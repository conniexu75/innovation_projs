https://openalex.org/W3120653349,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the global community in many ways. Combating the COVID-19 pandemic requires a coordinated effort through engaging public and service providers in preventive measures. The government of Ethiopia had already announced prevention guidelines for the public. However, there is a scarcity of evidence-based data on the public knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) and response of the service providers regarding COVID-19. Objective This study aimed to assess the public KAP and service providers’ preparedness towards the pandemic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from late March to the first week of April 2020. Participants were conveniently sampled from 10 different city sites. Data collection was performed using a self-administered questionnaire and observational assessment using a checklist. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version Descriptive statistics, correlation coefficient and chi-square tests were performed. Result A total of 839 public participants and 420 service providers enrolled in the study. The mean age was 30.30 (range = 18–72) years. The majority of the respondents (58.6%) had moderate knowledge about COVID-19, whereas 37.2% had good knowledge. Moreover, 60.7% and 59.8% of the participants had a positive attitude towards preventive measures and good practice to mitigate the pandemic, respectively. There was a moderate positive correlation between knowledge and attitude, whereas the correlations between knowledge and practice and attitude and practice were weak. With regard to service providers’ preparedness, 70% have made hand-washing facilities available. A large majority of the respondents (84.4%) were using government-owned media followed by social media (46.0%) as a main source of information. Conclusion The public in Addis Ababa had moderate knowledge, an optimistic attitude and descent practice. The information flow from government and social media seemed successful seeing the majority of the respondents identifying preventive measures, signs and symptoms and transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Knowledge and attitude was not associated with practice, thus, additional innovative strategies for practice changes are needed. Two thirds of the service provider made available hand washing facilities which seems a first positive step. However, periodic evaluation of the public KAP and assessment of service providers’ preparedness is mandatory to combat the pandemic effectively."
https://openalex.org/W3119784425,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an emergent disease that initially had no historical data to guide scientists on predicting/ forecasting its global or national impact over time. The ability to predict the progress of this pandemic has been crucial for decision making aimed at fighting this pandemic and controlling its spread. In this work we considered four different statistical/time series models that are readily available from the ‘forecast’ package in R. We performed novel applications with these models, forecasting the number of infected cases (confirmed cases and similarly the number of deaths and recovery) along with the corresponding 90% prediction interval to estimate uncertainty around pointwise forecasts. Since the future may not repeat the past for this pandemic, no prediction model is certain. However, any prediction tool with acceptable prediction performance (or prediction error) could still be very useful for public-health planning to handle spread of the pandemic, and could policy decision-making and facilitate transition to normality. These four models were applied to publicly available data of the COVID-19 pandemic for both the USA and Italy. We observed that all models reasonably predicted the future numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19. However, for the majority of the analyses, the time series model with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and cubic smoothing spline models both had smaller prediction errors and narrower prediction intervals, compared to the Holt and Trigonometric Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation (TBATS) models. Therefore, the former two models were preferable to the latter models. Given similarities in performance of the models in the USA and Italy, the corresponding prediction tools can be applied to other countries grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, and to any pandemics that can occur in future."
https://openalex.org/W3118845514,"Policymakers need clear, fast assessment of the real spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in each of their respective countries. Standard measures of the situation provided by the governments include reported positive cases and total deaths. While total deaths indicate immediately that countries like Italy and Spain had the worst situation as of mid-April, 2020, reported cases alone do not provide a complete picture of the situation. Different countries diagnose differently and present very distinctive reported case fatality ratios. Similar levels of reported incidence and mortality might hide a very different underlying pictures. Here we present a straightforward and robust estimation of the diagnostic rate in each European country. From that estimation we obtain a uniform, unbiased incidence of the epidemic. The method to obtain the diagnostic rate is transparent and empirical. The key assumption of the method is that the infection fatality ratio of COVID-19 in Europe is not strongly country-dependent. We show that this number is not expected to be biased due to demography nor to the way total deaths are reported. The estimation protocol is dynamic, and it has been yielding converging numbers for diagnostic rates in all European countries as from mid-April, 2020. Using this diagnostic rate, policy makers can obtain Effective Potential Growth updated every day, providing an unbiased assessment of the countries at greater risk of experiencing an uncontrolled situation. The method developed has been and will be used to track possible improvements in the diagnostic rate in European countries as the epidemic evolves."
https://openalex.org/W3048029138,"Fibrosis is driven by a misdirected cell response causing the overproduction of extracellular matrix and tissue dysfunction. Numerous pharmacological strategies have attempted to prevent fibrosis but have attained limited efficacy with some detrimental side effects. While stem cell treatments have provided more encouraging results, they have exhibited high variability and have not always improved tissue function. To enhance stem cell efficacy, we evaluated whether mechanical memory could direct cell response. We hypothesized that mechanically pre-conditioning on a soft matrix (soft priming) will delay adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) transition to a pro-fibrotic phenotype, expanding their regenerative potential, and improving healing in a complex tissue environment. Primary ASCs isolated from rat and human subcutaneous fat exhibited mechanical memory, demonstrated by a delayed cell response to stiffness following two weeks of soft priming including decreased cell area, actin coherency, and extracellular matrix production compared to cells on stiff substrates. Soft primed ASCs injected into our rat model of post-traumatic elbow contracture decreased histological evidence of anterior capsule fibrosis and increased elbow range-of-motion when evaluated by joint mechanics. These findings suggest that exploiting mechanical memory by strategically controlling the culture environment during cell expansion may improve the efficacy of stem cell-based therapies targeting fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3118442996,"Public health policies to contain the spread of COVID-19 rely mainly on non-pharmacological measures. Those measures, especially social distancing, are a challenge for developing countries, such as Brazil. In São Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil (45 million inhabitants), most COVID-19 cases up to April 18th were reported in the Capital and metropolitan area. However, the inner municipalities, where 20 million people live, are also at risk. As governmental authorities discuss the loosening of measures for restricting population mobility, it is urgent to analyze the routes of dispersion of COVID-19 in São Paulo territory. We hypothesize that urban hierarchy is the main responsible for the disease spreading, and we identify the hotspots and the main routes of virus movement from the metropolis to the inner state. In this ecological study, we use geographic models of population mobility to check for patterns for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identify two patterns based on surveillance data: one by contiguous diffusion from the capital metropolitan area, and the other hierarchical with long-distance spread through major highways that connects São Paulo city with cities of regional relevance. This knowledge can provide real-time responses to support public health strategies, optimizing the use of resources in order to minimize disease impact on population and economy."
https://openalex.org/W3120454439,"Forest bathing is an outdoor activity, and it might be a promising preventive treatment for social problems involving stress. A vast number of studies confirm the positive effects of this activity on people’s health. Nevertheless, little is known about the influence of winter forest bathing when conducted in an environment with snow cover on the ground and trees. Thus, a crossover experiment was designed in this study, with the participation of twenty-two healthy university students from Finland. During the experiment, a short exposition by a forest environment or landscape with buildings (as a control) was applied. Participants self-reported their psychological relaxation before and after the exposition, and the results were analyzed and compared. The mood, emotions, restorativeness, and subjective vitality were recorded as indices reflecting the psychological relaxation effect. The negative mood indices decreased significantly after exposition by the snow-covered environment, but the positive ‘vigor’ indices did not increase or decrease significantly. The level of negative emotions increased after the exposition with the control environment. Likewise, positive emotions decreased after the interaction with the control. Restorativeness was significantly increased after the exposition by the experimental forest but decreased after the viewing of the control buildings. The size of the effect in terms of restorativeness was the highest in this experiment. The subjective vitality was lowered as affected by the control, but it did not increase or decrease after the exposition with the experimental forest. There is probably an effect from the slight interruption in the process from the influence of the forest greens on participants because their vigor and vitality did not increase after the exposition with this environment in the study. However, snow might influence the participants as a calming and emotion-lowering component of the environment, but this idea needs to be further explored with the involvement of participants from other countries who would be viewing forest environments with snow cover and whose psychological relaxation could be measured."
https://openalex.org/W3118989618,"Gene-editing has raised the possibility of being able to treat or cure cancers, but key challenges remain, including efficient delivery, in vivo efficacy, and its safety profile. Ideal targets for cancer therapy are oncogenes, that when edited, cause cell death. Here, we show, using the human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 cancer cell line TC1, that CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the E7 oncogene and packaged in PEGylated liposomes cleared established tumours in immunocompetent mice. Treatment caused no significant toxicity in the spleen or liver. An ideal therapeutic outcome would be the induction of an immunogenic cell death (ICD), such that recurrent tumours would be eliminated by the host immune system. We show here for the first time that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cell death via targeting E7 did not result in ICD. Overall, our data show that in vivo CRISPR/Cas targeting of oncogenes is an effective treatment approach for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3118481307,"Unsupervised statistical analysis of unstructured data has gained wide acceptance especially in natural language processing and text mining domains. Topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation is one such statistical tool that has been successfully applied to synthesize collections of legal, biomedical documents and journalistic topics. We applied a novel two-stage topic modelling approach and illustrated the methodology with data from a collection of published abstracts from the University of Nairobi, Kenya. In the first stage, topic modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation was applied to derive the per-document topic probabilities. To more succinctly present the topics, in the second stage, hierarchical clustering with Hellinger distance was applied to derive the final clusters of topics. The analysis showed that dominant research themes in the university include: HIV and malaria research, research on agricultural and veterinary services as well as cross-cutting themes in humanities and social sciences. Further, the use of hierarchical clustering in the second stage reduces the discovered latent topics to clusters of homogeneous topics."
https://openalex.org/W3119390298,"The social-ecological effects of agricultural intensification are complex. We explore farmers’ perceptions about the impacts of their land management and the impact of social information flows on their management through a case study in a farming community in Navarra, Spain, that is undergoing agricultural intensification due to adoption of large scale irrigation. We found that modern technology adopters are aware that their management practices often have negative social-ecological implications; by contrast, more traditional farmers tend to recognize their positive impacts on non-material benefits such as those linked with traditions and traditional knowledge, and climate regulation. We found that farmers’ awareness about nature contributions to people co-production and their land management decisions determine, in part, the structure of the social networks among the farming community. Since modern farmers are at the core of the social network, they are better able to control the information flow within the community. This has important implications, such as the fact that the traditional farmers, who are more aware of their impacts on the environment, rely on information controlled by more intensive modern farmers, potentially jeopardizing sustainable practices in this region. We suggest that this might be counteracted by helping traditional farmers obtain information tailored to their practices from outside the social network."
https://openalex.org/W3120660140,"With the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence technology, computer-aided pulmonary nodule detection based on deep learning has achieved some successes. However, the sizes of pulmonary nodules vary greatly, and the pulmonary nodules have visual similarity with structures such as blood vessels and shadows around pulmonary nodules, which make the quick and accurate detection of pulmonary nodules in CT image still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose two kinds of 3D multi-scale deep convolution neural networks for nodule candidate detection and false positive reduction respectively. Among them, the nodule candidate detection network consists of two parts: 1) the backbone network part Res2SENet, which is used to extract multi-scale feature information of pulmonary nodules, it is composed of the multi-scale Res2Net modules of multiple available receptive fields at a granular level and the squeeze-and-excitation units; 2) the detection part, which uses a region proposal network structure to determine region candidates, and introduces context enhancement module and spatial attention module to improve detection performance. The false positive reduction network, also composed of the multi-scale Res2Net modules and the squeeze-and-excitation units, can further classify the nodule candidates generated by the nodule candidate detection network and screen out the ground truth positive nodules. Finally, the prediction probability generated by the nodule candidate detection network is weighted average with the prediction probability generated by the false positive reduction network to obtain the final results. The experimental results on the publicly available LUNA16 dataset showed that the proposed method has a superior ability to detect pulmonary nodules in CT images."
https://openalex.org/W3045900552,"Lycium barbarum berry (gouqi, Goji, goji berry, or wolfberry), a traditional medicine and functional food, has a wide range of biological effects, including immuno-modulation, anti-aging, antitumor, neuro-protection, and hepato-protection. However, thus far, little is known about the traditional effects of L. barbarum on strengthening muscles. Therefore, this study focused on the effects of an extract of L. barbarum on skeletal muscles. First, the extract of L. barbarum significantly increased the mass of the tibial anterior muscle and gastrocnemius muscle and improved the average running distance of mice. Then, in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that the extract enhanced muscle endurance by increasing the proportion of type IIa oxidative muscle fibers and aerobic respiration. In an in-depth study of the molecular mechanism of these effects, we found that the extract upregulated the proportion of type IIa oxidative muscle fibers by activating ERRγ and that the PKA-CREB signaling pathway was involved in its activation. This study is the first to show that L. barbarum extract modulates skeletal muscle remodeling and has mimetic effects on skeletal muscles in a manner similar to exercise. It provides a scientific explanation based on modern biological technologies and concepts for the traditional function of L. barbarum in improving muscle fitness. This study lays a theoretical foundation for the application of L. barbarum in skeletal muscles as an exercise mimetic."
https://openalex.org/W3120907929,"Characterizing the gut microbiota in terms of their capacity to interfere with drug metabolism is necessary to achieve drug efficacy and safety. Although examples of drug-microbiome interactions are well-documented, little has been reported about a computational pipeline for systematically identifying and characterizing bacterial enzymes that process particular classes of drugs. The goal of our study is to develop a computational approach that compiles drugs whose metabolism may be influenced by a particular class of microbial enzymes and that quantifies the variability in the collective level of those enzymes among individuals. The present paper describes this approach, with microbial β-glucuronidases as an example, which break down drug-glucuronide conjugates and reactivate the drugs or their metabolites. We identified 100 medications that may be metabolized by β-glucuronidases from the gut microbiome. These medications included morphine, estrogen, ibuprofen, midazolam, and their structural analogues. The analysis of metagenomic data available through the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) showed that the level of β-glucuronidase in the gut metagenomes was higher in males than in females, which provides a potential explanation for the sex-based differences in efficacy and toxicity for several drugs, reported in previous studies. Our analysis also showed that infant gut metagenomes at birth and 12 months of age have higher levels of β-glucuronidase than the metagenomes of their mothers and the implication of this observed variability was discussed in the context of breastfeeding as well as infant hyperbilirubinemia. Overall, despite important limitations discussed in this paper, our analysis provided useful insights on the role of the human gut metagenome in the variability in drug response among individuals. Importantly, this approach exploits drug and metagenome data available in public databases as well as open-source cheminformatics and bioinformatics tools to predict drug-metagenome interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3044813065,"Akt, a crucial protein involved in a variety of signaling pathways in cancer, acts as an important regulator of survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and provides curative option for the related drugs development. We have found an active phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid, (13aR,14R)-9,11,12,13,13a,14-hexahydro-3,6,7-trimethoxydibenzo[f,h]pyrrolo[1,2-b]isoquinolin-14-ol (HTBPI), is a promising Akt inhibitor effective in the suppression of HCC cells proliferation through stimulating apoptotic and autophagic capability in vivo and in vitro. Treatment of HTBPI combined with a classical autophagy-lysosomal inhibitor (bafilomycin A1), could enhance stimulation effects of apoptosis on HCC cell lines. In addition, we confirmed HTBPI targeting Akt, occupied the kinase binding domain (Thr 308) of Akt to inactivate its function by CETSA and DARTS assay. In contrast, ectopic Akt-induced overexpression significantly abrogated inhibitory effects of HTBPI on cell viability and proliferation. Furthermore, high p-Akt (Thr 308) expression is collated with liver tumor formation and poor survival in HCC patients. In conclusions, HTBPI impeded HCC progress through regulation of apoptosis and autophagy machinery via interaction with p-Akt (Thr 308). This may provide potential molecular candidate by targeting Akt for the therapy of HCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3118639735,"The virulence of Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile ) is mainly caused by its two toxins A and B. Their formation is significantly regulated by metabolic processes. Here we investigated the influence of various sugars (glucose, fructose, mannose, trehalose), sugar derivatives (mannitol and xylitol) and L-lactate on toxin synthesis. Fructose, mannose, trehalose, mannitol and xylitol in the growth medium resulted in an up to 2.2-fold increase of secreted toxin. Low glucose concentration of 2 g/L increased the toxin concentration 1.4-fold compared to growth without glucose, while high glucose concentrations in the growth medium (5 and 10 g/L) led to up to 6.6-fold decrease in toxin formation. Transcriptomic and metabolic investigation of the low glucose effect pointed towards an inactive CcpA and Rex regulatory system. L-lactate (500 mg/L) significantly reduced extracellular toxin formation. Transcriptome analyses of the later process revealed the induction of the lactose utilization operon encoding lactate racemase ( larA ), electron confurcating lactate dehydrogenase ( CDIF630erm_01321 ) and the corresponding electron transfer flavoprotein ( etfAB ). Metabolome analyses revealed L-lactate consumption and the formation of pyruvate. The involved electron confurcation process might be responsible for the also observed reduction of the NAD + /NADH ratio which in turn is apparently linked to reduced toxin release from the cell."
https://openalex.org/W3120672146,"Objective To examine the risk of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) due to osteoarthritis associated with obesity defined by body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference (WC) and whether there is discordance between these measures in assessing this risk. Methods 36,784 participants from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study with BMI and WC measured at 1990–1994 were included. Obesity was defined by BMI (≥30 kg/m 2 ) or WC (men ≥102cm, women ≥88cm). The incidence of TKA between January 2001 and December 2018 was determined by linking participant records to the National Joint Replacement Registry. Results Over 15.4±4.8 years, 2,683 participants underwent TKA. There were 20.4% participants with BMI-defined obesity, 20.8% with WC-defined obesity, and 73.6% without obesity defined by either BMI or WC. Obesity was classified as non-obese (misclassified obesity) in 11.7% of participants if BMI or WC alone was used to define obesity. BMI-defined obesity (HR 2.69, 95%CI 2.48–2.92), WC-defined obesity (HR 2.28, 95%CI 2.10–2.48), and obesity defined by either BMI or WC (HR 2.53, 95%CI 2.33–2.74) were associated with an increased risk of TKA. Compared with those without obesity, participants with misclassified obesity had an increased risk of TKA (HR 2.06, 95%CI 1.85–2.30). 22.7% of TKA in the community can be attributable to BMI-defined obesity, and a further 3.3% of TKA can be identified if WC was also used to define obesity. Conclusions Both BMI and WC should be used to identify obese individuals who are at risk of TKA for osteoarthritis and should be targeted for prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3118506738,"Galectin-1 (gal-1) is a carbohydrate-binding lectin with important functions in angiogenesis, immune response, hemostasis and inflammation. Comparable functions are exerted by platelet factor 4 (CXCL4), a chemokine stored in the α -granules of platelets. Previously, gal-1 was found to activate platelets through integrin α IIb β 3 . Both gal-1 and CXCL4 have high affinities for polysaccharides, and thus may mutually influence their functions. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible synergism of gal-1 and CXCL4 in platelet activation. Platelets were treated with increasing concentrations of gal-1, CXCL4 or both, and aggregation, integrin activation, P-selectin and phosphatidyl serine (PS) exposure were determined by light transmission aggregometry and by flow cytometry. To investigate the influence of cell surface sialic acid, platelets were treated with neuraminidase prior to stimulation. Gal-1 and CXCL4 were found to colocalize on the platelet surface. Stimulation with gal-1 led to integrin α IIb β 3 activation and to robust platelet aggregation, while CXCL4 weakly triggered aggregation and primarily induced P-selectin expression. Co-incubation of gal-1 and CXCL4 potentiated platelet aggregation compared with gal-1 alone. Whereas neither gal-1 and CXCL4 induced PS-exposure on platelets, prior removal of surface sialic acid strongly potentiated PS exposure. In addition, neuraminidase treatment increased the binding of gal-1 to platelets and lowered the activation threshold for gal-1. However, CXCL4 did not affect binding of gal-1 to platelets. Taken together, stimulation of platelets with gal-1 and CXCL4 led to distinct and complementary activation profiles, with additive rather than synergistic effects."
https://openalex.org/W3118916765,"The CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis mediates recruitment and extravasation of CX3CR1-expressing subsets of leukocytes and plays a pivotal role in the inflammation-driven pathology of cardiovascular disease. The cardiac immune response differs depending on the underlying causes. This suggests that for the development of successful immunomodulatory therapy in heart failure due to chronic pressure overload induced left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, the underlying immune patterns must be examined. Here, the authors demonstrate that Fraktalkine-receptor CX3CR1 is a prerequisite for the development of cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction in a mouse model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC). The comparison of C57BL/6 mice with CX3CR1 deficient mice displayed reduced LV hypertrophy and preserved cardiac function in response to pressure overload in mice lacking CX3CR1. Moreover, the normal immune response following TAC induced pressure overload which is dominated by Ly6C low macrophages changed to an early pro-inflammatory immune response driven by neutrophils, Ly6C high macrophages and altered cytokine expression pattern in CX3CR1 deficient mice. In this early inflammatory phase of LV hypertrophy Ly6C high monocytes infiltrated the heart in response to a C-C chemokine ligand 2 burst. CX3CR1 expression impacts the immune response in the development of LV hypertrophy and its absence has clear cardioprotective effects. Hence, suppression of CX3CR1 may be an important immunomodulatory therapeutic target to ameliorate pressure-overload induced heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W3119002388,"Background Digital devices and wearables allow for the measurement of a wide range of health-related parameters in a non-invasive manner, which may be particularly valuable in pediatrics. Incorporation of such parameters in clinical trials or care as digital endpoint could reduce the burden for children and their parents but requires clinical validation in the target population. This study aims to determine the tolerability, repeatability, and reference values of novel digital endpoints in healthy children. Methods Apparently healthy children (n = 175, 46% male) aged 2–16 were included. Subjects were monitored for 21 days using a home-monitoring platform with several devices (smartwatch, spirometer, thermometer, blood pressure monitor, scales). Endpoints were analyzed with a mixed effects model, assessing variables that explained within- and between-subject variability. Endpoints based on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep-related parameters were included in the analysis. For physical-activity-related endpoints, a sample size needed to detect a 15% increase was calculated. Findings Median compliance was 94%. Variability in each physical activity-related candidate endpoint was explained by age, sex, watch wear time, rain duration per day, average ambient temperature, and population density of the city of residence. Estimated sample sizes for candidate endpoints ranged from 33–110 per group. Daytime heart rate, nocturnal heart rate and sleep duration decreased as a function of age and were comparable to reference values published in the literature. Conclusions Wearable- and portable devices are tolerable for pediatric subjects. The raw data, models and reference values presented here can be used to guide further validation and, in the future, clinical trial designs involving the included measures."
https://openalex.org/W3044012614,"The clinically successful adjuvant MF59 is used in seasonal influenza vaccines, which is proposed to enhance immunity by creating an immune-competent microenvironment in the muscle that allows recruitment of immune cells that drive adaptive immune responses. Here, we examined whether the clinically successful adjuvants MF59/AddaVax could be used for subcutaneous use and how antigen delivery can be synergized with cellular dynamics at the vaccination site. Subcutaneous injection of AddaVax leads to thickening of the skin, characterized by a neutrophil-monocyte recruitment sequence. Skin-infiltrating CCR2+Ly6Chigh monocytes showed differentiation to CD11b+Ly6C+MHCII+CD11c+CD64+ monocyte-derived DCs over time in the hypodermal layers of the skin, expressing high levels of CD209a/mDC-SIGN. Surprisingly, skin thickening was accompanied with increased white adipose tissue highly enriched with monocytes. Analysis of the skin-draining lymph nodes revealed early increases in neutrophils and moDCs at 12 hours after injection and later increases in migratory cDC2s. Subcutaneous vaccination with AddaVax enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses, while moDC targeting using antigen-coupled CD209a antibody additionally boosted humoral responses. Hence, oil-in-water emulsions provide an attractive immune modulatory adjuvants aimed at increasing cellular responses, as well as antibody responses when combined with moDC targeting."
https://openalex.org/W3095222604,"The human genome contains vast genetic diversity as naturally occurring coding variants, yet the impact of these variants on protein function and physiology is poorly understood. RGS14 is a multifunctional signaling protein that suppresses synaptic plasticity in dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons. RGS14 also is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, suggesting that balanced nuclear import/export and dendritic spine localization are essential for RGS14 functions. We identified genetic variants L505R (LR) and R507Q (RQ) located within the nuclear export sequence (NES) of human RGS14. Here we report that RGS14 encoding LR or RQ profoundly impacts protein functions in hippocampal neurons. RGS14 membrane localization is regulated by binding Gαi-GDP, whereas RGS14 nuclear export is regulated by Exportin 1 (XPO1). Remarkably, LR and RQ variants disrupt RGS14 binding to Gαi1-GDP and XPO1, nucleocytoplasmic equilibrium, and capacity to inhibit long-term potentiation (LTP). Variant LR accumulates irreversibly in the nucleus, preventing RGS14 binding to Gαi1, localization to dendritic spines, and inhibitory actions on LTP induction, while variant RQ exhibits a mixed phenotype. When introduced into mice by CRISPR/Cas9, RGS14-LR protein expression was detected predominantly in the nuclei of neurons within hippocampus, central amygdala, piriform cortex, and striatum, brain regions associated with learning and synaptic plasticity. Whereas mice completely lacking RGS14 exhibit enhanced spatial learning, mice carrying variant LR exhibit normal spatial learning, suggesting that RGS14 may have distinct functions in the nucleus independent from those in dendrites and spines. These findings show that naturally occurring genetic variants can profoundly alter normal protein function, impacting physiology in unexpected ways."
https://openalex.org/W3095613676,"BC200 is a noncoding RNA elevated in a broad spectrum of tumor cells that is critical for cell viability, invasion, and migration. Overexpression studies have implicated BC200 and the rodent analog BC1 as negative regulators of translation in both cell-based and in vitro translation assays. Although these studies are consistent, they have not been confirmed in knockdown studies and direct evidence for this function is lacking. Herein, we have demonstrated that BC200 knockdown is correlated with a decrease in global translation rates. As this conflicts with the hypothesis that BC200 is a translational suppressor, we overexpressed BC200 by transfection of in vitro transcribed RNA and transient expression from transfected plasmids. In this context BC200 suppressed translation; however, an innate immune response confounded the data. To overcome this, breast cancer cells stably overexpressing BC200 and various control RNAs were developed by selection for genomic incorporation of a plasmid coexpressing BC200 and the neomycin resistance gene. Stable overexpression of BC200 was associated with elevated translation levels in pooled stable cell lines and isolated single-cell clones. Cross-linking sucrose density gradient centrifugation demonstrated an association of BC200 and its reported binding partners SRP9/14, CSDE1, DHX36, and PABPC1 with both ribosomal subunits and polysomal RNA, an association not previously observed owing to the labile nature of the interactions. In summary, these data present a novel understanding of BC200 function as well as optimized methodology that has far reaching implications in the study of noncoding RNAs, particularly within the context of translational regulatory mechanisms.

The prevalence of cellular Alu RNA is primarily due to insertions within the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions and introns of mRNAs. In addition to transcription as part of RNA polymerase II transcribed mRNAs, Alu elements are themselves transcribed via recruitment of RNA polymerase III to internal promoter sequences of the Alu repeat itself (4Chen L.L. Yang L. ALUternative regulation for gene expression.Trends Cell Biology. 2017; 27: 480-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The pervasiveness and sequence similarity between various Alu elements add a considerable research challenge to the study of these expressed SINEs (1Deininger P. Alu elements: know the SINEs.Genome Biol. 2011; 12: 236Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, expressed Alu elements have been reported to influence diverse cellular processes such as gene transcription, RNA splicing, RNA localization, and RNA editing (1Deininger P.

BC200 (Brain cytoplasmic RNA 1, BCYRN1) is a 200-nt anthropoid primate-specific monomeric Alu RNA that is abundantly expressed in the brain (6Tiedge H. Chen W. Brosius J.

In a similar manner to its rodent counterpart BC1, BC200 is postulated to regulate localized translation in neuronal dendrites (10Wang H. Iacoangeli A. Popp S. Muslimov I.A. Imataka H. Sonenberg N.

BC1 RNA, the transcript from a master gene for ID element amplification, is able to prime its own reverse transcription.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). BC1 exhibits a highly similar expression profile to BC200 and is thought to fulfill an analogous function despite being unique in sequence and origin (13DeChiara T.M. Brosius J.

In prosimian primates, a dimeric Alu insertion is found at the identical location on chromosome 2 as BC200 (15Ludwig A. Rozhdestvensky T.S. Kuryshev V.Y. Schmitz J. Brosius J. An unusual primate locus that attracted two independent Alu insertions and facilitates their transcription.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This RNA has been termed G22 and is a 335-nt RNA that displays a similar expression pattern as BC200, suggesting a functional overlap between these RNAs in distinct species (15Ludwig A. Rozhdestvensky T.S. Kuryshev V.Y. Schmitz J. Brosius J. An unusual primate locus that attracted two independent Alu insertions and facilitates their transcription.J. Mol.

Although BC200, BC1, and G22 RNAs are derived from SINE retrotransposons and exhibit nearly identical expression patterns, they diverge in sequence considerably. BC200 comprises a 5′ left Alu-J monomer (nucleotides 1–120) followed by a central 40-nt adenosine-rich stretch and a 3′ region that contains 25 nt of unique sequence as well as a consecutive run of 12 cytosines prior to the transcriptional termination sequence (6Tiedge H.

BC1 exhibits little sequence similarity to BC200 with the exception of an adenosine-rich stretch that spans approximately 50 nucleotides (13DeChiara T.M. Brosius J.

G22 on the other hand is a dimeric Alu that has only a short 9-nt stretch of adenosines prior to a unique and C-rich 3′ end that bears similarity to BC200 (16Khanam T. Rozhdestvensky T.S. Bundman M.

Reinforcing a probable common function with BC200, the G22 RNA shares a number of key protein binding partners with BC200 including SRP9/14 and PABPC1 (16Khanam T. Rozhdestvensky T.S. Bundman M.

Although Alu RNAs can enhance translation, their role is still unclear. Alu RNA in complex with SRP9/14 has been shown to inhibit translation by in vitro translation assays, whereas supplementation of Alu RNA alone stimulated translation (33Häsler J. Strub K. Alu RNP and Alu RNA regulate translation initiation in vitro.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2374-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Alu RNAs inhibit the activity of EIF2AK2 (PKR) under cell stress, providing a possible mechanism by which they may act to increase translation rates in this context (41Chu W.M. Ballard R. Carpick B.W. Williams B.R. Schmid C.W. Potential Alu function: regulation of the activity of double-stranded RNA-activated kinase PKR.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In previous studies, Alu RNA did not show an association with either free ribosomal subunits, monosomes (a single intact ribosome), or polysomes (actively translating ribosomes on a single mRNA) in sucrose density gradients and were proposed to act at the initiation stage of translation and not affect elongation rates (33Häsler J. Strub K. Alu RNP and Alu RNA regulate translation initiation in vitro.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2374-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, both BC200 and other transcribed Alu RNAs have been shown to exist as an ∼11S ribonucleoprotein particle, which sediments considerably slower than the small 40S ribosomal subunit (33Häsler J.

In the present study we observed a significant reduction in global translation rates upon BC200 knockdown using locked nucleic acid (LNA) GapmeRs in a panel of tumor cell lines. MCF-7 cells were selected for further study as they exhibit elevated BC200 expression, rely on BC200 for cell viability, and have been used to assess the protein components of the BC200 RNP (7Booy E.P.

Dual nature of translational control by regulatory BC RNAs.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 4538-4549Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although we were able to replicate these results in-cell by transfection of in vitro transcribed BC200, a scrambled control RNA produced a more robust effect. Transfection of all in vitro transcribed RNAs tested induced an innate immune response as was detected by induction of RIG-I expression. To avoid the innate immune response elicited by RNA transfection, we overexpressed BC200 from a transiently transfected plasmid; however, control transfections significantly impacted cellular translation rates for as long as 96 h post transfection. To avoid these pitfalls, cells stably expressing BC200 were generated that demonstrated a significant increase in global translation rates in response to elevated BC200. We observed a positive correlation between expression of BC200 and relative translation rates in isolated single-cell clones. Initial sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiments were in agreement with the literature and indicated that BC200 did not comigrate with ribosomal subunits or polysomal RNA; however, in these experiments we also observed a complete separation of BC200 from some of its previously reported binding partners. To investigate this discrepancy, we optimized a cross-linking sucrose density gradient centrifugation protocol that demonstrated comigration of BC200 with published protein binding partners as well as association with polysomal RNA. This study for the first time presents evidence that BC200 is in fact a translational activator and likely exerts its function through interactions with actively translating mRNAs. We have recently reported the interaction of BC200 with a number of protein binding partners that supports the proposed function of BC200 as a regulator of mRNA translation (34Booy E.P. McRae E.K.

Alu RNP and Alu RNA regulate translation initiation in vitro.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2374-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we sought to assess the impact of BC200 knockdown on mRNA translation rates. Knockdown of BC200 in MCF-7 cells with an LNA GapmeR resulted in a significant reduction in translation rates within 12 h as measured by puromycin incorporation (Fig. 1A). Puromycin is an aminonucleoside antibiotic that is incorporated into actively translating peptides causing chain termination, a process that can be monitored using monoclonal antibodies that exhibit high specificity for puromycin (45Schmidt E.K. Clavarino G. Ceppi M. Pierre P. SUnSET, a nonradioactive method to monitor protein synthesis.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). The reduction in translation was concurrent with efficient reduction in BC200 expression (Fig. 1, A–C). Translation rates remained suppressed through 48 h as compared with cells transfected with a nontargeting control GapmeR. A second commonly used method to monitor translation rates is polysome profiling. Polysome profiling involves separation of cellular components by density gradient centrifugation allowing for separation of 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits from intact ribosomes (monosomes, 80S) and mRNAs that are being actively translated by multiple ribosomes simultaneously (polysomes). Each subpopulation is clearly identified as well-differentiated peaks in the absorbance trace at 260 nm and the relative quantity of polysomes is considered indicative of global translation rate (46Pringle E.S.

https://openalex.org/W3120027527,"Neutrophilic inflammation results in loss of lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Gram-negative bacteria, such as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), trigger acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) and contribute to chronic lung inflammation. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17C (IL-17C) is expressed by airway epithelial cells and regulates neutrophilic chemotaxis. Here, we explored the function of IL-17C in NTHi- and cigarette smoke (CS)-induced models of COPD. Neutrophilic inflammation and tissue destruction were decreased in lungs of IL-17C-deficient mice ( Il-17c -/- ) chronically exposed to NTHi. Numbers of pulmonary neutrophils were decreased in Il-17c -/- mice after acute exposure to the combination of NTHi and CS. However, Il-17c -/- mice were not protected from CS-induced lung inflammation. In a preliminary patient study, we show that IL-17C is present in sputum samples obtained during AECOPD and associates with disease severity. Concentrations of IL-17C were significantly increased during advanced COPD (GOLD III/IV) compared to moderate COPD (GOLD I/II). Concentrations of IL-17A and IL-17E did not associate with disease severity. Our data suggest that IL-17C promotes harmful pulmonary inflammation triggered by bacteria in COPD."
https://openalex.org/W3120478017,"To tackle China’s rapidly aging population, a policy was framed by using overlapping generations (OLG) model and computable general equilibrium (CGE) model; the main objective was to successfully implement “second-child policy” and “delayed retirement age” for female or male workers. The 2012 census data was obtained from National Bureau of Statistics of China. Our research findings suggest that the economy can be improved in the short-term by delaying retirement age; however, Chinese economy would improve tremendously in the long run by implementing second-child policy. Compared to delayed retirement age, second-child policy would be more effective in improving the economy in China. In terms of industrial output, the three policies have a greater influence on labor-intensive industries, such as agriculture, light industry, finance, and service sector; the impact is less significant on construction and heavy industry. In terms of industrial import and export, these three policies have greatly influenced following industries: finance, electric power, and fossil energy. From a monetary perspective, these three policies can significantly improve household income; these three policies did not significantly impact both government and corporate incomes."
https://openalex.org/W3044828854,"Embryos are growing organisms with highly heterogeneous properties in space and time. Understanding the mechanical properties is a crucial prerequisite for the investigation of morphogenesis. During the last 10 years, new techniques have been developed to evaluate the mechanical properties of biological tissues in vivo. To address this need, we employed a new instrument that, via the combination of micro-indentation with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), allows us to determine both, the spatial distribution of mechanical properties of chick embryos, and the structural changes in real-time. We report here the stiffness measurements on the live chicken embryo, from the mesenchymal tailbud to the epithelialized somites. The storage modulus of the mesoderm increases from (176 ± 18) Pa in the tail to (716 ± 117) Pa in the somitic region (mean ± SEM, n = 12). The midline has a mean storage modulus of (947 ± 111) Pa in the caudal (PSM) presomitic mesoderm (mean ± SEM, n = 12), indicating a stiff rod along the body axis, which thereby mechanically supports the surrounding tissue. The difference in stiffness between midline and presomitic mesoderm decreases as the mesoderm forms somites. This study provides an efficient method for the biomechanical characterization of soft biological tissues in vivo and shows that the mechanical properties strongly relate to different morphological features of the investigated regions."
https://openalex.org/W3118318105,"Spotting is thought to increase wildfire rate of spread (ROS) and in some cases become the main mechanism for spread. The role of spotting in wildfire spread is controlled by many factors including fire intensity, number of and distance between spot fires, weather, fuel characteristics and topography. Through a set of 30 laboratory fire experiments on a 3 m x 4 m fuel bed, subject to air flow, we explored the influence of manually ignited spot fires (0, 1 or 2), the presence or absence of a model hill and their interaction on combined fire ROS (i.e. ROS incorporating main fire and merged spot fires). During experiments conducted on a flat fuel bed, spot fires (whether 1 or 2) had only a small influence on combined ROS. Slowest combined ROS was recorded when a hill was present and no spot fires were ignited, because the fires crept very slowly downslope and downwind of the hill. This was up to, depending on measurement interval, 5 times slower than ROS in the flat fuel bed experiments. However, ignition of 1 or 2 spot fires (with hill present) greatly increased combined ROS to similar levels as those recorded in the flat fuel bed experiments (depending on spread interval). The effect was strongest on the head fire, where spot fires merged directly with the main fire, but significant increases in off-centre ROS were also detected. Our findings suggest that under certain topographic conditions, spot fires can allow a fire to overcome the low spread potential of downslopes. Current models may underestimate wildfire ROS and fire arrival time in hilly terrain if the influence of spot fires on ROS is not incorporated into predictions."
https://openalex.org/W3118728879,"Introduction The aim of this study was to identify movement synergies during normal-walking that can differentiate healthy adults in terms of gait adaptability at various speeds. To this end, the association between movement synergies and lower-limb coordination variability or Deviation Phase (DP) was investigated. This study also investigated the moderating effect of movement synergies on the relationship between DP and the smoothness of arm-swing motion (NJI). Method A principal component analysis of whole-body marker trajectories from normal-walking treadmill trials at 0.8m/s, 1.2m/s and 1.6m/s was undertaken. Both DP and NJI were derived from approx. 8 minutes of perturbed-walking treadmill trials. Principal movement components, PM k , were derived and the RMS of the 2 nd -order differentiation of these PM k (PA k RMS) were included as independent variables representing the magnitude of neuromuscular control in each PM k . Each PA k RMS were input into maximal linear mixed-effects models against DP and (DP x NJI) respectively. A stepwise elimination of terms and comparison of models using Anova identified optimal models for both aims. Results The principal movement related to the push-off mechanism of gait (PA 4 RMS) was identified as an optimal model and demonstrated a significant negative effect on DP however this effect may differ considerably across walking-speeds. An optimal model for describing the variance in (DP x NJI) included a fixed-effect of PA 6 RMS representing Right—Left side weight transfer was identified. Interpretation The hypotheses that individuals who exhibited greater control on specific kinematic synergies would exhibit variations during perturbed walking was substantiated. Supporting evidence for the role of movement synergies during the double-support phase of gait in proactively correcting balance was presented as well as the potential for this approach in targeted rehabilitation. The potential influence of leg dominance on gait adaptability was also discussed. Future studies should investigate further the role of walking-speed and leg dominance on movement synergies and look to generalize these findings to patient populations."
https://openalex.org/W3119621549,"Facial expressions are complex and subtle signals, central for communication and emotion in social mammals. Traditionally, facial expressions have been classified as a whole, disregarding small but relevant differences in displays. Even with the same morphological configuration different information can be conveyed depending on the species. Due to a hardwired processing of faces in the human brain, humans are quick to attribute emotion, but have difficulty in registering facial movement units. The well-known human FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is the gold standard for objectively measuring facial expressions, and can be adapted through anatomical investigation and functional homologies for cross-species systematic comparisons. Here we aimed at developing a FACS for Japanese macaques, following established FACS methodology: first, we considered the species’ muscular facial plan; second, we ascertained functional homologies with other primate species; and finally, we categorised each independent facial movement into Action Units (AUs). Due to similarities in the rhesus and Japanese macaques’ facial musculature, the MaqFACS (previously developed for rhesus macaques) was used as a basis to extend the FACS tool to Japanese macaques, while highlighting the morphological and appearance changes differences between the two species. We documented 19 AUs, 15 Action Descriptors (ADs) and 3 Ear Action Units (EAUs) in Japanese macaques, with all movements of MaqFACS found in Japanese macaques. New movements were also observed, indicating a slightly larger repertoire than in rhesus or Barbary macaques. Our work reported here of the MaqFACS extension for Japanese macaques, when used together with the MaqFACS, comprises a valuable objective tool for the systematic and standardised analysis of facial expressions in Japanese macaques. The MaqFACS extension for Japanese macaques will now allow the investigation of the evolution of communication and emotion in primates, as well as contribute to improving the welfare of individuals, particularly in captivity and laboratory settings."
https://openalex.org/W3119979619,"A new algorithmic approach to personality prototyping based on Big Five traits was applied to a large representative and longitudinal German dataset (N = 22,820) including behavior, personality and health correlates. We applied three different clustering techniques, latent profile analysis, the k-means method and spectral clustering algorithms. The resulting cluster centers, i.e. the personality prototypes, were evaluated using a large number of internal and external validity criteria including health, locus of control, self-esteem, impulsivity, risk-taking and wellbeing. The best-fitting prototypical personality profiles were labeled according to their Euclidean distances to averaged personality type profiles identified in a review of previous studies on personality types. This procedure yielded a five-cluster solution: resilient, overcontroller, undercontroller, reserved and vulnerable-resilient. Reliability and construct validity could be confirmed. We discuss wether personality types could comprise a bridge between personality and clinical psychology as well as between developmental psychology and resilience research."
https://openalex.org/W3120417244,"Large-scale data sources, remote sensing technologies, and superior computing power have tremendously benefitted to environmental health study. Recently, various machine-learning algorithms were introduced to provide mechanistic insights about the heterogeneity of clustered data pertaining to the symptoms of each asthma patient and potential environmental risk factors. However, there is limited information on the performance of these machine learning tools. In this study, we compared the performance of ten machine-learning techniques. Using an advanced method of imbalanced sampling (IS), we improved the performance of nine conventional machine learning techniques predicting the association between exposure level to indoor air quality and change in patients’ peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). We then proposed a deep learning method of transfer learning (TL) for further improvement in prediction accuracy. Our selected final prediction techniques (TL1_IS or TL2-IS) achieved a balanced accuracy median (interquartile range) of 66(56~76) % for TL1_IS and 68(63~78) % for TL2_IS. Precision levels for TL1_IS and TL2_IS were 68(62~72) % and 66(62~69) % while sensitivity levels were 58(50~67) % and 59(51~80) % from 25 patients which were approximately 1.08 (accuracy, precision) to 1.28 (sensitivity) times increased in terms of performance outcomes, compared to NN_IS. Our results indicate that the transfer machine learning technique with imbalanced sampling is a powerful tool to predict the change in PEFR due to exposure to indoor air including the concentration of particulate matter of 2.5 μm and carbon dioxide. This modeling technique is even applicable with small-sized or imbalanced dataset, which represents a personalized, real-world setting."
https://openalex.org/W3118751311,"Objectives To assess the feasibility of quantitative analysis of dynamic computed tomography angiography (dCTA) for the detection of endoleaks in patients who underwent endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR). Material and methods Twenty patients scheduled for contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA) of the abdominal aorta post-EVAR were prospectively enrolled. All patients received a standard triphasic CTA protocol, followed by an additional dCTA. The dCTA acquisition enabled reconstruction of color-coded maps depicting blood perfusion and a dCTA dataset of the aneurysm sac. Observers assessed the dCTA and dynamic CT perfusion (dCTP) images for the detection of endoleaks, establishing diagnostic confidence based on a modified 5-point Likert scale. An index was calculated for the ratio between the endoleak and aneurysm sac using blood flow for dCTP and Hounsfield units (HU) for dCTA. The Wilcoxon test compared the endoleak index and the diagnostic confidence of the observers. Results In total, 19 patients (18 males, median age 74 years [70.5–75.7]) were included for analysis. Nine endoleaks were detected in 7 patients using triphasic CTA as the reference standard. There was complete agreement for endoleak detection between the two techniques on a per-patient basis. Both dCTA and dCTP identified an additional endoleak in one patient. The diagnostic confidence using dCTP for detection of endoleaks was not significantly superior to dCTA (5.0 [5–5] vs. 4.5 [4–5], respectively; p = 0.11); however, dCTP demonstrated superior diagnostic confidence for endoleak exclusion compared to dCTA (1.0 [1–1] vs 1.5 [1.5–1.5], respectively; p &lt;0.01). Moreover, the dCTP endoleak index was significantly higher than the dCTA index (18.5 [10.8–20.5] vs. 3.5 [5–2.7], respectively; p = 0.02). Conclusions Quantitative analysis of dCTP imaging can aid in the detection of endoleaks and demonstrates a higher endoleak detection rate than triphasic CTA, as well as a strong correlation with visual assessment of dCTA images."
https://openalex.org/W3118575598,"Liver stiffness is a reliable non-invasive predictor of Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HVPG) above 10 mm Hg. However, it failed to predict higher thresholds of HVPG. Our aim was to investigate whether liver stiffness and selected previously published non-invasive blood biomarkers could predict higher HVPG thresholds in liver transplant candidates without ongoing alcohol use. One hundred and nine liver transplant candidates with liver cirrhosis of various aetiologies underwent direct HVPG measurement, liver stiffness measurement by 2D shear-wave elastography (Aixplorer Multiwave, Supersonic Imagine, France) and assessment of blood HVPG biomarkers (osteopontin, VCAM-1, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1ra/IL-1F3 and ELF score). The correlation between liver stiffness and HVPG was linear up to 30 mm Hg of HVPG (r = 0.765, p &lt; 0.0001). The regression lines had similar slopes for HVPG values below and above 16 mm Hg (p &gt; 0.05) and the correlation in patients with HVPG &lt;16 mm Hg (r = 0.456, p = 0.01) was similar to patients with HVPG ≥ 16 mm Hg (r = 0.499, p &lt; 0.0001). The correlation was similar in the subgroup patients with alcoholic (r = 0.718, p &lt; 0.0001), NASH (r = 0.740, p = 0.008), cryptogenic (r = 0.648, p = 0,0377), cholestatic and autoimmune (r = 0.706, p &lt; 0.0001) and viral cirrhosis (r = 0.756, p &lt; 0.0001). Liver stiffness distinguished patients with HVPG above 16, and 20 mm Hg with AUROCs 0.90243, and 0.86824, sensitivity 0.7656, and 0.7027, and specificity 0.9333, and 0.8750. All studied blood biomarkers correlated better with liver stiffness than with HVPG and their AUROCs did not exceed 0.8 at both HVPG thresholds. Therefore, a composite predictor superior to liver stiffness could not be established. We conclude that liver stiffness is a clinically reliable predictor of higher HVPG thresholds in non-drinking subjects with advanced liver cirrhosis."

Methods All PD patients awaiting Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) answered the TCI before neurosurgery. Their results were compared to those of historical cohorts (a French normative population, a de novo PD population, and a PD population with motor fluctuations). Results Most personality dimensions of our 333 included PD patients with motor fluctuations who are candidates for DBS were different from those of the normative population and some were also different from those of the De Novo PD population, whereas they were similar to those of another population of PD patients with motor fluctuations. Conclusions During the course of PD, personality dimensions can change in parallel with the development of motor fluctuations, either due to the evolution of the disease and/or dopaminergic treatments."

We aimed to describe the characteristics, focusing on histopathology, of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients who did and did not respond to nintedanib. Methods This study retrospectively examined the clinicoradiopathologic features of 40 consecutive patients with surgical lung biopsy-confirmed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated with nintedanib. Additionally, we compared the histopathologic scoring of 21 microscopic features between patients with functional or radiological progression and those with non-progression during 12 months of treatment. Results The histopathologic evaluation showed edematous changes in the interlobular septum as the only histologic finding observed more frequently in patients with both functional and radiological progression than in those without (58% vs. 14%, P = 0.007 and 50% vs. 0%, P = 0.003, respectively). Regarding per-year change, patients with edematous changes in the interlobular septum showed greater progression in median changes in spared area (-12%, interquartile range: [-25%–-5%], vs. -3% [-7%–0%], P = 0.004) and reticular shadow (7% [3%–13%], vs. 0% [0%–5%], P = 0.041) on computed tomography. Functional and radiological progression-free survival were shorter in patients with edematous changes in the interlobular septum than in those without (6.6 months, 95% confidence interval: [5.9–25.3], vs. event &lt;50%, [12.1–Not available], P = 0.0009, and 6.1 months, [5.2–6.6] vs. 14.5 months [7.8–not available], P&lt;0.0001).

Building on our preliminary study reporting successful brain self-regulation using slow cortical potential (SCP) neurofeedback in offenders with psychopathy, we investigated the central nervous and autonomic peripheral changes occurring after brain self-regulation in a group of severe male offenders with psychopathy. Regarding the central nervous system, an overall suppression of the psychopathic overrepresentation of slow frequency bands was found, such as delta and theta band activity, after EEG neurofeedback. In addition, an increase in alpha band activity could be observed after the SCP self-regulation training. Electrodermal activity adaptively changed according to the regulation task, and this flexibility improved over training time. The results of this study point towards a constructive learning process and plasticity in neural and peripheral measures of offenders with psychopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3119568287,"Fostering students’ classroom engagement is a research hotspot in classroom teaching management. Enhancing classroom engagement requires consideration of the interactive effects of physical and interpersonal environments. Considering the characteristics of physical space, the teacher gives feedback on student engagement in terms of different seating positions. Further, near-seated peer group engagement has an impact, though previous research has found this to be inconsistent. The teacher and near-seated peer groups have different paths of influence on classroom engagement, and there is interplay between them. However, based on realistic classroom scenarios, it is difficult for traditional research methods to reveal how spatially heterogeneous and non-linear micro-interactions among teachers, students, and near-seated peer groups evolve into dynamic changes in macro-classroom engagement. Hence, this study utilized agent-based simulation to explore the non-linear dynamic mechanism underlying how teacher-student proximity, teacher feedback, and near-seated peer groups affect classroom engagement, thereby shedding light on the evolutionary features of classroom engagement. According to the results, the teacher’s positive feedback promoted an S-shaped increase in classroom engagement, and the closer a student sat to the teacher, the greater the increase was. The level and homogeneity of near-seated peer group engagement were predictors of changes in classroom engagement. Moreover, the proximity of students to the teacher, teacher feedback, and near-seated peer groups had a joint effect on student engagement. The compensation effect of the teacher’s positive feedback on the impact of low-engagement, near-seated peer groups was weaker than that of highly engaged, near-seated peer groups on the effects of the teacher’s negative feedback. This suggests that the model of teacher-student proximity and teacher feedback effects differed from that of near-seated peer group influence, and the two interacted and showed asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W3119644888,"In this age of rapid biodiversity loss, we must continue to refine our approaches to describing variation in life on Earth. Combining knowledge and research tools from multiple disciplines is one way to better describe complex natural systems. Understanding plant community diversity requires documenting both pattern and process. We must first know which species exist, and where (i.e., taxonomic and biogeographic patterns), before we can determine why they exist there (i.e., ecological and evolutionary processes). Floristic botanists often use collections-based approaches to elucidate biodiversity patterns, while plant ecologists use hypothesis-driven statistical approaches to describe underlying processes. Because of these different disciplinary histories and research goals, floristic botanists and plant ecologists often remain siloed in their work. Here, using a case study from an urban greenway in Colorado, USA, we illustrate that the collections-based, opportunistic sampling of floristic botanists is highly complementary to the transect- or plot-based sampling of plant ecologists. We found that floristic sampling captured a community species pool four times larger than that captured using ecological transects, with rarefaction and non-parametric species estimation indicating that it would be prohibitive to capture the “true” community species pool if constrained to sampling within transects. We further illustrate that the discrepancy in species pool size between approaches led to a different interpretation of the greenway’s ecological condition in some cases (e.g., transects missed uncommon cultivated species escaping from nearby gardens) but not others (e.g., plant species distributions among functional groups were similar between species pools). Finally, we show that while using transects to estimate plant relative abundances necessarily trades off with a fuller assessment of the species pool, it is an indispensable indicator of ecosystem health, as evidenced by three non-native grasses contributing to 50% of plant cover along the highly modified urban greenway. We suggest that actively fostering collaborations between floristic botanists and ecologists can create new insights into the maintenance of species diversity at the community scale."

However, priorities for health research in low-and-middle income countries are set almost exclusively by external parties and priorities, while end-users remain ""researched on"" not ""researched with"". This paper presents the first stage of a Community-Based Participatory Research-inspired project to engage communities and public-health end-users in setting a research agenda to improve health in their community. Methods Photovoice was used in Kuc, Gulu District, Uganda to engage community members in the selection of a research topic for future public health research and intervention. Alcohol-Use Disorders emerged from this process the health issue that most negatively impacts the community. Following identification of this issue, a cross-sectional survey was conducted using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (n = 327) to triangulate Photovoice findings and to estimate the prevalence of Alcohol-Use Disorders in Kuc. Logistic regression was used to test for associations with demographic characteristics and Alcohol-Use Disorders. Results Photovoice generated four prominent themes, including alcohol related issues, sanitation and compound cleanliness, water quality and access, and infrastructure. Alcohol-Use Disorders were identified by the community as the most important driver of poor health. Survey results indicated that 23.55% of adults in Kuc had a probable Alcohol Use Disorder, 16.45 percentage points higher than World Health Organization estimates for Uganda. Conclusions Community members engaged in the participatory, bottom-up approach offered by the research team to develop a research agenda to improve health in the community. Participants honed in on the under-researched and underfunded topic of Alcohol-Use Disorders. The findings from Photovoice were validated by survey results, thereby solidifying the high prevalence of Alcohol-Use Disorders as the health outcome that will be targeted through future long-term research and partnership."

The Wonder Gecko, Teratoscincus keyserlingii , is one of nine members of the genus. This species is distributed in Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, with a small isolated population in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where it is classified nationally as Critically Endangered. Within its Arabian range, anthropogenic activity is directly linked to the species’ decline, with highly localised and severely fragmented populations. Here we describe the evolutionary history of Teratoscincus , by reconstructing its phylogenetic relationships and estimating its divergence times and ancestral biogeography. For conservation implications of T . keyserlingii we evaluate the genetic structure of the Arabian population using genomic data. This study supports the monophyly of most species and reveals considerable intraspecific variability in T . microlepis and T . keyserlingii , which necessitate broad systematic revisions. The UAE population of T . keyserlingii likely arrived from southern Iran during the Pleistocene and no internal structure was recovered within, implying a single population status. Regional conservation of T . keyserlingii requires improved land management and natural habitat restoration in the species’ present distribution, and expansion of current protected areas, or establishment of new areas with suitable habitat for the species, mostly in northern Abu Dhabi Emirate."

First, a field-goal shooting performance analysis template was developed that included 71 Action Variables (AV) grouped within 22 Categorical Predictor Variables (CPV) representing offensive, defensive and game context variables. Second, footage of all 5,105 field-goal attempts from 12 teams during the men’s 2016 Rio De Janeiro Paralympic Games wheelchair basketball competition were analysed using the template. Pearson’s chi-square analyses found that 18 of the CPV were significantly associated with field-goal attempt outcome (p &lt; 0.05), with seven of them reaching moderate association (Cramer’s V: 0.1–0.3). Third, using 70% of the dataset (3,574 field-goal attempts), binary logistic regression analyses identified that five offensive variables (classification category of the player, the action leading up to the field-goal attempt, the time left on the clock, the location of the shot, and the movement of the player), two defensive variables (the pressure being exerted by the defence, and the number of defenders within a 1-meter radius) and 1 context variable (the finishing position of the team in the competition) affected the probability of a successful field-goal attempt. The quality of the developed model was determined acceptable (greater than 65%), producing an area under the curve value of 68.5% when the model was run against the remaining 30% of the dataset (1,531 field-goal attempts). The development of the model from such a large sample of objective data is unique. As such it offers robust empirical evidence to enable coaches, performance analysts and players to move beyond anecdote, in order to appreciate the potential effect of various and varying offensive, defensive and contextual variables on field-goal success."

With these metrics, we analyze the geography of diseases and empirically investigate the effect of economic development on the health complexity of countries. We show that a higher income per capita increases the complexity of countries’ diseases. We also show that complex diseases tend to be non-ubiquitous diseases that are prevalent in disease-diversified (complex) countries, while non-complex diseases tend to be non-ubiquitous diseases that are prevalent in non-diversified (non-complex) countries. Furthermore, we build a disease-level index that links a disease to the average level of GDP per capita of the countries in which the disease is prevalent. With this index, we highlight the link between economic development and the complexity of diseases and illustrate how increases in income per capita are associated with more complex diseases."

It relies on a larger sample, with 192 volunteers, than previous studies to achieve higher statistical power. The main conclusion, drawn from binary comparisons between the treatment and reference groups, is that acute stress does not have a significant impact on cognitive skills, strategic sophistication, risk attitudes, altruism, cooperativeness, or nastiness. Regression analysis, controlling for psycho-social characteristics, corroborates these findings, while also suggesting that acute stress significantly decreases men’s risk aversion (as measured by a lottery-choice risk-elicitation task)."
https://openalex.org/W3119647043,"The value learning process has been investigated using decision-making tasks with a correct answer specified by the external environment (externally guided decision-making, EDM). In EDM, people are required to adjust their choices based on feedback, and the learning process is generally explained by the reinforcement learning (RL) model. In addition to EDM, value is learned through internally guided decision-making (IDM), in which no correct answer defined by external circumstances is available, such as preference judgment. In IDM, it has been believed that the value of the chosen item is increased and that of the rejected item is decreased (choice-induced preference change; CIPC). An RL-based model called the choice-based learning (CBL) model had been proposed to describe CIPC, in which the values of chosen and/or rejected items are updated as if own choice were the correct answer. However, the validity of the CBL model has not been confirmed by fitting the model to IDM behavioral data. The present study aims to examine the CBL model in IDM. We conducted simulations, a preference judgment task for novel contour shapes, and applied computational model analyses to the behavioral data. The results showed that the CBL model with both the chosen and rejected value’s updated were a good fit for the IDM behavioral data compared to the other candidate models. Although previous studies using subjective preference ratings had repeatedly reported changes only in one of the values of either the chosen or rejected items, we demonstrated for the first time both items’ value changes were based solely on IDM choice behavioral data with computational model analyses."

Methods The study was conducted in a rural and a metropolitan health district in NSW, Australia. Expert Panels reviewed detailed case reports to assess preventability. For those admissions identified as preventable, comments from clinicians indicating what they perceived could have made a difference and/or been done differently to prevent each of the preventable admissions were analysed qualitatively. Results 148 (46%) of 323 admissions were assessed as preventable. Across the two districts, the most commonly identified groups of contributing factors to preventable admissions were: ‘Systems issues: Community based services missing or inadequate or not referred to’; ‘Patient issues: Problems with adherence/self-management’; and ‘Clinician issues: GP care inadequate’. In some instances, important differences drove these groups of factors. For example, in the rural district ‘Systems issues: Community based services missing or inadequate or not referred to’ was largely driven by social and welfare support services missing/inadequate/not referred to, whereas in the metropolitan district it was largely driven by community nursing, allied health, care coordination or integrated care services missing/inadequate/not referred to. Analyses revealed the complexity of system, clinician and patient factors contributing to each admission. Admissions for COPD (rural) and CHF (metropolitan) admissions showed greatest complexity. Discussion and conclusion These findings suggest preventability of individual admissions is complex and context specific. There is no single, simple solution likely to reduce PPH. Rather, an approach addressing multiple factors is required. This need for comprehensiveness may explain why many programs seeking to reduce PPH have been unsuccessful."

This study sought to determine the presence of HDV in HIV/HBV co-infected patients in Ghana.This was a longitudinal purposive study which enrolled 113 HIV/HBV co-infected patients attending clinic at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH) in Accra, Ghana. After consenting, 5 mL whole blood was collected at two-time points (baseline and 4-6 months afterwards). The sera obtained were tested to confirm the presence of HIV, HBV antibodies and/or antigens, and HBV DNA. Antibodies and viral RNA were also determined for HDV. Amplified HBV DNA and HDV RNA were sequenced and phylogenetic analysis carried out with reference sequences from the GenBank to establish the genotypes.Of the 113 samples tested 63 (55.7%) were females and 50 (44.25%) were males with a median age of 45 years. A total of 100 (88.5%) samples had detectable HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), and 32 out of the 113 had detectable HBV DNA. Nucleotide sequences were obtained for 15 and 2 samples of HBV and HDV, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis was predominantly genotype E for the HBVs and genotype 1 for the HDVs. Of the 13 samples that were HBsAg unreactive, 4 (30.8%) had detectable HBV DNA suggesting the incidence of occult HBV infections. The percentage occurrence of HDV in this study was observed to be 3.54.Our data suggest the presence and circulation of HDV and incidence of occult HBV infection in HIV/HBV co-infected patients in Ghana. This informs health staff and makes it imperative to look out for the presence of HDV and occult HBV in HIV/HBV co-infected patients presenting with potential risk of liver cancers and HBV transmission through haemodialysis and blood transfusions."
https://openalex.org/W3118890173,"The Strength Use and Deficit Correction (SUDCO) Questionnaire has been shown to be a reliable instrument for the measurement of its four dimensions perceived organizational support for strengths use , perceived organizational support for deficit correction , strengths use behavior , and deficit correction behavior in the context of organizations. This paper aims to adapt and validate the SUDCO for the German-speaking population (SUDCO-G). Three studies were conducted. Confirmatory factor analyses and correlations with other psychological constructs on the data of three German samples ( N 1 = 302; N 2 = 243, N 3 = 295) were performed. The twenty-four item SUDCO-G exhibits the anticipated factorial structure with four factors and an acceptable model fit in all three studies ( CFI = .920-.937, TLI = .911-.929, RMSEA = .063-.079, SRMR = 0.52-.075). The associations of the four dimensions to other constructs concur with previous findings (study 2) and the subscales of the SUDCO-G also show positive relations with general strengths use, meaning of work and Psychological Capital (study 3). We conclude that the SUDCO-G is a reliable and valid instrument for the use in the German-speaking population."
https://openalex.org/W3119272939,"Objectives Oxygen saturation (OS) imaging is a new method of endoscopic imaging that has clinical applications in oncology which can directly measure tissue oxygen saturation (Sto2) of the surface of gastrointestinal tract without any additional drugs or devices. This imaging technology is expected to contribute to research into cancer biology which leads to clinical benefit such as prediction to efficacy of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. However, adherent substances on tumors such as blood and white coating, pose a challenge for accurate measurements of the StO2 values in tumors. The aim of this study was to develop algorithms for discriminating between the tumors and their adherent substances, and to investigate whether it is possible to evaluate the tumor specific StO2 values excluding adherent substances during OS imaging. Methods We plotted areas of tumors and their adherent substances using white-light images of 50 upper digestive tumors: blood (68 plots); reddish tumor (83 plots); white coating (89 plots); and whitish tumor (79 plots). Scatter diagrams and discriminating algorithms using spectrum signal intensity values were constructed and verified using validation datasets. StO2 values were compared between the tumors and tumor adherent substances using OS images of gastrointestinal tumors. Results The discriminating algorithms and their accuracy rates (AR) were as follows: blood vs. reddish tumor: Y&gt; - 4.90X+7.13 (AR: 95.9%) and white coating vs. whitish tumor: Y&lt; -0.52X+0.17 (AR: 96.0%). The StO2 values (median, [range]) were as follows: blood, 79.3% [37.8%–100.0%]; reddish tumor, 74.5% [62.0%–86.9%]; white coating, 73.8% [42.1%–100.0%]; and whitish tumor, 65.7% [53.0%–76.3%]. Conclusions OS imaging is strongly influenced by adherent substances for evaluating the specific StO2 value of tumors; therefore, it is important to eliminate the information of adherent substances for clinical application of OS imaging."
https://openalex.org/W3119140780,"Objectives A multicenter study was organized to explore sources of variation (SVs) of reference values (RVs) for 22 major immunochemistry analytes and to determine reference intervals (RIs) for the Russian population. Methods According to IFCC Committee on Reference Intervals and Decision Limits (C-RIDL) protocol, 758 healthy volunteers were recruited in St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Yekaterinburg. Serum samples were tested for five tumor markers, 17 hormones and related tests by Beckman Coulter’s UniCel DxI 800 immunochemistry analyzer. SVs were explored using multiple regression analysis and ANOVA. Standard deviation ratio (SDR) of 0.4 was used as primary guide for partitioning RIs by gender and age. Results SDR for between-city difference was &lt;0.4 for all analytes. Secondary exclusion of individuals was done under the following conditions: for female sex-hormones, those with contraceptives (8%); for CA19-9, those supposed to have negative Lewis blood-group (10.5% males and 11.3% females); for insulin, those with BMI≥28 kg/m 2 (31%); for the thyroid panel, those with anti-thyroid antibodies (10.3% males; 24.5% females), for CEA those with smoking habit (30% males and 16% females). Gender-specific RIs were required for all analytes except CA19-9, CA15-3, thyroid-related tests, parathyroid hormone, and insulin. Age-specific RIs were required for alpha-fetoprotein, CEA, all sex-hormones for females, FSH and progesterone for both sexes. RIs were generally derived by parametric method after Gaussian transformation using modified Box-Cox formula. Exceptions were growth hormone, estradiol for females in postmenopause, and progesterone for females in premenopause, for which nonparametric method was required due to bimodal distribution and/or insufficient detection limit. Conclusion RIs for major hormones and tumor markers specific for the Russian population were derived based on the up-to-date internationally harmonized protocol by careful consideration of analyte-specific SVs."
https://openalex.org/W3121087428,"In a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinic for children and their families in Eswatini, we sought to understand the use of antibiotics and identify specific areas for improvement. We performed a retrospective patient chart review as part of a quality improvement (QI) initiative to assess antimicrobial use before and after implementation of a standardized antimicrobial guide. For each prescribing period, 100 random patient encounters were selected for review if the indication for antibiotics, duration, and dose were consistent with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Two physicians reviewed each encounter using a structured abstraction tool, with a third resolving discrepancies. Results were analyzed using a chi-square test of proportions and a structured survey was performed to assess perceptions of the guide. After the implementation of an antimicrobial guide, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of clinic visits with an antibiotic prescribed (p &lt; 0.001). Incorrect indication for antimicrobial use decreased from 20.4% in the initial period to 10.31% and 10.2% but did not reach significance (p = .0621) in the subsequent periods after implementation. Incorrect dose/duration decreased from 10.47% in the initial period to 7.37% and 3.1% in the subsequent periods, but this was also was not significant (p = 0.139). All prescribers who completed the survey felt that it positively impacted their prescribing. Our study found that an antimicrobial guide reduced and improved the prescription of antimicrobials, demonstrating practical solutions can have a lasting impact on prescribing in low resource settings."
