One important feature of signaling compounds is their ability to move between different compartments, e.g. to cross membranes. Here we present evidence that aquaporins can channel hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Twenty-four aquaporins from plants and mammals were screened in five yeast strains differing in sensitivity toward oxidative stress. Expression of human AQP8 and plant Arabidopsis TIP1;1 and TIP1;2 in yeast decreased growth and survival in the presence of H2O2. Further evidence for aquaporin-mediated H2O2 diffusion was obtained by a fluorescence assay with intact yeast cells using an intracellular reactive oxygen species-sensitive fluorescent dye. Application of silver ions (Ag+), which block aquaporin-mediated water diffusion in a fast kinetics swelling assay, also reversed both the aquaporin-dependent growth repression and the H2O2-induced fluorescence. Our results present the first molecular genetic evidence for the diffusion of H2O2 through specific members of the aquaporin family.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 2The abbreviations used are: H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; AQP, aquaporin; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TIP, tonoplast intrinsic protein; wt, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. belongs to the group of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are generated in a number of key metabolic processes in cells like the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane (1Møller I.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 561-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar) and, specific for plants, the chloroplast thylakoid membrane (2Foyer C.H. Noctor G. Physiol. Plant. 2003; 119: 355-364Crossref Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Because ROS can potentially damage proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, cells have a number of ROS-scavenging systems that are able to remove these molecules and to maintain a relatively low and constant ROS concentration (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine.3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 105-245Google Scholar). However, ROS are also intermediates in various signal transduction pathways and have been shown to initiate responses to various stresses and disorders (for recent reviews, see Refs. 4Ardanaz N. Pagano P.J. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2006; 231: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar and 5Cai H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 6: 26-36Crossref Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis mutants lacking an NADPH oxidase were not able to respond adequately to potassium deficiency (6Shin R. Schachtman D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8827-8832Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and were impaired in stomatal closure (7Bright J. Desikan R. Hancock J.T. Weir I.S. Neill S.J. Plant J. 2006; 45: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), providing genetic evidence for a role of NADPH oxidase in signaling. ROS are interconvertible molecules including singlet oxygen, superoxide, hydroxyl radical, and H2O2.H2O2 has a distinctive set of features compared with other ROS. (i) It is not charged, (ii) it is not a radical, (iii) it possesses an intermediate oxidation number, (iv) it is relatively stable under physiological conditions, and (v) catalase can disproportionate it into water and molecular oxygen without the expense of reduction equivalents. Although substantial progress has been made regarding the formation and scavenging of ROS, little is known about their transport from the site of origin to the place of action or detoxification. Recently three studies from mammalian systems have provided evidence that H2O2, in addition to the well studied role in intracellular signaling, is also used as an intercellular signal molecule (8Pletjushkina O.Y. Fetisova E.K. Lyamzaev K.G. Ivanova O.Y. Dom-nina L.V. Vyssokikh M.Y. Pustovidko A.V. Alexeevski A.V. Alexeevski D.A. Vasiliev J.M. Murphy M.P. Chernyak B.V. Skulachev V.P.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 854-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This implies that a necessary step within these signal transduction pathways is the transport of H2O2 or ROS across at least two membranes: (i) the plasma membrane of the H2O2-producing cell and (ii) the plasma membrane of the H2O2 signal-perceiving cell. The role of biological membranes is to act as barriers between organelles and cells and to separate compartments for different metabolic pathways. Only small and non-polar molecules easily cross the hydrophobic membrane lipid bilayer by simple diffusion. The transport of larger, polar or charged molecules depends on transporters and channels to decrease the activation energy needed for passive diffusion. Expression of aquaporins in yeast secretory vesicles lowered the activation energy for diffusion of water from between 46 and 55 to 17 kJ mol-1 (11Coury L.A. Hiller M. Mathai J.C Jones E.W. Zeidel M.L. Brodsky J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4437-4440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 has a permanent dipole moment of 2.26 × 10-18 electrostatic unit (12Ardon M. Oxygen. W. A. Benjamin Inc., New York1965: 82Google Scholar), very similar to that of water (1.85 × 10-18 electrostatic unit). Consequently simple passive diffusion of H2O2 across the lipid bilayer should be limited as for water. Recent studies have demonstrated that some membranes are indeed poorly permeable to H2O2 (13Seaver L.C. Imlay A.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7182-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 14Branco M.R. Marhino H. Cyrne L. Antunes F. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); this together with scavenging processes explains the formation of H2O2 gradients across membranes (17Antunes F. Cadenas E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Differences in permeability could either be explained by different membrane lipid compositions or by diffusion-facilitating channel proteins or a combination of both (for a review, see Ref. 18Bienert G.P. Schjoerring J.K. Jahn T.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 994-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). The striking chemical similarity between water and H2O2 points to aquaporins as likely candidates for H2O2 permeation. Aquaporins form a large family of membrane proteins with members in all kingdoms of life and are known as efficient water channels (19Preston G.M. Caroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar, 20Zardoya R. Biol. Cell. 2005; 97: 397-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). H2O2 has almost the same size, dielectric properties, and capacity to form hydrogen bonds as does water (12Ardon M. Oxygen. W. A. Benjamin Inc., New York1965: 82Google Scholar). Exactly those properties are the main factors determining the diffusion through major intrinsic proteins including aqua-porins. Henzler and Steudle (21Henzler T. Steudle E. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 2053-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) showed that mercury, an aqua-porin blocker, repressed H2O2 accumulation in internodal cells of the algae Chara corallina. The authors therefore suggested that some aquaporins in Chara served as peroxoporins. The accumulating evidence prompted us to perform a comprehensive screen testing 24 aquaporin isoforms from plants and mammals in five yeast strains differing in sensitivity to oxidative stress. Aquaporin-mediated H2O2 transport was further investigated in a fluorescence assay with intact yeast cells using an intracellular ROS-sensitive fluorescent dye. Our data provide the first molecular genetic evidence that the three aqua-porins hAQP8, AtTIP1;1, and AtTIP1;2 facilitate the diffusion of H2O2 across membranes. Yeast Strains and Growth Assay—A wild type (wt) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (BY4741) and four deletion mutants in the same genetic background were used (Table 1). The double deletion mutant Δfps1,Δyfl054c was generated by crossing haploid, single deletion mutants Y15675 (Δyfl054c) and Y01531 (Δyll043w) (Euroscarf) and subsequent sporulation according to standard procedures. To complement the lack of the leu2 gene that was used to delete tsa2 to generate the Δtsa1,2 mutant (22Wong C.M. Zhou Y. Ng R.W. Kung H.-f. Jin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5385-5394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), wild type, Δskn7, Δyap1, and Δfps1,Δyfl054c were transformed with the centromeric vector pRS305 carrying the leu2 gene. All yeast strains were transformed with either an empty pYES2 (Invitrogen) as control or derivates of pYES2 carrying cDNAs for 24 different aquaporin homologues (Table 2). Yeast cells were grown on synthetic medium containing 2% galactose (SG), 50 mm succinic acid/Tris base, pH 5.5, 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 0.3% methionine (M), and 0.3% histidine (H). Yeast cells were diluted in sterile water to an A600 of 0.01, and 10 μl were spotted on solid SG-HM medium containing various concentrations of H2O2 (J. T. Baker Inc.) as indicated. After 6 days of incubation, differences in growth and survival were recorded. For Ag+ treatments, cells were spotted on solid SG-HM medium supplemented with either no or 0.1 mm H2O2 and various concentrations of AgNO3 (Merck). After 6 days of incubation, differences in growth and survival were recorded.TABLE 1List of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study Yeast strains used in this study differ in a number of essential oxidative defense enzymes or the presence of endogenous aquaporin homologues.

The supernatants were used for the catalase activity assay. Catalase activity was determined as the decomposition of H2O2 measured as a decrease in absorbance at 240 nm (23Bergmeyer H.U. Biochem. Z. 1955; 327: 255-258PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 10 μg of yeast protein extract and 20 mm H2O2 corresponding to an absorbance A240 of 0.5–0.6. Specific catalase activity (μmol min-1 mg of protein-1) was calculated from ΔA240 ϵ(H2O2)-1 mg-1 where ΔA240 is the change in A240 over 60 s and ϵ(H2O2) is the millimolar extinction coefficient of H2O2 at 240 nm, 0.0436 mm-1 cm-1. Fluorescence Assay—Yeast strain Δyap1 transformed with pYES2 or pYES2 containing AtTIP1; 1, hAQP8, or hAQP1 were precultured for 2 days on solid synthetic medium. Two-milliliter liquid cultures were inoculated and supplemented with 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA, Molecular Probes) from a 5 mm stock in Me2SO or ethanol to a final concentration of 1 μm. Cells were grown in darkness overnight to an A600 of 1.6, washed five times in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), and finally suspended in HEPES buffer at an A600 of 1.4. Fluorescence of 2 ml of yeast suspension was followed over time with a spectrofluorometer (MOS-250, BioLogic) at excitation/emission of 492/527 nm and a temperature of 20 °C. For the calculation of the activation energy (Ea), temperatures were set to 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C. Primary data were collected using BioKine software. For Ag+ inhibition assays, yeast cells were preincubated for 45 min in 30 μm AgNO3 in the dark and washed twice with HEPES buffer before measuring fluorescence. Spheroplast Swelling Assay—Δyap1 transformed with pYES2 or pYES2 containing AtTIP1;1, hAQP1,or hAQP8 were grown in 10 ml of YPG (complex medium) for 16 h at 30 °C. After centrifugation, cells were washed in 50 ml of 5 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.5), resuspended in 10 ml of 5 mm KH2PO4 plus 20 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (98%), and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 2.4 m sorbitol, 5 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.5) plus 60 units of lyticase (Sigma)/ml of buffer at an A600 of 1.0. The cells were incubated for 45 min at 30 °C. Following centrifugation, spheroplasts were washed once and finally resuspended in 10 mm Tris/MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m sorbitol, and 0.4 m K2SO4 at an A475 of 2.0. Kinetics of spheroplast swelling were measured essentially as described previously (24Laizé V. Gobin R. Rousselet G. Badier C. Hohmann S. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Volume changes were recorded at 10 °C as light scattering at an angle of 90° and 475 nm using a fast kinetics instrument (SFM-300, BioLogic) equipped with a spectrofluorometer (MOS-250, BioLogic). For Ag+ or H2O2 treatments, the final spheroplast suspensions were treated with AgNO3 at 30 μm for 10 min or 0.1 versus 0.75 mm H2O2 for 30 min before conducting the swelling assay. All data presented are averages of at least 12 trace recordings. The rate constant of the decrease of scattered light intensity is proportional to the water permeability coefficient (25Kozono D. Ding X. Kwasaki I. Meng X. Kamagata Y. Agre P. Kitagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10649-10656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Calamita G. Ferri D. Gena P. Liquori G.E. Cavalier A. Thomas D. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17149-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Rate constants were calculated by fitting the curves using non-linear regression as described earlier (27Liu K. Nagase H. Huang C.G. Calamita G. Agre P. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 153-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One-exponential functions were used for control spheroplasts, and two-exponential functions were used for aquaporin-expressing spheroplasts (27Liu K. Nagase H. Huang C.G. Calamita G. Agre P. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 153-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fitting curves were also used to calculate the half-maximal swelling time (t½). Bioimaging—Dye-loaded yeast cells were placed on Novakemi AB 10-well microscope slides (Menzel) covered with poly-l-lysine allowing the yeast cells to attach. Excess cells were washed off with double distilled H2O. The slides were placed in a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2, Leica Microsystems) and monitored using a dipping lens (63× and numerical aperture of 0.9). Time lapse experiments in xyt mode with a line average of 2 and intervals of approximately 3 s between each frame were carried out. Total experiment time was about 5 min (93 frames). ROS development was monitored during experiments where the yeast cells were treated with 0.1 mm H2O2 using the 488 nm laser line with 3% laser power. To treat the yeast cells with H2O2, a peristaltic pump (P-3, GE Healthcare) was connected with the microscope stage to facilitate suction. H2O2 solution was added after about 30 s (10 frames). Expression of Aquaporins Increase the Sensitivity of Yeast Cells to Externally Supplied H2O2—To test whether aquaporins are permeable to H2O2, five different yeast strains (S. cerevisiae, Table 1) were transformed with 24 different aquaporins from human, rat, Arabidopsis, and wheat (Table 2) or with an empty vector as control. Four of the different yeast strains differed in their sensitivity toward oxidative stress and, consequently, to externally supplied H2O2. The fifth yeast strain, Δfps1,Δyfl054c, used lacked all functional endogenous aquaporin homologues. Yeast strains were plated on synthetic medium with various concentrations of H2O2. Growth was recorded after 6 days at 30 °C. In the absence of any heterologous aquaporin, addition of H2O2 decreased growth and survival of the different yeast strains to various degrees. wt, Δtsa1,2, and Δfps1,Δyfl054c were able to grow in the presence of 0.75 mm H2O2, whereas growth of Δskn7 and Δyap1 was completely repressed at 0.75 mm H2O2 (Fig. 1). Stability of H2O2 during the growth period was tested by preincubating H2O2-containing medium for 6 days at 30 °C prior to the growth assay. Very similar growth responses were recorded with and without preincubation of the medium (data not shown). Transformation with the majority of aquaporins did not significantly change the sensitivity of yeast cells toward increasing concentrations of H2O2 in the medium. Results from hAQP1 are shown as an example (Fig. 1). However, expression of hAQP8 and AtTIP1;1 markedly reduced growth and cell survival on medium containing H2O2 (Fig. 1). The same was seen when expressing AtTIP1;2 (data not shown). Following expression of hAQP8 and AtTIP1;1, growth of all yeast strains tested was repressed at a 2–3 times lower concentration of H2O2 compared with the empty vector controls. The strain Δyap1 was again most sensitive followed by Δskn7, Δtsa1,2, and wt. Although for example the wt transformed with hAQP8 was able to grow on medium containing up to 0.5 mm H2O2, growth of Δyap1 when transformed with hAQP8 was completely repressed at 0.3 mm H2O2. Transformants of Δfps1,Δyfl054c showed growth and cell survival comparable to the corresponding wild type transformants. Growth was repressed by addition of H2O2 at very similar concentrations. Fps1p is known to play a role in osmotic adaptation (28Tamas M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H. Li H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Increased sensitivity of hAQP8- and AtTIP1-expressing yeasts toward H2O2 in the medium could be the result of a decreased capacity to scavenge H2O2 inside the cells. Catalase is the most abundant ROS-scavenging enzyme; it directly decomposes H2O2 to water and molecular oxygen. To investigate whether heterologous expression of aquaporins resulted in a decreased scavenging capacity of the yeast cells, we measured catalase activity as the breakdown of H2O2 by diluted extracts from yeast cells transformed with either the empty vector pYES or pYES containing hAQP1, hAQP8, or AtTIP1;1 (Table 3). Expression of all three aquaporins resulted in either no change or an increase rather than a decrease of H2O2 scavenging capacity in the yeast extracts. Pretreatment with H2O2 caused a further increase in catalase activity. Therefore the increased sensitivity toward H2O2 in the external medium was not caused by a decrease in H2O2 scavenging of aquaporin-expressing yeasts. The reduced growth of yeast expressing AtTIP1;1 or hAQP8 was rather due to increased oxidative stress as the result of increased uptake of H2O2 from the external medium.TABLE 3Specific catalase activity in extracts from yeast cells transformed with hAQP8, hAQP1, AtTIP1;1, or pYES as a control Shown is specific catalase activity (μmol min-1 mg-1) in yeast extracts from cells grown in YPG (n = 4) (A) and cells grown in YPG and supplemented with 0.1 mm H2O2 6 h before protein extraction (n = 2) (B).

Tyerman S.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Ag+ acts by binding to cysteine or histidine residues in proteins. Both hAQP8 and AtTIP1;1 contain cysteine residues in their pore region that have been identified as targets for inhibition by mercury when water permeability was investigated in oocyte swelling assays (30Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Kageyama Y. Tohsaka A. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 31Daniels M.J. Chaumont F. Mirkov T.E. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Ag+ is also a biocide with various negative effects on organisms. In the absence of H2O2, increasing concentrations of AgNO3 (up to 30 μm) resulted in a substantial decrease in growth and viability of cells irrespective of whether cells were transformed with empty vector, hAQP8, or AtTIP1;1 (data for Δskn7, Fig. 2A). Toxicity became evident at about 6 μm Ag+, a concentration level that Niemietz and Tyerman (29Niemietz C.M. Tyerman S.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) found most effective for inhibition of aquaporins. The control yeast (pYES2) showed a very similar growth repression at increasing Ag+ concentrations in the absence and presence of H2O2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Conversely yeast expressing hAQP8 and AtTIP1;1 were only able to grow in the presence of 6 μm Ag+ and higher (Fig. 2B). The results suggested that Ag+ blocks the diffusion of H2O2 through these aquaporins. Interestingly the presence of 0.1 mm H2O2 slightly alleviated the growth repression induced by Ag+ in all yeast transformants tested (Fig. 2B). This may be due to a direct effect of H2O2 on Ag+. An alternative explanation is that a moderate concentration of H2O2 causes a stress-alert response in the yeast cells and consequently improves growth in the presence of the biocide Ag+. Water Transport and Swelling of Yeast Spheroplasts—To confirm that the heterologous aquaporins were functionally expressed at the yeast plasma membrane and to investigate the effect of Ag+ and H2O2 on aquaporin function, we performed a water transport assay. Yeast spheroplasts were prepared and divided into three fractions, one of which was preincubated with Ag+, another was preincubated with H2O2, and the third was untreated control. After exposing the spheroplasts to hypoosmotic conditions (transfer from 400 to 200 mm K2SO4), fast initial swelling was observed with spheroplasts expressing AtTIP1;1, hAQP8, and hAQP1 compared with the empty vector control (Fig. 3). Pretreatment with 6 μm Ag+ had only marginal effects on swelling kinetics of aquaporin-expressing spheroplasts (data not shown). This may be due to the incubation with the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol during spheroplast preparation. At higher concentration (30 μm Ag+), both aqua-porin-expressing and control spheroplasts did not reach the same final volume as in the absence of Ag+ (data not shown), indicating some non-aquaporin-specific, toxic effects. However, pretreatment with 30 μm Ag+ substantially decreased the rate constant for AQP1- and TIP1;1-expressing spheroplasts but not for AQP8-expressing and control spheroplasts (Fig. 3B). Ag+ pretreatment also increased the time needed to reach half-maximal swelling (t½). This was seen for all aquaporin-expressing spheroplasts but not for the control (Fig. 3C). Together the results support the view that Ag+ acts as an aqua-porin blocker to inhibit water flux. Pretreatment with H2O2 did not change the swelling kinetics of the spheroplast regardless of the presence of the various aquaporins (Fig. 3, B and C). Fluorescence Measurements—Growth inhibition following supplementation of the growth medium with H2O2 is a rather slow and indirect approach. To more directly follow H2O2 transport across the yeast plasma membrane, we developed a fluorescence-based assay. Yeast cells were grown in the presence of the dye CM-H2DCFDA, which has been used to monitor the level of ROS in various systems (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine.3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 105-245Google Scholar). In its acetylated form, the dye can diffuse into yeast cells. Deacetylation traps the fluorochrome inside the cells and makes it susceptible to oxidation by ROS. After culture overnight, yeast cells were washed five times, and fluorescence was monitored. To test whether all yeast transformants took up the dye, cells loaded with CM-H2DCFDA were upon washing made permeable with 1% Triton, and the supernatants were exposed to H2O2. In all cases, an increase in fluorescence was detected (data not shown). In the absence of H2O2 in the buffer solution, none of the dye-loaded yeast cells (Δyap1 transformed with either AtTIP1;1, hAQP1, hAQP8, or pYES) showed a significant increase in fluorescence even after 1800 s (not shown). Addition of 0.1 mm H2O2 to control or hAQP1-transformed yeast cells only marginally increased fluorescence (Fig. 4, A and B). However, addition of H2O2 to yeast cells expressing AtTIP1;1 and hAQP8 increased fluorescence significantly (Fig. 4). The same was seen for AtTIP1;2 (data not shown). When cells were removed from the assay medium by centrifugation, no fluorescence could be detected after addition of H2O2 to the assay supernatants (Fig. 5A). However, after resuspension with fresh assay buffer, yeast cells transformed with hAQP8 and AtTIP1;1 showed the increase in fluorescence upon addition of H2O2 (Fig. 5B) as in Fig. 4A. Removal of the cells by centrifugation after completion of the assay (addition of H2O2) also reduced the fluorescence signal from the assay medium (not shown). Together this demonstrates that the increase in fluorescence was not due to increased leakage of the fluorescent dye from the cells expressing hAQP8 and AtTIP1;1 but was rather caused by increased uptake of H2O2 into the cells. Fig. 4B shows the average relative increase of fluorescence during the first 100 s after addition of H2O2. Expression of AtTIP1;1 led to a higher increase in fluorescence than expression of hAQP8. The Arrhenius plot suggested a reduction in the activation energy (Ea) for the diffusion of H2O2 from 58 to about 42 kJ mol-1 (Fig. 4C). Preincubation of yeast cells for 45 min with 30 μm AgNO3 almost completely abolished the fluorescence increase upon addition of H2O2 (Fig. 4, A and B). In an in vitro co"

For the last glacial period, ice core studies have revealed strong coupling of the largest millennial-scale warm events in Antarctica with the longest Dansgaard-Oeschger events in Greenland through the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. It has been unclear, however, whether the shorter Dansgaard-Oeschger events have counterparts in the shorter and less prominent Antarctic temperature variations, and whether these events are linked by the same mechanism. Here we present a glacial climate record derived from an ice core from Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, which represents South Atlantic climate at a resolution comparable with the Greenland ice core records. After methane synchronization with an ice core from North Greenland, the oxygen isotope record from the Dronning Maud Land ice core shows a one-to-one coupling between all Antarctic warm events and Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger events by the bipolar seesaw6. The amplitude of the Antarctic warm events is found to be linearly dependent on the duration of the concurrent stadial in the North, suggesting that they all result from a similar reduction in the meridional overturning circulation."

PGC-1α regulates and coordinates mitochondrial biogenesis, and overexpression of PGC-1α in muscle cells results in increases in mitochondrial content. In this context, it has been proposed that the increase in PGC-1α protein expression mediates the exercise-induced increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. However, we found that mitochondrial proteins with a short half-life increase as rapidly as, or more rapidly than, PGC-1α protein. This finding led us to hypothesize that activation, rather than increased expression, of PGC-1α mediates the initial phase of the exercise-induced increase in mitochondria. In this study, we found that most of the PGC-1α in resting skeletal muscle is in the cytosol. Exercise resulted in activation of p38 MAPK and movement of PGC-1α into the nucleus. In support of our hypothesis, binding of the transcription factor nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) to the cytochrome c promoter and NRF-2 to the cytochrome oxidase subunit 4 promoter increased in response to exercise prior to an increase in PGC-1α protein. Furthermore, exercise-induced increases in the mRNAs of cytochrome c, δ-aminolevulinate synthase, and citrate synthase also occurred before an increase in PGC-1 protein. Thus, it appears that activation of PGC-1α may mediate the initial phase of the exercise-induced adaptive increase in muscle mitochondria, whereas the subsequent increase in PGC-1α protein sustains and enhances the increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. Exercise results in rapid increases in expression of the transcription coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and in mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle.

However, when we examined the time course of this adaptive response, we found that mitochondrial proteins with short half-lives increase in parallel with the increase in PGC-1α protein.

To evaluate the effects of exercise on mitochondrial biogenesis, some rats were exercised by swimming for 6 h using a modification of the protocol of Plough et al. (14Ploug T. Stallknecht B.M. Pedersen O. Kahn B.B. Ohkuwa T. Vinten J. Galbo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E778-E786PubMed Google Scholar) in which the exercise session was divided into two 3-h bouts separated by 45 min of rest during which time the rats were kept warm and given food and water, as described previously (15Ren J.-M. Semenkovich C.F. Gulve E.A. Gao J. Holloszy J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14396-14401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other rats were exercised by swimming for 2 h. Rats were anesthetized with 5 mg/100 g of body weight sodium pentobarbital given intraperitoneally. Triceps and epitrochlearis muscles were dissected out and trimmed of fat and connective tissue. Some triceps muscles were used immediately for isolation of nuclei. The other muscles were clamp-frozen in aluminum tongs cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. This protocol was approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Triceps muscles were homogenized in 10 volumes of Pierce cytosolic extraction reagent supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate; 1 mm each EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, NaF; 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; 0.1 mm bis-peroxovanadium,1,10-phenanthrolene; 25 μm okadaic acid; and 2 mg/ml β-glycerophosphate aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were isolated according to the manufacturer's specifications using a Pierce nuclear isolation kit.Western Blot Analysis—Clamp-frozen epitrochlearis muscles were powdered and then homogenized in a 10:1 volume-to-weight ratio of ice-cold buffer containing: 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm each EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, NaF, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 0.1 mm bis-peroxovanadium,1,10-phenanthrolene, 25 μm okadaic acid, and 2 mg/ml β-glycerophosphate. The homogenates were sonicated on ice for 5 s. Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 700 × g at 4 °C. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions of triceps muscle were prepared as described above. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (16Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PGC-1α, SUO, ALAS, p-P38 MAPK, p-ATF-2, lactate dehydrogenase, and histone H2B were measured by Western analysis using the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies as described previously (13Garcia-Roves P.M.

Two epitrochlearis muscles were pooled for each sample and cross-linked in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. 1 ml of 10× glycine (Upstate Biotechnology) was added to stop fixation. Muscles were homogenized in 1 ml of SDS lysis buffer containing 5 μl of Protease Inhibitor Mixture II (Upstate Biotechnology) in glass Kontes grinding tubes. Chromatin was sheared by sonicating each sample for 4× 10 s on ice. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, supernatant containing 1 mg of protein was diluted to 1 ml with dilution buffer (Upstate Biotechnology). 5 μg of anti-NRF-1, NRF-2, or anti-IgG antibody was added per sample and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Anti-IgG antibodies were used as a nonspecific control. The following morning, 60 μl of protein G-agarose was added, and the sample was mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Precipitated complexes were eluted in 100 μl of elution buffer (Upstate Biotechnology), and cross-linking was reversed by the addition of 8 μl of 5 m NaCl per sample followed by incubation at 65 °C overnight. Coimmunoprecipitated DNA was purified according to the manufacturer's directions. Primers were designed to amplify the NRF-1 binding region of the cytochrome c promoter and the NRF-2 binding region of the cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) promoter. The following specific primers were used: cytochrome c, forward, 5′-TGT CGT AAG TGT CGG GCA AAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCA TTG GCT CCA GGA TTG GG-3′; COXIV, forward, 5′-ACC GCG ARC CTG AAG CTG AT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTG TCA AAG GCC GTC ACC-3′.PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min and then 36 20-s cycles at 94 °C, 36 30-s cycles at 59 °C, and 36 20-s cycles at 72 °C. 50 μl of PCR product was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel and electrophoretically separated, and the densities of the bands were quantified. Purified DNA from the input sample that did not undergo immunoprecipitation was PCR-amplified and used to normalize signals from ChIP assays.Determination of mRNA—RNA was extracted from triceps muscles from sedentary and exercised rats using TRIzol reagent as described previously (18Garcia-Roves P.M.

Universal 18s (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used as an internal control for citrate synthase and ALAS, whereas 18s Classic (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used for cytochrome c. PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with Sybr Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Transcript intensity was expressed relative to 18s. The following primers were used: δ ALAS, forward, 5′-GCTCTTGTTCTCTTCCTGCTTCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAAACTCGTGCTGGCAATGTATC-3′; citrate synthase, forward, 5′-CACAGCCCCTCAACAGTGAAAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTAGTCTCGTAACTTCTCATCTGACACG-3′; cytochrome c, forward, 5′-GGAGGCAAGCATAAGACTGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTCTGCCCTTTCTCCCTTCT-3′.Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E.

PGC-1α protein content was significantly increased 3 h following exercise, with a further increase over the next 15 h (Fig. 1). The finding of increases in proteins that are regulated by PGC-1α prior to an increase in PGC-1 protein provides evidence that the initial adaptive increase in mitochondrial biogenesis is not mediated by the exercise-induced increase in PGC-1α protein expression.Exercise-induced Increases in mRNAs of Mitochondrial Markers—To obtain further evidence regarding the role of PGC-1α in the early phase of the adaptation to exercise, we measured ALAS, citrate synthase, and cytochrome c mRNAs immediately after a bout of swimming. As shown in Fig. 2, the mRNAs for ALAS, citrate synthase, and cytochrome c were significantly increased at this time point, prior to the increase in PGC-1α protein.FIGURE 2δ-Aminolevulinate synthase, citrate synthase (CS), and cytochrome c mRNAs are increased in triceps muscles immediately following exercise.

However, as shown in Fig. 4, in resting skeletal muscle, most of the PGC-1α is present in the cytosol. Lactate dehydrogenase protein was used as a marker of the degree of contamination of the nuclear fraction with cytosolic proteins (Fig. 4). Histone H2B protein was measured to evaluate the effect of exercise on the yield of nuclei. As shown in Fig. 4, there was no detectable contamination of the nuclear fraction by the cytosolic protein, lactate dehydrogenase. There was also no difference in the quantity of nuclei extracted from resting and exercised muscles as reflected in the nuclear protein histone H2B (Fig. 4). 2 h of swimming resulted in a large increase in the amount of PGC-1α located in the nuclei.FIGURE 4Exercise causes an increase in PGC-1α protein content in the nucleus. Rats were sacrificed immediately following 2 h of swimming, and PGC-1α content was determined in the nuclear fraction of epitrochlearis muscles. A, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) protein content was measured in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions as an indicator of the degree of contamination of the nuclear fraction with cytosolic protein.

To further evaluate the possibility that activation rather than increased expression of PGC-1α mediates the initial phase of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis, we measured NRF-1 and NRF-2 DNA binding. We used the ChIP assay to quantify binding of NRF-1 to the NRF-1 binding site on the cytochrome c promoter and binding of NRF-2 to an NRF-2 binding sequence on the cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) promoter. As shown in Fig. 5, NRF-1 and NRF-2 DNA binding was increased in response to a bout of exercise, before there was an increase in PGC-1α protein expression.FIGURE 5NRF-1 binding to the cytochrome c promoter and NRF-2 binding to the COXIV promoter is increased in rat epitrochlearis muscles immediately following 2 h of swimming.

https://openalex.org/W2022897538,"Abstract An Escherichia coli strain that cannot scavenge hydrogen peroxide has been used to identify the cell processes that are most sensitive to this oxidant. Low micromolar concentrations of H2O2 completely blocked the biosynthesis of leucine. The defect was tracked to the inactivation of isopropylmalate isomerase. This enzyme belongs to a family of [4Fe-4S] dehydratases that are notoriously sensitive to univalent oxidation, and experiments confirmed that other members were also inactivated. In vitro and in vivo analyses showed that H2O2 directly oxidized their solvent-exposed clusters in a Fenton-like reaction. The oxidized cluster then degraded to a catalytically inactive [3Fe-4S] form. Experiments indicated that H2O2 accepted two consecutive electrons during the oxidation event. As a consequence, hydroxyl radicals were not released; the polypeptide was undamaged; and the enzyme was competent for reactivation by repair processes. Strikingly, in scavenger-deficient mutants, the H2O2 that was generated as an adventitious by-product of metabolism (<1 μm) was sufficient to damage these [4Fe-4S] enzymes. This result demonstrates that aerobic organisms must synthesize H2O2 scavengers to avoid poisoning their own pathways. The extreme vulnerability of these enzymes may explain why many organisms, including mammals, deploy H2O2 to suppress microbial growth."

Lipin harboring the fld2j (Gly84 → Arg) mutation exhibited relatively little PAP activity. These results indicate that lipin is a major PAP in vivo and that the loss of PAP activity contributes to the fld phenotype. PAP activity was readily detected in immune complexes of lipin from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, where the protein was found both as a microsomal form and a soluble, more highly phosphorylated, form. Fifteen phosphorylation sites were identified by mass spectrometric analyses. Insulin increased the phosphorylation of multiple sites and promoted a gel shift that was due in part to phosphorylation of Ser106. In contrast, epinephrine and oleic acid promoted dephosphorylation of lipin. The PAP-specific activity of lipin was not affected by the hormones or by dephosphorylation of lipin with protein phosphatase 1. However, the ratio of soluble to microsomal lipin was markedly increased in response to insulin and decreased in response to epinephrine and oleic acid. The results suggest that insulin and epinephrine control lipin primarily by changing localization rather than intrinsic PAP activity.

This enzyme generates pools of diacylglycerol utilized in the synthesis both of TAG and of the phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine (2Coleman R.A.

Lipin is encoded by the Lpin1 gene, 3We refer to the protein products of the mammalian Lpin1 gene as lipin, except when necessary to distinguish between the 1a and 1b isoforms.

Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Consequently, lipin was known to have an important role in lipid metabolism before the PAP activity of the protein was discovered. The fld allele arose spontaneously as a result of a complex genetic rearrangement of the Lpin1 gene (4Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Thus, fld/fld mice express neither lipin 1a nor lipin 1b, a slightly larger protein, which arises from alternative mRNA splicing (4Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 5Huffman T.A. Mothe-Satney I. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1387-1405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These abnormalities resolve after a few weeks, but several long lasting derangements develop, including glucose intolerance, insulin resistance (7Reue K. Xu P. Wang X.P. Slavin B.G. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and defective peripheral myelination (8Langner C.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Roth K.A. Bronson R.T. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11955-11964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A striking abnormality of the fld/fld mice is the absence of normal adipose tissue (7Reue K. Xu P. Wang X.P. Slavin B.G. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another mutant Lpin1 allele, designated fld2j, encodes a protein identical to wild type lipin, except that Arg replaces Gly at position 84 (4Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The phenotype of fld2j/fld2j mice is indistinguishable from that of fld/fld mice. The effect of the Gly84 → Arg mutation on the enzymatic activity of lipin has not been described. The proteins encoded by Lpin1 are expressed in a wide variety of tissues, with the highest levels found in adipose tissue (4Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 5Huffman T.A. Mothe-Satney I. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Lipin 1b increases markedly as fat cells differentiate, and it is the prevalent isoform in mature adipocytes (9Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Two other isoforms, lipin 2 and lipin 3, are encoded by different genes (4Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Conservation of sequence among the lipin isoforms is highest in domains, referred to as NLIP and CLIP, which are located in the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions, respectively, of the proteins (4Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). These domains are found in lipin proteins from other species, including the Saccharomyces cerevisiae lipin (1Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 10Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S. Siniossoglou S.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4375-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Imbedded in the CLIP domain is a signature sequence of the HAD superfamily of hydrolases (12Koonin E.V. Tatusov R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In HAD family phosphatases, the phosphate group from the substrate is transferred to Asp (corresponding to Asp712 in lipin 1b) in the HAD motif I consensus sequence, ΦΦΦΦDXXGTΦ (where Φ represents a bulky hydrophobic residue and X is any residue) (13Ridder I.S. Dijkstra B.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activity measurements in hepatocytes and adipocytes indicate that the subcellular distribution of the Mg2+-dependent PAP is controlled by hormones and fatty acids (14Pittner R.A. Fears R. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1985; 230: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Taylor S.J. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Incubating adipocytes with insulin increased the proportion of soluble phosphatase activity, whereas incubating the fat cells with norepinephrine or fatty acids, such as palmitic or oleic acid, increased the proportion of activity that fractionated with intracellular membranes upon centrifugation (15Taylor S.J. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The membrane-associated phosphatase has been proposed to be the form that is active in TAG synthesis (16Brindley D.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1984; 23: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); however, there is not a strict relationship between rates of TAG synthesis and membrane association of the phosphatase in adipocytes (15Taylor S.J. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fatty acids directly inhibit PAP activity in vitro (17Elabbadi N. Day C.P. Virden R. Yeaman S.J. Lipids. 2002; 37: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Moller F. Green P. Harkness E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 486: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It would be premature to conclude that the activities that have been measured in different subcellular fractions are due to lipin, since other PAP enzymes exist. Overexpressed green fluorescent protein-tagged lipin has been detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of HEK 293 cells (4Peterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar); however, information on the subcellular localization of the lipin protein is limited. The mechanisms involved in the control of lipin are still poorly defined. In previous 32P-labeling experiments, we discovered that lipin was phosphorylated in a rapamycin-sensitive manner in response to insulin in rat adipocytes (5Huffman T.A. Mothe-Satney I. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), indicating that lipin was a target of the mTOR signaling pathway. The present study was conducted to investigate control of the activity and phosphorylation of lipin. Animals—Mice homozygous for the fld allele were generated by mating heterozygous BALB/cByJ-fld/+ mice (Jackson Laboratories). Five-month-old wild type and fld/fld progeny from this cross were used in experiments. Where indicated, some of the mice were fasted overnight. Otherwise, the mice were allowed free access to food and water. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts in 10-cm diameter plates were differentiated into adipocytes (19Harris T.E. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Rhoads R.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Adipocytes were used 7-14 days after adding the differentiation medium. For experiments, the culture medium was replaced with 145 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm sodium phosphate, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Adipocytes were then incubated at 37 °C with insulin or other additions as indicated. 293T cells were cultured and as described previously (20McMahon L.P. Choi K.M. Lin T.A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence J.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7428-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Extract Preparation—Incubations were terminated by rinsing with chilled phosphate-buffered saline (145 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and then immediately homogenizing the cells (1.0 ml of buffer per 10-cm diameter dish) in a glass tissue grinder with a Teflon pestle driven at 1,000 rpm. Homogenization buffer was composed of Buffer A (50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium phosphate, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μm microcystin, and, where indicated, 1% Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40. Unless otherwise stated, homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were retained for analyses. Subcellular Fractionations—3T3-L1 adipocytes were fractionated by slight modification of the method described by Piper et al. (21Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each treatment, a 10-cm-diameter plate of cells was rinsed in PBS before the cells were homogenized as described above except in 1 ml of Buffer B (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellets containing plasma membranes, mitochondria, and nuclei were retained. The supernatants were centrifuged at 175,000 × g for 1 h. The high speed supernatants containing soluble proteins were collected, and the pellets containing microsomes were suspended in 1 ml of Buffer B. Measurements of PAP Activities—[32P]Phosphatidic acid was purified by thin layer chromatography after using [γ-32P]ATP and Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase to phosphorylate 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol (22Carman G.M. Lin Y.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PAP activity was determined by using a modification of the method of Carman and Lin (22Carman G.M. Lin Y.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to measure [32P]phosphate release from [32P]phosphatidic acid. Briefly, samples of cell or tissue extracts (5 μl), subcellular fractions (5 μl), or immune complexes (10 μl) were added to reaction mixtures (100 μl) containing 1 mm Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm [32P]phosphatidic acid (10,000 cpm/nmol), 50 mm Tris-maleate (pH 7.0), and either no added Mg2+ or 2 mm MgCl2 as described below. After 20 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding 0.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl in methanol. [32P]phosphate was extracted by vigorous mixing after adding 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of 1 m MgCl2. The [32P]phosphate in 0.5 ml of the aqueous phase was determined by scintillation counting. With tissue extract samples (see Fig. 1) or subcellular fractions of cells (see Fig. 7), Mg2+-dependent PAP activity was determined by subtracting activity measured in the absence of MgCl2 from activity measured in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. To determine PAP activities attributable to overexpressed lipin proteins in extract samples (see Fig. 2), reaction mixtures were supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2, and the activities from cells transfected with a control plasmid were subtracted from the activities from cells overexpressing lipin. For lipin immune complexes (see Fig. 6), PAP activities were routinely measured only in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. Results of control experiments revealed that PAP activity in these complexes was negligible without MgCl2. 4T. E. Harris and J. C. Lawrence, Jr., unpublished observations. FIGURE 7Changes in lipin phosphorylation produced by insulin, epinephrine, and oleic acid are associated with redistribution of lipin between soluble and membrane-bound forms. A, 3T3-L1 adipocytes (10-cm plate/treatment) were incubated for 2 h as follows: no additions (C), 10 milliunits/ml insulin for the last 60 min (I), 20 nm rapamycin for 120 min (R), and rapamycin for 60 min followed by insulin plus rapamycin for 60 min (RI). Cells were homogenized in 1 ml of Buffer B, and a pellet fraction containing nuclei, mitochondria, and plasma membranes was prepared by centrifuging the homogenates at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The 16,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 175,000 × g for 1 h to obtain a supernatant fraction containing soluble proteins and a pellet fraction containing microsomal membranes, which were suspended in 1 ml of Buffer B. Samples (40 μl) of the fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and lipin immunoblots were prepared. B, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated without additions (C), with decreasing concentrations (1 mm, 330 μm, and 100 μm) of oleic acid (O) or with 10 μm epinephrine (E). After 30 min, fractions containing soluble and microsomal proteins were isolated, and a lipin immunoblot was prepared. C and D, adipocytes were incubated without additions and with insulin and rapamycin as described in A. In addition, cells were incubated as follows: 330 μm oleic acid (O) for the last 30 min, insulin for 30 min followed by insulin plus oleic acid for the final 30 min (IO), 10 μm epinephrine (E) for the last 30 min, and insulin for 30 min followed by insulin plus epinephrine for the final 30 min (IE).

A, 293T cells were transfected with a control plasmid (V) or with pcDNA3 constructs encoding HA epitope-tagged forms of wild type lipin 1b (1b), lipin 1a (1a), lipin 1b with the fld2j mutation (R84), or lipin 1b with a mutation in the PAP active site (E712). After 24 h, the cells were homogenized in Buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100, and extract samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. A representative HA immunoblot of the lipin proteins is presented. PAP activities were measured in cell extracts in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. After subtracting the activity from cells transfected with control plasmid, PAP activities were corrected for HA-lipin expression, estimated from HA immunoblots. The results are expressed relative to the activity of lipin 1b (6.8 ± 2.5 nmol/min/10-cm plate of cells) and are mean values ± S.E. from five experiments. B, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3 constructs encoding lipin 1b, lipin 1b lacking the NH2-terminal 106 amino acids (Δ106), and lipin 1b proteins lacking the COOH-terminal 283 (1-641), 103 (1-821), 52 (1-872), or 15 (1-909) amino acids. PAP activities attributable to the overexpressed lipin were measured and expressed relative to the activity of lipin 1b (6.84 ± 3.4 nmol/min/10-cm plate of cells) as described in A.

After homogenizing cells in 1 ml of Buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100, lipin was immunoprecipitated from extracts by using LAb-1. Immune complexes were washed four times and suspended in 100 μl of a solution containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Samples (50 μl) of the suspension were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min without or with 1.25 μg/ml purified recombinant catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1α (PP1C). Next, the beads were washed with 1 ml of Buffer A plus 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 μm microcystin and then suspended in 100 μl of Buffer B. A, samples (40 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were prepared to detect Ser(P)106 and lipin. B, PAP activities associated with the beads (10-μl suspensions) were measured in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. In three experiments, the activity in control cells averaged 18.9 ± 2.6 nmol/min/10-cm plate.

This was accomplished by dividing PAP activity by the relative amount of lipin estimated from lipin immunoblots. Generation of cDNA Constructs Encoding Lipin Proteins— cDNA encoding lipin 1b (accession number AF412811) flanked by EcoRI sites was generated by PCR using PFU Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and appropriately designed primers. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and introduced into the EcoRI site of pBluescript to generate pBluescriptlipin 1b. Next a DNA fragment encoding a triple HA epitope tag was excised from pKH3 (23Mattingly R.R. Sorisky A. Brann M.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7943-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) by using EcoRI and SalI and inserted between the EcoRI site upstream of the lipin coding region and the SalI site of pBluescriptlipin 1b. The resulting pBluescriptHA-lipin 1b was then cut with NotI and KpnI, and the fragment containing HA-lipin was introduced between the NotI and KpnI sites of pcDNA3 to generate pcDNA3HAlb. cDNAs encoding lipin proteins having point mutations were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of pcDNA3HAlb by using a QuikChange II kit (Stratagene). Deletion constructs were generated by using PCR and appropriate primers. All constructs were cassette-subcloned, and the mutated fragments were sequenced and found to be free of errors. Electroporation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes and Transfection of 293T Cells—Adipocytes (4-6 days postdifferentiation) were removed from the culture dishes (150-mm diameter) by incubating with trypsin (0.05%) for 5 min. The cells were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min), rinsed once with Buffer C, and suspended in Buffer C (350 μl/dish), which contained 120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm glutathione, 10 mm potassium phosphate, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6. Cells (350 μl) were added to cuvettes (4 mm) containing 50 μg of the appropriate pcDNA3 plasmid and then electroporated with a single pulse from a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) set at 280 V and 960 microfarads. Transfection efficiency judged by electroporating cells with a vector encoding green fluorescent protein was 40-50%. 293T cells (10-cm plate for each vector) were transfected with pcDNA3 vectors as described previously (19Harris T.E. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Rhoads R.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1659-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Expression of HA-lipin in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes by Adenoviral-mediated Gene Transfer—Viruses for expressing HA-lipin and A106 HA-lipin were prepared using procedures described by He et al. (24He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNAs encoding the HA-tagged lipin 1b proteins were excised with KpnI and NotI from the pBluescript constructs and inserted between the KpnI and NotI sites in the shuttle vector, pAdTrackCMV. The resulting plasmids were cotransformed with the adenoviral backbone plasmid, pAdEasy-1, into BJ5183 bacteria. Recombined plasmids were selected and transfected into HEK 293 cells to generate virus, which was amplified and then purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation to create a high titer viral stock. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected essentially as described by Kotani et al. (25Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of infection judged by expression of green fluorescent protein, which is also encoded by the HA-lipin virus, was ∼50%. The adipocytes were used 40-48 h after infection. Virus encoding β-galactosidase was used as a control. Antibodies—The two lipin antibodies, LAb-1 and LAb-2, prepared by immunizing rabbits with peptide conjugates have been described previously (5Huffman T.A. Mothe-Satney I. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The peptide for LAb-1 corresponded to the sequence between Ser409 and Gly430 in mouse lipin 1b, and that for LAb-2 corresponded to the last 11 amino acids in the protein. Monoclonal antibodies to the HA epitope were purified from culture medium from 12CA5 hybridoma cells. To generate antibodies that specifically recognize lipin phosphorylated in Ser106, rabbits were immunized with the following phosphopeptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin: Cys-Tyr-Leu-Ala-Thr-Ser(P)-Pro-Ile-Leu-Ser-Glu (where Ser(P) represents phosphorylated Ser). To select the phosphospecific antibodies, the serum was first incubated with the nonphosphorylated peptide that had been coupled to SulfoLink resin (Pierce). Next, the fraction that did not bind to the nonphosphorylated peptide resin was incubated with the phosphopeptide coupled to SulfoLink. After washing the column, the phosphospecific antibodies were eluted at pH 2.7, immediately neutralized, and affinity-purified using protein A-agarose. Immunoprecipitations—Adipocyte extract samples (800 μl) were incubated with lipin antibodies (2 μg) bound to protein A-agarose beads (15 μl) or with the anti-HA antibody, 12CA5 (2 μg), bound to protein G-agarose beads (15 μl), at 4 °C for 12 h with constant mixing. As a control for specificity, rabbit or mouse nonimmune IgG was substituted for the lipin antibodies or 12CA5, respectively. The beads were then washed four times with Buffer A supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Electrophoretic Analyses—Protein samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 8.75% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS (30Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sci. STKE. 2003. 2003; : re15Google Scholar). Relative amounts of 32P were determined using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were prepared as described previously (5Huffman T.A. Mothe-Satney I. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), except with different antibodies, and signals were detected by using either film or a CCD camera system (Fujifilm LAS3000). Band intensities were determined by using the volume integration function of Image-Quant (Amersham Biosciences). Mass Spectrometry—After SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue, the band containing lipin was sliced from the gel. In-gel digestion of the protein with trypsin was performed as described previously (26Shevchenko A. Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the resulting peptides was analyzed by nanoflow HPLC coupled to microelectrospray ionization on an LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA) (27Martin S.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Marto J.A. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 4266-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). MS/MS spectra acquired were searched against a human-rat-mouse data base (National Center for Biotechnology Information, available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using SEQUEST (28Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar). Peptide sequence and phosphorylation site assignments and were validated by manual interpretation of the MS/MS spectra.

In conclusion, GBA2 plays a role in cellular glucosylceramide metabolism. In higher eukaryotes, glucosylceramide is the precursor of glycosphingolipids, a complex group of ubiquitous membrane lipids, including gangliosides and globosides. Steady-state levels of these lipids are the result of ongoing synthesis and degradation. A well defined pathway for their degradation is the intra-lysosomal stepwise removal of terminal carbohydrate moieties. The penultimate product of this catabolic pathway is glucosylceramide that subsequently is converted to free glucose and ceramide by the action of the lysosomal acid β-glucosidase, named glucocerebrosidase (EC 3.2.1.45). The importance of intra-lysosomal glycosphingolipid catabolism is illustrated by the existence of inherited lysosomal storage disorders in which specific glycosphingolipids accumulate as the consequence of an inherited defect in some lysosomal glycosidases (1Neufeld E.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Deficiency of glucocerebrosidase is the cause for the most common lysosomal storage disorder named Gaucher disease (2Barranger J.A. Ginns E.I. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1677-1698Google Scholar, 3Beutler E. Grabowski G.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3635-3668Google Scholar). This disorder is characterized by the accumulation of glucosylceramide laden tissue macrophages (Gaucher cells). In most other cell types of Gaucher patients, despite a severe deficiency in glucocerebrosidase activity, no obvious accumulation of glucosylceramide is notable. This finding points to the existence of an alternative catabolic pathway (2Barranger J.A. Ginns E.I. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1989: 1677-1698Google Scholar, 3Beutler E. Grabowski G.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3635-3668Google Scholar). Indeed, a glucosylceramidase distinct to glucocerebrosidase has been detected in various tissues and cell types (4Van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The activity of this enzyme, named non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase (NLGase), 2The abbreviations used are: NLGase, non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase; CBE, conduritol B epoxide; DNM, deoxynojirimycin; AMP-DNM, N-(5-adamantane-1-yl-methoxy)pentyl-DNM; DNJ, deoxynojirimycin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; 4-MU, 4-methylumbelliferyl; RNAi, RNA interference; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GBA1–3, β-glucosidases 1–3; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; C6-NBD-glucosylceramide, 6-[N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3 diazol-4-yl)amino-dodecanoyl]sphingosyl-β-d-glucoside; PC, phosphatidylcholine. is not deficient in patients with Gaucher disease and is not located in lysosomes but near the cell surface (4Van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Contrary to glucocerebrosidase, this enzyme behaves as an integral membrane protein. It also differs from glucocerebrosidase in enzymatic features like specificity toward artificial substrates and inhibitors (4Van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Overkleeft H.S. Renkema G.H. Neele J. Vianello P. Hung I.O. Strijland A. van der Burg A.M. Koomen G.J. Pandit U.K. Aerts J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26522-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For example, NLGase is not able to hydro-lyze artificial β-xylosidic substrates, contrary to glucocerebrosidase. Another striking difference in this respect is the irreversible inhibition of glucocerebrosidase by conduritol B epoxide (CBE) and the relative insensitivity of NLGase for this compound. NLGase is extremely sensitive to inhibition by hydrophobic deoxynojirimycin (DNM) analogues (5Overkleeft H.S. Renkema G.H. Neele J. Vianello P. Hung I.O. Strijland A. van der Burg A.M. Koomen G.J. Pandit U.K. Aerts J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26522-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The IC50 for N-(5-adamantane-1-yl-methoxy)pentyl-DNM (AMPDNM) is ∼1 nm (5Overkleeft H.S. Renkema G.H. Neele J. Vianello P. Hung I.O. Strijland A. van der Burg A.M. Koomen G.J. Pandit U.K. Aerts J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26522-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The two enzymes also differ in response to hydrophobic agents. Glucocerebrosidase is potently stimulated by negatively charged bile salts and phospholipids, whereas NLGase is not. The enzymatic activity of NLGase in membranes is completely lost upon exposure to various kinds of detergents (4Van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This inactivation has seriously hampered the attempts to purify the enzyme. Suitable conditions for re-activation of detergent-solubilized NLGase could not be established. So far the only tools for studying NLGase were very sensitive, low nanomolar inhibitors consisting of N-alkylated deoxynojirimycins linked to a large hydrophobic moiety such as adamantane or cholesterol (5Overkleeft H.S. Renkema G.H. Neele J. Vianello P. Hung I.O. Strijland A. van der Burg A.M. Koomen G.J. Pandit U.K. Aerts J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26522-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is relevant to note that the enzyme is also inhibited by N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (N-butyl-DNJ, IC50 200 nm). This compound is a recently registered drug (Zavesca, Actelion) for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease (6Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cox T. Lachmann R. Hollak C. Aerts J. van Weely S. Hrebicek M. Platt F. Butters T. Dwek R. Moyses C. Gow I. Elstein D.

The therapeutic action of Zavesca is ascribed to its ability to inhibit the synthesis of glucosylceramide by glucosylceramide synthase (IC50 50–80 μm) (6Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So-called substrate reduction therapy of Gaucher disease implies chronic administration of Zavesca (100 mg three times daily), resulting in average plasma concentrations of ∼5 μm. Such concentrations of N-butyl-DNJ should only partially inhibit glucosylcer-amide synthase but completely abolish NLGase activity (5Overkleeft H.S. Renkema G.H. Neele J. Vianello P. Hung I.O.

In view of this, increased insight into the physiological relevance of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase is of additional interest. Here we describe that the GBA2 gene encodes the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. The identification of the corresponding gene offers novel tools to study the physiological importance of extra-lysosomal glucosylceramide catabolism. During the final preparation of the manuscript Yildiz and coworkers reported that GBA2 knock-out mice are deficient in a glucosylceramidase activity (9Yildiz Y. Matern H. Thompson B. Allegood J.C. Warren R.L. Ramirez D.M. Hammer R.E. Hamra F.K. Matern S. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2985-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). They elegantly demonstrated that GBA2 deficiency results in impaired spermatogenesis in mice and hypothesize that GBA2 might be responsible for the non-lysosomal glucocerebrosidase activity reported by us in the 1990s. Our results are completely in line with this hypothesis. Cloning—The complete open reading frames for klotho (NM_153683.2), KLPH/LCTH (NM_207338.1), β-klotho (NM_175737.2), and GBA2 (human NM_020944.2, mouse NM_172692.1) were amplified from human and mouse tissue, using specific primers containing restriction sites and an extended Kozak sequence in front of the start codon. PCR products were subsequently cloned in the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and their sequence were verified. For expression studies in mammalian cells the appropriate fragments were subcloned in pCDNA-3.1 (Invitrogen) using the added restriction sites. Fusion proteins, containing the complete GBA2 fused to Myc/His, were generated by cloning the full-length cDNA of GBA2 without stop codon in-frame with the Myc/His sequence of pCDNA3.1-Myc/His (A+, Invitrogen). Fusion proteins containing the complete GBA2 fused to either the C terminus or the N terminus of GFP were generated by cloning of the full-length GBA2, with or without stop codon (depending on the site of the GFP fusion) in the pEGFP-N3 or pEGFP-C3 vectors (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A di-leucine motif close to the transmembrane in GBA2 was changed to a di-alanine motif by PCR with a primer that contained the changed codons. A unique HindIII site upstream of the mutated codons allowed subsequent exchange of the sequence verified mutated PCR fragment with the wild-type GBA2 rendering a full-length GBA2 with the mutated di-ala-nine motif. Transient Transfections—Transient transfection experiments in either COS-7 cells or the mouse melanoma cell-line MEB-4 were performed using Fugene-6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Enzyme Activity Assays—As convenient source of enzyme, water extracts of Gaucher disease spleens were generated by homogenization of 10 g of tissue in 30 ml of water (4 °C) using an Ultra-Turrax and sonication followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 × g. Membrane suspensions were prepared by resuspending the pellet in 30 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 5.8) and centrifugation (15 min, 15,000 × g). This procedure was repeated two times. The activity of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase with the artificial 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-glucoside (4-MU-β-glucoside, Sigma) substrate, and the natural substrate was determined as described previously (4Van Weely S.

Briefly, either membrane suspension, total cellular lysate, or intact cells were incubated with 3.7 mm 4-MU-β-glucoside in McIlvaine buffer (0.1 m cit-rate and 0.2 m phosphate buffer), pH 5.8, with or without pre-incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with 1 mm CBE (Sigma) to inhibit the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase. Assays were incubated at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of glycine/NaOH (pH 10.6). The amount of liberated 4-MU was determined with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS30 fluorometer. 6-[N-Methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3 diazol-4-yl)aminododecanoyl]sphingosyl-β-d-glucoside (C6-NBD-glucosylceramide) was synthesized exactly as described (5Overkleeft H.S.

Briefly, cells were preincubated with or without 1 mm CBE for 30 min, washed, and incubated for the indicated time in 500 μl of medium with or without 1 mm CBE and 1 nmol of C6-NBD-glucosylceramide. The cells were harvested followed by lipid extraction, and separation by thin-layer chromatography (11van Weely S. van Leeuwen M.B. Jansen I.D.C. de Bruijn M.A.C. Brouwer-Kelder E. Schram A.W.

RNA Interference—Suitable 21-mer sequences for RNA interference were selected using the mouse GBA2 sequence and the Reynolds algorithm (12Reynolds A. Leake D. Boese Q. Scaringe S. Marshall W.S. Khvorova A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Subsequently oligonucleotides were ordered (RNAi1, 5′-GATCCCGGGAAGGACCTGAACCTGAAGAAGCTTGTTCAGGTTCAGGTCCTTCCTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAAAAAGGAAGGACCTGAACCTGAACAAGCTTCTTCAGGTTCAGGTCCTTCCCGG-3′; RNAi2, 5′-GATCCCGGTCATTGCAGACCAATTTAGAAGCTTGTAAATTGGTCTGCAATGACTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAAAAAGTCATTGCAGACCAATTTACAAGCTTCTAAATTGGTCTGCAATGACCGG-3′; and RNAi3, 5′-GATCCCGGATCATGTTTGGAGCTAAAGAAGCTTGTTTAGCTCCAAACATGATCTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAAAAAGATCATGTTTGGAGCTAAACAAGCTTCTTTAGCTCCAAACATGATCCGG-3′) annealed and cloned into the GeneEraser short hairpin vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For RNAi experiments the short hairpins were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells co-transfected with the mouse GBA2-Myc for analysis of activity toward the mouse GBA2. This was followed by analysis of enzyme activity and protein expression using Western blot and the anti-Myc antibody compared with a negative short hairpin-expressing cells. For RNAi on endogenous GBA2 the short hairpins were transiently expressed in the mouse melanoma cell line MEB-4 followed by analysis of enzyme activity using the 4-MU-β-glucoside substrate, and enzyme levels were compared to negative short hairpin-expressing cells. Subcellular Localization—GBA2-GFP or GFP-GBA2 fusion proteins or GFP alone was/were expressed in COS-7 cells grown on coverslips. Living cells were subsequently analyzed using Confocal laser scanning microscopy on a Leica instrument (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Protease Protection—For protease protection experiments intact COS-7 cells expressing GBA2-GFP or GFP-GBA2 fusion proteins were treated with increasing concentrations of Proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) ranging from 0 to 10 mg/ml for 40 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding a saturated phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride solution (1:100), followed by sample buffer. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody 1:2500 (AbCam, Cambridge, UK) was employed to detect the protected fragments.

Briefly, COS-7 cells expressing Myc-tagged GBA2 were homogenized at 4 °C with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 or 1% (v/v) Brij-35 or 1% (v/v) Lubrol in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl), supplemented with mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysate was adjusted to 80% sucrose in MES-buffered saline, overlaid with a 30–5% sucrose step gradient, and centrifuged for 18 h at 36,000 rpm in a Kontron TST41.14 rotor at 4 °C. Subsequently, for SDS-PAGE, either equal volumes from gradient fractions were used, or protein concentrations were first quantified to determine the volume required for 10 μg of protein. Western blot analysis was performed by transfer of protein to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Primary antibodies, anti-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) or anti-Cav-1 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ) as positive DRM control were used at 1:5000 and 1:2500 dilutions, respectively, for detection of the aforementioned proteins. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) were used in combination with a chemiluminescent substrate.

The crude hemiaminal intermediate was reduced with lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran to provide the 1,5-aminoalcohol, which was cyclized (17Bernotas R.C. Cube R.V. Tetrahedron Lett. 1991; 32: 161-164Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) under Mitsunobu conditions. The benzyl protecting groups in the cyclized product were removed by palladium on charcoal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis in the presence of hydrochloric acid to provide N-butyl-1,5-dideoxy-1,5-imino-xylitol. The initial synthetic steps for the preparation of N-[5-(adamantan-1-ylmethoxy)pentyl]-1,5-dideoxy-1,5-iminoxylitol were analogous to the steps described above but employing allylamine in the synthesis of the hemiaminal. After Mitsunobu-mediated cyclization, the allyl group of the endocyclic amine was isomerized and cleaved by heating in Me2SO with potassium butoxide (18Gigg R. Conant R. J. Carbohydr.

For inhibitor analysis, cellular extracts were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of the DNM-type inhibitors, and activity was measured as described above in the presence of the inhibitor. Enzyme activities were related to those in the absence of the inhibitors. Selection of Candidate Genes Coding β-Glucosidases—Attempts to conventionally purify NLGase all failed by the instability of detergent-solubilized enzyme. We therefore analyzed potential β-glucosidase genes as candidate genes for the enzyme (Table 1). NLGase could belong to family 1 of glycosyl hydrolases (www.cazy.org/CAZY/fam/acc_GH.html). This family includes cytosolic β-glucosidase (GBA3, Unigene: Hs.371763), lactase phlorizin hydrolase (Unigene: Hs.551506), klotho (Unigene: Hs.524953), β-klotho (Unigene: Hs.90756), and klotho-lactase phlorizin hydrolase like (Unigene: Hs.585062). The former two enzymes are known to not be identical to NLGase. We cloned and expressed the latter three β-glucosidase-like cDNAs. None of the gene products showed β-glucosidase activity when measured with 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-glucoside (not shown). These negative results led us to consider another known β-glucosidase, the so-called bile acid β-glucosidase (GBA2, Unigene: Hs.443134) (24Matern H. Gartzen R. Matern S.

Initially GBA2 was excluded as a candidate, because it had been reported that this enzyme is expressed specifically in the liver, is inactive toward glucosylceramide, and is sensitive toward CBE, all features clearly distinct from those of NLGase (4Van Weely S.

https://openalex.org/W2064263380,"Transglutaminase 2 (TG2, a.k.a. tissue transglutaminase) belongs to a family of transglutaminase enzymes that stabilize proteins by affecting covalent crosslinking via formation of amide bonds. Cell surface TG2 is directly involved as an adhesive receptor in cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Here, we show that TG2 activity is elevated in glioblastomas compared with non-neoplastic brain. Immunofluorescent studies showed increased staining of fibronectin colocalized with TG2 in the ECM in glioblastomas. In addition, small clusters of invading human glioblastoma cells present in non-neoplastic brain parenchyma secrete high levels of TG2 and fibronectin that distinguish them from normal brain stroma. Downregulation of TG2 in U87MG glioblastoma cells with RNAi demonstrated decreased assembly of fibronectin in the ECM. Treatment with KCC009 blocked the remodeling of fibronectin in the ECM in glioblastomas in both in vitro and in vivo studies. KCC009 treatment in mice harboring orthotopic glioblastomas (DBT-FG) sensitized the tumors to N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea chemotherapy, as measured by reduced bioluminescence, increased apoptosis and prolonged survival. The ability of KCC009 to interfere with the permissive remodeling of fibronectin in the ECM in glioblastomas suggests a novel target to enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy directed not only at the tumor mass, but also invading glioblastoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2002373536,"Chronic therapy with nitroglycerin results in a rapid development of nitrate tolerance, which is associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species. We have recently shown that mitochondria are an important source of nitroglycerin-induced oxidants and that the nitroglycerin-bioactivating mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase is oxidatively inactivated in the setting of tolerance. Here we investigated the effect of various oxidants on aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and its restoration by dihydrolipoic acid. In vivo tolerance in Wistar rats was induced by infusion of nitroglycerin (6.6 microg/kg/min, 4 days). Vascular reactivity was measured by isometric tension studies of isolated aortic rings in response to nitroglycerin. Chronic nitroglycerin infusion lead to impaired vascular responses to nitroglycerin and decreased dehydrogenase activity, which was corrected by dihydrolipoic acid co-incubation. Superoxide, peroxynitrite, and nitroglycerin itself were highly efficient in inhibiting mitochondrial and yeast aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, which was restored by dithiol compounds such as dihydrolipoic acid and dithiothreitol. Hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide were rather insensitive inhibitors. Our observations indicate that mitochondrial oxidative stress (especially superoxide and peroxynitrite) in response to organic nitrate treatment may inactivate aldehyde dehydrogenase thereby leading to nitrate tolerance. Glutathionylation obviously amplifies oxidative inactivation of the enzyme providing another regulatory pathway. Furthermore, the present data demonstrate that the mitochondrial dithiol compound dihydrolipoic acid restores mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase activity via reduction of a disulfide at the active site and thereby improves nitrate tolerance."

https://openalex.org/W2058674722,"In islet β-cells and INS-1 cells both the high activity of malic enzyme and the correlation of insulin secretion rates with pyruvate carboxylase (PC) flux suggest that a pyruvate-malate cycle is functionally relevant to insulin secretion. Expression of the malic enzyme isoforms in INS-1 cells and rat islets was measured, and small interfering RNA was used to selectively reduce isoform mRNA expression in INS-1 cells to evaluate its impact on insulin secretion. The cytosolic NADP+-specific isoform (ME1) was the most abundant, with the mitochondrial isoforms NAD+-preferred (ME2) expressed at ∼50%, and the NADP+-specific (ME3) at ∼10% compared with ME1. Selective reduction (89 ± 2%) of cytosolic ME1 mRNA expression and enzyme activity significantly reduced glucose (15 mm:41 ± 6%, p < 0.01) and amino acid (4 mm glutamine ± 10 mm leucine: 39 ± 6%, p < 0.01)-stimulated insulin secretion. Selective small interfering RNA reduction (51 ± 6%) of mitochondrial ME2 mRNA expression did not impact glucose-induced insulin secretion, but decreased amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion by 25 ± 4% (p < 0.01). Modeling of the metabolism of [U-13C]glucose by its isotopic distribution in glutamate indicates a second pool of pyruvate distinct from glycolytically derived pyruvate in INS-1 cells. ME1 knockdown decreased flux of both pools of pyruvate through PC. In contrast, ME2 knockdown affected only PC flux of the pyruvate derived from glutamate metabolism. These results suggest a physiological basis for two metabolically and functionally distinct pyruvate cycles. The cycling of pyruvate by ME1 generates cytosolic NADPH, whereas mitochondrial ME2 responds to elevated amino acids and serves to supply sufficient pyruvate for increased Krebs cycle flux when glucose is limiting.

It is now generally accepted that in addition to the key role of the ratio of ATP to ADP on closure of the ATP-dependent K+-channel, other metabolically derived second messengers are needed to promote insulin secretion from pancreatic islet β-cells. Many of these second messengers are believed to result from the export of the Krebs cycle intermediates from the mitochondria to the cytosol (1MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Brown L.J. Hasan N.M.

Non-canonical (i.e. KATP independent)-stimulated insulin secretion via mitochondria-derived second messengers has received intensive effort with evidence in support of several candidate metabolites stimulating insulin exocytosis (1MacDonald M.J.

Alternatively, a passive role for PC flux can be envisioned. The tight coupling of insulin secretion and plasma glucose concentration from the β-cell is dependant on the directly proportional increase in glycolytic flux (14Matschinsky F.M. Liang Y. Kesavan P. Wang L. Froguel P. Velho G. Cohen D. Permutt M.A. Tanizawa Y. Jetton T.L. Niswender K. Magnuson M.A. J. Clin.

However, because the β-cell lacks any appreciable capacity to either store the excess glucose as glycogen or eliminate it as lactate, the increased glycolytic flux would lead to feedback inhibition unless energy demand increases at the same pace as input (9Schuit F. De Vos A. Farfari S. Moens K. Pipeleers D. Brun T. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18572-18579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Ishihara H. Wang H. Drewes L.R. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Substrate cycling mediated through PC would provide an alternative mechanism to dissipate the increased glycolytic flux, thereby preventing feedback inhibition and allowing the β-cell to be metabolically responsive to changes in plasma glucose concentrations. Malate represents one of the principle Krebs cycle intermediates exported from the mitochondria to the cytosol, where malic enzyme can then regenerate pyruvate from malate for cycling back to the mitochondria (5MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Cells, in contrast to the liver, do not express phospho-enol-pyruvate carboxykinase and pyruvate cycling can only occur as the result of malic enzyme activity (17MacDonald M.J. Chang C.-M. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18MacDonald M.J. McKenzie D.I. Walker T.M. Kaysen J.H. Horm. Metab. Res. 1992; 24: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The relatively high activity of both PC and cytosolic malic enzyme can support a robust rate of pyruvate cycling, and this cycle has been hypothesized to be a necessary component of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (5MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39163-39168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A pyruvate cycle mediated by PC and cytosolic malic enzyme occurs at the expense of one ATP, but leads to the exchange of reducing equivalents from mitochondrial NADH to cytosolic NADPH. The shift in redox state toward increased concentration of NADPH with increased pyruvate cycling may couple increased mitochondrial activity with downstream events in the cytosol leading to insulin secretion (16Ishihara H. Wang H. Drewes L.R. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Ashcroft S.J.H. Christie M.R. Biochem.

Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). There also exists the potential for an alternative pyruvate cycle within the mitochondrial matrix via a mitochondrial localized isoform of malic enzyme. In mammalian cells, three isoforms of malic enzyme are known. In addition to the cytosolic NADP+-dependent isoform, malic enzyme 1 (ME1), two mitochondrial isoforms exist: malic enzyme 2 (ME2) with a preference for NAD+, and an NADP+-dependent malic enzyme 3 (ME3). Less well established is the potential for the mitochondrial isoforms, ME2 and ME3, to play a role in fuel-stimulated insulin secretion because mitochondrial malic enzyme activity will not provide an avenue for any exchange of reducing equivalents or other substrates from the mitochondria to the cytosol. Mandella and Sauer (22Mandella R.D. Sauer L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5877-5884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) characterized the enzymatic properties of the mitochondrial isoforms, and suggested that the high Km value of ME2 for malate and NAD+ will minimize the conversion of malate to pyruvate under conditions of ample pyruvate supply, but will provide an alternative source of pyruvate from fumarate precursors such as glutamine when glycolytic flux is low (22Mandella R.D. Sauer L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5877-5884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brain and tumor cells, mitochondrial malic enzyme utilizes glutamine as a respiratory fuel by shunting glutamate-derived malate toward the formation of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA (23Moreadith R.W. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6215-6221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bakken I.J. Sonnewald U. Clark J.B. Bates T.E. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The combination of glutamine and leucine is equipotent to glucose for stimulating insulin exocytosis in vitro (12Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Nature. 1980; 288: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 13Li C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I.B. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2853-2858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and mitochondrial malic enzyme may be utilized by the β-cell to couple amino acid metabolism with insulin secretion. To provide further insight into the apparent requirement of PC flux and pyruvate cycling in fuel-stimulated insulin secretion, we have measured the relative expression levels of the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of malic enzyme in 832/13 INS-1 cells and rat islets. Prior experimental evidence implicating pyruvate cycling as a key regulator of insulin secretion has been deduced from modeling studies, activation of one arm of the cycle, or from small molecule inhibitors of malate transport (11Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 25MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, these methods do not clearly differentiate the roles of PC flux from pyruvate cycling, nor can they distinguish cytosolic from mitochondrial pyruvate cycling. In this article, we report the results of selective reduction of cytosolic ME1 and mitochondrial ME2 isoforms, and hence pyruvate cycling in INS-1 cells. These experiments allow direct determination of the impact on both insulin secretion and rates of anaplerotic flux from the 1) reduction in pyruvate cycling between cytosol and mitochondria catalyzed by ME1, distinct from 2) reduced pyruvate cycling confined to the mitochondria catalyzed by ME2. Cell Culture—Initial stocks of clonal INS-1 832/13 cells were provided by Dr. Christopher Newgard (Duke University) (26Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Reiger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Cells were determined to be mycoplasma-free (Cambrex, Mycoalert), and cultured as monolayers in RPMI 1640 complete medium with 11.1 mm d-glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, antibiotics (10,000 units/ml penicillin and 10 mg/ml streptomycin), 10 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mecaptoethanol. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Cells were cultured into 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells per well and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of humidified 5% CO2, 95% air for 3 days to reach 50% confluence for transfection. The INS-1 cells were maintained for 2 additional days post-transfection to reach 80–100% confluence for mRNA knock-down analysis and insulin secretion assays. Although INS-1 832/13 cells differ from pancreatic β-cells in some aspects of glucose metabolism (16Ishihara H. Wang H. Drewes L.R. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we, and others, have shown that many of the mechanisms coupling metabolism with insulin secretion are similar to islet β-cells. Significantly for this study, mitochondrial oxidation, anaplerosis, and as we show here, malic enzyme activity are similar in INS-1 cells and rat pancreatic islets (3Prentki M. Vischer S.

Construction of Small Interfering RNAs to Silence Malic Enzyme Expression—21-Nucleotide siRNA sequences targeting the specific malic enzyme genes for each of the three rat malic enzyme isoforms were constructed using the NCBI sequencing data base and synthesized using Qiagen's custom siRNA facility. The NCBI accession numbers used to design the targets and primers are rat ME1, NM_012600; rat ME2, XM_001053085; and rat ME3, XM_341880. siRNAs for two different regions of each isoform were constructed for analysis of effective mRNA knockdown. BLAST analysis was used to verify that each sequence had no significant homology to any other known gene. The siRNA duplex consisted of the sense strand and its complementary antisense strand to provide a 2-nucleotide dithymidine overhang at each 3′ terminus. siRNAs were synthesized by Qiagen with 19-base pair ribonucleic acid sequences with 5′ dideoxythymidine overhangs of the following sequences (“a” and “b” designate our siRNA constructs for each malic enzyme isoform): ME1a, AACCAGGAGATCCAGGTCCTT and ME1b, AAGCCAAGAGGCCTCTTTATC; ME2a, AACGGCTTGCTAGTTAAGGGC and ME2b, AAAGCCATGGCCGCTATCAAC. Duplexes were resuspended and annealed as per the manufacturer's recommendation. Similar results were obtained with either siRNA for each isoform. siRNA Knockdown of Malic Enzyme Isoforms—siRNA transfection constructs were made using the RNAiFect Transfection Reagent kit (Qiagen). Once the INS-1 cells reached 50% confluence in a 6-well plate, media was replaced with 1 ml of Opti-MEM with Glutamax (Invitrogen) transfection media. Each well was then treated with the transfection complex consisting of 6 μl of 20 μm stock siRNA, 9 μl of Qiagen RNAiFect reagent, and 100 μl of RNAiFect buffer, and then incubated at 37 °C for ∼6 h. The transfected 6-well plates were then incubated in RPMI as described above. Insulin secretion in response to glucose or amino acid stimulation was performed 48 h after transfection. A non-silencing fluorescent siRNA (Qiagen, Alexa Fluor) had no effect on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, or mRNA expression of ME1, ME2, or ME3. Thus, the observed effects of ME1 and ME2 knockdown using siRNA were not due to nonspecific effects of siRNA transfection. Transfection efficiency was estimated from fluorescent-labeled siRNA and was apparent from 24 to 72 h post-transfection with optimal transfection efficiency at 48 h. Transfection efficiency was estimated to be over 90% (data not shown). Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis of Malic Enzyme Isoforms—Cells were extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) from 6-well plates that had been set aside for RNA and were not used for the substrate stimulation. RNA was reverse transcribed (Stratagene, Stratoscript RT) to cDNA on a PTC-100 Thermocycler (Bio-Rad). Forward and reverse sequence primers (KECK facility, Yale University) and fluorescent-labeled internal probes (Applied Biosystems, TaqMan) were designed specifically for each malic enzyme isoform and normalized to actin. Sequences for primers and probes used were: ME1, 5′-ATGGAGAAGGAAGGTTTATCAAAG-3′ and 5′-GGCTTCTAGGTTCTTCATTTCTT-3′, internal probe, FAM-GGGCGTGCTTCTCTCACAGAAGA-TAMRA; ME2, 5′-GGCTTTAGCTGTTATTCTCTGTGA-3′ and 5′-TGAATATTAGCAAGTGATGGGTAAA-3, internal probe, FAM-CCCGACACATCAGTGACACCGTTTTAMRA; ME3, 5′-AGATAAGTTCGGAATAAATTGCCT-3′ and 5′-CATCATTGAACATGCAGTATTTGT-3′, internal probe, FAM-GACTTTGCCAATGCCAATGCCTTC-TAMRA; actin, 5′-CCAGATCATGTTTGAGACCTTC-3′ and 5′-CATGAGGTAGTCTGTCAGGTCC-3′, internal probe, VIC-AGCCATGTACGTAGCCATCCAGGCT-TAMRA. Quantitative real-time PCR (Bio-Rad) using Quantitect PCR reagent (Qiagen) was evaluated using the Opticon 2 Monitor analysis software version 2.02 provided by MJ Research. Reaction efficiencies were determined to be greater than 98.7% for actin, ME1, ME2, and ME3. Cytosolic NADP+-dependent Malic Enzyme 1 Activity–Fresh INS-1 cell extracts from the malic enzyme isoform knock-down studies were analyzed for malic enzyme activity. NADP+-dependent malic enzyme was measured spectrophotometrically (340 nm) at 32 °C in a 96-well plate (250 μl/well). The assay was performed under the following reaction conditions: pH 7.4, 100 mm Tris/HCl, 1.0 mm MnCl2, 1.0 mm NH4Cl, 100 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NADP (freshly prepared), and 10 mm l-malate. All cell samples were run in duplicate with or without malate as substrate for test and control conditions, respectively. Cell extracts were added to all of the wells last, immediately shaken, and the absorbance read every 1 min for 40 min. Enzyme activity was determined by subtracting the activity of the control wells for each sample from the test wells run with l-malate. The resulting slopes of absorbance versus time were averaged and normalized to protein content. Mitochondrial NAD+ Preferred Malic Enzyme 2 Activity–Mitochondria were isolated by a modification of methods previously described (27Kowluru A. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, INS-1 cells were grown to 80–100% confluence on 10 150-cm2 plates in RPMI. The cells were immediately placed on ice, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and quickly extracted by the cell scraping technique in ice-cold isotonic mitochondria extraction buffer containing 65 mm sucrose, 215 mmd-mannitol, 5 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KH2PO4, and 5 mm KHCO3 (made fresh daily). The remainder of the protocol was carried out at 4 °C. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at low speed (∼100 × g) to gently pellet the cells. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was re-suspended in 1.0 ml of mitochondria buffer. The sample was transferred to a pre-cooled B-pestle Dounce and was passed 50 times, centrifuged for 3.5 min at 1.8 × 103 × g to remove heavy membranes, and re-extracted in isotonic buffer. The supernatants from both low speed spins were then centrifuged for 5 min at 8.5 × 103 × g to pellet out the mitochondria. The high-speed pellet was washed by re-suspension in mitochondria buffer and centrifuged a second time. The final pellet of isolated mitochondria was re-suspended in 1.0 ml of mitochondria buffer. Aliquots were taken for protein analysis (Bio-Rad, Lowry method) and the cytochrome c oxidase assay, the remainder of the sample was used for the 13C labeling studies. The cytochrome c oxidase assay was performed on intact and sonicated mitochondria to determine mitochondrial integrity. Mitochondrial integrity was determined to be greater than 79 ± 6%. Cytosolic contamination of less than 3% was determined by glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase activity in 300 mm triethanolamine-HCl buffer (pH 7.4, 0.13 mm NAD+). The freshly isolated mitochondria (1 mg protein) were then incubated in mitochondrial buffer with ADP (1.25 mm) in the presence of either [U-13C]fumarate (1 mm), or [U-13C]glutamate (1 mm) plus leucine (10 mm). After a 20-min incubation, the reaction was quenched with ice-cold perchloric acid (30%) and sonicated to disrupt the mitochondria. The solution was neutralized with potassium hydroxide, centrifuged, and the supernatant was lyophilized and resuspended in D2O for NMR analysis followed by LC/MS/MS determination of pyruvate isotopic enrichment. LC/MS/MS Analysis of [13C]Pyruvate—Quantitative analysis of the isotopomer distribution of [13C]pyruvate was performed with Applied Biosystems 4000 Q Trap LC/MS/MS system. Multiple reaction monitoring (negative-mode) of negatively charged ions from the TurboIonSpray probe was used to determine abundance of the unlabeled (86.9/43.3), single-labeled (87.9/43.3 and 87.9/44.3), double-labeled (88.9/45.3 and 88.9/44.3), and triple-labeled (89.9/45.3) pyruvate mass isotopomers. A 5-μl sample of the mitochondrial extract was loaded onto a LUNA 5u C8 (2Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S37-S42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 100A 250 × 4.6-mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and eluted using a linear gradient starting with 75% buffer A, 25% B changing to 5% buffer A, 95% buffer B over 10 min. Buffer A was 95% water with 5% acetonitrile (2 mm ammonium acetate) and buffer B was 5% water with 95% acetonitrile (2 mm ammonium acetate). These conditions provided for the necessary baseline resolution of pyruvate from oxaloacetate because they ionize to produce similar ion fragment spectra. Pyruvate peak identification was based on the retention time of 13C-labeled and unlabeled standards. Glucose- and Amino Acid-stimulated Insulin Secretion–Transfected and non-treated INS-1 cells were equilibrated in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) ±99% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin with 3 mm glucose for 2 h and then incubated in 2 ml of the appropriate secretogogue KRB mixture (G3 (3 mm Glc), G15 (15 mm Glc), G3 + 4 mm Gln + 10 mm Leu, or G15 + 4 mm Gln + 10 mm Leu) for an additional 2 h. Media aliquots were then taken and stored in the –20 °C freezer for analysis. Cells in the remaining media were placed on ice, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with 0.1% Triton prior to protein analysis. Isotopomer Analysis of Anaplerotic Pathways—The quantitative analysis of anaplerotic pathways was determined by incubating the transfected and non-transfected INS-1 cells using identical protocols as described above to determine the effects of malic enzyme knockdown on insulin secretion, except that [U-13C]glucose was substituted for natural abundance glucose. At the end of the incubation period, the amino acids were extracted and the isotopomer distributions of glutamate, aspartate, and alanine were determined using either 13C NMR or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (10Cline G.W. LePine R. Papas K.K. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44370-44375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The relative fluxes of labeled and unlabeled substrates into the Krebs cycle were calculated from the isotopomer distribution of glutamate, aspartate, and alanine using the program “tcacalc” (10Cline G.W.

Insulin Secretion Analysis—Media extracts were measured for insulin concentration using the High Range Insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO) and analyzed on a spectrophotometric plate reader at 450 nm. All media extracts were normalized to cell protein concentration using a Micro-BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Relative Expression Levels of Malic Enzyme Isofoms—mRNA levels of each of the three malic enzyme isoforms, cytosolic ME1, mitochondrial ME2, and mitochondrial ME3, were determined for both INS-1 832/13 cells and rat islets. All cell and islet mRNA expression levels for each of the malic enzyme isoforms were normalized to actin expression and further compared with the non-treated sample. Reaction efficiencies for all primer/probe mixtures were greater than 98.7%. mRNA expression from all three isoforms of malic enzyme were present in the INS-1 832/13 cells as was determined using quantitative real-time PCR with the two predominant forms ME1 and ME2 accounting for over 97% of malic enzyme expression. Expression levels of mitochondrial isoforms ME2 and ME3 are shown relative to cytosolic ME1 (Fig. 1A). Similar expression patterns were observed in rat islets when compared with the INS-1 cells, where ME1 and ME2 accounted for 93% of malic enzyme expression (Fig. 1B). Because in both models, the mitochondrial isoform ME3 was a minor species, our studies focused on the roles of cytosolic ME1 and mitochondrial ME2 in glucose- and amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion. Cytosolic NADP+-dependent Malic Enzyme 1 Activity—Enzyme assays were performed on the INS-1 whole cell lysates in the presence of NADP+ and l-malate in the reaction buffer to asses"

The cloning and expression of this gene in Escherichia coli provided us with new opportunities to explore the mechanism of carboxylic acid reduction by this enzyme. Phosphopantetheine transferases (PPTases) (12Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) catalyze post-translational modifications of proteins by covalently attaching the 4-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) moiety of CoA usually to a conserved serine residue of an apoprotein (Scheme 2). The role of PPTases has been well documented in fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis and in non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (12Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 13Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T.

Biol. 2001; 8: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). By phosphopantetheinylation, PPTases convert inactive apoproteins to active holoproteins that participate in the biosynthesis of fatty acids and in the biosynthesis of polyketides such as bleomycin (14Sanchez C. Du L. Edwards D.J. Toney M.D. Shen B. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and rifamycin (15Admiraal S.J. Walsh C.T. Khosla C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6116-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), bacterial acyl oligosaccharides (16Tang L. Weissborn A.C. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3697-3705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and acylated proteins (17Gehring A.M. Lambalot R.H. Vogel K.W. Drueckhammer D.G. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 17-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PPTases have been classified according to their specificity for given proteins: (a) for acyl carrier proteins involved in fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis; (b) for aryl carrier proteins and peptide carrier proteins involved in non-ribosomal peptide and siderophore biosynthesis; (c) a PPTase that exists as an integrated domain of fatty-acid synthases; and (d) a subclass of PPTase that is related to the Bacillus subtilis PPTase Sfp, but shows higher catalytic efficiencies with carrier protein involved in primary metabolism (18Seidle H.F. Couch R.D. Parry R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 446: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We were initially puzzled to observe that purified recombinant Car (rCar) from E. coli BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RP/pHAT305 shows a specific activity of 0.1 unit/mg of protein, nearly 50-fold lower than that obtained for purified Nocardia sp. wild-type Car (10He A. Li T. Daniels L. Fotheringham I. Rosazza J.P.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 1874-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). BLAST analysis of car showed that Car contains an N-terminal domain (amino acids 90-544) with high homology to known AMP-binding proteins. The C-terminal domain (amino acids 750-1094) has high homology to NADPH-binding proteins. During analysis of the deduced sequence of rCar, we observed the sequence LGGDSLSA (present between amino acids 661-693), similar to the consensus sequence (LGGXSXXA) for Ppant attachment sites in other proteins (12Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Homology searches also showed that the serine at position 689 is conserved, and this residue was hypothesized as the position at which a Ppant moiety could be attached. We therefore considered the possibility that wild-type Nocardia sp. Car is actually a holoenzyme produced by post-translational phosphopantetheinylation of apo-Car to afford maximum enzyme activity. A 4′-Ppant prosthetic group in active Car could serve as a “swinging arm” that would react with acyl-AMP intermediates at the N-terminal adenylating domain to form a covalently linked thioester that “swings” to the C-terminal reductase domain for reduction by NADPH, subsequent aldehyde release, thiol regeneration, and a new catalytic cycle. This arrangement of the Car protein would reflect a sequential catalytic mechanism wherein the N-terminal domain catalyzes substrate activation by formation of an initial acyl-AMP intermediate, and the C-terminal portion then catalyzes the reduction by NADPH of an intermediate thioester formed from acyl-AMP to finish a catalytic cycle (Fig. 1). The 50-fold difference in specific activity between rCar and wild-type Car was attributed to activities being measured for an E. coli enzyme consisting largely of apo-Car versus fully active wild-type Car as a phosphopantetheinylated holoenzyme. We report the cloning and identification of an Sfp-type PPTase from Nocardia sp. NRRL 5646, present evidence that rCar phosphopantetheinylation is required for maximum activity, and demonstrate the expression of a rCar of high specific activity with an E. coli clone containing both the car and npt (Nocardia phosphopantetheine transferase) genes.

Nocardia sp. strain NRRL 5646 is held in the College of Pharmacy Culture Collection of the University of Iowa and is grown and maintained on slants of Sabouraud dextrose agar. DNA manipulations were performed by standard protocols (20Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Competent cells of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RP and JM109 were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and Promega Corp. (Madison, WI), respectively. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Fast-Link® T4 DNA ligase was obtained from Epicentre Biotechnologies (Madison, WI). Pfu Turbo and Pfu Ultra DNA polymerases (Stratagene) were used for PCR following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA sequencing was performed by the University of Iowa DNA Facility. DNA primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). DNA fragments from restriction digests or PCR amplifications were purified using a DNA Clean & Concentrator™ kit (Zymo Research). DNA from agarose gels was recovered using a Zymoclean™ gel DNA recovery kit (DNA Clean & Concentrator kit). Plasmid DNA was isolated and purified using a Qiagen DNA miniprep spin kit. Southern blotting, labeling of DNA probes with digoxigenin, hybridization, and detection were performed according to the protocols of Roche Diagnostics. Plasmids pUC19 and pGEM-T were purchased from New England Biolabs and Promega Corp., respectively. E. coli MV1190/pUC8-sfp was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Zuber (21Nakano M.M. Corbell N. Besson J. Zuber P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Construction of plasmid pHAT305 expressing the car gene and isolation of Nocardia sp. NRRL 5646 genomic DNA have been described previously (10He A. Li T. Daniels L. Fotheringham I. Rosazza J.P.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 1874-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cultivation Methods—E. coli MV1190/pUC8-sfp was cultured according to a published procedure (13Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Nocardia sp. NRRL 5646 cultures were grown by a two-stage incubation protocol in 200 ml of Iowa medium in 1-liter DeLong culture flasks (8Li T. Rosazza J.P.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3482-3487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen glycerol stocks of E. coli BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RP harboring plasmid pHAT305, pPV1.184, pPV2.83, or pPV2.51 were streaked onto LB agar plates with ampicillin and chloramphenicol to obtain single colonies. Single colonies were inoculated into 20 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol in 125-ml stainless steel capped DeLong flasks. Cultures were incubated with shaking at 250 rpm on gyratory shakers at 37 °C. A 1% inoculum derived from 8-h stage I cultures was used to initiate fresh LB cultures (200 ml) with antibiotics in a 1-liter DeLong flask. These cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h with shaking at 250 rpm on a gyratory shaker. E. coli BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RP/pPV2.51 was cultured for 12 h (stage I) and for 14 h (stage II). E. coli cells were harvested at 5000 × g for 6 min at 4 °C. Analytical Methods—Standard solutions were prepared by dissolving weighed amounts of standards in 0.1 m Na2HPO4 (pH 7) containing acetonitrile (1:1, v/v). Aliquots of 0.5 ml were removed from the biotransformation samples and mixed with 0.5 ml of acetonitrile. Acetonitrile-diluted samples were vortexed for 30 s, allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min, and microcentrifuged at 20,000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm polyvinylidene difluoride syringe filter. Samples of 1-2 μl were injected for HPLC analysis. A Shimadzu HPLC system was used with mobile phases consisting of CH3CN/H2O/HCOOH (20:80:1, v/v/v). Quantitation of standards and samples was achieved by isocratically eluting them over an Econosil HPLC column (C18, 5 μm, 150 × 3.2 mm; Alltech) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The HPLC retention volumes and detection wavelengths for standards were as follows: vanillyl alcohol, 1.7 ml and 277 nm, respectively; vanillic acid, 2.5 ml and 260 nm, respectively; and vanillin, 4.1 ml and 284 nm, respectively. Car Assay—Car or rCar activity was measured by adding enzyme samples (10-50 μl) to solutions containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm NADPH, and 5 mm benzoate in a final volume of 1.4 ml. The rate of change in absorbance at 340 nm as NADPH was oxidized to NADP+ was used to assess the specific activities of the Car and rCar preparations. PPTase Assay—An indirect assay was developed to measure PPTase. Nocardia sp. NRRL 5646 cell-free extracts (CFE) were prepared by resuspending cell paste (5 g) in cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol (25 ml). The cell suspension was disrupted with a Branson Sonifier 450 cell disrupter at 450 watts with 50% intermittent duty cycle for 10 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (30 ml) was concentrated by ultrafiltration in an Amicon 50-ml concentrator (PM-10 membrane) to give a 17-ml (5-6 mg/ml) crude protein solution and used further for assay. The CFE (320-400 μg) from Nocardia sp. NRRL 5646 or from E. coli MV1190/pUC8-sfp were incubated with purified rCar (256 μg, 2 nmol) in the presence of CoA (1 mm) as a cofactor for 1 h at 28 °Cina final volume of 100 μl of buffer C. Controls were (a) Nocardia CFE + rCar, (b) Car + CoA, (c) Nocardia CFE + CoA, (d) rCar alone, and (e) Nocardia CFE alone. Car activity in these mixtures was then measured by the addition of 50-μl samples to buffer C containing 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm NADPH, and 5 mm benzoate in a final volume of 1.4 ml. The rate of change in absorbance at 340 nm was measured. In this assay, enhancement of rCar activity was attributed to the conversion of apoto holo-enzyme by PPTase. Construction of pPV1.184—The 1.5-kb Plac sfp fragment was amplified from plasmid pUC8-sfp (21Nakano M.M. Corbell N. Besson J. Zuber P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) using primers SFP-FW and SFP-RV containing KpnI terminal restriction sites (see Table 1). PCR was performed using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase for a total of 30 cycles as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The 1.5-kb PCR product was purified, digested with KpnI, purified on a 0.7% agarose gel, and ligated into plasmid pHAT305 (previously digested with KpnI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase) to give plasmid pPV1.184. The Plac sfp gene was transcribed in the same direction as the Plac car gene.TABLE 1List of primers used in this studyOligonucleotideSequence (5′ to 3′)SourceSFP-FWCGGGGTACCATTCATTAATGCAGCTGGThis studySFP-RVCGGGGTACCATTAACTTGGGTAACGCCThis studyNPT-1CGGCATCGTCGGCTCCHTNACNCAYTGThis studyNPT-2GGGTCAGCGGGAACCANRCYTTRWAThis studyNPT-3CGCCGGGTCAGCGGRWACCANRCYTThis studyNPT-4GCCGGGTCAGCGGGWACCANRCYTTThis studyNPT-5CGGCATGGTCGGCTCCHTNACNCAYTGThis studyASM1-FWACCGACCTGGGCGGCGATGCGCTTTCCGCGCTGTCGTTCTCGThis studyASM1-RVCGAGAACGACAGCGCGGAAAGCGCATCGCCGCCCAGGTCGGTThis studyASM2-FWGACCTGGGCGGCGATTCCCTTGCGGCGCTGTCGTTCTCGAACThis studyASM2-RVGTTCGAGAACGACAGCGCCGCAAGGGAATCGCCGCCCAGGTCThis studyASM3-FWCTGGGCGGCGATTCCCTTTCCGCGCTGGCGTTCTCGAACCTGThis studyASM3-RVCAGGTTCGAGAACGCCAGCGCGGAAAGGGAATCGCCGCCCAGThis studyASM4-FWGGCGATTCCCTTTCCGCGCTGTCGTTCGCGAACCTGCTGCACThis studyASM4-RVGTGCAGCAGGTTCGCGAACGACAGCGCGGAAAGGGAATCGCCThis studyNPTORF-FWCAATAAGCTTATGATCGAGACAATTTTGCCTGCThis studyNPTORF-RVCGAGGATCCTCAGGCGTACGCGATCGCThis studyPUC191-FWCTTGGTACCAAAGGGGGATGTGCTGCAAGThis studyPUC191-RVCCCGGTACCAACCGTATTACCGCCTTTGAGThis studyPPT1FWCACAAGGTGCGCTTCCGTTCThis studyPPT1RVCCTTGTAGGTGGCTTCCTTGThis studyS71-FGAATTCACCGTCCGAAACATCThis studyS71-RGATGTTTCGGACGGTGAATTCThis studyS72-FCAGCGTTTCGCGAGAGAATCThis studyS72-RGATTCTCTCGCGAAACGCTGThis studyS73-FGTTTCGCTTACCCCGCACTGThis studyS73-RCAGTGCGGGGTAAGCGAAACThis studyNPT-6GTGGTTGAAGACCACCGATTThis studyNPT-7CAGGCTGACCGAATCCAGThis studyT7TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGUniversity of Iowa DNA FacilitySP6CGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGUniversity of Iowa DNA FacilityM13 reverseCAGGAAACAGCTATGACCUniversity of Iowa DNA Facility Open table in a new tab Construction of pGEM-T-S7—20 μg of genomic DNA (1.75 μg/μl) from Nocardia sp. NRRL 5646 was digested with SmaI (200 units) and loaded onto a 1% agarose gel. DNA fragments of 5.1-5.4 kb were excised from the agarose gel, purified, and ligated into pGEM-T. The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli JM109. The resulting transformants were screened by colony hybridization (20Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) using a 250-bp DNA probe that was constructed by PCR amplification of Nocardia genomic DNA using primers designed based on the consensus PPTase gene sequence (14Sanchez C. Du L. Edwards D.J. Toney M.D. Shen B. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The plasmid clone was called pGEM-T-S7 and included a 5.2-kb SmaI-digested DNA fragment with the full-length npt gene along with the flanking DNA sequences. Construction of pPV2.83—The 669-bp npt open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from plasmid pGEM-T-S7 containing the whole 5.2-kb SmaI-digested genomic DNA fragment using primers NPTORF-FW and NPTORF-RV containing HindIII and BamHI restriction sites, respectively (Table 1). The PCR fragment was cloned into plasmid pUC19 to afford plasmid pPV2.51. Plac npt was amplified from plasmid pPV2.51 using primers PUC191-FW and PUC191-RV with KpnI restriction ends. The PCR-amplified product was digested with KpnI, purified by gel electrophoresis, and ligated into pHAT305 (previously digested with KpnI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase) to give plasmid pPV2.83 (Plac car Plac npt). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutants of pHAT305 (Plac car) were constructed using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primers ASM1-FW/ASM1-RV, ASM2-FW/ASM2-RV, ASM3-FW/ASM3-RV, and ASM4-FW/ASM4-RV to create the car mutants ASM1 (S689A), ASM2 (S691A), ASM3 (S694A), and ASM4 (S696A), respectively. The PCR products were treated with DpnI and transformed into E. coli JM109. Transformants were selected, and the introduced mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids carrying the desired mutations were transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RP competent cells, and the resulting colonies were used for enzyme analysis. Overexpression and Purification of rCar—Cells expressing rCar were resuspended in buffer B and homogenized by two passages through a French press (16,000 p.s.i), and the homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 26,000 × g. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a column of Talon® resin (2.5 × 20 cm, 50-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer A and washed with buffer A (100 ml). rCar was eluted using a linear gradient of 0-50 mm imidazole in buffer A in a total volume of 100 ml. Fractions were assayed for benzoic acid reduction activity, and the active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration in an Amicon 200-ml concentrator (YM-30 membrane). The concentrate was diluted in 50 ml of buffer C. The solution was once again concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM-30 membrane) and again diluted with 50 ml of buffer C. This preparation was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (2.5 × 20 cm, 50-ml bed volume) pre-equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer C, and the bound protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl in buffer C with a total of 150 ml of eluant. Fractions were assayed for rCar activity, and the active fractions were pooled and concentrated. Purification of Sfp and Npt—The B. subtilis PPTase Sfp was purified from E. coli MV1190/pUC8-sfp according to a published procedure (13Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Npt was purified from E. coli BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RP/pPV2.51. For Npt, harvested cells (26 g) were resuspended in buffer C (100 ml) and homogenized by two passages through a French press (16,000 p.s.i.), and the homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 26,000 × g to give 115 ml of CFE (2875 mg of protein). Crystalline ammonium sulfate was added to 35% saturation of the extract, which was stirred for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The 35% supernatant was brought to 55% ammonium sulfate saturation and stirred for 1 h at 4°Cto give a 55% ammonium sulfate precipitate, which was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g (865 mg of total protein). The 55% precipitate (∼433 mg of protein) was dissolved in 5 ml of buffer C and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-100 column (2.5 × 20 cm, 50-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer C. The proteins were eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min. Fractions were assayed for their ability to enhance rCar activity (PPTase indirect assay), and the active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 15 ml (PM-10 membrane). This fraction was then loaded onto a reactive green 19 column (2.5 × 20, 100-ml bed volume), washed with 1 column volume of buffer C, and then eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient of 0-3 m NaCl in buffer C. Fractions were tested for PPTase activity, and the active fractions were pooled and concentrated (PM-10 membrane) to 5 ml (80 mg of protein). The protein mixture was desalted by passage through a 50-ml Sephacryl S-100 column (2.5 × 20 cm), and the eluate (50 ml) was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (2.5 × 20 cm, 100-ml bed volume). The column was washed with 1 column volume of buffer C and then eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl in buffer C. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon PM-10 membrane to 5 ml (45 mg of protein), and aliquots (100 μl) were flash-frozen at -80 °C. Labeling of Purified rCar with [3H]Acetyl-CoA—rCar (25 μg, 0.21 nmol) was incubated with 18 μg of either Npt or Sfp and 7.5 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (200 μCi/mmol, 37.5 nmol) in a final volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 28°C. The reaction was quenched with SDS-PAGE sample buffer without DTT (50 μl) and heated at 100 °C for 2 min. 50 μl of the above reaction mixture was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was briefly stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad), destained with water, and soaked in Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL) for 30 min. The gel was air-dried between a cellophane sheet and Saran Wrap™ for 2 days. The dried gels were then exposed to Hyperfilm™ MP (GE Healthcare) at -70 °C for 3 weeks. Whole Cell Carboxylic Acid Reduction—Harvested E. coli cells were resuspended in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl and pelleted once again by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 6 min at 4 °C. Cells were then resuspended in 0.1 m Na2HPO4 (pH 7) to achieve wet cell weight concentrations of 0.5 g/ml. A sodium vanillate stock solution (50 mg/ml) was prepared by dissolving equimolar amounts of vanillic acid and NaHCO3 in 0.1 m Na2HPO4 (pH 7). Reaction mixtures of 50 ml contained 0.4% glucose, 1.5 g of biocatalyst (wet cell weight), 200 mg of sodium vanillate, and 0.1 m Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0). Reactions were incubated at 28 °C with shaking at 220 rpm, and 1-ml samples were withdrawn at various time intervals for analysis. Reactions were quenched by diluting samples with equal volumes of acetonitrile, which were then equilibrated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by centrifugation in a Microfuge and HPLC analysis. Optimizing rCar Expression—rCar was cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RP/pHAT305. We found that cultures grown for 16 h without isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction gave maximum levels of rCar with a specific activity of 0.3 ± 0.04 units/mg, 3-fold higher than rCar from induced cultures (10He A. Li T. Daniels L. Fotheringham I. Rosazza J.P.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 1874-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Evidence for Car Phosphopantetheinylation—PPTases (12Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem.

The presence of a possible phosphopantetheinylation site in the car ORF suggested that Nocardia sp. NRRL 5646 could contain a PPTase that converts apo-Car to fully active holo-Car. Incubations of purified apo-rCar with Nocardia sp. CFE plus CoA gave a more active preparation (Table 2). A 5-fold increase in specific activity was obtained in the reaction of CFE with rCar plus CoA, indicating that Nocardia produces a PPTase. Incubating E. coli BL21-CodonPlus®(DE3)-RP/pHAT305 CFE with rCar plus CoA showed no equivalent enhancement in specific activity, indicating that E. coli lacks or poorly expresses a PPTase or contains a PPTase that is not active with rCar.TABLE 2Specific activity measurements of rCar when incubated with Nocardia CFE and CoA for 1 h at 28 °CConditionsSpecific activityunits/mgNocardia CFE0.01 ± 0.006 +CoA0.01 ± 0.003 +rCar0.5 ± 0.06"
https://openalex.org/W2004287746,"Tipin was originally isolated as a protein interacting with Timeless/Tim1/Tim (Tim), which is known to be involved in both circadian rhythm and cell cycle checkpoint regulation. The endogenous Tim and Tipin proteins in human cells, interacting through the N-terminal segment of each molecule, form a complex throughout the cell cycle. Tipin and Tim are expressed in the interphase nuclei mostly at constant levels during the cell cycle, and small fractions are recovered in the chromatin-enriched fractions during S phase. Depletion of endogenous Tipin results in reduced growth rate, and this may be due in part to inefficient progression of S phase and DNA synthesis. Knockdown of Tipin induces radioresistant DNA synthesis and inhibits phosphorylation of Chk1 kinase caused by replication stress, as was observed with that of Tim. Knockdown of Tipin or Tim results in reduced protein level and relocation to the cytoplasm of the respective binding partner, suggesting that the complex formation may be required for stabilization and nuclear accumulation of both proteins. Furthermore, both Tipin and Tim may facilitate the accumulation of Claspin in the nuclei under replication stress, whereas nuclear localization of Tipin and Tim is unaffected by Claspin. Our results indicate that mammalian Tipin is a checkpoint mediator that cooperates with Tim and may regulate the nuclear relocation of Claspin in response to replication checkpoint. Tipin was originally isolated as a protein interacting with Timeless/Tim1/Tim (Tim), which is known to be involved in both circadian rhythm and cell cycle checkpoint regulation. The endogenous Tim and Tipin proteins in human cells, interacting through the N-terminal segment of each molecule, form a complex throughout the cell cycle. Tipin and Tim are expressed in the interphase nuclei mostly at constant levels during the cell cycle, and small fractions are recovered in the chromatin-enriched fractions during S phase. Depletion of endogenous Tipin results in reduced growth rate, and this may be due in part to inefficient progression of S phase and DNA synthesis.

During the course of DNA replication, the genome may be highly susceptible to damages derived from environmental or naturally occurring hazards (1Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A.

Cell cycle checkpoint is a safeguard system against these threats to maintain genomic integrity. In eukaryotic cells, inhibition of DNA replication by depletion of the cellular nucleotide pool, or by certain forms of DNA damage, leads to activation of the replication checkpoint mediated mainly by ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related kinase ATR 2The abbreviations used are: ATR, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related protein; HU, hydroxyurea; MCM, minichromosome maintenance; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; RDS, radioresistant synthesis; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. and its downstream molecules (5Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). The key function of this signaling pathway is to stabilize the arrested replication forks and to transduce the downstream signals required for the preservation of the forks until the damage is removed. One of the most important targets of ATR is the checkpoint effector kinase, Chk1 (6Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), which is required for activation of various effector functions, including fork preservation and suspension of further S phase progression (7Takai H.

Recent studies revealed a group of proteins that affect ATR-dependent Chk1 activation. Budding yeast Tof1 was reported to be required for stable arrest of replication forks in the presence of hydroxyurea (HU) and is required for activation of Rad53 (10Foss E.J.

Recently, human Tim was reported to be a mediator of replication and intra-S phase checkpoint (20Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Mullen T.E. Kaufmann W.K. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3109-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Claspin has been isolated as a Chk1-interacting protein that is essential for phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR during replication and DNA damage responses in Xenopus egg extracts (21Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The yeast ortholog of Claspin, Mrc1, is also required for activation of Rad53/Cds1 effector kinases under replication stress (22Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J. Bousset K.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, budding yeast Mrc1 was shown to be required for stable arrest of replication forks and was implicated as a component of a fork pausing complex together with Tof1 protein (11Katou Y.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Fission yeast Swi3 was first isolated as a gene required for mating type switching and was later shown to be essential for replication pausing at the mat1 locus (25Egel R. Beach D.H. Klar A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3481-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Swi3 forms a complex with Swi1 (26Lee B.S. Grewal S.I. Klar A.J. Mol. Cell.

II I Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8342-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Swi3 as well as Swi1 is required for stalling replication forks not only at mat1 locus (13Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) but also at rDNA repeats (28Krings G. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14085-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Its budding yeast counterpart, Csm3, was originally identified as a factor required for proper chromosome segregation (29Sjogren C. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 991-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and was shown to be involved in sister chromatid cohesion and to bind to Tof1 (30Mayer M.L. Pot I. Chang M. Xu H. Aneliunas V. Kwok T. Newitt R. Aebersold R. Boone C. Brown G.W. Hieter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1736-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Csm3 was reported to belong to the same epistasis group with Tof1 and histone H2A serine 129 in response to DNA damages (31Redon C. Pilch D.R. Bonner W.M. Genetics. 2006; 172: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, it was proposed that Csm3, Tof1, and Mrc1 are components of a replisome progression complex together with other fork factors, including MCM, Cdc45, and GINS (32Gambus A. Jones R.C. Sanchez-Diaz A. Kanemaki M. van Deursen F. Edmondson R.D. Labib K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Tipin, which was identified as a Tim-interacting protein (33Gotter A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), is regarded as an ortholog of Swi3/Csm3, but its molecular function has not been precisely determined. In this study, we analyzed the functions and molecular dynamics of human Tipin protein during cell cycle progression and replication checkpoint responses. Our results show that Tipin is essential for replication checkpoint responses and that the Tim-Tipin complex may be required for proper nuclear accumulation of the Claspin molecule. Cell Culture and Cell Cycle Synchronization—HeLa cells and U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For synchronization, cells were arrested at the G1/S boundary by incubation in the presence of 2.5 mm thymidine for 14–16 h twice with a 9-h interval of growth without the drug. Otherwise, cells were arrested at mitosis by 50 ng of nocodazole per ml for 10 h after single thymidine block and release. Arrested cells were released into the cell cycle and harvested at the indicated time intervals. siRNAs and Transfection—Transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes was conducted by using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). All siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Japan Bio Services Co. Ltd. (Saitama, Japan). The sense strands of the three different siRNAs for Tipin are as follows: Tipin1, 5′-AGGUCAUGAGGCUGAAGACdTdT-3′; Tipin2, 5′-GAUGGUGAAGGAACUGAGCdTdT-3′; and Tipin3, 5′-AAGGAGGAGUCAAAUGGAUdTdT-3′. siRNA for Tim is 5′-GAGCUAAGAAGCCUAGGGGdTdT-3′. siRNA for Claspin is CCUUGCUUAGAGCUGAGUCdTdT-3′. The sequences of control siRNA and siRNA for Cdc7 were reported previously (34Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Ishii A. Taniyama C. Matsui E. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13062-13070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Rabbit anti-Tipin antibody (anti-Tipin) was raised by immunizing two animals with glutathione S-transferase-tagged full-length human Tipin, and rabbit anti-Tim (anti-Tim-C) antibody was generated by immunizing two animals with the C-terminal half (603–1208 amino acids) of the human Tim. Rat anti-Tim antibody (anti-Tim-N) was also generated by immunization of two Lewis/CrlCrlj rats (donated by Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Japan) with the N-terminal half (1–573 amino acids) of human Tim. All antibodies were affinity-purified using HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HP (GE Healthcare). Antibodies against human Cdc7, anti-huCdc7-1, were described previously (35Sato N. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4340-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Cdt1 antibody was a gift from Katsuyuki Tamai (MBL). Antibodies from commercial sources were as follows: Chk1, Chk2, PCNA, and lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); α-tubulin and FLAG M2 (Sigma); Chk1 S317P, Chk1 S345P, and Chk2 T68P (Cell Signaling Technology); Claspin (Bethyl Laboratories); and Myc (clone 4A6, Upstate, or A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA Constructions—Human Tim and human Tipin cDNA were subcloned into pME18S-FLAG and pME18S-myc vector, respectively, generating FLAG-tagged Tim and Myc-tagged Tipin. PCR-amplified fragments encoding deletion derivatives of human Tipin were subcloned into pME18S-myc as shown in Fig. 3B. The constructs 1 and 1+2 of Tim were generated by deleting the C-terminal segments from pME18S-FLAG-Tim. The constructs 2, 4, and 5 of Tim were generated on FLAG-pcDNA3.1, and construct 3 of Tim was generated on pME18S-FLAG by subcloning the corresponding restriction fragments. Immunofluorescence Staining—Preparation of cells for immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (36Sugata N. Li S. Earnshaw W.C. Yen T.J. Yoda K. Masumoto H. Munekata E. Warburton P.E. Todokoro K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2919-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, for pre-extraction procedure, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were washed twice with PHEM buffer (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 6.9, 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2) at room temperature and lysed with PHEM containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 min. The cells were fixed with methanol at -20°C for 5 min, immediately dried, and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For post-extraction procedure, PBS-washed cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS for 10 min, and lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. For immunostaining, the coverslips were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies in AB buffer (0.1 m PIPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1.83% l-lysine, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% NaN3) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBS for 3 min, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated anti mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch); Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes); and 1 μgof DAPI per ml) for 45 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were then washed three times with PBS for 3 min and mounted with PBS containing 90% glycerol, 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma). Samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER CCD camera. Images were processed with software Aquacosmos (Hamamatsu Photonics). Cell Fractionation—Cells were fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions by the procedure described previously (34Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Ishii A. Taniyama C. Matsui E. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13062-13070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspending the cells in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were extracted with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 5% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 mm Pefabloc SC). After rotation for 30 min at 4 °C, the lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was recovered (Nonidet P-40 extracts). Before immunoprecipitation, the extracts were cleared by incubation with protein A- and protein G-Sepharose and centrifuged for 3 min at 11,000 × g. The cleared extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with antibodies as indicated. DNA Content and Incorporation of BrdUrd—Cells were incubated with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) as described previously (34Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Ishii A. Taniyama C. Matsui E. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13062-13070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Radioresistant DNA Synthesis (RDS) Assay—RDS after ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation was assayed as reported previously (37Heffernan T.P. Simpson D.A. Frank A.R. Heinloth A.N. Paules R.S. Cordeiro-Stone M. Kaufmann W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8552-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 6 × 105 HeLa cells or 3 × 105 U2OS cells in a 6-cm dish were transfected with siRNA and incubated in medium containing 10 nCi of [14C]thymidine per ml (GE Healthcare), and incubation was continued for 40 h. The cells were then divided into two dishes containing nonisotopic medium and cultured for 2 h. One dish was irradiated with UVC (2 or 5 J/m2) and the other was mock-treated. After 1 h, 10 μCi of [3H]thymidine (GE Healthcare) per ml was added, and incubation was continued for 1.5 h. Finally, cells washed two times with PBS and harvested by scraping into a solution containing 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA were lysed by 1 m NaOH, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and high molecular weight DNA was precipitated by addition of 10% trichloroacetate. Acid-insoluble DNA was trapped on a GF/C glass filter, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counter. Tipin Is a Nuclear Protein and Associates with Chromatin during S Phase—Tipin, originally isolated as a Tim (an ortholog of yeast Tof1/Swi1)-binding protein, is a likely mammalian ortholog of budding yeast Csm3 and fission yeast Swi3, which may be involved in replication checkpoint pathway (10Foss E.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 567-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Matsumoto S. Ogino K. Noguchi E. Russell P. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42536-42542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate the roles of Tipin in replication checkpoint regulation in mammalian cells, we have generated specific antibodies against human Tipin and Tim proteins. All rabbit (anti-Tipin and anti-Tim-C) and rat (anti-Tim-N) polyclonal antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”) raised in this study have been successfully used to detect endogenous human Tipin and Tim proteins by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A). Using these antibodies, we first determined the expression levels of Tim and Tipin proteins during the cell cycle. HeLa cells were synchronously released into the cell cycle from arrest at the G1/S boundary by double thymidine block or at mitosis by nocodazole block. As shown in Fig. 1B, the Claspin protein level dramatically increased in S phase and decreased in M to G1 phase, as observed previously (23Tanaka K. Russell P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 42Wang X. Zou L. Lu T. Bao S. Hurov K.E. Hittelman W.N. Elledge S.J. Li L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Tim protein is expressed at a constant level during the cell cycle, and no mobility shift was observed. It was reported previously that Tim expression was high in S, G2, and M and low in G0 and G1 (20Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Mullen T.E. Kaufmann W.K. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3109-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be due to the method of cell cycle synchronization protocol (released from G0 after serum starvation versus release from G1/S or mitosis block), or to the different cell types used. In contrast, a mobility-shifted form of Tipin was detected at mitosis (nocodazole block), which may be caused by phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, lane 7), and its level slightly increased during S phase (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4). Next we analyzed cellular localization of Tipin and Tim during cell cycle progression. HeLa cells, synchronously released from G1/S arrest by double thymidine block, were fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble fraction containing cytosol and nucleoplasm and Triton-insoluble fractions enriched with chromatin-bound and nuclear matrix-bound proteins (Fig. 1C). Successful fractionation was confirmed by the exclusive presence of tubulin and lamin B proteins in Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble fractions, respectively. Cdt1 was detected predominantly during late M to G1 phase, and PCNA was detected in Triton-insoluble fractions only during S phase, confirming the cell cycle synchronization. Detection of Cdt1 during the second S phase (Fig. 1C, lanes 10–12) is because of loss of synchrony at the second cell cycle stage after release. Tipin and Tim were detected in the Triton-soluble fractions throughout the cell cycle, but they were detected in the insoluble fractions in early to mid-S phase, coincident with PCNA protein (Fig. 1C, lanes 14–16). This result suggests that Tipin and Tim proteins may associate with chromatin only during S phase. We next examined localization of endogenous Tim and Tipin proteins by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. In the formaldehyde-fixed samples, both proteins were mainly detected in nuclei rather uniformly except for nucleoli (Fig. 2A). Under these conditions, the staining patterns of Tipin and Tim were quite similar. When the soluble proteins were pre-extracted by detergent prior to fixation, only a limited fraction of cells showed positive nuclear signals for Tipin with a wide variety of signal strength and staining patterns (Fig. 2B, panels a and e). Double staining of the pre-extracted cells with anti-Tipin and anti-PCNA antibodies revealed that Tipin and PCNA exhibited similar staining patterns (Fig. 2B, panels b and f). This is in agreement with the results of immunoblot analysis, showing the association of Tipin and PCNA with chromatin-enriched fractions only during S phase (Fig. 1C). Similarly, detergent-resistant signals for Tim were similar to those of PCNA (Fig. 2C). In newborn daughter cells in G1 phase (Fig. 2, B and C, cells highlighted by circles), signals were very weak for Tipin, Tim, and PCNA. Complex Formation between Tipin and Tim—Because Tipin is a Tim-binding protein, we analyzed complex formation between Tipin and Tim. The Nonidet P-40 extracts of HeLa cells were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Tipin antibody, and the immunoprecipitate was examined by immunoblotting with anti-Tim antibody. The full-length Tim protein was detected in the immunoprecipitate but not in that of the preimmune serum (Fig. 3A, bottom panel) (data not shown). Reciprocally, the immunoprecipitates with anti-Tim-N antibody contained Tipin (Fig. 3A, top panel). The complex formation was analyzed also in the Nonidet P-40 extracts prepared from synchronized cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 3–11). Interactions were observed throughout the cell cycle, suggesting that Tipin and Tim form a complex at all the stages of the cell cycle. We then tried to determine the domains of Tipin and Tim required for the complex formation. We have constructed deletion mutants of FLAG-tagged Tim proteins as shown in Fig. 3B and transiently coexpressed them with Myc-tagged full-length Tipin in 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody coimmunoprecipitated the Tim fragments 1, 2, and 1+2 (Fig. 3C, lanes 11–13) but not the Tim fragments 3, 4, or 5 (lanes 14–16). On the other hand, in coexpression of deletion derivatives of Myc-tagged Tipin and FLAG-tagged full-length Tim, fragments a + b, a + b + c, and b but not a, c, or c + d of Tipin were detected in the immunoprecipitates with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3D). Data shown above indicate that the amino acid residues 1–267 or 267–573 of Tim and amino acid residues 67–143 of Tipin can bind to Tipin and Tim, respectively. Both segments contain amino acid sequences conserved throughout evolution (Fig. 3D), suggesting that this interaction may be conserved. Depletion of Tipin Inhibits Cell Growth—To explore the functions of Tipin, the protein was depleted from cells by RNA interference. Three different siRNA oligonucleotides specific for Tipin were designed and introduced into HeLa or U2OS cells, and the expression was monitored by Western blotting. Each transfected siRNA significantly reduced the level of Tipin protein (Fig. 4A) (data not shown). To assess the effects of knockdown of Tipin on cell growth, the increase of cell numbers was monitored 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection (Fig. 4B). As we and other groups reported previously (34Yoshizawa-Sugata N. Ishii A. Taniyama C. Matsui E. Arai K. Masai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13062-13070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 38Montagnoli A. Tenca P. Sola F. Carpani D. Brotherton D. Albanese C. Santocanale C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7110-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), depletion of Cdc7 greatly inhibited cell growth. Treatment with Tipin siRNA also decreased cell growth, whereas treatment with Tim siRNA did not have a significant effect on cell growth (Fig. 4B and phase contrast images in Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 4D, cell death was abundantly observed in Tipin or Cdc7-siRNA-treated cells, although there were no significant changes in cellular or nuclear morphology. In contrast, viability and cell morphology were not affected in Tim-depleted cells. Next, we analyzed the cell cycle profile to examine whether Tipin knockdown blocks a specific stage of the cell cycle. Cells depleted of Tipin did not show any significant accumulation of cells at a particular cell cycle stage, but slight reduction in G1 population and accumulation in late S phase cells were observed (Fig. 4C). Similar effects were observed also with Tim siRNA treatment and are generally shared with the effect of Cdc7 depletion (39Kim J.M. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Saito I. Katsuki M. Arai K. Masai H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of knockdown on DNA synthesis, thymidine incorporation was examined in Tipin-depleted cells. The relative level of thymidine incorporation in Tipin-siRNA-treated cells was significantly reduced (55.5% that of control siRNA; Fig. 4E). A similar result was observed in BrdUrd-pulse labeling experiments (Fig. 5D, top panels) (data not shown). These results indicate that DNA synthesis is inhibited in Tipin-depleted cells. Depletion of Tipin Slows Down S Phase Progression—The FACS analysis data above suggest that Tipin is required for normal progression of S phase. Therefore, we examined the effects of knockdown of Tipin on S phase progression. HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by double thymidine block after transfection of siRNA and then were released into the cell cycle (Fig. 5A). In control cells, S phase was completed by 9 h after release, and most of the cells entered mitosis or the next G1 phase by 12 h (Fig. 5B). In Tipin siRNA-treated cells, mid-to-late S transition was retarded (compare the cell populations at 6–9 h after release). In control cells at 9 or 12 h after release, S phase population was 12 or 7.3%, respectively, whereas that in Tipin-depleted cells was 29 or 18% (Fig. 5C, open symbols). In accordance with the delay in S phase, timing of the increase in G2/M population was also delayed; at 9 h, 81% of control cells were in G2/M phase and 62% in Tipin-depleted cells (Fig. 5C, closed symbols). This result is consistent with slight accumulation of mid-to-late S phase cell population in Tipin siRNA-treated asynchronously growing cells (Fig. 4C). We also measured the uptake of BrdUrd after thymidine block release in the same set of the experiments (Fig. 5, A and D). The population of BrdUrd-incorporating cells in Tipin siRNA-treated cells was slightly reduced at 3 and 6 h after release compared with the control cells, and it increased at 9 and 12 h (Fig. 5E). These results are consistent with the idea that depletion of Tip"
https://openalex.org/W2090142000,"The cyanobacterial small CAB-like proteins (SCPs) consist of one-helix proteins that resemble transmembrane regions of the light-harvesting proteins of plants. To determine whether these proteins are associated with protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane, an abundant member of the SCP family, ScpD, was marked with a His tag, and proteins co-isolating with His-tagged ScpD were identified. These proteins included the major Photosystem (PS) II components as well as FtsH, which is involved in degradation of the PSII complex. To ascertain specific interaction between ScpD and the PSII complex, the His-tagged protein fraction was subjected to two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE. Again, PSII components were co-isolated with ScpD-His, and ScpD-His was found to interact most strongly with CP47. ScpD association was most prominent with the monomeric form of PSII, suggesting ScpD association with PSII that is repaired. Using antibodies that recognize both ScpC and ScpD, we found the ScpC protein, which is very similar in primary structure to ScpD, to also co-isolate with the PSII complex. In contrast, ScpE did not co-isolate with a major protein complex in thylakoids. A fourth member of the SCP family, ScpB, could not be immunodetected, but was found by mass spectrometry in samples co-isolating with ScpD-His. Therefore, ScpB may be associated with ScpD as well. No association between SCPs and PSI could be demonstrated. On the basis of these and other data presented, we suggest that members of the SCP family can associate with damaged PSII and can serve as a temporary pigment reservoir while PSII components are being replaced.

In organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophylls and other pigments, and absorbed excitation energy is transferred to the reaction centers, where the photochemical process of converting excitation energy to chemical (redox) energy takes place. These pigments are bound to proteins to keep them in their proper location and orientation so that the energy transfer is efficient and rapid and so that toxic triplet states can be quenched effectively. In plants, the vast majority of pigments, including chlorophylls a and b and various carotenoids, are bound to a family of integral membrane proteins called the light-harvesting complex (LHC). 2The abbreviations used are: LHC, light-harvesting complex; PS, Photosystem; SCPs, small CAB-like proteins; BN, blue native; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry. Most abundant is LHCII, the main light-harvesting complex of Photosystem (PS) II, which has been crystallized and is known to consist of three transmembrane helices (B, C, and A), each of which is composed of 20–34 amino acids (1Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 2Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). The sequences of helices A and B are very similar and comprise the CAB (chlorophyll a/b-binding) motif, which is composed of ∼25 amino acid residues and includes the domain involved in chlorophyll binding (3Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Each individual LHCII apoprotein molecule binds an array of about eight chlorophylls a, six chlorophylls b, three to four carotenoids, and two lipids (4Standfuss J. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Several other closely related chlorophyll a/b-binding polypeptides function as light-harvesting antenna for PSII and PSI in plants. Together, these proteins are known as CAB proteins (3Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The CAB proteins in plants display a high degree of sequence similarity and are believed to share a common evolutionary origin (5Durnford D.G. Deane J.A. Tan S. McFadden G.I. Gantt E. Green B.R. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 6Heddad M. Adamska I. Comp. Funct. Genom. 2002; 3: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Their corresponding nuclear encoded genes belong to an extended cab family that includes also the genes coding for early light-inducible proteins, which are stress-induced (see Ref. 7Adamska I. Aro E.M. Andersson B. Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration: Regulation of Photosynthesis. 11. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 487-505Google Scholar) and probably bind chlorophyll a and lutein (8Adamska I. Roobol-Boza M. Lindahl M. Andersson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The CAB family also includes the PsbS protein (reviewed in Ref. 9Funk C. Aro E.M. Andersson B. Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration: Regulation of Photosynthesis. 11. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 453-467Google Scholar), which has an important function in non-photochemical quenching (10Li X.P. Bjorkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature. 2000; 403: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). PsbS is predicted to have four thylakoid membrane-spanning regions, and it binds chlorophylls a and b as well as carotenoids (11Funk C. Schroder W.P. Green B.R. Renger G. Andersson B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, related genes coding for polypeptides with one or two transmembrane α-helices have been detected in the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana (12Heddad M. Adamska I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3741-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 13Jansson S. Andersson J. Kim S.J. Jackowski G. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), rice and poplar (14Klimmek F. Sjödin A. Noutsos C. Leister D. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 793-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (15Teramoto H. Itoh T. Ono T.A. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae (16Ohta N. Matsuzaki M. Misumi O. Miyagishima S.Y. Nozaki H. Tanaka K. Shin I.T. Kohara Y. Kuroiwa T. DNA Res. 2003; 10: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast to plants, cyanobacteria lack the multihelix CAB proteins. The major peripheral LHC in some cyanobacteria is the phycobilisome, which is in the cytoplasm, is bound to the thylakoid membrane, and contributes to the deep blue-green color of cyanobacteria. However, small CAB-like proteins of <8 kDa have recently been identified in the genomes of marine and freshwater cyanobacteria (reviewed in Ref. 17Bhaya D. Dufresne A. Vaulot D. Grossman A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 215: 209-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are predicted to have a single membrane-spanning α-helix, which shows significant sequence similarity to the first and third membrane-spanning regions of the green plant CAB proteins, giving them the name small CAB-like proteins (SCPs) (18Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). They were also designated high light-inducible proteins because their RNA level was found to increase after transfer of cells to high light and many other stress conditions (19He Q. Dolganov N. Bjorkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 20Mikami K. Kanesaki Y. Suzuki I. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the small genome of the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus MED4, as many as 23 scp or hli genes were identified (17Bhaya D. Dufresne A. Vaulot D. Grossman A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 215: 209-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these genes have recently been detected in the genomes of Prochlorococcus cyanophages (21Lindell D. Sullivan M.B. Johnson Z.I. Tolonen A.C. Rohwer F. Chisholm S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 22Sullivan M.B. Coleman M.L. Weigele P. Rohwer F. Chisholm S.W. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e144Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), where they are believed to maintain the photosynthetic activity of the host during an infection (21Lindell D. Sullivan M.B. Johnson Z.I. Tolonen A.C. Rohwer F. Chisholm S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Although the function of the SCPs is not fully understood, these findings indicate their importance. In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, five SCPs were identified (18Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); four of them (ScpB–E) encode proteins of ∼6 kDa, whereas the fifth (ScpA) is the C-terminal extension of the ferrochelatase. The genes coding for ScpB–E are induced under various different stress conditions, including very high light intensity (>500 μmol m–2 s–1), low temperature, and nitrogen and sulfur starvation (19He Q. Dolganov N. Bjorkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 20Mikami K. Kanesaki Y. Suzuki I. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A mutant with these four genes inactivated is sensitive to high intensity illumination and shows alteration in pigmentation and in the ability to perform non-photochemical dissipation of absorbed light energy (23Havaux M. Guedeney G. He Q. Grossman A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1557: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The enhanced expression of the scp genes in response to high intensity illumination is consistent with the putative function of SCPs in protection against light stress (19He Q. Dolganov N. Bjorkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It was suggested that SCPs play a role in energy dissipation that is analogous to the process of non-photochemical quenching of higher plants (23Havaux M. Guedeney G. He Q. Grossman A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1557: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but the absence of scp genes does not affect fluorescence characteristics (24Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IsiA and/or a carotenoid closely associated with phycobilin energy transfer is now recognized to be involved with energy transfer regulation (25Mullineaux C.W. Emlyn-Jones D. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 26Rakhimberdieva M.G. Stadnichuk I.N. Elanskaya I.V. Karapetyan N.V. FEBS Lett. 2004; 574: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Wilson A. Ajlani G. Verbavatz J.M. Vass I. Kerfeld C.A. Kirilovsky D. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 992-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It also has been hypothesized that SCPs prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species by serving as transient carriers of chlorophyll (24Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The presence of the CAB motif in SCPs suggests that SCPs bind chlorophyll molecules in a similar way as the LHCII of plants. Furthermore, the SCPs seem to participate in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and regulate pigment availability. The chlorophyll synthesis rates in the PSI-less/chlL–/scpB–, PSI-less/chlL–/scpE–, and PSI-less/chlL–/scpC–/scpD– strains decrease when these three mutants are transferred from darkness to light (24Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ScpC and ScpD seem to be functionally complementary (24Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27971-27979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These two genes are most similar (87.1% identity) (19He Q. Dolganov N. Bjorkman O. Grossman A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), indicating a rather recent gene duplication (17Bhaya D. Dufresne A. Vaulot D. Grossman A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 215: 209-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a reasonably strict primary structure requirement. ScpD was immunologically detected in thylakoid membranes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (29Hao L.M. Schmidt K. Paulsen H. Funk C. Larkum T. Critchley C. Proceedings of the 12th International Congress on Photosynthesis. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Publishing, Melbourne, Australia2001: S31-005Google Scholar). To understand the function of this and other SCPs, it is important to know which complexes in the membrane they interact with. Here, we used His-tagged ScpD proteins to identify the main complexes with which ScpD is associated. After two-dimensional PAGE (blue native (BN) PAGE followed by SDS-PAGE), ScpD was found to be associated with monomeric PSII, its closest neighbor being CP47. CP43 and Psb28 were also found to interact with ScpD. Although ScpC could be identified in the PSII fraction and ScpB was found to co-fractionate with ScpD to some degree, ScpE was found in thylakoids, but did not seem to be associated with PSII. Growth Conditions—Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strains (wild-type, the PSI-less strain (ΔpsaAB) (30Shen G. Boussiba S. Vermaas W.F. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the PSII-less strain (ΔpsbDIC/ΔpsbDII) (31Vermaas W. Charité J. Eggers B. Baltscheffsky M. Current Research in Photosynthesis. 1. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1990: 231-238Crossref Google Scholar), the PSI-less/PSII-less strain (ΔpsaAB/ΔpsbDIC/ΔpsbDII) (32Ermakova-Gerdes S. Shestakov S. Vermaas W. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. 1. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 483-486Google Scholar), the CP47-His-tagged HT-3 strain (33Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the ScpD-His strain (see below)) were cultivated at 30 °C in BG-11 medium (34Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar). The PSI-less and PSII-less mutants were provided with 15 mm glucose. All strains except the PSI-less strain were grown at normal (50 μmol photons m–2 s–1) or high (500 μmol photons m–2 s–1) light intensity as indicated. Because of its light sensitivity, the PSI-less strain was cultured at 10 μmol photons m–2 s–1. To induce the SCPs, the wild-type and PSII-less strains were grown at high light intensity for 7 h. In the PSI-less/PSII-less and PSI-less strains, SCPs are induced also at light intensities of 50 and 10 μmol photons m–2 s–1, respectively (18Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Mutant Construction—To generate the ScpD-His strain, a plasmid construct was made to tag the ScpD protein in Synechocystis with an His6 epitope on its N terminus and to express the corresponding gene construct under the control of the psbAII promoter. To construct this plasmid, the scpD gene was amplified by PCR using a mixture of Taq and Pfu DNA polymerases and gene-specific primers (forward, 5′-TTATACATATGCATCATCATCATCATCATGGAACTAGCCGCGGATTTCGCCT-3′; and reverse, 5′-TCGGATCCTTAGAGAGGAGAGCAACCAACCC-3′) with artificially generated restriction sites for NdeI and BamHI and containing six histidine codons (CAT) in the forward primer. After restriction, the PCR fragment was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pPSBA plasmid; the resulting plasmid contains the scpD-His gene construct right behind the psbAII start codon (35Lagarde D. Beuf L. Vermaas W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and retains the upstream and downstream regions of the Synechocystis psbAII gene. The ligation mixture was amplified by PCR using pPSBA primers amplifying the entire psbAII/scpD-His region, and DNA of the desired size was selected. Amplification by PCR was chosen because transformation of Escherichia coli with the ligation mixture yielded no colonies, presumably reflecting toxicity of the plasmid to E. coli. The PCR product containing the scpD-His gene was transformed into the Synechocystis psbAII-KS strain, in which the psbAII gene was replaced with a kanamycin resistance/sacB cartridge (35Lagarde D. Beuf L. Vermaas W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The sacB gene codes for a levansucrase, leading to sucrose sensitivity of this strain (36Ried J.L. Collmer A. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). After transformation, Synechocystis cells were grown on BG-11 plates for 4 days. Transformants were then transferred to plates with 5% sucrose, and sucrose-resistant colonies were checked for kanamycin sensitivity. The resulting strain expressing both wild-type and His-tagged forms of the ScpD protein was subsequently transformed with chromosomal DNA from a ΔscpD strain carrying a spectinomycin resistance cassette insertion (37Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), and spectinomycin-resistant transformants were selected (28Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Insertion of the scpD-His gene at the desired location was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and deletion of the wild-type scpD gene was confirmed by PCR. Biochemical Preparations—Total membranes from the different Synechocystis strains were isolated as described (18Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Radioactive labeling of cells using a mixture of l-[35S]methionine and l-[35S]cysteine (>1000 Ci/mmol, final activity of 400 μCi/ml; Tran35S-label, ICN Biomedicals) and isolation of membranes were performed as described (38Komenda J. Reisinger V. Muller B.C. Dobakova M. Granvogl B. Eichacker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48620-48629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Isolated membranes were solubilized with n-dodecyl β-maltoside (n-dodecyl β-maltoside/chlorophyll ratios were 20 and 100 (w/w) in the PSI-containing and PSI-less strains, respectively), and extracted complexes were separated by BN gel electrophoresis (39Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar). Isolation of His-tagged Complexes—Cells from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strains carrying a His tag were pelleted after 4 h of exposure to high light intensity (500 μmol photons m–2 s–1), resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 25% glycerol), and broken. Thylakoids were prepared as described (33Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The cell homogenate (at 1 mg/ml chlorophyll) was brought to 1.28% β-dodecyl maltoside and incubated for 25 min at 4 °C. The sample was then loaded onto an Ni2+ metal affinity column. The column was washed with 9 column volumes (45 ml) of Buffer A containing 0.04% β-dodecyl maltoside and 10 mm imidazole. Subsequently, the column was washed with 10 ml of Buffer A with 0.04% β-dodecyl maltoside and 30 mm imidazole. Bound ScpD-His was eluted with 0.04% β-dodecyl maltoside and 100 mm imidazole in Buffer A. The eluate was precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of 25% polyethylene glycol 8000 in 50 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.0) and then resuspended in Buffer A containing 0.04% β-dodecyl maltoside. PAGE—To the resuspended Ni2+ column eluate was added 0.1 volume of loading solution containing 750 mm aminocaproic acid and 5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Protein complexes in the eluate were separated by BN-PAGE at 4 °C as described (39Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar) using a 5–14% polyacrylamide gradient gel. For the second dimension, the BN gel lane of interest was incubated for 20 min in a solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1% SDS and then placed on top of an SDS-12–20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea (40Komenda J. Lupinkova L. Kopecky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were either stained with silver nitrate (41Bjellqvist B. Pasquali C. Ravier F. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) or transferred onto polyvinyl difluoride membrane for further analysis by Western blotting. Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinyl difluoride membrane (42Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Anti-ScpC antibody raised in rabbits against residues 1–17 of the ScpC protein (MTTRGFRLDQDNRLNNF) was a gift from Dr. A. Sokolenko (University of Munich). A peptide-directed antibody against a region near the N terminus of ScpE (ELQPNQTPVQEDPKFG) was made commercially by Innovagen AB (Lund, Sweden). Pigment Analysis—Chlorophyll content was determined in 80% acetone and was calculated as described (43Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 385-394Google Scholar). Protein Analysis by Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—Protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting and post-source decay tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis was carried out using a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Stockholm). In-gel digestion to produce peptides for analysis by mass spectrometry was carried out essentially as described (44Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar) using sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega/SDS Biosciences, Falkenberg, Sweden) or sequencing-grade chymotrypsin (Roche Diagnostics, Bromma, Sweden). Silver-stained protein bands were destained prior to in-gel digestion using the method previously described (45Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). To analyze the in gel-digested proteins by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, dried droplet preparations were applied as described (46Kussmann M. Nordhoff E. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Haebel S. Rossel-Larsen M. Jakobsen L. Gobom J. Mirgorodskaya E. Kroll-Kristensen A. Palm L. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The matrices used were readymade solutions of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (G2037A) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (G2039A) from Agilent Technologies (Stockholm). Samples were concentrated and desalted as needed using homemade Stop-and-Go extraction columns as described (47Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). Data base searches were carried out on an in-house Mascot server that was licensed to Umeå University by Matrix Science (www.matrixscience.com) using the current version of the NCBInr Database and the Synechocystis Protein Database of the European Bioinformatics Institute. The data bases were searched using peptide mass fingerprint spectra and post-source decay MS/MS spectra. If appropriate, proteins were identified by sequence queries that included both types of data. The search parameters restricted the error for peptide masses to 50 ppm and for MS/MS fragments to 0.5 Da. The instrument type specified for MS/MS ion searches was MALDI-TOF/TOF. By default, the search parameters permitted one missed cleavage site and variable oxidation states of methionine. If appropriate, two or more missed cleavage sites were allowed. Proteins Co-purifying with ScpD-His—Based on two-phase separation experiments, ScpD is a prevalent SCP member in the thylakoid membrane (29Hao L.M. Schmidt K. Paulsen H. Funk C. Larkum T. Critchley C. Proceedings of the 12th International Congress on Photosynthesis. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Publishing, Melbourne, Australia2001: S31-005Google Scholar), but its association with protein complexes in this membrane system remains unknown. To learn about the function of the SCPs, we decided to tag ScpD with His, to determine its interaction partners, and to analyze the SCP composition of thylakoid complexes. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we created a Synechocystis mutant in which scpD had been deleted and replaced with a His-tagged scpD copy, the expression of which was under the control of the psbAII promoter. After harvesting and rupturing the cells, the total membranes were solubilized using β-dodecyl maltoside, and ScpD-His-containing complexes were isolated via nickel column chromatography (33Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. To test the validity of this protocol, we also isolated PSII complexes via CP47-His using the HT-3 mutant (33Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and analyzed them by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). They were composed of essentially the same subunits as shown in originally (33Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 57Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The SDS gel in Fig. 1 shows the washed off fractions and eventual eluate resulting from the affinity purification of the ScpD-His complex (lanes C–E) and similar fractions of a chromatography control using wild-type ScpD (lanes A and B). Although the wild-type fraction collected upon washing the column (lane A) showed no recognizable pattern, the corresponding fraction from the ScpD-His strain showed a pattern of components resembling that of PSII (lane C). Indeed, upon elution with 100 mm imidazole, such components co-eluted with ScpD-His (lanes D and E; representing results from two independent preparations). The presence of two distinct bands with apparent masses of 47.3 and 6 kDa was clearly visible in these lanes, and fainter bands migrating with apparent masses between 4 and 6, 30 and 45, and 70 and 80 kDa could be observed. The only visible differences between the PSII complexes washed off the column at 30 mm imidazole (lane C) and at 100 mm imidazole (lane D) were the presence of ScpD-His and an enrichment of CP47 in the latter fraction. It therefore seems that most of the PSII complexes were washed off the column and that only a minor fraction was bound to ScpD. The corresponding eluent fraction from the wild-type control in lane B did not display protein bands, demonstrating the specificity of retention of the proteins in lanes D and E by ScpD-His.

Mass spectral analysis of Dpo4-catalyzed extension products revealed that the enzyme accurately bypasses O6-MeG, with C being the major product (∼70%) and T or A being the minor species (∼20% or ∼10%, respectively), consistent with steady-state kinetic parameters. Transient-state kinetic experiments revealed that kpol, the maximum forward rate constant describing polymerization, for dCTP incorporation opposite O6-MeG was ∼6-fold slower than observed for unmodified G, and no measurable product was observed for dTTP incorporation in the pre-steady state. The lack of any structural information regarding how O6-MeG paired in a polymerase active site led us to perform x-ray crystallographic studies, which show that “wobble” pairing occurs between C and O6-MeG. A structure containing T opposite O6-MeG was solved, but much of the ribose and pyrimidine base density was disordered, in accordance with a much higher Km,dTTP that drives the difference in efficiency between C and T incorporation. The more stabilized C:O6-MeG pairing reinforces the importance of hydrogen bonding with respect to nucleotide selection within a geometrically tolerant polymerase active site.

Of the myriad forms that covalent modification of DNA can take, alkylation of the purine/pyrimidine bases is one of the most extensively studied (1Loveless A. Nature. 1969; 223: 206-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 2Lawley P.D. Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens. 2nd Ed. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1984: 325-484Google Scholar). The term “alkylating agent” encompasses a variety of known carcinogenic chemicals ranging from the spontaneously reactive nitrogen and sulfur mustards (e.g. mechlorethamine) and N-alkyl-N-nitrosoureas to metabolically activated compounds such as cyclophosphamide and N-nitrosamines (3Wheeler G.P. Cancer Res. 1962; 22: 651-688PubMed Google Scholar). Guanine is generally considered the most easily oxidized of the bases, and the N7 position is the most nucleophilic atom of guanine. One prevalent form of guanine oxidation occurs at the O6 position, with a simple and widely studied process being addition of a methyl group to form O6-MeG 2The abbreviations used are: MeG, methylguanine; CID, collision-induced dissociation; dCTPαS, 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate); DTT, di-thiothreitol; LC, liquid chromatography; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; pol, (DNA) polymerase; pol T7-, bacteriophage pol T7 exonuclease-deficient; RT, reverse transcriptase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus.

Methylation of the O6 atom results in alternate pairing schemes that include a O6-MeG:C “wobble” pairing and a pseudo-“Watson-Crick” O6-MeG:T pair (Fig. 1), and the relevance of O6-MeG to mutagenesis is well established (5Delaney J.C.

Cells can repair O6-MeG by recognition and/or removal of the lesion through either the mismatch repair pathway or through the actions of (O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase) (8Pegg A.E.

O6-MeG is even observed in the DNA of the general population, although the level measured between studies has varied (4Margison G.P. Santibanez Koref M.F. Povey A.C.

Substantially increased levels of O6-MeG are found in patients treated with chemotherapeutic regimes that include methylating agents (4Margison G.P. Santibanez Koref M.F. Povey A.C.

Cancer. 2000; 88: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Of the enzymes associated with what has commonly been referred to as “translesion synthesis,” the Y-family DNA polymerases are thought to represent the major constituent present during post-replication repair of covalently modified DNA (14Langston L.D. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 155-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A.

Four human Y-family polymerases are known (η, ι, κ, and Rev1), and representatives also occur in other eukaryotic, archaeal, and prokaryotic systems (17Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Current models for translesion synthesis across damaged DNA during replication propose a dynamic exchange between two general groups of polymerases, namely the high fidelity replicative polymerases that perform the vast majority of incorporation events and the Y-family enzymes (14Langston L.D. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 155-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Plosky B.S. Woodgate R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In mammalian systems the coordination of the four Y-family polymerases, at sites of damage or otherwise, is less than clear at this point. For all of these reasons, the one or more mechanisms by which specialized polymerases bypass damaged DNA is an area of intense focus. Several crystal structures of the Dpo4 DNA polymerase from Sulfolobus solfataricus in complex with covalently modified DNA have served as a major source of structural information regarding how Y-family polymerases bypass damaged DNA templates (18Ling H. Boudsocq F. Plosky B.S. Woodgate R. Yang W. Nature. 2003; 424: 1083-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W.

Rigorous kinetic analysis of Dpo4 catalysis performed with unmodified DNA indicates that the enzyme bears all of the hallmarks of a “translesion” polymerase, namely low efficiency (“low” kpol and “high” KD,dCTP), low processivity (∼16 incorporation events prior to dissociation), and low “fidelity” (one mistake every few thousand insertions) (24Fiala K.A. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Fiala K.A. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2106-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, within the context of the cell these attributes are not at all surprising, because copying undamaged DNA does not appear to be the major function of these enzymes. An investigation of Dpo4-catalyzed bypass of a ubiquitous product of oxidative damage, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxodeoxyguanosine, revealed that Dpo4 efficiency is increased ∼2-fold during lesion bypass (23Zang H. Irimia A. Choi J.Y. Angel K.C. Loukachevitch L.V. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2358-2372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The increased catalytic efficiency is in direct contrast to results obtained with T7- and other high fidelity polymerases, where catalysis is, in general, greatly inhibited for both C and A incorporation events (26Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6475-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 27Furge L.L. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3567-3574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, transient-state kinetic approaches were combined with mass spectral analysis of incorporation/extension products and x-ray crystallography. The results clearly illustrate that Dpo4 favors C incorporation followed by correct extension of at least 4 bp, with T and some A incorporations occurring as minor products. The rate-constant defining Dpo4-catalyzed incorporation of dCTP, kpol, is ∼6-fold slower for incorporation opposite O6-MeG relative to G. The basis for the decreased rate was revealed by the crystal structure to be formation of a wobble base pairing between O6-MeG and C. From these results some of the mechanistic distinctions between polymerase subfamilies and the subsequent influence of those distinctions upon whether C or T is paired opposite O6-MeG become apparent. Materials—Dpo4 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity as described previously (25Fiala K.A. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2106-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All unlabeled dNTPs were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ), Sp-dCTPαS was purchased from Biolog Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany), and [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All oligonucleotides used in this work were synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) and purified using high-performance liquid chromatography by the manufacturer, with analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight MS. The 13-base primer sequence used in the kinetic and mass spectral analyses was 5′-GGGGGAAGGATTC-3′. The 14-base primer sequences used in the indicated kinetic assays and the crystal structures was 5′-GGGGGAAGGATTCC-3′ for the O6-MeG:C structure and 5′-GGGGGAAGGATTCT-3′ for the O6-MeG:T structure. The template DNA sequence used in all of the kinetic and mass spectral assays and in the O6-MeG:C and O6-MeG:dATP structures was 5′-TCATXGAATCCTTCCCCC-3′, where X = Gor O6-MeG, as indicated. A second template sequence, used for the O6-MeG:T structure, was 5′-TCACXGAATCCTTCCCCC-3′, where X = O6-MeG. Polymerization Assays and Gel Electrophoresis—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template oligonucleotide, was extended in the presence of the indicated dNTP(s). Each reaction was initiated by adding 2 μl of dNTP·Mg2+ (250 μm dNTP and 5 mm MgCl2) solution to a preincubated Dpo4·DNA complex (25-100 nm). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C in Tris-HCl (pH 7.8 at 22 °C) buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm DTT, and 50 μg μl-1 bovine serum albumin. At the indicated time, 5-μl aliquots were quenched with 50 μl of 500 mm EDTA, pH 9.0. The samples were then mixed with 100 μl of a 95% formamide/20 mm EDTA solution and were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide (w/v)/7 m urea gel. Products were visualized and quantified using a phosphorimaging screen and Quantity One™ software, respectively (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Formation of an 18-base extension product from a 13-base primer was quantified by fitting the data to Equation 1, f18mer(t)=A1-∑r=1n((kobs)t)r-1(r-1)!e-(kobs)t+k2t(Eq. 1) where A is the amount of product formed during the first binding event between Dpo4 and DNA, kobs is the an observed rate constant defining nucleotide incorporation, n is the number of incorporation events required to observe product formation, k2 is the steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation, and t is time. All statistical values given indicate the standard error. Steady-state Kinetics—Dpo4-catalyzed single nucleotide incorporation was measured over a range of dNTP concentrations. All reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8 at 25 °C) buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm DTT, 50 μg μl-1 bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol (v/v). Dpo4 (10 nm) was preincubated with DNA (100 nm), and the reaction was initiated by adding dNTP·Mg2+. Aliquots were quenched with 500 mm EDTA (pH 9.0) after varying incubation times. The initial portion of the velocity curve was fit to a linear equation in the program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The resulting velocity was plotted as a function of dNTP concentration and then fit to a hyperbola, correcting for enzyme concentration to obtain an estimate of kcat and Km,dNTP. Pre-steady-state Kinetics—All pre-steady-state experiments were performed using a KinTek RQF-3 model chemical quench-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8 at 25 °C) buffer in the drive syringes. Initially, all RQF experiments were carried out at 37 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 (at 25 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 100 μg μl-1 bovine serum albumin, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. Subsequent experiments indicated that increasing the concentration of glycerol in the reaction mixture resulted in considerably more product in the first binding event for Dpo4-catalyzed incorporation of dCTP opposite O6-MeG (supplemental Fig. S4). Therefore, the pre-steady-state reactions were repeated using reaction buffer containing 35% glycerol (v/v). Polymerase catalysis was stopped via addition of 500 mm EDTA (pH 9.0). Where indicated, competitor primer/template DNA (1 μm 13/18-mer) was included in the right syringe as a trap for protein, thereby creating single-turnover conditions even under enzyme limiting conditions. Substrate and product DNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide (w/v)/7 m urea gel. The products were then visualized using phosphorimaging and quantitated using Quantity One™ software (Bio-Rad). Results obtained under single-turnover conditions were fit to Equation 2, y=A(1-e-kobst)(Eq. 2) where A is the product formed in first binding event, kobs is the rate constant defining polymerization under the conditions used for the experiment being analyzed, and t is time. Results obtained under conditions that allowed a second round of Dpo4·DNA binding and polymerase action were fit to Equation 3, y=A(1-e-kobst)+ksst(Eq. 3) where kss represents a steady-state velocity of nucleotide incorporation. Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Oligonucleotide Products from Dpo4 Reactions—Dpo4 (5 μm) was preincubated with primer/template DNA (10 μm), and the reaction was initiated by addition of dNTP (1 mm each) and Mg2+ (5 mm) for a final volume of 100 μl. Dpo4 catalysis was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 4 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8 at 25 °C) buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg μl-1 bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol (v/v). The reaction was terminated by extraction of the remaining dNTPs by using a size-exclusion chromatography column (Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column, Bio-Rad). Concentrated stocks of Tris-HCl, DTT, and EDTA were added to restore the concentrations to 50 mm, 5 mm, and 1 mm, respectively. Next, E. coli uracil DNA glycosylase (20 units, Sigma-Aldrich) was added and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h to hydrolyze the uracil residue on the extended primer (22Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.Y. Irimia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

The reaction mixture was then heated at 95 °C for 1 h in the presence of 0.25 m piperidine, followed by removal of the solvent by centrifugation under vacuum. The dried sample was re-suspended in 100 μl of H2O for MS analysis. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Waters Aquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography system (Waters, Milford, MA) connected to a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron Corp., San Jose, CA), operating in the electrospray ionization negative ion mode. An Aquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography BEH octadecylsilane (C18) column (1.7 μm, 1.0 mm × 100 mm) was used with the following LC conditions: buffer A contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 plus 2% CH3CN (v/v), and buffer B contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 plus 95% CH3CN (v/v). The following gradient program was used with a flow rate of 150 μl min-1: 0-3 min, linear gradient from 100% A to 97%A/3% B (v/v); 3-4.5 min, linear gradient to 80% A/20% B (v/v); 4-5.5 min, linear gradient to 100% B; 5-5.5 min, hold at 100% B; 5.5-6.5 min, linear gradient to 100% A; 6.5-9.5 min, hold at 100% A. The temperature of the column was maintained at 50 °C. Samples were infused with an autosampler system. Electrospray ionization conditions were as follows: source voltage, 4 kV; source current, 100 μA; auxillary gas flow rate setting, 20; sweep gas flow rate setting, 5; sheath gas flow setting, 34; capillary voltage, -49 V; capillary temperature, 350 °C; and tube lens voltage, -90 V. MS/MS conditions were as follows: normalized collision energy, 35%; activation Q, 0.250; and activation time, 30 ms. Product ion spectra were acquired over the range m/z 345-2000. The doubly (negatively) charged species were generally used for CID analysis. The calculations of the CID fragmentations of oligonucleotide sequences were done using a program linked to the Mass Spectrometry Group of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Utah (www.medlib.med.utah.edu/massspec). The nomenclature used in supplemental Tables S1-S3 has been described previously (28Christian N.P. Reilly J.P. Mokler V.R. Wincott F.E. Ellington A.D. J. Am. Soc.

Crystallization of Dpo4·DNA Complexes—Dpo4 was concentrated to ∼300-550 μm (∼12-22 mg ml-1) using a spin concentrator with a 104 Mr cutoff filter (Amicon) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 25 °C) buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol (v/v). Dpo4 was then mixed with DNA (1:1.2 molar ratio), incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, centrifuged at 104 rpm for 5 min (Eppendorf, centrifuge 5415C) to remove insoluble material, and then placed on ice for 1 h prior to incubation with 1 mm d(N)TP and 5 mm CaCl2. Crystals were grown using the sitting drop, vapor-diffusion method by mixing 1 μl of complex with 1 μl of solution containing 5-10% polyethylene glycol 3350 (w/v), and 100 mm Ca(OAc)2, and equilibrated against a well solution containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 25 °C) buffer, 5-10% polyethylene glycol 3350 (w/v), 100 mm Ca(OAc)2, and 2.5% glycerol (v/v). Crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing an additional 25% polyethylene glycol 3350 (w/v) and 15% ethylene glycol (v/v), and then swiped through paratone-N (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and flash frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data sets for Dpo4 ternary O6-MeG:C and O6-MeG:dATP complexes were collected at 100 K using a radiation wavelength of 1.54 Å on a Bruker Microstar (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI) system housed in the Center for Structural Biology at Vander-bilt. Data sets for the O6-MeG:T were collected at 110 K using synchrotron radiation wavelength of 0.98 Å on the X25 beam-line at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven, NY. Indexing and scaling were performed using HKL2000 (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). All three structures indexed to the same space group and had very similar unit cell parameters. Structure Determination and Refinement—The refined Dpo4-dG model (23Zang H. Irimia A. Choi J.Y.

Goodenough A.K. Choi J.Y. Irimia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

In each instance, several rounds of rigid body refinement of the diffraction data, with gradually increasing resolution, optimized the initial positions of the models. The model was refined further using the CNS Solve package (version 1.1) (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Individual occupancy refinement was necessary to establish the final model for the active site thymidine residue in the O6-MeG:T structure. Manual model building was performed using TURBO. 3C.

Extension of Oligonucleotide Primers by Dpo4 in the Presence of All Four dNTPs—A time course performed under enzyme-limiting conditions provides a general measure of how Dpo4 catalysis is affected by O6-MeG (Fig. 2). An observed rate constant defining five incorporation events can be measured by following the appearance of the fully extended 18-mer primer and fitting the data to Equation 1, where n = 5. The amount of product formed in the first binding event (i.e. the “burst” amplitude) is diminished by roughly 25% relative to what is observed with the DNA control indicating that fewer Dpo4 molecules are able to fully extend the primer in the first attempt (Fig. 2C). It is important to note that, in the absence of any other evidence (see below), the exact identity of the fully extended product is unknown. Dpo4 Catalysis in the Presence of a Single dNTP—In the next set of experiments, Dpo4 catalysis was allowed to proceed in the presence of a single nucleotide. Dpo4 can incorporate each of the four dNTPs across from O6-MeG (supplemental Fig. S1). Steady-state kinetic assays were then employed as a first quantitative measure of the preferential mechanism for Dpo4 insertion opposite O6-MeG. The relative catalytic efficiency of nucleotide incorporation by Dpo4 was determined by varying the concentration of dNTP in the reaction solution (Table 1). Dpo4-catalyzed incorporation of dCTP opposite O6-MeG is inhibited ∼103-fold relative to unmodified DNA, but the enzyme is ∼3-, ∼6-, and ∼14-fold more efficient at correct incorporation of C opposite O6-MeG compared with incorrect incorporation of T, A, and G, respectively.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters for one-base incorporation by Dpo4Oligomer pairPrimer-template pairdNTPkcatKm,dNTPΔEfficiency relative to dCTP:Gs−1μm13-merdCTP0.58 ± 0.013.0 ± 0.218-mer-1-G-13-merdCTP0.071 ± 0.005340 ± 70950-fold less18-mer-1-O6MeG-13-merdTTP0.11 ± 0.012100 ± 5003600-fold less18-mer-1-G-13-merdTTP0.088 ± 0.0031200 ± 1202600-fold less18-mer-1-O6MeG-13-merdATP0.012 ± 0.001225 ± 223600-fold less18-mer-1-G-13-merdATP0.0022 ± 0.000171 ± 166000-fold less18-mer-1-O6MeG-13-merdGTP0.012 ± 0.001760 ± 13012000-fold less18-mer-1-G-13-merdGTP0.008 ± 0.001590 ± 7013500-fold less18-mer-1-O6MeG- Open table in a new tab LC-MS/MS Analysis of Full-length Extension Products—Unambiguous identification of full-length extension products resulting from Dpo4 catalysis was carried out as described previously (23Zang H. Irimia A. Choi J.Y. Angel K.C. Loukachevitch L.V. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2358-2372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), with slight modifications that are described under “Experimental Procedures.” MS results for Dpo4-catalyzed incorporation opposite and extension past O6-MeG modified template DNA are summarized in Fig. 3. Two major ions were observed at m/z 1078.6 and 719.1, corresponding with the -2 and -3 ions, respectively (Fig. 3B). The total ion trace for the m/z 1079 ion MS/MS is shown in Fig. 3C, and CID analysis of the m/z 1079 ion resulted in the fragmentation pattern shown in Fig. 3D. The major ions in the fragmentation pattern are consistent with the sequence, 5′-pTCCATGA-3′ (supplemental Table S1), which corresponds to the insertion of C opposite O6-MeG and accurate full-length extension of the primer. A second pair of ions was detected at m/z 1086.1 and 723.8, both of which are consistent with the -2 and -3 charge states of a parent ion representing T insertion opposite O6-MeG followed by accurate full-length extension. CID provided a fragmentation pattern consistent with this sequence assignment (supplemental Fig. S2 and Table S2). The third ion pair, 1090.7 and 726.8, was identified as A insertion products, again followed by accurate full-length extension (supplemental Fig. S3 and Table S3). Comparison of the selected ion counts (for the ions corresponding to all three products) indicates that correct incorporation of C opposite O6-MeG comprises roughly 70% of the full-length extension products observed in the reaction mixture. Misincorporation of T accounted for ∼20% of the products, and A accounted for the remaining ∼10%, consistent with the steady-state parameters. Transient-state Kinetic Analysis for Dpo4 Bypass of O6-MeG—Pre-steady-state experiments were performed under enzyme-limiting conditions in the presence of dCTP alone. The presence of O6-MeG in the template strand reduces the amount of product generated in the first catalytic turnover by roughly 3-fold under the experimental conditions used here (Fig. 4). The kobs value is 4.4-fold slower for incorporation opposite O6-MeG compared with undamaged DNA at this particular concentration of nucleoside triphosphate (1 mm dCTP). Previous studies suggest that phosphoryl transfer (i.e. the “chemistry” step) is not the rate-limiting step that defines correct dNTP incorporation by Dpo4 (24Fiala K.A. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One approach to determining the overall contribution of “chemistry” to the polymerase catalytic cycle involves substituting sulfur for one of the oxygen atoms in the α-phosphate group. In principle, substitution of oxygen with a less electronegative sulfur atom makes bond breakage (and subsequent phosphoryl transfer) more difficult. If phosphoryl transfer is the rate-limiting step in the multistep polymerase catalytic cycle then the sulfur substitution experiment will exhibit a decreased rate of nucleotide incorporation, although interpretation of such changes are a matter of some debate (32Joyce C.M. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14317-14324Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The measured reduction in kobs upon substitution of sulfur for oxygen (“thio” effect) for unmodified G was ∼1.9 (Fig. 4A), which is similar to previous phosphorothioate substitution experiments with Dpo4 that resulted in a thio effect of ∼1.4 (24Fiala K.A.

https://openalex.org/W2068286667,"Organisms respond to changes in their environment, and many such responses are initiated at the level of gene transcription. Here, we provide evidence for a previously undiscovered mechanism for directing transcriptional regulators to new binding targets in response to an environmental change. We show that repressor-activator protein 1 (Rap1), a master regulator of yeast metabolism, binds to an expanded target set after glucose depletion despite decreasing protein levels and no evidence of posttranslational modification. Computational analysis predicts that proteins capable of recruiting the chromatin regulator Tup1 act to restrict the binding distribution of Rap1 in the presence of glucose. Deletion of the gene(s) encoding Tup1, recruiters of Tup1 or chromatin regulators recruited by Tup1 cause Rap1 to bind specifically and inappropriately to low-glucose targets. These data, combined with whole-genome measurements of nucleosome occupancy and Tup1 distribution, provide evidence for a mechanism of dynamic target specification that coordinates the genome-wide distribution of intermediate-affinity DNA sequence motifs with chromatin-mediated regulation of accessibility to those sites."
https://openalex.org/W1973255115,"Junctional Adhesion Molecules (JAMs) have been described as major components of tight junctions in endothelial and epithelial cells. Tight junctions are crucial for the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. During tumor development, they are remodeled, enabling neoplastic cells to escape from constraints imposed by intercellular junctions and to adopt a migratory behavior. Using a carcinoma cell line we tested whether JAM-C could affect tight junctions and migratory properties of tumor cells. We show that transfection of JAM-C improves the tight junctional barrier in tumor cells devoid of JAM-C expression. This is dependent on serine 281 in the cytoplasmic tail of JAM-C because serine mutation into alanine abolishes the specific localization of JAM-C in tight junctions and establishment of cell polarity. More importantly, the same mutation stimulates integrin-mediated cell migration and adhesion via the modulation of β1 and β3 integrin activation. These results highlight an unexpected function for JAM-C in controlling epithelial cell conversion from a static, polarized state to a pro-migratory phenotype.

These results highlight an unexpected function for JAM-C in controlling epithelial cell conversion from a static, polarized state to a pro-migratory phenotype. Tight junctions play a fundamental role in the generation of cell polarity in epithelial and endothelial cells. They delimitate the apical and the basolateral plasma membrane domains and restrict the free diffusion of integral membrane proteins and lipids between them (1Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar).

The protein JAM-A is involved in the formation of tight junctions, acting as an anchor recruiting polarity complex proteins to intercellular junctions via its PDZ binding motif (5Rehder D. Iden S.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Similarly to JAM-A, previous studies have shown that the PDZ binding site of JAM-C interacts with Par-3 and ZO-1, both acting as scaf-folds for larger polarity complexes (8Ebnet K. Aurrand-Lions M. Kuhn A. Kiefer F. Butz S. Zander K. Meyer zu Brickwedde M.K. Suzuki A. Imhof B.A. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116 (Pt. 19): 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Maintenance of cell polarity is crucial for tissue integrity. The development of cancers is frequently associated with loss of cellular apico-basal polarity, enabling tumor epithelial cells to escape the constraints imposed by intercellular junctions and tissue organization. Epithelial plasticity ranges from subtle phenotypic changes to complete epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (9Grunert S. Jechlinger M. Beug H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Mesenchymal transformation is characterized by disruption of intercellular contacts, loss of epithelium-specific proteins, switch to a mesenchymal gene expression pattern, and gain of invasive properties (10Thiery J.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 442-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (5431) Google Scholar). In contrast, during morphogenesis, epithelial cells transiently down-modulate or relocalize junctional proteins without losing cell-cell contacts (11Zegers M.M. O'Brien L.E. Yu W. Datta A. Mostov K.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 169-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 12Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). This occurs during development but has a fundamental role in tumor progression from adenoma to carcinoma. Disorganization of tight junctions occurs concomitantly with activation of the cytoskeleton machinery into a pro-migratory state of the cell, due in part to activation of integrin complexes that provide the physical link between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular environment (13Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar). Indeed, by interacting with their ligands, including the members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, integrins initiate intracellular responses that lead to an increase in cell migration, adhesion, or integrin activation (14Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 15Imhof B.A. Dunon D. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 345-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter is also controlled by “inside-out” signals that tune the affinity of integrins for their ligands (16Wehrle-Haller B. Imhof B. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 382-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). JAM-C expression has been found in carcinoma cell lines (17Santoso S. Orlova V.V. Song K. Sachs U.J. Andrei-Selmer C.L. Chavakis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36326-36333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the role of JAM-C during tumor formation remains to be determined. In the present study, we investigated the role of JAM-C in tight junction plasticity and integrin activation associated to the tumor process. We took advantage of the tumor cell line KLN205, which is devoid of JAM-C expression and displays an intermediate transformed phenotype, representing an ideal model to test the function of JAM-C during epithelial-to mesenchymal transformation (18Aurrand-Lions M. Johnson-Leger C. Wong C. Pasquier L.Du Imhof B.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We show that JAM-C expression in KLN205 cells restores an epithelial phenotype in respect to tight junction formation and trans-epithelial electrical resistance. In addition, mutation of the serine 281 amino acid of JAM-C into alanine (J-C S281A) abolishes this effect and induces a pro-adhesive and pro-migratory phenotype of the cells. In agreement, we show that the S281A mutation of JAM-C activates β3 integrins. Hence, we demonstrate that the JAM-C phosphorylation status is involved in the switch from a static, polarized state to a pro-migratory phenotype occurring during neoplastic progression. Expression Vectors—JAM-C and JAM-CEGFP constructs have been previously described (19Lamagna C. Meda P. Mandicourt G. Brown J. Gilbert R.J. Jones E.Y. Kiefer F. Ruga P. Imhof B.A. Aurrand-Lions M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4992-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The point mutation in J-C S281A was generated by a PCR-based approach using Pfu-Turbo® DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Briefly, mutagenic primers were used to amplify the plasmidic matrix DNA encoding the full-length sequence of JAM-C. After 15 cycles of amplification, the PCR mix was digested using DpnI to degrade the matrix plasmidic DNA and recover amplification products that were transformed in bacteria. Mutated plasmids were then sequenced on both strands using the Thermo Sequence Fluorescent-labeled Primer Cycle Sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and the LI-COR DNA Analysis System (MWG-Biotech GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany). From this product, the J-C S281AEGFP construct was generated with the same strategy as the one used for the generation of JAM-CEGFP. Antibodies—The rat monoclonal antibody against mouse JAM-C (F26) was previously described (18Aurrand-Lions M. Johnson-Leger C. Wong C. Pasquier L.Du Imhof B.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 3699-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The KM16 anti-β1 integrin and the HMβ3 anti-β3 integrin are from BD Biosciences. The polyclonal anti-ZO-1 is from Zymed Laboratories (Invitrogen). F-actin was visualized with Texas Red®-X phalloidin (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). The 9EG7 anti-β1 integrin was kindly provided by D. Vestweber, Münster, Germany (20Lenter M. Uhlig H. Hamann A. Jeno P. Imhof B. Vestweber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9051-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Cell Lines and Transfections—KLN205 cells (21Kaneko T. LePage G.A. Shnitka T.K. In Vitro. 1980; 16: 884-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and CHO cells in F12 medium (Invitrogen), both supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. TransIT®-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus Bio Corp.) was used for stable transfection according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Cells were cultured in the presence of 1 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen) to select for stable expressing cells. JAM-C-expressing cells were selected using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FacStar; BD Biosciences) after immunostaining with appropriate antibodies. Transfected cells were selected for comparable amounts of JAM-C expression and used without clonal selection to avoid artifacts due to clonal variations (supplemental Fig. S1). Western Blot—Cells were incubated in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl with 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (chymostatin, leupeptin, anti-pain A, pepstatin A, each at 1 μg/ml, Sigma) for 30 min on ice. Afterward, the lysed cells were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged. The supernatant was collected, and protein content was measured with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of total extracts (50 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE before transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Uniform loading of lanes was verified both by immunoblotting of total actin and Ponceau red staining. The membrane was blocked for 60 min at room temperature in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS-Tween) and 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder and then incubated either overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies anti-JAM-C rat monoclonal (F26) or anti-total actin rabbit serum (1:5000) (gift from G. Gabbiani, University of Geneva). After extensive washing in PBS-Tween, the membrane was incubated for 60 min at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). The membrane was then washed extensively in PBS-Tween, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). In Vivo Labeling and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Confluent KLN205 cells stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged JAM-C wild-type or JAM-C S281A were washed in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and subsequently metabolically labeled for 14 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml) supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 1 mm Pefabloc, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 1 μg of pepstatin A/ml, 1 mm dithiothreitol), and JAM-C was immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After excision of the bands corresponding to JAM-C, amino acids were released by acid hydrolysis with constant boiling hydrochloric acid for 1 h at 100°C and separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis on thin layer cellulose plates using a Hunter HTLE 7000 apparatus (C. B. S. Scientific Company, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Epithelial Cultures Using the Air/Liquid System—For JAM-C junctional distribution study and trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TER) measurement, KLN205 cells were cultured in an air/liquid system to allow optimal organization of monolayers (22Forteza R. Salathe M. Miot F. Forteza R. Conner G.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on 0.4-μm pore size polycarbonate filters (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). When confluence was reached, the medium in the upper chamber was removed, allowing air contact with the cells and the complete polarization of the monolayer. The setting up of the polarity of the monolayer was followed by the measurement of TER using a WPI EVOM Electrod port (World Precision Instruments). It is important to note that the TER of a non-polarized KLN205 monolayer is usually ∼500 Ohms × cm2 and increases up to >2000 Ohms × cm2 when tightness of cell-cell contacts is complete. Immunofluorescent Staining—For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with paraformaldehyde containing 0.01% Triton for 5 min prior to washing with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Cells were then incubated with the corresponding primary antibody for 1 h, washed, and further incubated with secondary antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Texas Red (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). Images were acquired using a confocal microscope Zeiss LSM510 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—Trypsinized adherent cells were collected, washed once with 10% fetal calf serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then resuspended in 0.2% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Cells were incubated with corresponding primary antibody on ice for 30–60 min. After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated with the appropriate isotype-matched phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) on ice for 30–60 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS followed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). The flow cytometer was calibrated using single phycoerythrin-stained cells. Results of individual cell lines are expressed as a plot of frequency versus log fluorescence. Adhesion Assay—KLN205 cells were labeled using PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker kit (Sigma) 1 day before use to avoid any problem with toxicity. Adhesion was performed in 96-well plates (Costar 9017; Corning Inc., Corning, NY) coated with either 10 μg/ml of fibronectin or different concentrations of vitronectin diluted in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1.25 mm CaCl2, and 0.8 mm MgCl2, for 60 min at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and washed four times. The fluorescence of adherent cells was quantified in a CytoFluor plate reader with excitation at 544 nm and emission at 590 nm (FlexStation; Molecular Devices). For blocking studies, cells were incubated with the 9EG7 anti-β1 integrin and the HMβ3 anti-β3 integrin-blocking antibodies, the KM16 anti-β1 integrin non-blocking antibody, or the integrin-blocking RGD peptide (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) during the adhesion period. For adhesion on vitronectin, the time of incubation was reduced to 30 min. Spreading Assay—KLN205 cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml of fibronectin. After 90 min, the majority of cells adhered to the fibronectin. Cells were fixed and then washed several times, and photographs were taken with phase contrast optics using an epifluorescent microscope (Zeiss-Axiovert 100, Zurich, Switzerland), with CP Achromat × 10/0.25 Ph1 objective (Zeiss), equipped with a C4742-95-10 digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) controlled by the Open-lab software (Improvision, Coventry, UK). Cells were considered as unspread when they appeared round and bright and spread when they appeared darker. The ratio was calculated by the number of spread cells divided by the total number of adherent cells. Migration Assay—Cell migration was studied by wounding assays. Cells were plated at high density (106 cells/ml) on glass coverslips and grown for 2 days in order to reach a dense, contact-inhibited monolayer. A wound was then created by scratching the monolayer with a yellow pipette tip, and the closure of the wound by migrating cells was followed over 8 h by time lapse microscopy using the same equipment as for the spreading assay completed with an incubation chamber with the temperature and CO2 set at 37 °C and 10%, respectively. Statistical Analysis—Bar graphs represent the mean and ± S.E. All experiments were evaluated with the Student's t test, using GraphPad Prism (www.graphpad.com/). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Junctional Localization of JAM-C in Epithelial Cells Is Controlled by Phosphorylation of Serine 281—To explore the function of JAM-C in polarized cells, we took advantage of the mouse tumor cell line of epithelial origin, KLN205, which lacks endogenous expression of JAM-C (Fig. 1). When expressed in KLN205 cells JAM-C colocalized with ZO-1 (Fig. 1B). Having previously shown that the localization of JAM-C at cell-cell borders of non-polarized cells is negatively regulated by serine phosphorylation (8Ebnet K. Aurrand-Lions M. Kuhn A. Kiefer F. Butz S. Zander K. Meyer zu Brickwedde M.K. Suzuki A. Imhof B.A. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116 (Pt. 19): 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we looked to see whether it is the case in the polarized KLN205 cells. The cytoplasmic tail of JAM-C contains a single phosphorylatable serine residue conserved across species (Fig. 2A). To analyze whether this serine residue is involved in cell-cell contact localization of JAM-C, we generated stable KLN205 cell lines expressing either JAM-C or JAM-C S281A. By phosphoamino acid analysis, we found that JAM-C is phosphorylated on serine residues in these cells (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the serine phosphorylation signal was markedly reduced in cells expressing JAM-C S281A despite the same amounts of JAM-C immunoprecipitated from the two cell lines (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that JAM-C is phosphorylated on serine 281 in KLN205 cells. Interestingly, this mutation affected the localization of the protein at cell borders. The J-C S281A mutated protein appeared highly enriched to cell-cell borders of CHO cells (Fig. 2C). In KLN205 cells, the distribution of the mutated protein to cell borders was more diffuse as compared with the wild-type protein, which was localized to the apical region of the lateral membrane domain (Fig. 2D). To further compare the localization of JAM-C and the J-C S281A mutated protein along the lateral membrane, KLN205 cells were grown in an air/liquid culture system that allows a full apico-basolateral polarization of the cells. Under these conditions, the wild-type protein was localized to the tight junctional region of KLN205 cell contacts (Fig. 3A). By contrast, the serine 281 unphosphorylatable mutant of JAM-C (J-C S281A) was massively enriched at cell-cell borders and displayed a lateral localization, overflowing the tight junction area (Fig. 3A), showing that serine 281 phosphorylation regulates JAM-C localization not only in the poorly polarized CHO cells but also in the more polarized KLN205 cells. In addition, expression of JAM-C in KLN205 cells resulted in a better organization of the cell monolayer as depicted by the regular square-shaped morphology of the cells, suggesting that JAM-C may have improved apico-basal polarity of KLN205 cells.FIGURE 2Serine 281 of JAM-C is phosphorylated and regulates intercellular localization of the protein. A, alignment of human and murine amino acid sequences of JAM-A, JAM-B, and JAM-C cytoplasmic tails. Identical and homologous amino acids are shaded in dark and light gray, respectively. The star indicates the conserved serine 281; the PDZ binding motif is underlined. B, part a, confluent KLN205 cells stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged JAM-C wild-type (WT) or JAM-C mutant S281A (JAM-C S281A) were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and subjected to immunoprecipitation with JAM-C antibodies. Note that equal amounts of JAM-C immunoprecipitates were used in the following phosphopeptide analysis. Part b, phosphoamino acid analysis of JAM-C. Immunoprecipitates shown in part a were hydrolyzed, the resulting amino acids were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis, and the remaining phosphorylation signals were displayed by 32P autoradiography. The circles indicate the positions of comigrating cold phosphoamino acids. Sample origins are indicated by black crosses. Arrows indicate electrophoresis directions at respective pH conditions. Note that JAM-C is phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues (JAM-C WT, left panel) and that a major portion of the phosphorylation signal gets lost by substitution of serine 281 to alanine (JAM-C S281A, right panel), indicating that Ser-281 reflects the main phosphorylation site in JAM-C expressed by KLN205 cells.

Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments, and one representative experiment is shown. ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the TER of cell monolayers reflects the polarity of epithelial cells (22Forteza R. Salathe M. Miot F. Forteza R. Conner G.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2005; 32: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), we compared the TER of non-transfected, JAM-C and J-C S281A-transfected KLN205 cells. We found that the expression of JAM-C increases the TER up to 2200 Ohms × cm2, whereas the TER of non-transfected or J-C S281A-transfected cells remains at ∼500 Ohms × cm2 (Fig. 3B). This is in agreement with the observation that the morphology of intercellular contacts was improved upon JAM-C transfection as visualized by electron microscopy (supplemental Fig. S2). These results indicate that JAM-C improves the junctional barrier properties of KLN205 monolayers and that this effect is dependent on JAM-C phosphorylation at serine 281. JAM-C S281A Increases Cell Adhesion and Migration—Having shown that JAM-C improves tightness of cellular contacts in carcinoma cells and restores a more epithelial phenotype, we addressed the question whether JAM-C affects other cardinal features of tumor cells, such as adhesion and migration. Surprisingly, we found no significant difference in adhesion of untransfected and JAM-C-transfected KLN205 cells on different substrates. In contrast, expression of the J-C S281A mutant dramatically increased cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained using CHO- and Madin-Darby canine kidney-transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that serine 281 of JAM-C is critically involved in the control of cell interaction with the extracellular matrix. Fibronectin is a versatile substrate allowing cells to adhere, spread, and migrate. We then investigated whether JAM-C expression influences cell spreading and found that the J-C S281A unphosphorylatable mutant significantly reduced cell spreading when compared with cells expressing no or wild-type JAM-C (Fig. 5). Because the JAM-C phosphorylation state modulated both adhesion and spreading of cells to fibronectin, it was likely that migration was also affected. Wounding assays using cell monolayers showed that mutant J-C S281A substantially increased and wild-type JAM-C slightly increased cell migration when compared with non-transfected cells (Fig. 6). This differential effect occurred immediately after cell wounding and was maximal after 6 h. At this time, J-C S281A-transfected KLN205 cells completely closed the wound whereas untransfected cells still kept it open. The differences observed in the wounding assay were not due to other mechanisms such as cell proliferation because growth rates of the different cell types were identical (supplemental Fig. S4).FIGURE 6JAM-C regulates cell migration and wound closure. A, representative micrographs of wound healing performed on non-transfected KLN205 cells or cells expressing JAM-C or the S281A mutated form of the protein are shown. Pictures obtained at time 0 and 6 h after wounding are shown.

Hence we investigated whether this occurs via regulation of integrin avidity for their ligands. KLN205 cells express both β1 and β3 integrin subunits, which are receptors for fibronectin (Figs. 7C and 8C). We first focused on β1 integrins, which are the main receptors for fibronectin, and performed adhesion and spreading assay in the presence of the anti-β1-blocking antibody 9EG7.

To identify novel MITF target genes, we have overexpressed MITF in the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 subclone 4 (RAW/C4) and examined the gene expression profile after sRANKL-stimulated osteoclastogenesis. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes superinduced by MITF overexpression, including Clcn7 (chloride channel 7) and Ostm1 (osteopetrosis-associated transmembrane protein 1). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we identified two MITF-binding sites (M-boxes) in the Clcn7 promoter and a single M-box in the Ostm1 promoter. An anti-MITF antibody supershifted DNA-protein complexes for promoter sites in both genes, whereas MITF binding was abolished by mutation of these sites. The Clcn7 promoter was transactivated by coexpression of MITF in reporter gene assays. Mutation of one Clcn7 M-box prevented MITF transactivation, but mutation of the second MITF-binding site only reduced basal activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that the two Clcn7 MITF binding and responsive regions in vitro bind MITF in genomic DNA. The expression of Clcn7 is repressed in the dominant negative mutant Mitf mouse, mi/mi, indicating that the dysregulated bone resorption seen in these mice can be attributed in part to transcriptional repression of Clcn7. MITF regulation of the TRAP, cathepsin K, Clcn7, and Ostm1 genes, which are critical for osteoclast resorption, suggests that the role of MITF is more significant than previously perceived and that MITF may be a master regulator of osteoclast function and bone resorption.

MITF regulation of the TRAP, cathepsin K, Clcn7, and Ostm1 genes, which are critical for osteoclast resorption, suggests that the role of MITF is more significant than previously perceived and that MITF may be a master regulator of osteoclast function and bone resorption. Bone-resorbing osteoclasts are multinucleated cells that are derived from the hematopoietic myeloid/monocyte lineage. Normal bone remodeling is controlled by the close interactions between osteoclasts and osteoblasts, the primary bone-synthesizing cells. The balance between the activities of these two cell types is controlled by tight transcriptional regulation of both osteoclast-specific and osteoblast-specific genes along with signaling mechanisms that couple the actions of these cells. Defects in the transcriptional control of osteoclasts can result in a failure of either cell differentiation or function. The resulting loss of bone resorption results in the development of osteopetrosis, a condition characterized by dense brittle bones and the lack of a marrow cavity. The use of transgenic gene knock-out mice has elucidated the role of several transcription factors in regulating osteoclast differentiation and function. Null mutations in PU.1 (1Tondravi M.M.

MITF is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (b-HLH-ZIP) family of transcription factors. This family is defined by the presence of a DNA-binding basic region, the HLH motif, and the protein association leucine zipper domain motif (8Moore K.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 442-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Together with TFEB, TFEC, and TFE3, MITF forms part of the MiT (Mitf-TFE) subgroup of the b-HLH-ZIP family. These MiT factors form homodimers and heterodimers with each other but do not heterodimerize with b-HLH-ZIP factors of other subfamilies (9Hemesath T.J. Steingrímsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2770-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). All MiT factors are expressed in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage with TFE3 and TFEB being widely expressed in other cell types but TFEC being restricted to myeloid cells (10Rehli M. Lichanska A. Cassady A.I. Ostrowski M.C. Hume D.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1559-1565PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous loss-of-function or deletion mutations of Mitf in the mouse result in an absence of coat pigmentation, deafness, and microphthalmia (8Moore K.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 442-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Homozygous semi-dominant mutations in Mitf affect cell types, including osteoclasts, mast cells, and NK cells (8Moore K.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 442-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Heterozygous mutations of the Mitf gene in humans result in Waardenburg syndrome type 2a (11Tassabehji M. Newton V.E. Read A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) and Tietz syndrome (12Amiel J. Watkin P.M. Tassabehji M. Read A.P. Winter R.M. Clin. Dysmorphol. 1998; 7: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which are characterized by deafness and hypopigmentation of the hair, skin, and iris. The mi mutant allele of Mitf has a 3-bpr deletion, which removes one of four arginine residues in the basic region that are necessary for MITF binding to DNA (9Hemesath T.J. Steingrímsson E.

Higashibata Y. Oboki K. Sato M. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2001; 19: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As a result, the mi/mi mouse has a severe defect in osteoclast maturation that produces profound osteopetrosis. This is characterized by the lack of a ruffled border, failure to fuse in order to form multinucleated cells, and ultimately a defect in bone resorption (14Graves L. II I Jilka R.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 145: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Glowacki J. Cox K.A. Wilcon S. Bone Miner. 1989; 5: 271-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The osteopetrotic defect in the mi/mi mice therefore results from deficiencies in the terminal differentiation and function of osteoclasts and differs from other osteopetrotic mouse defects, including null mutations of PU.1, c-Fos, and NF-κB, in which earlier stages of osteoclast differentiation are affected (1Tondravi M.M.

The activation of MITF in osteoclasts via the phosphorylation of serine residues is dependent on TRAF6-mediated signaling in response to RANKL binding to its receptor, RANK (16Steingrímsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 365-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Site-directed alanine substitution of Ser-73 or Ser-409 results in transcriptionally inactive MITF, and these residues are targets of phosphorylation by MAP kinase and RSK-1 (17Hemesath T.J.

We propose that this will provide a unique insight into mature osteoclast function, in particular the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with osteoclastic bone resorption. To determine the role of MITF in mature osteoclast function, we identified genes with high expression in osteoclast-like cells late in the differentiation process. One such gene is Clcn7 (chloride channel 7), which is the major chloride channel expressed in the ruffled border of the mature osteoclast (41Kornak U. Kasper D. Bosl M.R. Kaiser E. Schweizer M. Schulz A. Friedrich W. Delling G. Jentsch T.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The expression of Clcn7 was also affected in cells with dysregulated levels of MITF protein. Disruption of CLCN7 activity leads to severe osteopetrosis in mice and humans because of a failure of the osteoclast to secrete acid (41Kornak U. Kasper D. Bosl M.R. Kaiser E. Schweizer M. Schulz A.

Cormier-Daire V. Hum. Genet. 2003; 112: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The grey-lethal (gl) murine and human alleles contain a mutation in the Ostm1 gene and are characterized by severe osteopetrosis (43Ramirez A. Faupel J. Goebel I. Stiller A. Beyer S. Stockle C. Hasan C. Bode U. Kornak U. Kubisch C. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The OSTM1 protein forms a complex with CLCN7 and as such has been proposed to be a β-subunit of active CLCN7 (44Lange P.F. Wartosch L. Jentsch T.J. Fuhrmann J.C. Nature. 2006; 440: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The osteopetrotic phenotype associated with Ostm1 mutations may result from the impairment of CLCN7-dependent acidification of the osteoclast resorption lacuna (44Lange P.F. Wartosch L. Jentsch T.J. Fuhrmann J.C. Nature. 2006; 440: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In this study, we report several lines of evidence that MITF regulates both the Clcn7 and Ostm1 genes during osteoclast maturation. In particular, reporter gene assays using transfection of osteoclast-like cells (OCL) coupled with electrophoretic mobility shift assays provide strong evidence of MITF regulation of the Clcn7 and Ostm1 promoters, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays validate MITF binding to the Clcn7 promoter. This study also shows that Clcn7 mRNA expression is repressed in primary osteoclasts derived from mi/mi mice and up-regulated in OCL overexpressing MITF protein. Our observation that MITF controls the expression of Clcn7 and Ostm1 along with TRAP and cathepsin K suggests that MITF is in fact a master regulator of a set of genes required for osteoclast function and bone resorption. Materials—We used the following: G418 (geneticin) (Sigma); the cytokines used were soluble recombinant human RANKL (sRANKL) (PeproTech) and human colony-stimulating factor-1 (a gift from Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA); the plasmids used were pEF6 (Invitrogen), pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI), and pEGFP-1 (Clontech); the cell lines used were RAW/C4 cells, a subclone of the RAW264.7 macrophage-like cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA (45Cassady A.I. Luchin A. Ostrowski M.C. Hume D.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1901-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)); the antibodies used were mouse anti-V5 antibody (Serotec, Oxford, UK), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Beverly, MA), goat anti-mouse phycoerythrin antibody (Molecular Probes), and mouse monoclonal anti-MITF antibody (NeoMarkers, Freemont, CA). Mice heterozygous for the mi mutation (B6C3Fe background) were obtained originally from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Generation of RAW/C4 Cell Lines Stably Transfected with an MITF Expression Construct and a TRAP Promoter-eGFP Reporter—The coding region of the wild type murine Mitf-A isoform was PCR-amplified using the following primers: sense primer (5′-CGG GTT CTG GTC CAA GTC CCA AGC AG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-ACA CGC ATG CTC CGT TTC TTC-3′) with the Mitf-pECE construct as the template. The PCR product was cloned into the pEF6/V5-His TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen). A murine 620-bp TRAP promoter-eGFP reporter construct, described previously, was used to monitor the activity of the exogenous proteins (6Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N.

RAW/C4 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 4 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Serum Supreme; BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). The cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml and cultured for 24 h before harvesting for transfection. RAW/C4 cells (5 × 106 cells/transfection) were electroporated at 0.28 kV and 1000 microfarads using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad), whereupon they were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 10 ml of culture medium and cultured at 37 °C. For stable transfection, 2 μg of selection plasmid (pNT-Neo, encoding geneticin resistance), 10 μg of expression plasmid (Mitf/pEF6), and 10 μg of reporter plasmid (pTRAP-eGFP) were used per transfection. After a 24-h recovery period, transfected cells were cultured in selection media containing 450 μg/ml geneticin for 2 weeks. Colonies resistant to the antibiotic were pooled and expanded, and expression was monitored using a combination of Western blotting, flow cytometry analysis, and immunofluorescence. The cell lines generated were RAW/C4-GFP-pEF6 (empty expression vector) and RAW/C4-GFP-pEF6-Mitf-A (Mitf isoform-A expression vector). Flow Cytometry Analysis of Fluorescently Activated Cells— Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS for analysis of green fluorescent protein expression on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed by analyzing 10,000 events for each assay using the Cellquest software package (BD Biosciences). The fluorescence intensity was divided into four regions, M1 to M4. M1 was set to encompass the background level of green autofluorescence exhibited by 99.9% of untransfected control cells; M2, M3, and M4 represented logarithmic increments of fluorescence intensity (100-, 1000-, and 10,000-fold above the background, respectively). All events with fluorescence intensity greater than the M1 region were accepted as cellular eGFP fluorescence events. The data are presented as shown in Equation 1, &percnt; eGFP−expressing cells=(M4)/(M2+M3+M4) (Eq. 1) Protein Isolation and Western Blotting—To isolate total cellular protein from cultured stable RAW/C4 cell lines, cells grown as monolayers were washed twice with PBS, pelleted, and then lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer (66 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% SDS). Protein lysates were resolved by electrophoresis on a 0.1% SDS, 12% polyacrylamide gel, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon transfer membrane; Millipore), which was blocked in 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBS-T) overnight at 4 °C. The V5 expressed protein tag encoded on the pEF6 vector was detected using a primary anti-V5 antibody (1:2000 dilution) (Serotec) by incubation for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed and incubated with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:1000 dilution). Image development was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Detection of Exogenous Proteins— RAW/C4 stable cell lines grown on coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then the cells were washed in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and labeled with primary anti-V5 antibody (1:2000 dilution) for 2 h. After washing with PBS, primary antibody was detected with a secondary goat anti-mouse phycoerythrin antibody (1:200 dilution) and incubated for 30 min. Cells were washed again with PBS and stained with DAPI (Sigma) for 15 min for visualization of nuclei. Cells were washed again and mounted onto glass coverslips using DAKO Cytomation fluorescent mounting media (Dako Corp., Carpenter, CA). Fluorescence microscopy was conducted on an Olympus AX-70 unit, and images were captured with NIH image 1.62 software using a Dage-MTI CCD300RC CCD camera. Culturing OCLs in Vitro and Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase Staining—For 5-day cultures, RAW/C4 cells were seeded at 3 × 104 cells in 10-cm tissue culture plastic plates (Corning Glass) and 5 × 103 cells/well in 6-well plates. For 7-day cultures, cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells in 10-cm plates, 1.6 × 103 cells/well in 6-well plates, and 0.5 × 103 cells/well in 48-well plates. All wells were pre-coated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma), and cells were grown in medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), 40 ng/ml sRANKL, and 104 units/ml CSF-1 with medium changes every 2–3 days. OCL were observed after 5–7 days in culture. Cells were subsequently harvested and separately processed for total RNA extraction and for nuclear protein extraction. Alternatively, cells were fixed and stained for the OCL marker TRAP using a commercially available kit (387-A; Sigma) and scored as TRAP+ multinucleated (more than three nuclei) cells. Hematopoietic precursors were obtained from the spleens of wild type mice and the spleens of mi/mi mice. OCLs were grown in the presence of 80 ng/ml receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (sRANKL, prepared as described (19Mansky K.C. Sankar U. Han J. Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11077-11083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar)) and 200 units/ml colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) with medium changes every 3 days. Cells were harvested after 5 days in culture. RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR—Total cell RNA was extracted and purified from cells using the RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Each sample was treated with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) and reverse-transcribed using a 17-mer oligo(dT) primer and the Superscript III RNase H reverse transcriptase kit or Superscript III first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Negative control samples (no first-strand synthesis) were prepared without the addition of reverse transcriptase. The cDNA was diluted to 100 μl with water, and 4 μl was used for quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) performed using the LightCycler-DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). The PCR was performed using an ABI Prism thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) as follows: 1 min hot start at 94 °C; 45 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 10 s at 60 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C. cDNA levels during the linear phase of amplification were normalized against Hprt (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase) controls. Assays were performed in triplicate, and the means ± S.D. were determined. Specific primers were used for qPCR as follows: mouse TRAP1C (GenBank™ accession number NM_007388) forward primer (5′-ACC TGT GCT TCC TCC AGG AT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TCT CAG GGT GGG AGT GGG-3′); mouse cathepsin K (GenBank™ accession number NM_007802) forward primer (5′-CCA TAT GTG GGC CAG GAT G-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TCA GGG CTT TCT CGT TCC C-3′); mouse Clcn7 (GenBank™ accession number NM_011930) forward primer (5′-GAC TGG CTG TGG GAA AGG AA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TCT CGC TTG AGT GAT GTT GAC C-3′); mouse Ostm1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_172416) forward primer (5′-TTG GAC AAT TAG TTC TAT CAT CG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GCC GGA CTG TAA CAG ATA GCT-3′). The relative expression levels were calculated using experimentally determined primer efficiency and the ΔCT method (47Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25871) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis and Data Handling—The microarray experiment was performed using 17.5 days post-coitum C57Bl/6J embryo total RNA as a common reference (48Miki R. Kadota K. Bono H. Mizuno Y.

Microarray experiments were performed in duplicate using independently generated RNA from OCL generated from the stable cell lines treated with sRANKL/CSF-1 for 5 days and untreated stable cell lines.

Various transcription factors are post-translationally modified by small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1). We investigated the role of the SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 in MR transactivation. Yeast two-hybrid, GST-pulldown, and coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that Ubc9 interacted with N-terminal MR-(1-670). Endogenous Ubc9 is associated with stably expressing MR in 293-MR cells. Transient transfection assays in COS-1 cells showed that Ubc9 increased MR transactivation of reporter constructs containing MRE, ENaC, or MMTV promoter in a hormone-sensitive manner. Moreover, reduction of Ubc9 protein levels by small interfering RNA attenuated hormonal activation of a reporter construct as well as an endogenous target gene by MR. A sumoylation-inactive mutant Ubc9(C93S) similarly interacted with MR and potentiated aldosterone-dependent MR transactivation. An MR mutant in which four lysine residues within sumoylation motifs were mutated into arginine (K89R/K399R/K494R/K953R) failed to be sumoylated, but Ubc9 similarly enhanced transactivation by the mutant MR, indicating that sumoylation activity is dispensable for coactivation capacity of Ubc9. Coexpression of Ubc9 and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) synergistically enhanced MR-mediated transactivation in transient transfection assays. Indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that endogenous MR, Ubc9, and SRC-1 were recruited to an endogenous ENaC gene promoter in a largely aldosterone-dependent manner. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed a complex of MR, Ubc9, and SRC-1 in mammalian cells, and the endogenous proteins were colocalized in the nuclei of the mouse collecting duct cells. These findings support a physiological role of Ubc9 as a transcriptional MR coactivator, beyond the known SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme.

However, molecular mechanisms to account for the successful treatment remain to be elucidated. MR functions are directed by specific activation domains, designated as activation function 1 (AF-1), which resides in the N terminus, and activation function 2 (AF-2), which resides in the C-terminal ligand-binding domain.

These coactivators have histone acetyltransferase activity to overcome repressive effects of chromatin structure on transcription. Besides these factors, several coregulators have various enzymatic activities, thus contributing to their abilities to enhance receptor-mediated transcription. The SUMO post-translationally modifies various proteins with roles in diverse processes, including regulation of transcription, chromatin structure, and DNA repair (15Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev.

Like ubiquitylation, the covalent attachment of SUMO to its targets (sumoylation) involves three enzymatic reactions as follows: the SUMO E1-activating, E2-conjugating enzymes, and E3 ligase. The SUMO E1 is a heterodimer of SAE1/SAE2 in mammals (Aos1/Uba2 in yeast). In contrast to the ubiquitin system where dozens of E2 enzymes have been identified, sumoylation uses only a single E2 enzyme, Ubc9. SUMO-1 is conjugated to target proteins at the consensus sequence ψKXE (where ψ is any hydrophobic amino acid, and X is any amino acid). Three unrelated proteins have SUMO E3 ligase activity to promote transfer of SUMO from E2 to specific substrates as follows: the protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (PIAS1) protein (20Kahyo T.

In this study, we focused on the protein-protein interaction between Ubc9 and MR. We describe a new function of Ubc9 as a coactivator of MR by formation of a complex with N-terminal MR and SRC-1 beyond the known SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme, although sumoylation of MR repressed the receptor-dependent transactivation. Antibodies—Goat anti-human MR (N-17) antibody, goat anti-human SRC-1 (M-341) antibody, and normal goat IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal anti-Xpress IgG was obtained from Invitrogen. Mouse anti-Ubc9 antibody was obtained from Pharmingen. Rabbit anti-HA antibody was obtained from Clontech. Mouse anti α-tubulin antibody was obtained from Oncogene. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—COS-1 cells, COS-7 cells, and HEK293 cells were routinely maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Twenty four hours before transfection, 5 × 104 cells per well of a 24-well dish were plated in the medium. All transfections were carried out by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 0.3 μg/well of the luciferase reporter, 0.01 μg/well of pRL-null internal control plasmids, and the indicated amounts of expression plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 18-24 h, the medium was changed to DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10-8 m aldosterone or vehicle. After an additional 24 h, cell extracts were assayed for both Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Relative luciferase activity was determined as ratio of Firefly/Renilla luciferase activities, and data were expressed as the mean (±S.D.) of triplicate values obtained from a representative experiment that was independently repeated at least three times.

In vitro-translated 35S-labeled proteins were obtained by using TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems (Promega). Crude lysates were incubated with the beads in 200 μl of beads incubation buffer for 60 min at 4 °C with a circle rotator. Finally the beads were washed five times with 1 ml of beads incubation buffer, and the proteins were solubilized in SDS loading buffer and analyzed on SDS-PAGE (12.5% polyacrylamide gel). The input lanes contained 20% of the labeled protein used for binding. Western Blot Analysis and Coimmunoprecipitation—The cells were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and Western blots were performed before the immunoprecipitation (IP) steps to confirm protein expression by corresponding antibodies as described previously (49Kobayashi S.

The cross-linked sheared chromatin solution was used for immunoprecipitation with 3 μg of anti-MR (N-17) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Ubc9 antibody (Pharmingen), or normal IgG. The immunoprecipitated DNAs were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated by ethanol, and amplified by PCR using primers flanking the MRE region or control region as follows: ENaC MRE sense primer, 5′-TTC CTT TCC AGC GCT GGC CAC-3′ (-1567/-1547); ENaC MRE antisense primer, 5′-CCT CCA ACC TTG TCC AGA CCC-3′ (-1317-1297); ENaC control sense primer, 5′-ATG GGC ATG GCC AGG-3′ (+1/+15); ENaC control antisense primer, 5′-CCT GCT CCT CAC GCT-3′ (+251/+265). DNA samples with serial dilution were amplified by PCR to determine the linear range for the amplification (data not shown). Immunohistochemical Staining—Tissues were isolated from 2-month-old wild type male mice, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and then processed for paraffin embedding. Sections (7 μm) were incubated for 2 h in blocking buffer, which is constituted by 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal donkey serum, 20 μg/ml donkey anti-mouse IgG Fab fragment (Jackson Immuno-Research, West Grove, PA), and 0.02% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and followed by incubation with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies used in this experiment were as follows: mouse anti-MR, rabbit anti-Ubc9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-SRC-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the optimized dilutions were 1:50-1:100. After incubation with the combination of primary antibodies (MR and Ubc9, MR and SRC-1), slides were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 4 °C. 4′,6-Diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used for nuclear staining. Fluorescence Imaging—The images of EGFP-tagged Ubc9 and YFP-tagged SRC-1 were described previously (49Kobayashi S. Shibata H. Kurihara I. Yokota K. Suda N. Saito I. Saruta T. J. Mol.

Live cell microscopy of DsRed fusion, EGFP fusion, or YFP fusion proteins was performed on a confocal microscope (Axiovert 100 M, Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.). Imaging for DsRed and EGFP or YFP was performed by excitation with 543 and 488 nm, respectively, from an argon laser, and the emissions were viewed through band passes ranging from 550 to 600 and 500-550 nm, respectively, by band pass regulation with LSM510 (Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.). All images were processed as tagged image file format (TIFF) files on Photoshop 7.0 using standard imageprocessing techniques. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—The effect of endogenous Ubc9 on the endogenous Sgk, Ubc9, and GAPDH levels in the presence of 10-8 m aldosterone was investigated by semiquantitative RT-PCR. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was extracted from 293-MR cells and reverse-transcribed as described previously. Procedures of RT-PCR were performed as described previously elsewhere. Preliminary experiments were conducted to ensure linearity for the semiquantitative procedures. Hot start PCR was performed by heat-activating AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 94 °C for 4 min. Optimized cycling condition was 30 cycles (for Sgk) or 20 cycles (for Ubc9 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) for 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Oligonucleotide prime"

Haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex formation promotes high affinity binding of hemoglobin to the macrophage scavenger receptor CD163 leading to endocytosis and degradation of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex. In contrast, complex formation between haptoglobin-related protein and hemoglobin does not promote high affinity interaction with CD163. To define structural components of haptoglobin important for CD163 recognition, we exploited this functional difference to design and analyze recombinant haptoglobin/haptoglobin-related protein chimeras complexed to hemoglobin. These data revealed that only the β-chain of haptoglobin is involved in receptor recognition. Substitution of 4 closely spaced amino acid residues of the haptoglobin β-chain (valine 259, glutamate 261, lysine 262, and threonine 264) abrogated the high affinity receptor binding. The 4 residues are encompassed by a part of the primary structure not present in other serine protease domain proteins. Structural modeling based on the well characterized serine protease domain fold suggests that this sequence represents a loop extension unique for haptoglobin and haptoglobin-related protein.

The primary function of Hp is to capture hemoglobin (Hb) leaking into plasma from ruptured erythrocytes and precursors during intravascular hemolysis. The resulting high affinity complex between Hp and Hb is cleared from the circulation by receptor-mediated endocytosis via the acute phase-regulated monocyte/macrophage-specific protein CD163 (1Kristiansen M.

The α- and β-chains are linked by a single disulfide bond. The Hp protein of most mammals is composed of two (αβ)-monomers linked together via a disulfide bond between the two α-chains generating an (αβ)2 structure (termed Hp1-1 in humans). However, three Hp phenotypes exist in humans due to the presence of two Hp gene alleles, designated Hp1 and Hp2. The Hp2 allele, which arose by an intragenic duplication of the Hp1 allele, encodes a slightly larger α-chain but is otherwise identical to the Hp1 allele. Because the cysteine residue connecting the α-chains is duplicated in the encoded Hp2 protein, the Hp2-1 and Hp2-2 phenotypes display a spectrum of various Hp (αβ)-multimers (4Delanghe J.R.

Both trypanosome lytic factor 1 and trypanosome lytic factor 2 protect against the African parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei by inducing lysis of the parasite, and Hpr is suggested to play a vital role in this primate-specific defense mechanism (12Drain J.

Petersen S.V. Jacobsen C. Oxvig C. Rees D. Møller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2006; 108: 2846-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Unlike Hp complex formation with Hb, Hpr complex formation with Hb does not increase Hb binding to CD163, thus indicating that some of the differences in the primary structure of Hp and Hpr are indispensable for high affinity receptor binding. In the present study, we have therefore designed and analyzed recombinant Hp/Hpr chimeric proteins as an approach to identify Hp regions/residues essential for the high affinity binding of Hp-Hb to CD163.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids for Expression of Recombinant Hp, Hpr, and Hp/Hpr Chimeras—The plasmid constructs composed of human Hp1 wild type (WT) or human Hpr WT inserted into the KpnI and XhoI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen, Taastrup, Denmark) were described recently (14Nielsen M.J. Petersen S.V. Jacobsen C. Oxvig C. Rees D. Møller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2006; 108: 2846-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By means of site-directed mutagenesis, a large panel of plasmid constructs encoding Hp/Hpr chimeras was established. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the pcDNA5/FRT-Hp1 WT construct as the initial template. Plasmid DNA was isolated by the Qiagen Maxiprep method (Qiagen, Albertslund, Denmark) and sequenced before transfection. The following constructs designated according to their encoded Hp and Hpr amino acid composition were designed: chimera 1, Hpr(α-chain)/Hp(β-chain) (the chimeric protein consisting of the Hpr α-chain and the Hp β-chain); chimera 2, Hp C33F (the Hp protein with a single mutation of Cys-33 to Phe); chimera 3, Hp(α-chain)/Hpr(β-chain) (the chimeric protein consisting of the Hp α-chain and the Hpr β-chain); chimera 4, Hpr(α-chain)/Hpr(β-chain 104–234)/Hp(β-chain 234–347) (the chimeric protein consisting of the Hpr α-chain, Hpr β-chain residues 104–234, and Hp β-chain residues 234–347); chimera 5, Hpr(α-chain)/Hpr(β-chain 104–253)/Hp(β-chain 253–347) (the chimeric protein consisting of the Hpr α-chain, Hpr β-chain residues 104–253, and Hp β-chain residues 253–347); chimera 6, Hpr(α-chain)/Hpr(β-chain 104–265)/Hp(β-chain 265–347) (the chimeric protein consisting of the Hpr α-chain, Hpr β-chain residues 104–265, and Hp β-chain residues 265–347); chimera 7, Hpr(α-chain)/Hpr(β-chain 104–265, C260V)/Hp(β-chain 265–347) (the chimeric protein consisting of the Hpr α-chain, Hpr β-chain residues 104–259 and 261–265, and Hp β-chain residues 259 and 265–347); chimera 8, Hp C33F, V259C (the Hp protein with mutations of Cys-33 to Phe and Val-259 to Cys); and chimera 9,Hp E261K, K262W, T264A (the Hp protein with mutations of Glu-261 to Lys, Lys-262 to Trp, and Thr-264 to Ala).Establishment of Cell Lines Stably Transfected with Hp/Hpr Chimeras—Flp-In 293 cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cambrex Bioscience Verviers, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) and transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Hvidovre, Denmark). Stable transfectants were selected with 150 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). For visualization of expression products, culture medium harvested from cells grown in serum-free 293 medium (Invitrogen) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-human Hp antibody (DAKOCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The generation of Flp-In 293 cells stably transfected with Hp WT and Hpr WT was described previously (14Nielsen M.J. Petersen S.V. Jacobsen C. Oxvig C. Rees D. Møller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2006; 108: 2846-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Purification of Hp, Hpr, and Hp/Hpr Chimeras by Hb Affinity Chromatography—Purification of Hp, Hpr, and Hp/Hpr chimeras was performed by subjecting the harvested serum-free 293 cell culture medium containing secreted expression products to Hb affinity chromatography, essentially as described (14Nielsen M.J.

Affinity columns were prepared by coupling 10 mg of Hb A0 (Sigma, Brøndby, Denmark) to 1 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Hørsholm, Denmark) essentially as described by the manufacturer. After allowing the expression products to bind the column material, the columns were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm NaH2PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.6 mm CaCl2), pH 7.4, and bound proteins subsequently eluted by 5 m urea containing 0.15 m NaCl. The collected material was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with one buffer change and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining to visualize the purified protein products.Automated Edman Degradation—Samples were analyzed by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Procise 491HT sequencer with on-line phenylthiohydantoin HPLC analysis. The instruments were operated according to instructions by the manufacturer.Mass Spectrometry (MS)—Approximately 40 μg of recombinant Hpr in 30 mm HEPES, pH 8.3, containing 5 m guanidinium hydrochloride was S-carboxyamidomethylated by adding iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 10 mm. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min before the material was acidified and desalted on to a 2.1 × 220 mm Aquapore RP-300 C8 reverse-phase HPLC column (Brownlee Labs) connected to an AKTA explorer (GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted by a linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) to 90% acetonitrile, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B) (1% B min-1). The column was operated at 23 °C at a flow rate of 200 μl min-1. Protein was detected at 220 and 280 nm, and fractions were collected manually. The fraction containing Hpr was lyophilized, redissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and digested by the addition of trypsin (sequence grade, Promega) at a 1:20 ratio for 16 h at 37 °C. The tryptic peptides were subsequently separated by reverse-phase HPLC as described above. Fractions were collected manually and analyzed by MALDI-MS before and after reduction using a Q-Tof Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Micromass/Waters Corp.) calibrated using a mixture of polyethylene glycol-200, -600, -1000, -2000, and NaI. The acquired mass spectra were mass-corrected using glu-fibrinopeptide B as an external calibrant. Aliquots of fractions selected for subdigestion using Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (Sigma) were lyophilized and redissolved in 50 mm NH4HCO3. The digestions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C. The generated peptides were recovered by using Stagetips (C18, Proxeon) as recommended by the manufacturer and spotted onto a MALDI sample target using 1 μl of matrix solution (0.4% (w/v) recrystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid in 70% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.03% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) and analyzed by MALDI-MS as described above.Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—CD163 binding of Hb A0, Hp, Hpr, Hp/Hpr chimeras (all 25 μg/ml) alone or complexes of Hb A0 with Hp, Hpr, or Hp/Hpr chimeras was studied by SPR analysis on a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden), essentially as described (2Madsen M. Moller H.J. Nielsen M.J. Jacobsen C. Graversen J.H. van den Berg T. Moestrup S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51561-51567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Biacore sensor chips (type CM5) were activated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccimide in water according to instructions by the manufacturer. CD163 purified from human spleen (1Kristiansen M. Graversen J.H. Jacobsen C. Sonne O. Hoffman H.J. Law S.K. Moestrup S.K. Nature. 2001; 409: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar) was immobilized in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and remaining binding sites were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. A control flow cell was made by performing the activation and blocking procedure only. The SPR signal generated from immobilized recombinant protein corresponded to 60–70 fmol of receptor/mm2. Samples were dissolved in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4. Sample and running buffers were identical. Regeneration of the sensor chip after each analysis cycle was performed with 10 mm glycine, pH 4.0, containing 20 mm EDTA and 500 mm NaCl. The Biacore response is expressed in relative response units, i.e. the difference in response between protein and control flow channel. Kinetic parameters were determined by BIAevaluation 4.1 software using a Langmuir 1:1 binding model.The effect of the synthetic peptides RHYEGSTVPEKKTPKSPVGVQPILNEHT and THYEGSTVPKWKAPKSPVGVQPILNEHT (KJ ROSS-Petersen ApS, Klampenborg, Denmark) on the binding of Hp-Hb to immobilized CD163 was studied using an Hp (1-1)-Hb A0 complex formed by mixing 8 μg/ml Hb A0 with 8 μg/ml plasma-derived Hp1-1 (Sigma). The synthetic peptides were dissolved in sample buffer, and experiments were performed in a concentration range from 0 to 750 μm of peptides. Sensorgrams were monitored, and the relative response at 600 s was used in calculation of the percentage of binding of the Hp-Hb complex.Modeling of the Hp Structure— The core of the model of human Hp was constructed using the Swiss-Model server (16Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar). SwissModel selected three structures of C1r (Protein Data Bank code: 1MD8, 1MD7, 1GPZ) and one structure of C1s (Protein Data Bank code: 1ELV) as templates for the modeling. Alternative suggestions for the structure of Hp loop 1 were identified by locating the nearly conserved sequence pattern PXXXXPXX-PXXXXP found in Hp in the set of non-redundant sequences of the Protein Data Bank using PATTERNSEARCHDB (Biology Workbench). Of 32 occurrences of the pattern, the loop from bovine mitochondrial aconitase (Protein Data Bank code: 1ACO) (residues 320–333) was chosen based on the agreement between endpoints of the loop and the core generated by Swiss-Model. The loop was incorporated into the Hp model using O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Found. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar).RESULTSComparison of the Primary Structure of Hp and Hpr and Determination of the Disulfide Bridge Pattern of Hpr—Fig. 1A shows an alignment of Hp1 and Hpr with the 27-amino-acid residue differences in the α- and β-chains indicated in black. The differences include 2 cysteine residues, the Cys-260 in the Hpr β-chain, which is a replacement of a Val in Hp, and Cys-33 in Hp, which is replaced by Phe in Hpr. The latter difference abolishes the covalent stabilization of the structure because Cys-33 mediates the disulfide bridging of the α-chains of Hp (18Kurosky A. Barnett D.R. Lee T.H. Touchstone B. Hay R.E. Arnott M.S. Bowman B.H. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3388-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Hpr Cys-260 perturbs the disulfide bond pattern relatively to the disulfide arrangement known from Hp (18Kurosky A. Barnett D.R. Lee T.H. Touchstone B. Hay R.E. Arnott M.S. Bowman B.H. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3388-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), purified recombinant Hpr was digested by trypsin, and the generated peptides were subsequently separated by reverse-phase HPLC. All fractions were analyzed by MALDI-MS, and selected fractions containing disulfide-linked peptides were subsequently subdigested using S. aureus V8 protease. This analysis revealed that the disulfide bridge pattern of Hpr was homologous to that of the Hp (αβ)-unit (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the analysis showed that Cys-260 was cysteinylated. The latter conclusion was based on the finding that under non-reducing conditions, the peptide encompassing Cys-260 had a mass increase of 119 Da corresponding to the cysteinylation of the cysteine residue. The identification of Cys-260 as the cysteinylated residue was determined by enzymatic subdigestion of the disulfide-linked tryptic peptide. As Hpr contains an uneven number of cysteine residues, the inability to detect any S-carboxyamidomethylated Cys-containing peptides further supports the presence of a cysteinylation.Expression of Recombinant Hp/Hpr Chimeric Proteins—A site-directed mutagenesis strategy was based on the 27 amino acid residues, which are different in Hpr as compared with Hp. Fig. 2 shows the panel of Hp/Hpr chimeric proteins expressed and analyzed to determine the elements important for receptor recognition.FIGURE 2Expression of recombinant Hp, Hpr, and Hp/Hpr chimeras.

A. 1980; 77: 3388-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), all expression products containing the C33F mutation primarily formed (αβ)-monomers of approximately half the size of the recombinant Hp WT (αβ)2 molecule as determined by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The mobility in SDS-PAGE was also influenced by the Hp S184H mutation disrupting a glycosylation motif of the type Asn-X-Ser/Thr. Expression products carrying this amino acid substitution migrated slightly faster than expression products without the mutation.In accordance with recent data showing that only a low degree of cleavage of recombinant proHp to the α- and β-chains takes place in 293 cells (19Wicher K.B. Fries E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14390-14395Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), amino-terminal sequencing showed that recombinant Hp remained largely uncleaved (14Nielsen M.J. Petersen S.V. Jacobsen C. Oxvig C. Rees D. Møller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2006; 108: 2846-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the recombinant Hp bound to Hb has similar receptor binding activity as Hb in complex with native plasma-derived Hp (14Nielsen M.J. Petersen S.V. Jacobsen C. Oxvig C. Rees D. Møller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2006; 108: 2846-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the recombinant Hpr expressed in the 293 cells was fully cleaved into the α- and β-chains (14Nielsen M.J. Petersen S.V. Jacobsen C. Oxvig C. Rees D. Møller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2006; 108: 2846-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that it is accessible for cleavage by an alternative protease. However, in contrast to the native Hpr found in plasma (9Raper J. Fung R. Ghiso J. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), recombinant Hpr was found to lack the hydro-phobic signal peptide (14Nielsen M.J. Petersen S.V. Jacobsen C. Oxvig C. Rees D. Møller H.J. Moestrup S.K. Blood. 2006; 108: 2846-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Identification of the Hp β-Chain Region Involved in High Affinity Binding to CD163—As expected, the panel of different Hp/Hpr chimeric expression products all bound Hb as evident by Hb affinity chromatography (Fig. 2B). Using SPR analysis, we subsequently examined the CD163 binding capacity of the purified proteins in complex with Hb (Fig. 3, Table 1). Replacement of the Hp α-chain with that of Hpr had no significant effect on the CD163 binding as seen by comparison of Hp WT and the Hpr(α-chain)/Hp(β-chain) chimera (Fig. 3, A and C). Concordantly, the Hp C33F mutant selectively missing the inter-α-chain disulfide bridge showed high affinity receptor binding (Fig. 3D). Thus, the residues specific for the Hpr α-chain, including the C33F substitution, which prevents the disulfide-mediated (αβ)-dimer formation, do not affect the binding to CD163.FIGURE 3SPR analyses of binding of complexes of Hb and purified recombinant Hp, Hpr, or Hp/Hpr chimeras to CD163. Purified Hb alone, purified recombinant Hp, Hpr, Hp/Hpr chimera 1–9 (C1–9) alone, or the complexes of Hb with Hp, Hpr, and Hp/Hpr chimeras were analyzed for binding to CD163 immobilized on a Biacore sensor chip. The recombinant protein analyzed is indicated above each panel (for designations of the chimeric proteins, refer to Fig. 2). Hb alone displayed low binding to CD163, whereas no binding of Hp, Hpr, or the Hp/Hpr chimeras alone to CD163 could be detected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Kinetic parameters derived from SPR analysis of binding of Hb alone or complexes of Hb and purified recombinant Hp, Hpr, and Hp/Hpr chimeras to immobilized CD163 The kinetic parameters were determined under the assumption that Hb alone binds CD163 as a dimer consisting of two globin subunits and that Hpr and Hp/Hpr chimeras harboring the Hp C33F substitution non-covalently dimerize to form the (αβ)2 structure (see discussion). The kinetic parameters were not determined in the cases of CD163-binding curve characteristics indistinguishable from those of Hb alone.

In the next step, we analyzed mutant proteins consisting of the Hpr α-chain and chimeric β-chain Hp/Hpr. Substituting the Hp residues 1–233 by the corresponding Hpr residues (1–234) had no significant impact on receptor binding (Fig. 3F). However, introducing the mutations corresponding to the Hpr residues 235–253 and 235–265 had a weak and completely abrogating effect, respectively, on the Hp-inducible increase in Hb binding to CD163 (Fig. 3, G and H). In essence, the triple substitution D248Y, Q249D, and R252T caused partial inhibition of high affinity receptor binding, and combining with the V259C, E261K, K262W, and T264A substitutions entirely eliminated high affinity receptor binding.Introduction of the V259C mutation in Hp (corresponding to Cys-260 of Hpr) appeared interesting because Hpr Cys-260 is cysteinylated (Fig. 1B). However, reintroduction of the original Hp Val at this position failed to rescue high affinity binding (Fig. 3, H and I). On the other hand, introduction of a Cys at Hp position 259, even in the absence of the D248Y, Q249D, R252T, E261K, K262W, and T264A substitutions, caused a substantial decrease in receptor binding as seen by comparing the Hp C33F and Hp C33F, V259C mutant proteins (Fig. 3, D versus J).Finally, the effect of the E261K, K262W, and T264A substitutions on receptor binding was tested in the absence of other residue alterations. Strikingly, as presented in Fig. 3, introduction of these 3 amino acid residue substitutions in Hp was sufficient to obstruct high affinity receptor binding (compare A and K). Taken together, the binding analyses demonstrate that the region encompassing residues 234–264 of the Hp β-chain contains residues that are critical for receptor binding, in particular the residues Val-259, Glu-261, Lys-262, and Thr-264, which in Hpr are replaced by Cys, Lys, Trp, and Ala, respectively.The determination of the structural fold of the complement control repeat and serine protease domains of complement components C1r and C1s by x-ray crystal-lography allows modeling of Hp as depicted in Fig. 4A. Due to the lack of similarity between the templates and the amino-terminal part of Hp, the model only comprises residues 43–346. Interestingly, the region identified as important for receptor binding represents a part of a loop, which has been designated as loop 1 of serine proteases (20Perona J.J. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29987-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This is a unique part of Hp and Hpr as compared with serine proteases, which all have a considerably shorter loop (Fig. 4B). Due to the length of the loop and the lack of a known template structure, a reliable model for the loop structure cannot be obtained. The presence of 4 proline residues in the loop suggests a limited flexibility.FIGURE 4Computer-modeled three-dimensional structure of Hp showing the r"

The mucin 1 (MUC1) oncoprotein is aberrantly overexpressed by most human carcinomas; however, there is no known relationship between MUC1 and the hypoxic stress response. The present work has demonstrated that MUC1 attenuates activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a regulator of gene transcription in the response of cells to hypoxic stress. In cells with stable gain and loss of MUC1 function, we have shown that MUC1 up-regulates prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) expression and promotes HIF-1α degradation. PHD activity is attenuated by increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the hypoxic stress response. Our results further demonstrate that MUC1 blocks hypoxia-induced increases in ROS and thereby potentiates PHD-mediated HIF-1α suppression. Importantly, MUC1 also blocks hypoxia-induced apoptosis and necrosis by suppressing accumulation of ROS.

The stability of HIF-1α is regulated through oxygen-dependent trans-4-hydroxylation of prolines by prolyl hydroxylase domain containing proteins PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3 (4Bruick R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Hydroxylation of HIF-1α on Pro-402 and Pro-564 in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain promotes binding of the von Hippel-Lindau protein and the formation of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets HIF-1α for proteosomal degradation (7Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5195) Google Scholar). Conversely, β-hydroxylation of Asn-803 attenuates the HIF-1α transactivation function by decreasing association with the CREB-binding protein/p300 coactivators (8Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). PHD activity is also dependent on ferrous iron (FeII) and is decreased by accumulation of ROS, which converts FeII to FeIII (9Gerald D. Berra E. Frapart Y.M. Chan D.A. Giaccia A.J. Mansuy D.

The inhibition of PHD activity under hypoxic conditions or by hypoxia-induced ROS thus results in the stabilization of HIF-1α and activation of HIF-1 target genes.

Cells were seeded, grown for 24 h, and then placed in a modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Inc., Del Mar, CA) flushed with a gas mixture containing 1% O2, 5% CO2, and the balance N2. Cells were also treated with 25μm MG132 (Calbiochem), 600μm CoCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich), or 500 units/ml catalase (Sigma).Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed as described previously (35Yin L. Kufe D. J.

The RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified using SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen). Amplified fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels.Measurement of ROS Levels–Cells were incubated with 5 μm DCFH-DA (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 37 °C to assess H2O2-mediated oxidation to the fluorescent compound 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin. Fluorescence of oxidized 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin was measured at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences).Silencing of MUC1 and PHD3–Cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/60-mm well. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with control siRNA, MUC1siRNA, or PHD3siRNA pools (siGENOME SMART pool reagents; Dharmacon RNA Technologies) for 72 h.Analysis of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential—Cells were incubated in 5 ng/ml DiOC6(3) (Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C and then monitored by flow cytometry.Assays of Apoptosis and Necrosis—Sub-G1 DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed and citrate buffer-permeabilized cells with propidium iodide and monitoring by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) as described previously (36Yin L.

Agata N. Chen D. Li Y. Yu W.-H. Huang L. Raina D. Chen W. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To determine whether MUC1 affects the response to hypoxia, we analyzed HIF-1α levels in HCT116 cells expressing an empty vector or exogenous MUC1. Exposure of HCT116/vector cells to hypoxic conditions was associated with increases in HIF-1α that were maximal at 6 h and remained elevated for 24 h (Fig. 1A). By contrast, hypoxia-induced increases in HIF-1α were attenuated in HCT116 cellss that stably overexpress MUC1 (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with separately isolated HCT116/vector and HCT116/MUC1 clones (supplemental Fig. S1A), indicating that clonal selection is not responsible for the attenuation of HIF-1α activation. To define the region of MUC1 that regulates HIF-1α levels, we performed studies on HCT116 cells stably overexpressing the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain (MUC1-CD) (33Huang L. Ren J. Chen D. Li Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Exposure of separately isolated HCT116/MUC1-CD clones to hypoxic conditions demonstrated that MUC1-CD is sufficient to attenuate HIF-1α activation (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1B). Members of the c-Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases are activated by ROS (39Nakashima I. Kato M. Akhand A.A. Suzuki H. Takeda K. Hossain K. Kawamoto Y. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and phosphorylate the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain on Tyr-46 (24Li Y. Kuwahara H. Ren J. Wen G. Kufe D. J. Biol.

Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) reversed (although not completely) the suppressive effects of MUC1 on HIF-1α activation (Fig. 1C). HIF-1α is destabilized under normoxic conditions by O2-dependent proteosomal degradation (40Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To define the level at which MUC1 regulates HIF-1α expression, RT-PCR was performed to assess HIF-1α gene transcription. MUC1 overexpression was associated with little effect on HIF-1α mRNA levels under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (supplemental Fig. S1C), indicating that MUC1 disrupts HIF-1α stabilization in the response to hypoxia. In concert with these results, attenuation of HIF-1α degradation with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 was associated with hypoxia-induced HIF-1α levels in HCT116/MUC1 and HCT116/MUC1-CD cells that were comparable with those in HCT116/vector cells (Fig. 1D). These findings indicate that MUC1 blocks hypoxia-induced stabilization of HIF-1α in HCT116 cells.Silencing Endogenous MUC1 Increases HIF-1α Activation in the Hypoxic Stress Response—To assess the effects of silencing endogenous MUC1 on HIF-1α, we studied ZR-75-1 cells expressing an empty vector, a control siRNA (CsiRNA) or a MUC1siRNA. As shown previously (31Ren J. Agata N. Chen D. Li Y. Yu W.-H. Huang L. Raina D. Chen W. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), the MUC1siRNA stably down-regulates endogenous MUC1 expression (Fig. 2A). Silencing MUC1 in ZR-75-1 cells was associated with substantially higher HIF-1α levels in response to hypoxia (Fig. 2A). The effects of down-regulating MUC1 were similar in two separately isolated ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA clones (Fig. 2B). RT-PCR demonstrated that silencing MUC1 is associated with increases in HIF-1α mRNA levels under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 2C). MG132 treatment of hypoxic ZR-75-1/CsiRNA and ZR-75-1/vector cells that overexpress endogenous MUC1 was associated with an increase in HIF-1α levels (Fig. 2D). However, the effects of MG132 were substantially more pronounced in the ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA cells (Fig. 2D). These findings indicate that MUC1 attenuates HIF-1α gene transcription and hypoxia-induced stabilization of HIF-1α in ZR-75-1 cells. Whereas MUC1 conferred destabilization of HIF-1α in both HCT116 and ZR-75-1 cells, our subsequent studies focused on signals responsible for HIF-1α degradation.FIGURE 2Silencing MUC1 in ZR-75-1 cells increases HIF-1α activation. A, ZR-75-1/vector and ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA cells were exposed to hypoxia for the indicated times. Lysates were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-HIF-1α, anti-MUC1-C, and anti-β-actin. B and C, the indicated ZR-75-1 cells were cultured under normoxic (N) or hypoxic (H) conditions for 24 h. Lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies (B). Total cellular RNA was amplified with HIF-1α- and β-actin-specific primers (C). The intensities of the signals were determined by densitometric scanning and are expressed as the relative signal intensity (RSI) compared with that obtained with normoxic ZR-75-1/CsiRNA cells. D, the indicated ZR-75-1 cells were exposed to hypoxia in the absence (–) and presence (+) of 25 μm MG132 for 8 h.

Immunoblot analysis of HCT116 cell lysates demonstrated that MUC1 overexpression has little if any effect on levels of the 43-kDa PHD1 protein (Fig. 3A). However, MUC1 overexpression was associated with down-regulation of the 46-kDa PHD2 (Fig. 3A). MUC1 overexpression was also associated with increases in levels of the 27-kDa PHD3 protein (Fig. 3A). In addition, hypoxia had little effect on the MUC1-induced increases in PHD3 (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S2A). Similar results were obtained with the separately isolated HCT116/vector and HCT116/MUC1 cells (supplemental Fig. S2A). Increases in PHD3 levels were also found in HCT116 cells overexpressing MUC1-CD (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S2B). By contrast, there was no apparent effect on PHD3 expression in the HCT116/MUC1(Y46F) cells (Fig. 3C). To determine whether MUC1 attenuates HIF-1α activation by up-regulating PHD3, we treated the HCT116 cells with CoCl2, an inhibitor of PHD activity (46Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). The results show that CoCl2-induced HIF-1α activation is similar in the absence and presence of MUC1 or MUC1-CD (Fig. 3D). To further assess whether PHD3 is involved in the regulation of HIF-1α in HCT116/MUC1 cells, we transiently down-regulated PHD3 expression with a PHD3 siRNA pool (Fig. 3E). Silencing PHD3 was associated with increases in HIF-1α (Fig. 3E). These findings indicate that MUC1 up-regulates PHD3 and thereby decreases HIF-1α in HCT116 cells.FIGURE 3MUC1 up-regulates PHD3 expression in HCT116 cells. A and B, HCT116/vector, HCT116/MUC1, and HCT116/MUC1-CD cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions for the indicated times. Lysates were immunoblotted (IB) with antibodies against PHD1–3. NS, nonspecific band. C, the indicated HCT116 cells were cultured under normoxic (N) or hypoxic (H) conditions for 24 h. Lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. D, the indicated HCT116 cells were incubated in the absence (–) and presence (+) of 600 μm CoCl2 for 24 h. Lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. E, HCT116/MUC1 cells were transfected with control CsiRNA or PHD3 siRNA pools. After 72 h, the cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions for 6 h. Lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Silencing MUC1 in ZR-75-1 Cells Decreases PHD3 Expression—Analysis of PHD levels in ZR-75-1 cells demonstrated that silencing of MUC1 has little effect on PHD1 or PHD2 levels (Fig. 4A). By contrast, silencing MUC1 was associated with a substantial down-regulation of PHD3 (Fig. 4A). A role for MUC1 in up-regulating PHD3 expression was confirmed in the ZR-75-1/CsiRNA cells and both ZR-75-1/MUC1siRNA clones (Fig. 4B). As a control, silencing MUC1 with a MUC1 siRNA pool was also associated with decreases in PHD3 and increases in HIF-1α levels (Fig. 4C), indicating that the results observed are not due to off-target effects of the MUC1siRNA. Analysis of PHD3 mRNA levels by RT-PCR further indicated that the down-regulation of PHD3 protein associated with silencing MUC1 is conferred by a post-transcriptional mechanism (supplemental Fig. S3). MUC1-mediated attenuation of HIF-1α activation was reversed in large part by CoCl2 (Fig. 4D), consistent with regulation by a PHD-dependent mechanism. Moreover, silencing PHD3 was associated with increases in HIF-1α levels (Fig. 4E). These findings in ZR-75-1 cells indicate that MUC1 increases PHD3 levels and that this response contributes to the attenuation of hypoxia-induced HIF-1α activation.FIGURE 4Silencing MUC1 in ZR-75-1 cells decreases PHD3 levels.

In a human cell culture model, we assessed whether extracellular matrix modification by hypoxia and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) involves the action of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and thereby affects cell proliferation. Expression of MMP and its activity were assessed by zymography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in human lung fibroblasts and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and synthesis of soluble collagen type I was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In both cell types, hypoxia up-regulated the expression of MMP-1, -2, and -9 precursors without subsequent activation. MMP-13 was increased by hypoxia only in fibroblasts. PDGF-BB inhibited the synthesis and secretion of all hypoxia-dependent MMP via Erk1/2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. Hypoxia and PDGF-BB induced synthesis of soluble collagen type I via Erk1/2 and p38 MAP kinase. Hypoxia-induced cell proliferation was blocked by antibodies to PDGF-BB or by inhibition of Erk1/2 but not by the inhibition of MMP or p38 MAP kinase in fibroblasts. In VSMCs, hypoxia-induced proliferation involved Erk1/2 and p38 MAP kinases and was further increased by fibroblast-conditioned medium or soluble collagen type I via Erk1/2. In conclusion, hypoxia controls tissue remodeling and proliferation in a cell type-specific manner. Furthermore, fibroblasts may affect proliferation of VSMC indirectly by inducing the synthesis of soluble collagen type I.

The incidences of chronic inflammatory lung diseases are increasing worldwide (1Holguin F. Folch E. Redd S.C. Mannino D.M.

Thorax. 2006; 61: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hypoxia has been identified as an important regulator of cell proliferation, ECM synthesis, and organ function and is assumed to result from increased tissue mass or insufficient vascularization (6Gebb S.A. Jones P.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2003; 543: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Locally restricted hypoxia increases the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, including interleukin-6 and -8, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) via hypoxia-sensitive transcription factors and feedback on hypoxia-related tissue remodeling (3Marx J.

(Shanghai). 2006; 38: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The local turnover and the composition of the ECM, especially of its collagen content, are key factors in the understanding of tissue remodeling (9Rahman I. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 43: 167-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 10Sweet D.G. Halliday H.L. Treat. Respir. Med. 2005; 4: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ECM is degraded by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are controlled by the tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs) (11Papakonstantinou E. Aletras A.J. Roth M. Tamm M. Karakiulakis G. Cytokine. 2003; 24: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Cha H.S. Ahn K.S. Jeon C.H. Kim J. Song Y.W. Koh E.M. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2003; 21: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). The initial step of ECM degradation involves active collagenases, especially MMP-1, -8, -13, and -18, which digest intact collagens followed by further digestion by gelatinases, mainly MMP-2 and MMP-9 (10Sweet D.G. Halliday H.L. Treat. Respir. Med. 2005; 4: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 13Hofbauer K.H. Gess B. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Katschinski D. Kurtz A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4515-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In such conditions, other cell types can invade and integrate into the area of the degraded ECM, where they will form their own cell type-specific bed of ECM (9Rahman I. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 43: 167-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 10Sweet D.G. Halliday H.L. Treat. Respir. Med. 2005; 4: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this context, hypoxia enhances the expression and action of MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, -13, and -14 (MT1-MMP) apparently in a cell type- but also species-specific manner (11Papakonstantinou E. Aletras A.J. Roth M. Tamm M. Karakiulakis G. Cytokine. 2003; 24: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Cha H.S. Ahn K.S. Jeon C.H. Kim J. Song Y.W. Koh E.M. Clin. Exp.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 4515-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As the enzymatic activity of MMP can be inhibited by TIMP, the effect of hypoxia on TIMP expression is of some importance (11Papakonstantinou E. Aletras A.J. Roth M. Tamm M. Karakiulakis G. Cytokine. 2003; 24: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Cha H.S. Ahn K.S. Jeon C.H. Kim J. Song Y.W. Koh E.M. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2003; 21: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, TIMPs seem to be essential to regulating the conversion of pro-MMP-2 into active MMP-2 and need the formation of a complex consisting of pro-MMP-2, TIMP-2, and MT1-MMP, which leads to cleavage and activation of pro-MMP-2, subsequently affecting cell proliferation and differentiation (14Munshi H.G. Wu Y.I. Mukhopadhyay S. Ottaviano A.J. Sassano A. Koblinski J.E. Platanias L.C. Stack M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39042-39050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).The effect of hypoxia or one of the associated cytokines on airway remodeling has been studied, but less attention has been paid so far to the feedback mechanism of the cytokines examined on hypoxia or on the interaction of the cell types involved. In this study, we assessed the effect of hypoxia (3% O2), PDGF-BB, and their combination on the synthesis and activity of MMP, TIMP, total collagen deposition, and soluble collagen type I synthesis by human lung fibroblasts and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We further studied the underlying intracellular signaling pathway and the feedback mechanism of these factors on proliferation, as well as the interaction of the two cell types.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Primary human lung cell lines were prepared from patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy for surgical therapy after written consent and approval by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland (M75/97). Primary human pulmonary VSMC lines were established from lung arteries, as described previously (15Papakonstantinou E. Karakiulakis G. Tamm M. Perruchoud A.P. Roth M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L825-L834Google Scholar), and were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 20 mm HEPES buffer (all Biochrom, Basel, Switzerland) and 1× amino acid mix (Invitrogen). No antibiotics or anti-mycotics were added at any time. VSMC were characterized by morphology and positive staining for smooth muscle cell actin. Primary human lung fibroblasts were grown from the same lung biopsies (16Roth M. Nauck M. Yousefi S. Tamm M. Blaser K. Perruchoud A.P. Simon H.U. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 8 mm l-glutamine, 20 mm HEPES buffer and 1× amino acid mix. All cells were grown to confluence and were expanded by trypsinization and used for experiments until the fourth passage.Cell Culture Conditions—Cells were seeded onto 24-well culture plates (Falcon, Basel, Switzerland) and grown until 80% confluence. Before stimulation with PDGF or exposure to hypoxia (3% O2), the cells were serum-deprived for 48 h with their specific growth medium containing 0.1% FCS. To avoid auto-stimulation, the medium was exchanged every 12 h. The cells were stimulated with 1–20 ng/ml PDGF-BB (human recombinant, R & D Systems) and/or incubated under hypoxic or normoxic conditions for 12, 24, or 48 h. Normoxia was 21% O2, 74% N2, and 5% CO2. Hypoxia was 3% O2, 93% N2, and 5% CO2 (11Papakonstantinou E. Aletras A.J. Roth M. Tamm M. Karakiulakis G. Cytokine. 2003; 24: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The effect of the MMP inhibitor OO-Hy (catalog number 44244; Calbiochem, Lucern, Switzerland) and of neutralizing polyclonal anti-PDGF-BB antibodies (AB-220-NA; R & D Systems) on proliferation (48 h) was also investigated. PD98059, a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, and SB203580, an Erk1/2 MAP kinase inhibitor, and its control substance SB202474 were from Calbiochem.Gelatin Zymography—MMP-2 and -9 secretion was determined as described earlier in cell culture medium (17Karakiulakis G. Papanikolaou C. Jankovic S.M. Aletras A. Papakonstantinou E. Vretou E. Mirtsou-Fidani V. Invasion Metastasis. 1997; 17: 158-168PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was adjusted before aliquots were size-fractionated by electrophoresis (8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, 0.1% gelatin, 25 mA, 2 h). Gelatinolytic activity was quantified by a Kodak image analysis program (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). MMPs were further characterized by protease inhibitors Na2EDTA (20 mm) and 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate (4 mm) (Sigma), which were added to the enzyme buffer for 24 h at 37 °C.Determination of Collagenases MMP-1 and MMP-13—MMP-1 and MMP-13 were determined in cell culture medium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (11Papakonstantinou E. Aletras A.J. Roth M. Tamm M. Karakiulakis G. Cytokine. 2003; 24: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Unspecific reactions were blocked (1 h, 37 °C) with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (anti-MMP-1 antibody Ab806; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or by 4% gelatin (anti-MMP-13 antibody Ab8114; Chemicon) in PBS-T (10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). Plates were washed three times with PBS-T and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:5000, 1 h, 37 °C) (Chemicon). The substrate o-phenyl-eno-diamine (0.03% H2O2/2 mg/ml 0.1 m citrate buffer) was added for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by 2 m H2SO4, and the absorbance was read at 492 nm. Purified human MMP-1 and MMP-13, respectively, were used to standardize MMP concentrations (18Syggelos S.A. Eleftheriou S.C. Giannopoulou E. Panagiotopoulos E. Aletras A.J. J. Rheumatol. 2001; 28: 1319-1329PubMed Google Scholar).Measurement of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2—Total TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were measured in cell culture medium samples containing 10 μg/ml total protein by ELISA (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoblotting—For protein analysis, 105 cells were lysed with 100 μl of Laemmli buffer, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 5 μg/μl before size fractionation by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4–15%, 40 V, 90 min, 4 °C) as described earlier (19Leufgen H. Bihl M.P. Rudiger J.J. Gambazzi J. Perruchoud A.P. Tamm M. Roth M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 204: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Protein loading was controlled by Ponceau staining after transfer onto nylon membranes. Unspecific binding was blocked by 3% skim milk in TBS-T (25 mm Tris-base, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05 m KCl, 0.05% Tween 20; 30 min, room temperature), and the expression of TIMP-1 and -2 and MMP-1 and -13 was analyzed using specific polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and subsequent incubation with species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Dako). Specific protein bands were visualized by ECL and documented by scanning (19Leufgen H. Bihl M.P. Rudiger J.J. Gambazzi J. Perruchoud A.P. Tamm M. Roth M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 204: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Determination of Soluble Collagen Type I—The concentration of soluble collagen type I was determined in 50-μl cell culture medium by ELISA (11Papakonstantinou E. Aletras A.J. Roth M. Tamm M. Karakiulakis G. Cytokine. 2003; 24: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Samples were dried, dissolved in water (50 μl), and coated overnight (60 °C) onto polystyrene plates. Unspecific binding was blocked by 4% BSA in PBS-T (1 h, 37 °C), plates were washed with PBS-T (2×), and collagen type I antibodies (mAb339, Chemicon) were added (0.1% BSA, 20 h, 4 °C). Following three washes with PBS-T, a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was added (dilution 1:5000/0.1% BSA; 1 h, 37 °C) (Chemicon). Plates were washed with PBS-T (2×) and once with 0.1 m citrate buffer before a peroxidase substrate was added (30 min) and the absorbance was read (492 nm). The concentration of collagen type I was calculated as ng/μg total protein referring to collagen type I (C3511; Sigma) solubilized in acetic acid (pH 7.0).Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR was performed by denaturation (3 min, 94 °C) followed by 20–25 cycles of denaturation (30 s, 94 °C), primer annealing (30 s, 58 °C), and extension (1 min, 72 °C) followed by a final extension (10 min, 72 °C). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis (1.5% agarose gel, ethidium bromide). Primers used for COL1A1 were forward (5′-CCC CTG GCG CTG TCG GTC CTG-3′), reverse (5′-GGG CGC CAA GGT CTC CAG GAA CA-3′) (product 201 bp) and for β-actin forward (5′-GTA CGT TGC TAT CCA GGC TGT GC-3′), reverse (5′-TCA GGC AGC TCG TAG CTC TTC TC-3′) (product 350 bp).Cell Proliferation—Cells were seeded (104 cells/ml) in 24-well plates and allowed to attach overnight and then arrested by serum starvation (0.1% FCS, 24 h) and exposed to hypoxia and/or PDGF-BB for 3 days before being manually counted (Neubauer hematocytometer).Protein Determination—The content of total protein of each sample was determined with a standard Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA (Sigma) as the standard of known concentrations.Statistics—Means ± S.E. were calculated from results obtained from cultures of primary human VSMCs or fibroblasts established from lung tissue biopsies from at least four different patients. Determinations were always made in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and Student's t test.RESULTSHypoxia Induces and PDGF-BB Inhibits the Secretion of Pro-MMP-2 and Pro-MMP-9—The morphology or viability of VSMCs or human lung fibroblasts was not affected by hypoxia (up to 72 h) or PDGF-BB (1–20 ng/ml), as assessed by immunostaining or trypan blue exclusion staining. Fibroblasts and VSMCs (Fig. 1A) secreted pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 under normoxia (48 h). Gelatinolytic activity was completely inhibited in the presence of the metal chelators Na2EDTA (20 mm) (Fig. 1A). Gelatinolytic activity in eight fibroblast and eight VSMC lines was quantified using a computer-assisted image analysis program and revealed that the ratio of pro-MMP-2 to pro-MMP-9 activity was 40:1 for both cell types. However, the results on pro-MMP-9 secretion were not further quantified or statistically analyzed due to the fact that only minor amounts of pro-MMP-9 could be detected.In fibroblasts (Fig. 1B) and VSMCs (Fig. 1C), hypoxia significantly increased the secretion of pro-MMP-2 by ∼38% (p < 0.02) within 48 h, and the addition of PDGF-BB significantly reduced this effect (p < 0.05). In fibroblasts, inhibition of p38 (but not Erk1/2 MAP kinase) dose-dependently reduced hypoxia-induced pro-MMP-2 secretion. In contrast, Erk1/2 MAP kinase counteracted the inhibitory effect of PDGF-BB on hypoxia-induced pro-MMP-2 secretion, whereas p38 MAP kinase inhibition had no effect, and the control substance SB202474 (negative Erk1/2 inhibitor) was also without significant effects under all tested conditions (Fig. 1B).Surprisingly, the signaling cascade was different in VSMCs, as inhibition of Erk1/2 and p38 MAP kinases were reducing the stimulatory effect of hypoxia on pro-MMP-2 secretion (Fig. 1C). However, only inhibition of Erk1/2 MAP kinase reduced the inhibitory effect of PDGF-BB on hypoxia-dependent pro-MMP-2 release; the control SB202474 was without significant effects under all tested conditions (Fig. 1C).PDGF-BB Increases TIMP-1 Production Preferentially by Fibroblasts, and Pro-MMP-2 Is Complexed with TIMP-2—PDGF-BB significantly increased TIMP-1 secretion by both cell types, whereas hypoxia had an additional increase but insignificant effect (Fig. 2A). In fibroblasts, the effect of PDGF-BB on TIMP-1 expression was mediated via Erk1/2 and did not involve p38 MAP kinase; the Erk1/2 control substance SB202474 was without significant effect under all tested conditions (Fig. 2A). Fibroblasts secreted significantly more TIMP-1 per cell than VSMCs, and the basic effects of hypoxia and PDGF-BB were similar in both cell types (Fig. 2A). The release of TIMP-2 from non-stimulated fibroblasts and VSMCs was not significantly affected by hypoxia or PDGF-BB within 48 h (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2The effect of hypoxia and/or PDGF-BB on TIMP-1 (A) and TIMP-2 (B) by human lung fibroblasts and VSMCs within 48 h was assessed by ELISA. The role of Erk1/2 and p38 MAP kinase on the stimulatory effect of both TIMPs was also determined using PD98059-inhibiting Erk1/2 MAP kinase, SB203580-inhibiting p38 MAP kinase, and SB202474 as a negative control for SB203580. Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. of six independent experiments, each in triplicate. The control was defined as normoxia (24 h). C, aliquots of cell culture medium from human lung fibroblasts and VSMCs containing the same amount of protein were incubated in the absence (–) or in the presence (+) of 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA; 1 mm, 37 °C, 24 h) and subjected to gelatin zymography. Arrows indicate the migration position of purified pro-MMP-2 and active MMP-2.

Quantification of gelatinolytic activity revealed that the sum of the intensities of the two gelatinolytic bands after APMA treatment was almost identical to the intensity of the initial pro-MMP-2 band. Neither hypoxia nor PDGF-BB modified the effect of APMA under normoxia in either cell-type (Fig. 2C).PDGF-BB Inhibits Hypoxia-induced MMP-1 Synthesis—As determined by ELISA, fibroblasts and VSMCs constitutively secreted MMP-1 within 48 h, and hypoxia significantly increased the release of MMP-1, which was abrogated by PDGF-BB, but PDGF-BB had no effect on the constitutive expression of MMP-1 in either cell type (Fig. 3A). Overall MMP-1 release by fibroblasts was significantly higher (11.7 ± 1.5 versus 8.1 ± 1.3 pg/μg protein, p < 0.01) than in VSMCs. Similar results were obtained by immunoblotting. Here we demonstrated that an anti-PDGF-BB antibody and Erk1/2 MAP kinase inhibition counteracted the effect of PDGF-BB on hypoxia-induced MMP-1 expression in fibroblasts (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, our data indicate that the stimulatory effect of hypoxia on MMP-1 expression involves p38 AMP kinase but not Erk1/2 or PDGF-BB (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with VSMCs (data not shown).FIGURE 3A, the effect of hypoxia (black bars) and PDGF-BB (striped bars) on MMP-1 expression by fibroblasts and VSMC within 48 h was assessed by ELISA. Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicates in six independent experiments. B, a representative immunoblot demonstrates the role of Erk1/2 and p38 MAP kinase in the hypoxia-induced expression of MMP-1, MMP-13, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) as well as on the antagonizing effect of PDGF-BB in human lung fibroblasts.

Similar results were obtained with two additional cell lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hypoxia Stimulates Hypoxia-inducible Factor (HIF)-1α Expression—HIF-1α is a hypoxia-associated transcription factor, and our data show that 24 h of hypoxia up-regulates HIF-1α expression in fibroblasts. PDGF-BB alone did not induce HIF-1α expression and did not alter the stimulatory effect of hypoxia (Fig. 3B). HIF-1α expression was only down-regulated in the presence of the Erk1/2 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 but not by its inactive control substance (SB202474) or the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor (PD98059) (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with VSMCs (data not shown).Hypoxia Increases MMP-13 in Fibroblasts but Not in VSMCs—Hypoxia almost doubled the release of MMP-13 by lung fibroblasts compared with normoxia (1.8 ± 0.24 versus 0.97 ± 0.14 pg/μg total protein, p < 0.01) within 48 h (Fig. 3, B and C). Although PDGF-BB did not affect the release of MMP-13 from fibroblasts under normoxia, it abolished the hypoxia-induced increase in MMP-13 (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, MMP-13 secretion by VSMCs was neither affected by hypoxia nor by PDGF-BB (Fig. 3C). Assessing the underlying signaling pathways, we observed that only p38 MAP kinase inhibition abrogated the stimulatory effect of hypoxia, whereas Erk1/2 was involved in the inhibitory effect of PDGF-BB on MMP-13 expression in fibroblasts (Fig. 3B).PDGF-BB and Hypoxia Synergistically Enhance Secretion of Soluble Collagen Type I by Fibroblasts—Soluble collagen type I was produced by fibroblasts but not by VSMCs. Hypoxia as well as PDGF-BB significantly increased the release of soluble collagen type I by human lung fibroblasts within 48 h (p < 0.05), and their combination had a more than additive effect (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). The increased synthesis of soluble collagen type I was because of increased transcription of the COL1A1 gene (Fig. 4B). COL1A1 mRNA was significantly increased by hypoxia within 12 h. Interestingly, both Erk1/2 and p38 MAP kinase inhibition significantly reduced the mRNA signal for COL1A1 when stimulated by hypoxia but not by PDGF-BB (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4A, the effect of hypoxia and PDGF-BB on the release of soluble collagen type I within 48 h was determined by ELISA in the cell culture medium obtained from human lung fibroblasts (n = 6). Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. Experiments in each cell line were performed in triplicates. B, the inducing effect of hypoxia and PDGF-BB on collagen type I α 1 chain (COL1A1) was confirmed on the mRNA level in three cell lines and the effect of Erk1/2 and p38 MAP kinase was assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. β-actin gene expression was used as a housekeeping gene, and data are displayed as a representative PCR product analysis. PD98059 inhibits Erk1/2 MAP kinase, SB203580 inhibits p38 MAP kinase, and SB202474 is a negative control for SB203580.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hypoxia and PDGF Synergistically Stimulate Cell Proliferation via Different Signaling Cascades in Fibroblasts and VSMCs—Under normoxia in 0.1% FCS, fibroblast and VSMC cell numbers did not significantly increase within 3 days, but when exposed to hypoxia, fibroblast numbers increased by 27.5 ± 2.9% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A), and VSMC numbers increased by 22.6 ± 1.9% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5B). Under normoxic and hypoxic cell culture conditions, PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) significantly increased fibroblast numbers (p < 0.02 and p < 0.01, respectively) (Fig. 5A) and achieved similar effects on VSMC numbers (normoxia, p < 0.01 and hypoxia, p < 0.05) (Fig. 5B). In VSMCs, the combination of hypoxia with PDGF-BB significantly increased cell numbers by 33.8 ± 2.5% (p < 0.01) as compared with hypoxia, but this increase was not significant compared with PDGF-BB alone (p = 0.81) (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5A, hypoxia and/or PDGF-BB increased fibroblast numbers significantly within 72 h. Under hypoxic culture condition, PDGF-BB mediates the mitogenic effect that is transmitted via Erk1/2. PD98059 inhibits Erk1/2 MAP kinase, SB203580 inhibits p38 MAP kinase, and SB202474 is a negative control for SB203580. The general inhibitor of MMP activity cis-9-octadecenoyl-N-hydroxylamide oleoyl-N-hydroxylamide (10 mm, OO-Hy) was added 3 h before cells were exposed to any other stimulus. B, hypoxia (black bar) and PDGF-BB up-regulated VSMC proliferation via Erk1/2 and p38 MAP kinase. Purified human soluble collagen type 1 (sol collagen type I (1 mg/ml)) was used to assess its contribution to hypoxia-mediated proliferation. Each bar represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicates performed in six independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The inhibition of Erk1/2 dose-dependently inhibited the mitogenic effect of hypoxia, as did both cell types (Fig. 5). In contrast, inhibition of p38 MAP kinase did not affect hypoxia-induced fibroblast proliferation (Fig. 5A), whereas it partially inhibited the stimulatory effect of hypoxia on VSMCs (Fig. 5B). When the two MAP kinases were inhibited, we observed an additive anti-proliferative effect in VSMC (Fig. 5B) but not in fibroblasts (Fig. 5A). Neutralizing antibodies to PDGF-BB also dose-dependently reduced cell proliferation with a significant effect only in fibroblasts (Fig. 5A) but not in VSMC (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the addition of"

Herein we have shown that IFNγ rapidly activated AP-1 DNA binding that required c-Jun but was independent of JAK1 and STAT1. IFNγ-induced c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 DNA binding required the MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, whereas the JNK1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways were dispensable. The induction of several ISGs, including ifi-205 and iNOS, was impaired in IFNγ-treated c-Jun–/– cells, but others, such as IP-10 and SOCS3, were unaffected, and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that c-Jun binds to the iNOS promoter following treatment with IFNγ. Thus, IFNγ induced JAK1- and STAT1-independent activation of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, phosphorylation of c-Jun, and activation of AP-1 DNA binding, which are important for the induction of a subset of ISGs. This represents a novel signal transduction pathway induced by IFNγ that proceeds in parallel with conventional JAK/STAT signaling to activate ISGs.

Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). Typically, IFNγ signaling proceeds through the ligation of surface receptors, sequential phosphorylation of JAKs and STAT1 on tyrosine 701 (Tyr-701), and translocation of STAT1 homodimers to the nucleus to bind IFNγ-activated sequences (GASs) found in the promoter regions of many ISGs (1Stark G.R.

Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). However, other signaling pathways are important for IFNγ signaling. For example STAT1 requires phosphorylation on Ser-727 to achieve full transcriptional activity (3Varinou L. Ramsauer K. Karaghiosoff M. Kolbe T. Pfeffer K. Muller M. Decker T.

Additionally, microarray analysis revealed that approximately one-third of ISGs were still regulated by IFNγ in the absence of functional STAT1 (5Gil M.P. Bohn E. O'Guin A.K. Ramana C.V. Levine B.

Thus, IFNγ can induce expression of ISGs by STAT1-independent mechanisms, and the activity of multiple intracellular pathways acting in parallel play an important role in the biological response to IFNγ. Aside from the JAKs, other kinases are activated in response to IFNγ, including MAP kinases (9Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R.

However, these enzymes have predominantly been assessed for their ability to trigger phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser-727, and little is known about their potential impact upon STAT-independent gene transcription.

There are conflicting reports regarding the involvement of the IKK/IκB/NF-κB pathway in STAT1-independent IFNγ signaling (24Deb A. Haque S.J. Mogensen T. Silverman R.H. Williams B.R. J.

Recently, it was shown that activation of IKKα and IKKβ in the absence of NF-κB activity was important for the induction of a subset of ISGs following treatment with IFNγ (26Sizemore N. Agarwal A. Das K. Lerner N. Sulak M. Rani S. Ransohoff R. Shultz D. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7994-7998Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However the signaling proteins and transcription factors downstream of IKK activation by IFNγ were not identified, and although STAT1 was phosphorylated on Tyr-701 and Ser-727 in IFNγ-treated IKKα/β-deficient cells, it was not determined whether this pathway activated the expression of ISGs in the absence of STAT1. We previously found that IFNγ could stimulate AP-1 DNA binding activity (27Clarke C.J. Apostolidis V. Hii L.L. Gough D.J. Trapani J.A. Johnstone R.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and herein investigated the molecular events leading to the activation of AP-1 following treatment with IFNγ. IFNγ induced rapid phosphorylation of c-Jun and concomitant activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity that was independent of JAK1 and STAT1 but dependent on c-Jun expression. Activation of AP-1 did not require p38 MAP kinases or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2 but did require the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway. We identified ISGs (ifi205, iNOS) that were not activated by IFNγ in c-Jun–/– cells, suggesting that AP-1 DNA binding activity was an essential regulator of these genes. IFNγ-induced expression of ifi205 (but not iNOS) was suppressed in STAT1–/– cells; additionally, IFNγ-induced iNOS transcription was observed in JAK1-deficient MEFs. In contrast, the IFNγ-mediated induction of IP-10 and SOCS3 was suppressed in STAT1–/– cells but was unaffected by perturbation of signaling through MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and c-Jun. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that IFNγ induced rapid binding of c-Jun to the iNOS promoter. Our data show for the first time that, in addition to activation of JAK/STAT1 signaling, IFNγ can mediate phosphorylation of c-Jun and activate AP-1 DNA binding through the ERK MAP kinase pathway independently of STAT1.

Mouse recombinant IFNγ and complete protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Antibodies for the following targets were used: pErk1/2 (phosphorylated on Thr-202 and Tyr-204); p38 MAPK (phosphorylated on Thr-180 and Tyr-182); pSTAT3 (phosphorylated on Tyr-705); c-Jun; pc-Jun (phosphorylated on Ser-63) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); JNK (1 and 2) (BD Biosciences); pJNK (phosphorylated on residues Thr-183 and Tyr-185) (Promega, Madison, WI); p38 MAPK, STAT3, c-Jun, JunD, c-Fos, ATF-2, JunB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

Threshold cycle numbers (Ct) were measured in the exponential phase for all samples. Ct values were converted to relative values using the equation (10 × 1010/(2Ct) = CΔt) for all ChIP samples. Final relative values for enrichment were calculated as percentage of input. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—MEFs were stimulated as indicated, and RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. 5 μg of RNA was hybridized to the Jun/Fos ribonuclease protection assay probe set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and ribonuclease protection assays performed using a ribonuclease protection assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocols (BD Biosciences). Results were visualized by autoradiography on x-ray film and quantitated on a phosphorimaging device using FX software (Bio-Rad). Statistical significance was tested using one-way analysis of variance testing with OriginLab version 7.5 software (Northampton, MA). AP-1 Is Rapidly and Transiently Activated by IFNγ—Using human tumor cell lines, we previously demonstrated that IFNγ was capable of activating protein complexes that bound AP-1 sites (27Clarke C.J. Apostolidis V. Hii L.L. Gough D.J. Trapani J.A. Johnstone R.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We confirmed this in immortalized MEFs by EMSA using an oligonucleotide probe containing a consensus AP-1 site. After treatment of cells with IFNγ, we observed a rapid and transient increase in AP-1 DNA binding activity that returned to basal levels by ∼120 min (Fig. 1A). The rapid induction of AP-1 DNA binding activity after IFNγ treatment was concomitant with the induction of GAS DNA binding activity (Fig. 1B). The IFNγ-induced AP-1 binding activity was specific, as it was competed by excess unlabeled oligonucleotides containing wild type (wt) (but not mutant) AP-1 binding sites (Fig. 1C). AP-1 activation by IFNγ was dose-dependent and could be induced by doses as low as 1 IU/ml (Fig. 1D). This effect is not confined to immortalized or transformed cells, as activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity by IFNγ was also seen in primary (early passage) MEFs (Fig. 1E). IFNγ Activation of AP-1 Is Independent of JAK1 and STAT1—IFNγ-mediated activation of AP-1 DNA binding was independent of either JAK1 or STAT1 expression, because it could still be detected in JAK1–/– or STAT1–/– MEFs (Fig. 2). Interestingly, we observed that both basal and IFNγ-induced AP-1 DNA binding activities were enhanced in the STAT1- and JAK1-deficient cells. To determine whether other STAT complexes could compensate for the loss of STAT1 in our system, we studied GAS DNA binding activity in wt and STAT1–/– cells using the GAS element from the FcγRI gene (Fig. 2B). GAS binding species were detected in nuclear extracts from wt MEFs treated with IFNγ for 15–30 min but not in extracts from STAT1–/– cells, indicating they were dependent on the presence of STAT1. Similar data were obtained using the GAS element from the IRF-1 promoter (supplemental Fig. S1A) and the SIE from the c-fos promoter (data not shown). Furthermore, we detected no increase in expression or phosphorylation of STAT3 in IFNγ-treated STAT1–/– cells (supplemental Fig. S1B). We therefore propose that we have identified an IFNγ-induced, JAK1- and STAT1-independent signaling pathway leading to activation of AP-1 DNA binding. c-Jun Is a Critical Component of the IFNγ-induced AP-1 Complex—AP-1 transcription factors are composed of Jun family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) homodimers, or Jun/Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2) or Jun/ATF2 heterodimers (32Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). Ribonuclease protection assays showed that the Jun family genes and Fra1 and Fra2 were equivalently expressed in resting MEFs; however, almost no FosB or c-Fos mRNA expression was detected (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Moreover, none of the AP-1 subunit genes were induced by IFNγ (supplemental Fig. S2, C–E). Supershift assays with antibodies specific for c-Jun, JunB, or JunD impaired the formation or migration of the IFNγ-induced AP-1/oligonucleotide complex, whereas antibodies against Fos family proteins or ATF2 had no effect (Fig. 3A). Expression of c-Jun was critical for the formation of the IFNγ-activated AP-1 DNA binding complex, as no AP-1 DNA binding activity was detected in c-Jun–/– MEFs treated with IFNγ (Fig. 3B). GAS binding activity was still evident in IFNγ-stimulated c-Jun–/– cells (data not shown), indicating that the JAK/STAT pathway remained intact. Optimal DNA binding by c-Jun requires phosphorylation of serine 63 (Ser-63) and serine 73 (Ser-73) (33Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 725-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A minimal basal level of Ser-63-phosphorylated c-Jun was detected in untreated wt MEFs, which was robustly enhanced following exposure of cells to IFNγ (Fig. 3C). In contrast, we observed no consistent change in total c-Jun expression in response to IFNγ. Taken together, these data demonstrate that treatment of cells with IFNγ results in rapid phosphorylation of c-Jun and formation of an AP-1 DNA binding complex that contains c-Jun as an essential component. The Activation of AP-1 by IFNγ Is Independent of JNK and p38 MAP Kinase but Requires ERK—JNK is the primary kinase responsible for the stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser-63 and -73 (34Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). IFNγ-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity was detected in JNK1/2 double knock-out MEFs with similar kinetics and magnitude of induction to that seen in wt MEFs (Fig. 4A). Treatment with a specific peptide inhibitor of JNK (35Barr R.K. Kendrick T.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10987-10997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) did not affect IFNγ-induced activation of AP-1 (Fig. 4B); however, this inhibitor effectively suppressed JNK-dependent activation of AP-1 following stimulation with tumor necrosis factor α (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). In contrast to tumor necrosis factor α, IFNγ did not stimulate the phosphorylation of JNK1 and JNK2 (supplemental Fig. S3C), providing further supporting evidence that these kinases do not play a role in the IFNγ-induced activation of AP-1. p38 MAPK plays an important role in type I IFN signaling (9Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 36Platanias L.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); however, its role in IFNγ signaling is unclear (37Ramsauer K. Sadzak I. Porras A. Pilz A. Nebreda A.R. Decker T. Kovarik P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12859-12864Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 38Sun D. Ding A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We saw no phosphorylation of p38 MAPK following treatment with IFNγ, and SB203580 (a pharmacological inhibitor of p38 MAPK) had no effect on IFNγ-induced activation of AP-1 DNA binding (supplemental Fig. S4). A previous study identified ERK1/2 as the kinases responsible for c-Jun phosphorylation in response to phorbol-ester or epidermal growth factor stimulation (39Morton S. Davis R.J. McLaren A. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3876-3886Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the MEK/ERK pathway could mediate IFNγ-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity using the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. PD98059 almost completely ablated the activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity following IFNγ treatment (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway lies upstream of AP-1 DNA binding. This was supported by Western blot showing that ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected within 5 min of IFNγ treatment (Fig. 5B) that was completely blocked by PD98059 (Fig. 5C). Moreover, PD98059 completely suppressed IFNγ-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 5D). These and supporting data obtained using the chemically distinct MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126 (supplemental Fig. S5) indicate that IFNγ can activate the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway resulting in c-Jun phosphorylation and induction of AP-1 DNA binding. AP-1 Is Critical for IFNγ-mediated Induction of ifi205 and iNOS—To delineate the functional significance of the novel STAT-independent, IFNγ-stimulated MEK1/2-ERK1/2-AP-1 pathway that we had identified, we sought to identify ISGs that were regulated through this pathway. We selected candidate genes on the basis of their responses to IFNγ treatment in the presence or absence of STAT1 or AP-1 (3Varinou L. Ramsauer K. Karaghiosoff M. Kolbe T. Pfeffer K. Muller M.

Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) and performed quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to determine changes in expression in response to IFNγ. We identified Ifi205 and iNOS as genes significantly activated in IFNγ-treated wt cells but not in IFNγ-treated c-Jun–/– cells, suggesting that c-Jun is essential for their induction by IFNγ (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, induction of SOCS3 and IP-10 by IFNγ was equivalent in wt and c-Jun–/– cells (Fig. 6, C and D). These experiments identify ifi205 and iNOS (but not SOCS3 or IP-10) as genes requiring AP-1 activity for induction following treatment with IFNγ. JAK1 and STAT1 Are Dispensable for IFNγ-mediated Induction of iNOS—We next determined whether the IFNγ-stimulated, c-Jun-dependent induction of ifi205 and iNOS occurred in the absence of the classical JAK1/STAT1 pathway. iNOS was maximally induced in wt MEFs following 6 h of exposure to IFNγ (Fig. 7A), and a corresponding increase in iNOS protein was observed by Western blot (data not shown). In STAT1–/– (Fig. 7A) or JAK1–/– (Fig. 7E) MEFs, IFNγ induced iNOS mRNA to the same levels seen in wt cells; however, maximal induction was observed following 1 h of exposure to IFNγ and decreased slightly by 6 h, indicating that both JAK1 and STAT1 are dispensable for the induction of iNOS by IFNγ. In contrast, ifi205 was significantly induced in wt cells exposed to IFNγ for 1 or 6 h but not in STAT1–/– cells (Fig. 7B). Thus, unlike iNOS, IFNγ-mediated induction of ifi205 requires both AP-1 and STAT1. The induction of SOCS3 and IP-10 seen in IFNγ-treated wt cells was significantly attenuated in STAT1–/– cells (Fig. 7, C and D). IFNγ Induces Binding of c-Jun to the iNOS Promoter in Vivo—Our experiments indicated that the MEK/ERK pathway and c-Jun were critical for the expression for ISGs such as iNOS, and the kinetics of the response were consistent with this being a direct transcriptional response downstream of c-Jun activation. We therefore investigated whether IFNγ activated the binding of c-Jun to the iNOS promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation. The 1.7-kb regulatory region of the murine iNOS promoter contains two consensus AP-1 binding sites (40Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 41Xie Q.W. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Ding A. Troso T. Nathan C. Science. 1992; 256: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar), and we therefore chose PCR primers flanking these sequences. We also studied the IFNγ-responsive region of the SOCS3 promoter as an example of a c-Jun-independent gene promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using wild type and c-Jun-deficient MEFs after a 30-min exposure to IFNγ. We observed a marked increase in c-Jun binding to the iNOS promoter following treatment of cells with IFNγ (Fig. 8A, lanes 3 and 4). No binding was detected using a control antibody in the immunoprecipitation reaction (Fig. 8A, lane 2) or in c-Jun-deficient lysates immunoprecipitated with the anti-c-Jun antibody (Fig. 8A, lanes 5 and 6), demonstrating specificity of the reaction. When quantified by quantitative real-time PCR, there was an 18-fold enrichment of c-Jun bound to the iNOS promoter following IFNγ treatment (Fig. 8C). Consistent with the data shown in Figs. 6 and 7, no increase in binding of c-Jun to the SOCS3 promoter was observed following treatment with IFNγ (Fig. 8B). These experiments demonstrate that c-Jun binds to the promoter of the iNOS gene following IFNγ treatment. Induction of ISGs through JAK/STAT1 plays an important role in mediating the biological effects of IFNγ (1Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). However, other signaling pathways functioning in parallel with JAK/STAT1 are required for a complete IFNγ response (5Gil M.P. Bohn E. O'Guin A.K. Ramana C.V. Levine B. Stark G.R. Virgin H.W. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6680-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 6Ramana C.V. Gil M.P.

Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 96-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), as IFNγ can still induce ISGs, mediate anti-viral responses, and regulate cell proliferation in the absence of STAT1 (5Gil M.P. Bohn E. O'Guin A.K. Ramana C.V. Levine B. Stark G.R. Virgin H.W. Schreiber R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6680-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 6Ramana C.V. Gil M.P.

Beatty P.R. Harris E. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 3946-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that, in addition to activating STAT1, IFNγ stimulates the phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 through MEK1/2, resulting in the downstream phosphorylation of c-Jun, activation of AP-1 DNA binding, and the induction of genes such as iNOS and ifi205 (Fig. 9). Importantly, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to demonstrate the binding of c-Jun to the iNOS promoter following treatment with IFNγ. This signaling pathway was engaged by IFNγ in a range of human and mouse tumor cell lines, immortalized and primary MEFs, and in JAK1–/– or STAT1–/– MEFs. This indicated that, although IFNγ-mediated activation of the pathway was independent of JAK1 and STAT1, it was also fully active in JAK1/STAT1-expressing cells and thus did not merely serve as a compensatory mechanism in the absence of either JAK1 or STAT1. Moreover, the stimulation of AP-1 DNA binding activity following IFNγ treatment occurred rapidly and independently of the transcriptional induction of any AP-1 subunit genes, which is consistent with this pathway being a primary response pathway. Although the IFNγ-stimulated activation of AP-1 is independent of the classical JAK1-STAT1 pathway (and possibly all STAT proteins), we consistently observed that the loss of these proteins augmented basal levels of AP-1 DNA binding. It is possible that this is due to the loss of a negative regulation of IFNγ signaling controlled by genes in a JAK1-STAT1-dependent manner; however, this needs to be determined experimentally. We have identified three classes of ISGs that differentially utilize the JAK/STAT1 and MEK/ERK/c-Jun signaling pathways in response to IFNγ. Induction of genes such as IP-10 and SOCS3 by IFNγ was significantly attenuated in STAT1–/– cells but was unaffected in c-Jun–/– cells, demonstrating the importance of STAT1 for the activation of these ISGs. We recently found that ifi204 had similar transcriptional requirements (data not shown). In contrast, iNOS was induced by IFNγ in wt, JAK1–/–, and STAT1–/– cells but not in c-Jun–/– cells. Previously, it has been demonstrated that STAT1, NF-κB, IRF-1, and IRF-8 can play important roles in the induction of iNOS by the combined treatment of IFNγ and lipopolysaccharide in macrophages (42Kleinert H. Pautz A. Linker K. Schwarz P.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 500: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). However, the utilization of different transcription factors in this response can be cell type-dependent, as IRF-1–/– pancreatic islet cells, chondrocytes, and hepatocytes (but not macrophages) showed normal iNOS induction in response to lipopolysaccharide/IFNγ (43Blair L.A. Maggi Jr., L.B. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 359-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 44Shiraishi A. Dudler J. Lotz M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3549-3554PubMed Google Scholar). Our data confirm observations by others (45Jaramillo M. Naccache P.H. Olivier M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5734-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 46Xiong H. Zhu C. Li H. Chen F. Mayer L. Ozato K. Unkeless J.C. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2271-2277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that iNOS expression is enhanced following treatment with IFNγ alone, although we found induction of iNOS in MEFs occurred within 6 h of IFNγ treatment, whereas studies in macrophages did not detect iNOS expression until 24 h post-IFNγ treatment (45Jaramillo M. Naccache P.H. Olivier M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5734-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 46Xiong H. Zhu C. Li H. Chen F. Mayer L. Ozato K. Unkeless J.C. Plevy S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2271-2277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A third type of response was represented by the induction of ifi205 by IFNγ that required both STAT1 and c-Jun (as did MIP-1β, data not shown). It is possible that STAT1 and AP-1 function cooperatively on the ifi205 and MIP-1β promoters to transactivate these genes; indeed functional interactions between STATs and other transcription factors are known to occur. For example STAT3 and c-Jun cooperate to induce expression of α (2Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar) macroglobulin (47Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Moreover, although IFNγ induced expression of C/EBPβ in STAT 1–/– MEFs (6Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Han Y. Ransohoff R.M. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6674-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), STAT1 was required for transactivation of C/EBPβ target genes but not DNA binding (48Hu J. Roy S.K. Shapiro P.S. Rodig S.R. Reddy S.P. Platanias L.C. Schreiber R.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although our data indicate that at least three classes of ISGs exist, genome-wide expression profiling will be required to confirm this and may identify other groups of ISGs, such as those repressed by STAT1, AP-1, or both factors following IFNγ treatment. Our data show that IFNγ-induced activation of AP-1 DNA binding was independent of both JAK1 and STAT1. Others have reported that hyperactivation of STAT3 by IFNγ can compensate for the loss of STAT1 and mediate transcription of ISGs (49Qing Y. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41679-41685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although our data does not entirely exclude this possibility, it does present strong evidence that this is not the case in our experimental system. First, AP-1 activity and corresponding iNOS expression was not only detected in IFNγ-stimulated STAT1–/– cells but also JAK1–/– cells in which IFNγ is incapable of activating STAT3 or GAS binding (49Qing Y. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41679-41685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 50Rodig S.J. Meraz M.A. White J.M. Lampe P.A. Riley J.K. Arthur C.D. King K.L. Sheehan K.C. Yin L. Pennica D. Johnson Jr., E.M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 1998; 93: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Second, STAT1–/– MEFs consistently lacked all of the IFNγ-induced GAS binding complexes observed in wild type cells across a range of oligonucleotide probes derived from promoters of different ISGs. Third, the induction of IP-10, SOCS3, and ifi204 was attenuated in STAT1–/– cells, suggesting that, at least for these genes, the absence of STAT1 could not be compensated. Finally, in contrast to a previous study (49Qing Y. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41679-41685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), we saw no increase in protein levels or the magnitude and duration of phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr-705 in STAT1–/– cells. We are yet to identify the molecular events that occur upstream of MEK1/2 following stimulation with IFNγ. Our data suggest that JAK 1 is dispensable; however, it does not rule out the possibility of compensation from other JAK kinases (especially JAK 2), which is a focus of continuing studies. IFNγ can also stimulate a large number of signal transduction proteins including Src family kinases c-Src (49Qing Y. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

The role of these molecules in IFNγ signaling has mainly been studied in the context of Ser-727 phosphorylation on STAT1; however, all of these proteins are upstream of ERK1/2 in other systems using various cytokines to stimulate signal transduction and thus are also potential activators of the IFNγ-induced MEK/ERK/AP-1 pathway described herein. It is becoming increasingly clear that a comprehensive response to IFNγ involves multiple signaling pathways that cooperate to stimulate transcription of ISGs (53Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (2372) Google Scholar). The IFNγ-induced MEK/ERK/c-Jun signaling pathway that we have deciphered provides important additional information regarding the molecular events that may underpin IFNγ biology. Although the JAK/STAT1 pathway plays a fundamental role in the biological response to IFNγ, it is evident that proteins, such as MAP kinases that can phosphorylate STAT1 on Ser-727, are also required for the full activation of STAT1 (7Ramana C.V. Gil M.P. Schreiber R.D. Stark G.R. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 96-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 53Platanias L.C. Nat. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W2075145977,"Downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM)/potassium channel interacting protein (KChIP3) is a multifunctional protein of the neuronal calcium sensor subfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins with specific roles in different cell compartments. In the nucleus, DREAM acts as a Ca2+-dependent transcriptional repressor, and outside the nucleus DREAM interacts with Kv4 potassium channels, regulating their trafficking to the cell membrane and their gating properties. In this study we characterized the interaction of DREAM with GRK6 and GRK2, members of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family of proteins, and their phosphorylation of DREAM. Ser-95 was identified as the site phosphorylated by GRK2. This phosphorylation did not modify the repressor activity of DREAM. Mutation of Ser-95 to aspartic acid, however, blocked DREAM-mediated membrane expression of the Kv4.2 potassium channel without affecting channel tetramerization. Treatment with the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and cyclosporin A also blocked DREAM-mediated Kv4.2 channel trafficking and calcineurin de-phosphorylated GRK2-phosphorylated DREAM in vitro. Our results indicate that these two Ca2+-dependent posttranslational events regulate the activity of DREAM on Kv4.2 channel function.

Ribas C. Mayor Jr., F. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). GRKs fall into three subgroups, one of which includes the two visual GRKs, GRK1 and GRK7 (1Penela P. Ribas C. Mayor Jr., F. Cell.

The non-visual GRKs subgroups divide further into the GRK2 subfamily, consisting of GRK2 and 3, and the GRK4 subfamily, with GRK4, -5, and -6. AlthoughGRK4 is expressed primarily in testis, other non-visual GRKs are ubiquitously expressed. GRKs share a characteristic tripartite modular architecture. The central ∼350-amino acid kinase domain is similar to that of other serine/threonine kinases. The C-terminal domain is of variable length and serves to facilitate interactions with lipids and other membrane proteins and is sometimes subject to different post-translational modifications. The N-terminal domains of all GRK family members are homologous to the regulator of G protein signaling family of proteins, providing additional phosphorylation-independent mechanisms for the control of cell signaling. In this regard it has been reported that GRK2/GRK3 specifically bind the Gαq subunit through the G protein signaling-like domain, which inhibits the interaction between Gαq and phospholipase Cβ (3Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Strernweis P.M. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34483-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In recent years the role of GRKs has expanded with the identification of new substrates such as non-G protein-coupled receptors including platelet-derived growth factor receptors (4Freedman N.J. Kim L.K. Murray J.P. Exum S.T. Brian L. Wu J.H. Peppel K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48261-48269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and also non-receptor substrates such as synucleins (5Pronin A.N. Morris A.J. Surguchov A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26515-26522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), tubulin (6Yoshida N. Haga K. Haga T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), phosducin (7Ruiz-Gomez A. Humrich J. Murga C. Quitterer U. Loshe M.J. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29724-29730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and ezrin (8Cant S.H. Pitcher J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3088-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) among others. Consistent with their key roles in cell function, multiple mechanisms exist to finely tune the activity, levels, and subcellular localization of GRKs. These mechanisms include intramolecular interactions, phosphorylation by different kinases, regulation of transcription and of protein stability, and interaction with different proteins (1Penela P. Ribas C. Mayor Jr., F. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 9Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). A common property of all three GRK subfamilies is their ability to interact with Ca2+ binding proteins of the EF-hand class, which reduces their kinase activity and provides a mechanism to terminate the receptor desensitization (for reviews, see Refs. 10Iacovelli L. Sallese M. Mariggio S. DeBlasi A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and 11Sallese M. Iacovelli L. Cumashi A. Capobianco L. Cuomo L. DeBlasi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This interaction is highly selective with respect to the different EF-hand proteins and GRK subtypes. Thus, calmodulin (CaM) binds with high affinity to members of the GRK4 subfamily, with low affinity to GRK2/3 members, and does not interact with GRK1 (12Chuang T.T. Iacovelli L. Sallese M. DeBlasi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 416-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Two CaM binding sites in the N- and the C-terminal domains of GRK5 and GRK2 are responsible for the interaction (13Levay K. Satpaev D.K. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13650-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which results in the case of GRK5 in autophosphorylation and reduced binding to phospholipids and to its receptor binding sites (14Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pronin A.N. Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31510-31518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the other hand, neuronal calcium sensors, including recoverin, neuronal calcium sensor-1, and visinin-like protein 1, have been described as specific regulators of GRK1 activity, with no effect on GRK2 or GRK5 activity (16Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16147-16152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17Boekhoff I. Braunewell K.H. Andreini I. Breer H. Gundelfinger E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 151-158PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that GRK2 interacts with the neuronal calcium sensor-1, resulting in the modulation of GRK2-mediated desensitization of the D2 dopamine receptor (18Kabbani N. Negyessy L. Lin R. Goldman-Rakic P. Levenson R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8476-8486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the study of the functional relationships between GRKs and calcium-binding proteins is an interesting field of research. DREAM is a multifunctional protein of the neuronal calcium sensor subfamily of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins with specific roles in different cell compartments (19Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 20An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, DREAM acts as a Ca2+-dependent transcriptional repressor, binding to specific sites in the DNA in the absence of calcium stimulation. In addition, DREAM interacts with several nucleoproteins also in a Ca2+-dependent manner to affect their transcriptional properties (21Ledo F. Carrión A.M. Link W.A. Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9120-9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Ledo F. Mellström B. Kremer L. Naranjo J.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 23Rivas M. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Santisteban P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33114-33122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Outside the nucleus, DREAM, also named KChIP3 (20An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), interacts with potassium channels of the Kv4 class directing their trafficking to and inside the plasma membrane (24Takimoto K. Yang E.-K. Conforti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26904-26911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and regulating in a Ca2+-dependent manner the gating properties of the channel (20An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). To regulate Kv4 trafficking in the plasma membrane, it has been shown that DREAM/KChIP3 needs to be palmitoylated at the cysteines in positions 45 and 46 (24Takimoto K. Yang E.-K. Conforti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26904-26911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutation at cysteines 45 and 46 blocks the redistribution into the plasma membrane in the presence of Kv4 channels and abolishes the increase in current amplitude observed with wild type DREAM (24Takimoto K. Yang E.-K. Conforti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26904-26911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Regulation of Kv4 channel gating depends on the conformation change in the DREAM/KChIP protein upon Ca2+ binding to the EF-hands (20An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation in the EF-hands of DREAM/KChIP3 causes a dramatic loss of its ability to induce faster and more complete channel inactivation recovery (20An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Conversely, palmitoylation at cysteines 45/46 does not influence the gating properties of the Kv4 channels (24Takimoto K. Yang E.-K. Conforti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26904-26911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study has shown that DREAM/KChIP3 participates in the tetramerization of Kv4 channels, restoring channel activity of Kv4.2 tetramerization mutants (25Kunjilwar K. Strang C. DeRubeis D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54542-54551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Finally, in the cytosol DREAM binds to the C-terminal region of the presenilins (26Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and blocks the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum and the apoptosis induced by presenilin mutants associated to Alzheimer disease (27Lilliehook C. Chan S. Choi E.K. Zaidi N.F. Wasco W. Mattson M.P. Buxbaum J.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study we describe the interaction between the neuronal calcium sensor DREAM/KChIP3 and GRK2 or GRK6 and analyzed the consequences of this interaction for different cellular functions of DREAM. We show that the phosphorylation state of DREAM at Ser-95 is regulated by GRK2 and calcineurin and that this is important for the regulation by DREAM of Kv4 channel cell surface expression. Cell Cultures and Transfections—HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), Chinese hamster ovary cells in DMEM-F-12 (1:1) with 10% FBS, and PC12 cells in DMEM with 10% horse serum and 5% FBS. All media were supplemented with Glutamax and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and incubation was at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. For coimmunoprecipitations, HEK 293 cells were cotransfected using calcium phosphate precipitation with DREAM and GRK cDNAs at a total amount of plasmid DNA of 10 μg. In some experiments, PC12 cells were treated with KCl (60 mm) or isoproterenol (100 nm) for 30 min. For electrophysiological recordings, HEK 293 cells were plated 2 days before transfection on 20-mm sterile glass coverslips at 50% confluence. Before transfection, cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum. Two μg of DNA of interest and 1 μg of EGFP-DNA were used for transfection in serum-free conditions with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 5 h, fetal bovine serum was added, and cells were recorded 35 h post-transfection. For confocal microscopy, HEK 293 cells on polylysine-coated glass coverslips in 35-mm plates were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation with 10 ng of EGFP-DREAM, wild type or mutations, and 300 ng of Kv4.2. When included, calcineurin and GRK2 were transfected at 3 and 2 μg, respectively. EF-hand mutated DREAM (EFmDREAM) was tagged with Myc epitopes instead of EGFP. Cells were fixed and analyzed 48 h posttransfection, in the case of EFmDREAM after immunostaining with anti-Myc (9E10) and anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Invitrogen). The phosphatase inhibitors, cyclosporin A (10 μm) and FK506 (0.1 μm), were present in the medium for the last 6 h. For size exclusion chromatography, Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected for 24 h using JetPei (PolyPlus-transfection, Illkirch, France) with 16 μg DREAM plasmids and 4 μg Kv4.2, wild type or the tetramerization-deficient mutant Kv4.2(-ZnB3) (25Kunjilwar K. Strang C. DeRubeis D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54542-54551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as recommended (Matchmaker protocol handbook, Clontech) using the yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109. The bait plasmid was constructed inserting cDNA encoding EFmDREAM into the pAS2-1 vector. A pretrans-formed bone marrow cDNA library cloned into the pACT2 vector was used for the screening. The interaction was monitored by transforming yeast library with the bait plasmid. Positive interactions were selected by sequential plating on low selective media S.D.DDO and high selective media S.D.QDO. Selected clones were subsequently subcloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pCS+2Myc. Protein Expression and Purification—GST-DREAM and His-DREAM were expressed in bacteria (BL21pLysS, Novagen) and purified by standard methods using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) beads, respectively. GRK2 and GRK6 were expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells and purified as described (7Ruiz-Gomez A. Humrich J. Murga C. Quitterer U. Loshe M.J. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol.

Purified urea-treated rod outer segments (consisting of >90% rhodopsin) were obtained as described (28Murga C. Ruiz-Gómez A. García-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation and Pulldown Assays—For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, whole cell extracts were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Cell membrane extract preparation was done as previously described (29Mellström B. Ceña V. Lamas M. Perales C. González C. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C using a mouse monoclonal antibody 1B1 for DREAM (22Ledo F. Mellström B. Kremer L. Naranjo J.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or antibodies against GRK2 (28Murga C. Ruiz-Gómez A. García-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), GRK6 (C-20, Santa Cruz), and for the Myc-tagged GRK truncated constructs, the mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) against c-Myc (Pharmingen). Immunocomplexes were captured with protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, and pellets were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Protein complexes were eluted in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Detection of DREAM after immuno-precipitation was performed with an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (Ab1014) raised against recombinant full-length DREAM (30Link W.A. Ledo F. Torres B. Palczewska M. Madsen T.M. Savignac M. Albar J.P. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5346-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For pulldown studies, GRK2 or GRK6 and its truncated forms were 35S-labeled in vitro using the transcription/translation T7-TNT system (Promega). Equimolar amounts, confirmed by PAGE and silver staining (data not shown), of recombinant GST and GST-DREAM proteins (20 pmol) bound to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with the labeled proteins in interaction buffer (20 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Blotto (Bio-Rad)) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and with the addition of 2 mm CaCl2 or 4 mm EDTA for calcium-dependence experiments. After five washes in the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, resolved in SDS-PAGE, detected by fluorography, and quantified using the NIH Image software. -Fold change was calculated by the ratio of glutathione-bound protein to GST protein alone. Phosphorylation Assays—GRK activities were assessed by a rhodopsin phosphorylation assay as previously described (7Ruiz-Gomez A. Humrich J. Murga C. Quitterer U. Loshe M.J. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29724-29730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of His-DREAM or GST-DREAM was performed in 50 μl of phosphorylation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.4 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 80 μm [γ32P]ATP (2–3 cpm/fmol)) in the presence of 20 mm pyrophosphate to minimize protein dephosphorylation during the reaction. Reactions contained the concentrations of recombinant GRK2, GRK6, GST-DREAM, or GST-DREAM mutants as indicated in the figure legends. In some experiments 0.8 μm heparin (Sigma) was included in the assay buffer. Reactions were started by exposure to fluorescent laboratory light. After incubation for indicated times at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 25 μl of SDS-sample buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were resolved by 8–12.5% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. Cerenkov counting of the excised bands was used to quantify the phosphorylation and determine stoichiometry. Dephosphorylation assays were initiated by adding 25 μlof2× calcineurin buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with 1.6 mm heparin in the presence or absence of 1.5 mm Ca+2 and 6.7 mg/ml calmodulin plus 10 units of calcineurin for 1 h at 30 °C. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—His-DREAM, 75 μg (analytical gel) or 1.5 mg (preparative gel for mass spectrometry analysis), was incubated with GRK2 (50 nm) for 2–3 h at 30 °C in phosphorylation buffer. Samples were concentrated by acetone precipitation before two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (7Ruiz-Gomez A. Humrich J. Murga C. Quitterer U. Loshe M.J. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29724-29730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. Spots of interest were subjected to in situ trypsin digestion, and digested peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (31Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7806) Google Scholar) by the Proteomics Service of Centro de Biología Molecular. Electrophysiological Procedures—Patch pipettes contained 10 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm K2SO4, 10 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.25. Bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, 5 mm caffeine, 10 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.35. Coverslips were washed once with bath solution without caffeine and placed in a 500-μl chamber with bath solution. Whole cell currents were recorded using the nystatin-perforated patch mode, only green fluorescent cells were patched. Patch electrodes had a resistance of 2–4 megaohms when filled with pipette solution. Current transients were evoked by applying a family of depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -80 mV to +60 mV (10-mV steps, 1000-ms length) under voltage-clamp using an EPC-7 amplifier (Heka, Lambrecht, Germany). Data were sampled at 1 kHz, and further analysis was performed using pClamp 9 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). A similar pulse protocol was applied from a holding potential of -40 mV to subtract the Ik component of the current. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Cells were harvested and lysed on ice in Tris/NaCl-buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2% CHAPS, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem). The cell extracts, 300 μl, were cleared by centrifugation and filtered through 0.45-μm filters before being applied to a Superose 6 analytical column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Tris/NaCl-buffer. Fractions of 400 μl were acetone-precipitated in the presence of trypsin inhibitor as a carrier. Protein pellets were resuspended in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by PAGE and immunoblotting using an antibody against Kv4.2 (N-15, Santa Cruz). Blots were developed with chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce) or ECL Advance (Amersham Biosciences). The Superose column was calibrated with molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences) for estimation of the size of proteins in each fraction. DREAM Interacts with GRK6 in a Ca2+- and Leucine-charged Residue-rich Domain (LCD)-dependent Manner—To disclose protein-protein interactions involving the DREAM protein that could reveal new functions in the cell, we screened a pretransformed bone marrow library using the yeast two-hybrid system. Previously, this approach resulted exclusively in detection of the Ca2+-independent interactions between DREAM and presenilins (26Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and Kv4 potassium channels (20An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that intracellular concentrations of luminal Ca2+ in the yeast possibly conditioned these earlier screenings, and we decided to use a DREAM mutant insensitive to Ca2+ (EFmDREAM) (19Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) as bait. Several positive interacting clones were selected and fully sequenced. Among them, one interaction, corresponding to a clone encoding an N-terminal truncation of the GRK6 kinase (GRK6ΔN, 351–576), called our attention and was further studied. Direct yeast two-hybrid with GRK6ΔN and EFmDREAM confirmed the interaction; however, bait containing wild type DREAM did not result in a positive interaction in the yeast system (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction between DREAM and GRK6ΔN might be sensitive to Ca2+. To further substantiate this observation we aimed to reproduce the Ca2+-dependent interaction in pulldown assays using GST-DREAM and in vitro translated 35S-labeled GRK6ΔN. In these experiments we observed a considerable nonspecific binding of GRK6ΔN to GST alone; nevertheless, the binding to the fusion protein GST-DREAM was reproducibly 2-fold above the nonspecific binding in three independent experiments. An example is shown in Fig. 1A. The addition of 2 mm CaCl2 to the incubation did not affect the nonspecific interaction with GST but substantially reduced the interaction with GST-DREAM to background levels, supporting that the interaction is sensitive to calcium. To validate these results and to get a hint about the domains in GRK6 involved in the interaction with DREAM, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments after cotransfection in HEK 293 cells of DREAM and GRK6ΔN or GRK6 truncated both at the N and C terminal (GRK6ΔNΔC) (Fig. 1B). Transient cotransfection of DREAM and GRK6ΔN reproduced the interaction previously observed in yeast and pulldown experiments (Fig. 1B); however, deletion of the C-terminal region in truncated GRK6ΔNΔC blocked its ability to immunoprecipitate DREAM, indicating that the C-terminal region is important for the interaction (Fig. 1B). GRK6ΔN did also not immunoprecipitate a mutant DREAM protein (DREAMmLCD1,2), in which two LCDs, located at positions amino acids 47–52 and 155–159, have been inactivated (Fig. 1B). This result indicates that, as previously shown for the interactions between DREAM and nucleoproteins cAMP-response element-binding protein and cAMP-responsive element modulator (21Ledo F. Carrión A.M. Link W.A. Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9120-9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Ledo F. Mellström B. Kremer L. Naranjo J.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the LCDs in DREAM are important for the interaction with GRK6. DREAM Interacts with GRK2 in an LCD-dependent Manner—To investigate the physiological relevance of the interaction between DREAM and GRK6, we first intended to reproduce the coimmunoprecipitation results with endogenously expressed proteins. For this, we used rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, shown to express high levels of DREAM (22Ledo F. Mellström B. Kremer L. Naranjo J.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4583-4592Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and several GRKs, including GRK6 and GRK2. 4A. Ruiz-Gomez, B. Mellström, E. Morato, M. Savignac, H. Holguín, K. Aurrekoetxea, P. González, F. Mayor, Jr., and J. R. Naranjo, unpublished results. In these experiments use of an antibody specific for GRK6 successfully immunoprecipitated endogenous DREAM both from whole cell extracts and membrane preparations (Fig. 2A). Use of an antibody specific for GRK2 also resulted in positive immuno-precipitation of DREAM from PC12 whole cell extract and from a membrane preparation (Fig. 2A). Notably, transient depolarization of PC12 cells with 60 mm extracellular KCl resulted in a reduced GRK2 coimmunoprecipitation with DREAM, supporting the notion of a Ca2+-sensitive interaction between DREAM and GRK proteins (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2028189288,"The human EVI5 gene was originally isolated through its involvement with a constitutional chromosome translocation in a patient with stage 4S neuroblastoma. Recently, it has been shown that EVI5 is a centrosomal protein in interphase cells, which relocalizes to the midbody during late phases of mitosis. Disruption of its function leads to incomplete cell division and the formation of multinucleate cells. The EVI5 protein contains a TBC (TRE2/BUB/CDC16 homology) motif located in the N-terminal region. Proteins containing a TBC domain have been shown in some cases to act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and function through the interaction with Rab-like small G proteins. Despite the identification of over 50 TBC-containing proteins, and over 70 Rab-like proteins, only three combinations have been shown to have Rab/GAP activity to date. In this study, using linear ion trap mass spectroscopy, we have demonstrated that EVI5 exists in a protein complex with Rab11. Further, using a specific Rab-binding assay, we have shown that EVI5 preferentially interacts with the guanosine triphosphate-bound form of Rab11, and in a GAP activity assay, we have confirmed that EVI5 functions as a GAP for the Rab11 GTPase."
https://openalex.org/W1968722748,"Nuclear factor-activated T cell 5 (NFAT5), a novel member of the NFAT family of proteins, was originally identified as a transcriptional factor responsible for adaptation to hyperosmotic stress. Though NFAT5 is ubiquitously expressed, the biological functions of NFAT5 remain to be clarified, especially in the tissues that are not exposed to hypertonicity, including hearts. In the present study, we focused on the cardioprotective roles of NFAT5 against the cardiotoxic anti-tumor agent doxorubicin (Dox). In cultured cardiomyocytes, transcripts of the hypertonicity-inducible genes, such as taurine transporter (TauT) and sodium/myo-inositol transporter, were down-regulated by Dox. Interestingly, NFAT5 protein, but not mRNA, was decreased in cardiomyocytes exposed to Dox. Treatment of proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 or proteasome-specific inhibitor 1, prevented the Dox-mediated decrease of NFAT5 protein. Further, ubiquitin-conjugated NFAT5 was not detected in cultured cardiomyocytes treated with MG-132 and/or Dox, as assessed by immunoprecipitation assay, suggesting Dox-induced degradation through ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway. Importantly, inhibition of NFAT5 with overexpression of dominant-negative NFAT5 decreased cell viability and increased creatine kinase leakage into culture medium. Consistently, small interfering RNA targeting NFAT5 gene enhanced myocyte death. These findings suggest that Dox promoted the degradation of NFAT5 protein, reducing cell viability in cardiomyocytes. This is the first demonstration that NFAT5 is a positive regulator of cardiomyocyte survival.

This is the first demonstration that NFAT5 is a positive regulator of cardiomyocyte survival. Because mature cardiac myocytes have a limited proliferative potential, accumulation of cardiomyocyte death leads to heart failure. Pathologically, cardiac myocyte death is induced by various kinds of stresses, such as hypoxia, mechanical stress, and cardiotoxic drugs.

Although the precise mechanisms of its myocardial damage are unclear, numerous evidence suggests that Dox induces cardiotoxicity through multiple pathways, including production of reactive oxygen species, perturbation of calcium handling, and selective inhibition of cardiac muscle-specific gene expression (1Minotti G.

NFAT5 (nuclear factor-activated T cell 5)/TonEBP (tonicity-response element-binding protein), a member of the rel/NFκB/NFAT family of transcription factors, was originally identified as a transcriptional factor involved in the cellular responses to hypertonic stress (7Ho S.N.

Whereas NFAT 1–4 are activated by Ca2+/calcineurin pathway, NFAT5 activity is regulated in a calcineurin-independent manner, because it lacks the N-terminal NFAT homology region containing the calcineurin regulatory motif (7Ho S.N.

NFAT5 transcriptionally regulates the expression of target genes responsible for the metabolism of organic osmolytes, including aldose reductase (9Ko B.C. Turck C.W. Lee K.W. Yang Y. Chung S.S.

Go W.Y. Ho S.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5477-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). NFAT5 is ubiquitously expressed even in tissues that are not exposed to hypertonic environment, such as brain, heart, and skeletal muscle (17Trama J. Lu Q. Hawley R.G. Ho S.N. J.

Recent studies have demonstrated that disruption of NFAT5 gene results in late gestational lethality and that surviving NFAT5-/- mice develop a remarkable atrophy of kidney medulla (19Lopez-Rodriguez C.

Similarly, suppression of NFAT5 transcriptional activity resulted in impaired cell proliferation with increased cell death in T-cell (16Trama J. Go W.Y. Ho S.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5477-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and lens fiber cells (20Wang Y. Ko B.C. Yang J.Y. Lam T.T. Jiang Z. Zhang J. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. J. Biol.

Interestingly, NFAT5, unlike the other members of the NFAT family of protein, is localized not only in cytosol but also in nucleus in isotonic conditions (9Ko B.C. Turck C.W. Lee K.W. Yang Y. Chung S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is proposed that NFAT5 activity is positively or negatively regulated independently of tonicity during normal development, although the tonicity-independent mechanisms for NFAT5 activation remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that transcriptional activity of NFAT5 was suppressed by Dox exposure in cultured cardiomyocytes in a proteasome-dependent manner. Then we tested the cytoprotective effects of NFAT5 activity by using the dominant-negative form of NFAT5. This is the first demonstration that NFAT5 functions as an important mediator for cardiomyocyte survival. Cell Culture—Cardiac myocytes were cultured as described previously (21Fujio Y. Matsuda T.

Briefly, cardiac ventricles of 1-day-old Wistar Kyoto rats were minced and dissociated with 0.1% trypsin and 0.1% collagenase type IV. To eliminate the non-myocyte population, dispersed cells were plated in culture dishes and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Nonattached cells were collected as cardiomyocytes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium/Ham's F-12 (DMEM/F-12) containing 5% neonatal calf serum and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine. On the other hand, attached cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 containing 5% neonatal calf serum and used as cardiac fibroblasts after being passed twice. After being cultured for 2 days, cells were washed twice and then treated with Dox (a kind gift from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd.) in serum-free DMEM/F-12. Cycloheximide (5 μm; Nacalai Tesque), MG-132 (5 μm; Calbiochem), proteasome inhibitor I (10 nm; Peptide Institute), U0126 (Cell Signaling), SB202190 (Alexis), SP600125 or H-7 (Calbiochem) was used to pretreat cells for 1 h prior to Dox treatment. Adenovirus infection was performed 24 h after seeding. Cells were cultured with adenovirus vector at a multiplicity of infection of 20. The human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293 cells) was cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Northern Blot—Northern blot was performed as described previously (10Ito T. Fujio Y. Hirata M. Takatani T. Matsuda T. Muraoka S. Takahashi K. Azuma J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments for NFAT5, TauT, SMIT, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Mega-Prime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot—Western blot was performed as described previously (10Ito T. Fujio Y. Hirata M. Takatani T. Matsuda T. Muraoka S. Takahashi K. Azuma J. Biochem.

Anti-NFAT5 (H-300), anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-NFAT5 (1439–1455) (Onco-gene), anti-phospho extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), anti-phospho p38 MAPK, anti-phospho c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (Cell Signaling), and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Chemicon) were used. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed using cell lysates from cultured cardiomyocytes. Protein samples in the lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque) were incubated on ice and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h with mouse anti-ubiquitin antibody (P4D1), and then protein G-conjugated Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to samples and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 1 min and washed three times with the lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40. Samples were boiled for 10 min in SDS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.8% SDS, 4% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol) for Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence Microscopic Examination—Immunofluorescence microscopic examination was performed as described previously (23Matsuda T. Fujio Y. Nariai T. Ito T. Yamane M. Takatani T. Takahashi K. Azuma J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2006; 40: 495-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, cardiomyocytes plated on the coverslip were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Immunostaining was performed using anti-NFAT5(1439–1455) antibody (1:1000; Oncogene). Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was used for detection. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258. Cells were examined by Olympus IX70. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared form cardiomyocytes or NFAT5-expressing HEK293 cells as described previously (24Uozumi Y. Ito T. Hoshino Y. Mohri T. Maeda M. Takahashi K. Fujio Y. Azuma J. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque)). Cells were lysed by incubation on ice for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction was discarded. The pellet was resus-pended in cold nuclear extract buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated on ice for 1 h. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the super-natant containing nuclear proteins was used for assay after protein concentrations were measured with BCA protein assay. Luciferase Assay—Promoter-reporter plasmids pTauT/-862-Luc, pTauT/-124-Luc, pTauT/-99-Luc, and pTauT/-124m-Luc were constructed as described previously (10Ito T. Fujio Y. Hirata M. Takatani T. Matsuda T. Muraoka S. Takahashi K. Azuma J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Transient transfection into cardiac myocytes was performed by using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Assay was performed by using the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega) as described previously (10Ito T. Fujio Y. Hirata M. Takatani T. Matsuda T. Muraoka S. Takahashi K. Azuma J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Expression vector of truncated NFAT5 construct consists of a DNA-binding domain (212–543 amino acids) as described previously (10Ito T. Fujio Y. Hirata M. Takatani T. Matsuda T. Muraoka S. Takahashi K. Azuma J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Other investigators have revealed that the deletion mutant inhibits endogenous NFAT5 activity, interfering with NFAT5 dimerization but not the transcriptional activity of the other NFATs, NFκB and AP-1 (16Trama J. Go W.Y. Ho S.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5477-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Lopez-Rodriguez C. Aramburu J. Rakeman A.S. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7214-7219Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Protein Expression in HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells seeded in 100-mm dishes were transfected with the NFAT5 expression vector pFLAG-NFAT5 (10Ito T. Fujio Y. Hirata M. Takatani T. Matsuda T. Muraoka S. Takahashi K. Azuma J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) by using FuGENE 6 transfection regent (Roche Applied Science) and were then cultured for 48 h. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as described previously (24Uozumi Y. Ito T. Hoshino Y. Mohri T. Maeda M. Takahashi K. Fujio Y. Azuma J. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To prepare DNA probes for EMSA, single-strand oligonucleotides (TauT-NFAT5 sense, AGC TGG TAT TTT TCC ACC CAG; TauT-NFAT5 antisense, CTG GGT GGA AAA ATA CCA GCT) were end labeled by [γ-32P]ATP and then were annealed at room temperature. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled DNA probe and poly(dI-dC) (100 μg/ml) at 30 °C for 20 min. To perform the competition assay, excess concentration of wild-type or mutant-type double-strand oligonucleotides (TauT-NFAT5 mut sense, AGC TGA TCT TCC CTT ACC CAG; TauT-NFAT5 mut antisense, CTG GGT AAG GGA AGA TCA GCT; mutated nucleotides are underlined) or BGT-NFAT5 oligonucleotide (BGT-NFAT5 sense, ACC AGC GGT AAT TTT CCA CCC AG; BGT-NFAT5 antisense, CTT GGT GGA AAA TTA CCG CTG GT) was preincubated for 5 min, followed by incubation with radiolabeled probe. For supershift assay, 2 μg of antibodies (anti-NFAT5 antibody or control IgG) was used. The DNA-protein complex was fractionated by 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and processed for autoradiography. Generation of Recombinant Adenovirus and Adenovirus Infection into Cardiomyocytes—To construct the recombinant adeno-virus vector encoding dominant-negative NFAT5 (dnNFAT5), the cDNA encoding the DNA-binding domain of NFAT5 was cloned into the cloning site of pACCMV.pLpA (26Gomez-Foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the recombinant plasmid was cotransfected with pJM17 plasmid into HEK293 cells, and the replication-deficient adenovirus was generated via homologous recombination as described previously (21Fujio Y. Matsuda T. Oshima Y. Maeda M. Mohri T. Ito T. Takatani T. Hirata M. Nakaoka Y. Kimura R. Kishimoto T. Azuma J.

Cardiac myocytes were infected with adenovirus in medium with 5% fetal calf serum at multiplicity of infection of 20 and cultured for 2 days. Adenovirus carrying β-galactosidase was used as a control. The infection efficiency of the adenovirus was almost 100% in cultured cardiomyocytes confirmed by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 7A). Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Studies—For siRNA analysis, TriFECTa Dicer-substrate RNA interference kit (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc.) containing 27-mer duplex was used. The following sequences specific for rat NFAT5 gene were used: sense 5′-GCC UCG ACC CUA GCA GCA ACA UGA C-3′, antisense 5′-GUC AUG UUG CUG CUA GGG UCG AGG CCA-3′. Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was used to deliver siRNA (10 nm) into cultured cardiomyocytes according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiency was confirmed by Cy3-labeled transfection control and was almost 100% (data not shown). Double-strand scrambled oligonucleo-tides were used as a negative control. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum starved for 48 h, and then cell viability was assessed by MTS assay. Measurement of Cytotoxicity—Cell viability was estimated by MTS assay. Cells were plated on 96-well plates at a density of 1–5 × 104 cells/well and were cultured for 2 days. MTS assay was performed by using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega) as described in the manufacturer's protocol (10Ito T. Fujio Y. Hirata M. Takatani T. Matsuda T. Muraoka S. Takahashi K. Azuma J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cell damage was evaluated by measuring CPK activity in culture medium by spectrophotometric assay using the CPK test WAKO kit (Wako Chemical) according to the manufacturer's protocol as described previously (27Takahashi K. Ohyabu Y. Solodushko V. Takatani T. Itoh T. Schaffer S.W. Azuma J. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2003; 41: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Each value was expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant when the calculated p value was < 0.05. NFAT5 and Its Downstream Targets Are Down-regulated by Dox Exposure in Cultured Cardiomyocytes—Osmotic stress-related genes, such as the organic osmolyte transporters, are expressed in the tissues that are not exposed to hypertonic stresses, including the heart (28Zhang Z. Ferraris J.D. Brooks H.L. Brisc I. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F688-F693Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To address their pathophysiological significance in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity, we examined the expression of TauT and SMIT in cardiomyocytes exposed to Dox. Myocytes were treated with or without Dox (0.3 μm) for 24 h, and TauT and SMIT mRNA were analyzed. Northern blot analyses revealed that Dox exposure resulted in down-regulation of TauT and SMIT (Fig. 1). Because the expression of osmotic stress-related genes is regulated by NFAT5 (7Ho S.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Woo S.K. Lee S.D. Kwon H.M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. Pfluegers Arch. Gesamte Physiol. Menschen Tiere. 2002; 444: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of Dox on NFAT5 expression in cultured cardiomyocytes. Western blot analyses revealed that NFAT5 protein was significantly reduced compared with non-treated myocytes (Fig. 2, A and D). Glyceralde-hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein expression was not affected by Dox treatment, suggesting that the reduction of NFAT5 may be due to a selective pathway induced by Dox. NFAT5 was decreased in a time-dependent manner, and the reduction in NFAT5 was examined 6 h after Dox exposure (Fig. 2B). Together, these findings identified a novel nuclear pathway targeted by Dox in cardiomyocytes. To ascertain whether a decrease of NFAT5 protein by Dox exposure is dependent on NFAT5 transcript level, Northern blot analyses were performed. NFAT5 mRNA was not down-regulated by Dox exposure (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, Dox-mediated decline of NFAT5 protein may result from reduced translation or selective degradation. Degradation of NFAT5 Is Enhanced by Dox Exposure in Cardiomyocytes—To determine whether NFAT5 stability is affected by Dox exposure, the protein level of NFAT5 was measured in the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, by Western blot analyses (Fig. 3A). Dox treatment accelerated turnover of NFAT5 protein in cells treated with cycloheximide. Collectively, these observations indicate that Dox enhances specific proteolysis of NFAT5. NFAT5 Is Degraded via Proteasome-mediated Proteolysis Pathway—Previous study has demonstrated that Dox activates proteasome-mediated proteolysis pathway in cardiac myocytes (6Kumarapeli A.R. Horak K.M. Glasford J.W. Li J. Chen Q. Liu J. Zheng H. Wang X. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 2051-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To investigate the pathway for reduction of NFAT5, we analyzed whether the proteasome-mediated proteolysis is involved in the reduction of NFAT5 protein by Dox. Cardiomyocytes were cultured with Dox in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (5 μm) or proteasome-specific inhibitor I (10 nm) for 24 h, and then the expression of NFAT5 was analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 3B). While NFAT5 expression was decreased by Dox alone, treatment with proteasome inhibitors prevented the down-regulation of NFAT5. These data suggest that degradation of NFAT5 caused by Dox exposure is due to the activation of proteasome. To ascertain whether ubiquitination was involved in Dox-mediated NFAT5 degradation, immunoprecipitation assay was performed (Fig. 3C). Samples used in this assay were prepared from cultured cardiomyocytes treated with or without Dox and/or MG-132 for 12 h. Whereas ubiquitinated proteins were detected in MG-132- or MG-132/Dox-treated cells, ubiquitinated NFAT5 was not detected in immunoprecipitated proteins with anti-ubiquitin antibody. These data suggest that ubiquitin-independent proteasome proteolysis pathway may be involved in Dox-enhanced NFAT5 degradation. Various kinds of serine/threonine protein kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family proteins, are activated by Dox exposure in hearts and cardiomyocytes (29Poizat C. Puri P.L. Bai Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2673-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Lou H. Danelisen I. Singal P.K. Am. J.

Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 736-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Indeed, we ascertained that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, p38 MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were activated by Dox exposure over 12 h (Fig. 3D). We tested whether Dox-induced activation of MAPK families was involved in NFAT5 degradation by Dox exposure using U0126, a MEK 1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase I) inhibitor, or SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, or SP600125, a JNK inhibitor (Fig. 3E). However, none of these inhibitors suppressed Dox-enhanced degradation of NFAT5 protein. Further, we examined the effect of H-7, a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine kinases with relative specificity for protein kinase C. However, H-7 also failed to suppress the NFAT5 degradation. Thus, these data indicate that the signal cascades associated with MAPK family members and H-7-sensitive protein kinases are not involved in Dox-enhanced NFAT5 degradation. Degradation of NFAT5 Protein Caused by Dox Exposure Is Not Observed in Non-cardiac Cells—To evaluate whether NFAT5 degradation by Dox is a cardiac myocyte-specific response, Western blot was performed by using lysate obtained from cardiac fibroblasts or the HEK293 cell line. Reduction of NFAT5 protein by Dox was not observed in the cell lysates from either cardiac fibroblasts or HEK293 cells, as shown in Fig. 4. Transcriptional Activity of NFAT5 Is Suppressed by Dox Exposure in Cardiac Myocytes—Next, we determined intracellular localization of NFAT5 in cardiomyocytes exposed to Dox. Immunofluorescence microscopic analyses by using anti-NFAT5 antibody revealed that NFAT5 was localized in nuclei in cardiomyocytes cultured in the absence of Dox, whereas nuclear NFAT5 protein was markedly decreased by exposure to Dox (Fig. 5A). Consistently, Western blot analyses showed that NFAT5 was decreased in nuclear extracts from Dox-exposed cardiomyocytes compared with that of control cells (Fig. 5B). To evaluate whether the down-regulation of NFAT5 protein is accompanied by the reduction in its transcriptional activity, promoter-reporter assay was performed by using reporter"

M., Nossal, N. G., and Griffith, J. D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 21276–21285). Here we probe the composition of this replication complex using nanoscale DNA biopointers to show the location of biotin-tagged replication proteins. We find that a large fraction of the molecules with a trombone loop had two pointers to polymerase, providing strong evidence that the leading and lagging strand polymerases are together in the replication complex. 6% of the molecules had two loops, and 31% of these had three pointers to biotin-tagged polymerase, suggesting that the two loops result from two fragments that are being extended simultaneously. Under fixation conditions that extend the lagging strand, occasional molecules show two nascent lagging strand fragments, each being elongated by a biotin-tagged polymerase. T4 41 helicase is present in the complex on a large fraction of actively replicating molecules but on a smaller fraction of molecules with a stalled polymerase.

Unexpectedly, we found that 59 helicase-loading protein remains on the fork after loading the helicase and is present on molecules with extensive replication. DNA replication is catalyzed by complexes of replication proteins that work together to catalyze the continuous synthesis of the new leading strand and the priming, discontinuous synthesis, and joining of short fragments on the new lagging strand. The coordinated interaction of these replication proteins with each other, and with DNA, is responsible for the accurate and timely duplication of the genome. Because the two strands of the duplex have opposite polarity, the leading and lagging strand polymerases move in opposite directions relative to the fork. Bruce Alberts (1Alberts B.M. Trends Genet. 1985; 1: 26-30Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (10) Google Scholar) proposed that leading and lagging strand synthesis could be coordinated if the nascent lagging strand fragment and the single-stranded DNA behind it were folded into what has been called a “trombone loop” to bring the two polymerases together (see Fig. 1). Our previous electron microscopic studies of the bacteriophage T4 replication complex confirmed this trombone model (2Chastain P. Makhov A.M. Nossal N.G. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We found a single complex of the leading and lagging strand proteins at the fork, with a single loop present on 43% of the molecules. Another 43% of the molecules did not have a loop, as expected for molecules stopped at the stage when the previous fragment has finished, but the next fragment had not started. Unexpectedly, and not anticipated by the Alberts model, 8% of the molecules had two loops near the fork, and 5% contained more than two, consistent with molecules in which a new lagging strand fragment has been initiated before the previous fragment was completed. In contrast to the original model (see Fig. 1A), the DNA in the loops was completely double-stranded, with no visible extended single-stranded DNA. Instead, the protein-covered single-stranded DNA segments on the lagging strand were folded into highly compact structures (“bobbins”), which constitute the major portion of the mass of the replication complex (Fig. 1B). This compact structure forms as a result of lagging strand synthesis. It was not observed in the absence of primase. Similar compact structures were found on molecules replicated with phage T7 proteins (3Lee J. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Mol.

Although the size of the complex at the fork was large enough to contain all the proteins needed for leading and lagging strand synthesis, as well as ∼800 b 2The abbreviations used are: b, base; TAPS, [tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-aminopropanesulfonic acid); TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydro-chloride; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). of protein-covered single-stranded DNA, the proteins actually present in these complexes could not be determined by this technique. The T4 replication proteins provide an attractive model system for determining the architecture of the replication fork and the mechanisms responsible for controlling and coordinating DNA synthesis on the two strands. This relatively simple multienzyme replication system composed of highly purified bacteriophage T4-encoded proteins is organized into the same functional enzyme groups as those in more complex eukaryotic replication systems (reviewed in Refs. 6Nossal N.G.

The RNA primers and adjacent DNA are ultimately removed by a T4 encoded 5′ to 3′ nuclease (T4 RNase H), and the adjacent fragments joined by T4 DNA ligase (25Bhagwat M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol.

Nature. 1970; 227: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and binds and modulates the activities of the polymerase, primase, helicase loader, and RNase H. We have now further developed a powerful technique first applied to yeast Orc complexes (29Chastain II, P.D. Bowers J.L. Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36354-36362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to use DNA “pointers” to biotin-tagged replication proteins to determine which proteins are present in the replication complexes visualized by electron microscopy at different stages of replication. We show that many of the protein complexes at the fork contain two polymer-ases, as expected if the leading and lagging strand polymerases are coordinated. Under fixation conditions that extend the lagging strand, occasional molecules show two nascent lagging strand fragments, each being elongated by a biotin-tagged polymerase, consistent with our previous finding of molecules with more than one lagging strand loop (2Chastain P.

We find that the 59 helicase-loading protein remains on the fork after loading the helicase and is present on molecules with extensive replication. Biotin-tagged helicase is present on a large fraction of actively replicating molecules but on a smaller fraction of molecules with a stalled polymerase. Cloning and Expression of Biotin-tagged T4 Replication Proteins—A 16-residue peptide (SGLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) that is biotinylated on the lysine in vivo by the Escherichia coli biotin ligase (BirA) enzyme (30Schatz P.J. Biotechnology (N. Y.). 1993; 11: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), followed by a Gly4 or a Pro4Gly linker, was inserted after the N-terminal methionine of T4 gene 41 helicase (p41Nbiogly and p41Nbiopro), and T4 gene 59 heli-case-loading protein (p59Nbiogly). This was accomplished by inserting the following oligonucleotides into the NdeI site at the beginning of these genes in T7 expression plasmids as follows: Glytop, 5′-tatgtccggtctgaacgacatcttcgaagctcagaaaatcgaatggcacgaaggtggtggtgg; Glybot, 3′-acaggccagacttgctgtagaagcttcgagtcttttagcttaccgtgcttccaccaccaccat; Protop, 5′-tatgtccggtctgaacgacatcttcgaagctcagaaaatcgaatggcacgaaccgccgccgccggg; and Probot, 3′-acaggccagacttgctgtagaagcttcgagtcttttagcttaccgtgcttggcggcggcggcccat. For T4 41 helicase, an NdeI site was added to pNN4101 (31Jones C.E. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27145-27154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by removing the small BsaXI fragment and replacing it with oligonucleotides that changed the agtgtg at the beginning of gene 41 to the NdeI sequence catatg. The internal NdeI site in the gene 59 expression plasmid pNN2859 (18Spacciapoli P. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 447-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was removed by site-directed mutagenesis. Because the N terminus of the gene 59 helicase-loading protein is in a β sheet in the crystal structure (32Mueser T.C. Jones C.E. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 597-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we also made 59 protein with its biotin tag at the C terminus by adding oligonucleotides encoding the Gly4 linker followed by SGLNDIFEAQKIEWHE at the end of gene 59 in pNN2859 (p59Cbiogly). To introduce the same sequences at the N terminus of T4 DNA polymerase, a BsgI site was first introduced just after the BamHI site in pPST4pol (33Spacciapoli P. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 438-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by amplifying the region between the BamHI and XhoI sites using the primers 5′-GCAGGATCCGTGCAGACTAAGGAATATCTATG (43 PCR TOP) and 5′-CGCTTCATCCAATCTCGAGCATCTTTCATTG (43 PCR BOT). The BamHI to XhoI region of the PCR fragment was then used to replace the same region in pPST4pol (pRB405). Finally the BsgI to PstI fragment of pRB405, the Pst to NdeI fragment of the T7 expression vector pVex11, and oligonucleotides encoding SGLNDIFEAQKIEWHE followed by a Gly4 or a Pro4Gly linker were ligated together (p43Nbiogly and p43Nbiopro). For expression, we first isolated pBirAcm, a pACYC184 plasmid with an isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible birA gene to overexpress biotin-protein ligase, from E. coli AVB99, purchased from Avidity (www.avidity.com). The pBirAcm plasmid was then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), with chloramphenicol at 10 μg/ml. Finally we moved each of the plasmids encoding T4 biotin fusion proteins into E. coli BL21(DE3) (pBirAcm). Cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.4 at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μm final concentration biotin, 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. Addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm induces both biotin-protein ligase and T7 RNA polymerase, and this gave good expression of each of the T4 fusion proteins after 2 h. Purification of Biotin-tagged T4 Replication Proteins—Proteins were purified by modifications of the methods previously described for the unmodified proteins, followed by affinity chromatography on monovalent avidin (Softlink from Promega, Madison, WI) for the helicase and polymerase, or the higher capacity Streptavidin Mutein Matrix (Roche Applied Science) for 59 protein. Biotin in the proteins was measured using streptavidin horseradish peroxidase and the Protein Detector LumiGLO Western blot Kit from KPL, Inc. The N- and C-terminally tagged biotin-59 proteins with Gly4 linkers from 2-liter cultures were partially purified through the high salt supernatant step (34Jones C.E. Green E.M. Stephens J.A. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25721-25728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The affinity purification on the Streptavidin Mutein Matrix, by the following modification of the manufacturer's protocol, was carried out at 4 °C. A 4-ml column (stated capacity is 2.5 mg of biotinylated protein per ml), was washed with 40 ml of wash buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl), and then with 16 ml of equilibration buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 400 mm ammonium sulfate). Half of the high salt supernatant (2 ml) was mixed with 1.25 ml of 3× equilibration buffer and then applied to this column. The column was closed for 40 min to allow protein to bind, and then washed with 40 ml of the wash buffer. 4 ml of elution buffer (wash buffer with 2 mm d-biotin) was allowed to run into the column, the column was closed for 30 min, and the biotin-tagged protein was then eluted with 20 ml more of the elution buffer, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. Most of the biotin-tagged 59 protein was in the first 2 ml. The matrix was regenerated following the manufacturer's protocol and then used to purify the remainder of the 59 protein. Peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm TCEP, and 100 mm KCl, and stored at -85 °C. The N-terminal biotin-tagged T4 DNA polymerases from p43Nbiogly and p43Nbiopro were purified from 2-liter cultures by the rapid batch phosphocellulose method described previously (35Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. Hobbs L.J. Spacciapoli P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 560-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and then on a Softlink monovalent biotin resin from Promega. To saturate nonspecific binding sites for biotin and regenerate the resin, 1-ml columns were washed sequentially with 5 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0); 5 ml of the same buffer containing 10 mm biotin; 10 ml of 10% acetic acid; and then with 10 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to bring the pH of the effluent to 6.8. The column was closed for 1 h at room temperature to allow the avidin to refold, moved to 4 °C, and equilibrated with 43SL buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Polymerase (2 mg) was loaded in 0.5-ml aliquots, closing the column for 15 min after each addition. The column was then washed with 8 ml of 43SL buffer, and the biotin-tagged protein was eluted with 43SL buffer containing 10 mm biotin, closing the column for 15 min after each 0.5-ml addition. Most of the protein (40% recovery) was in the second and third 0.5-ml fractions. Polymerase was dialyzed against 43SL buffer and stored at -85 °C. The N-terminal biotin-tagged T4 41 helicase from a 5-liter culture of p41biopro or p41biogly was purified through the Q-Sepharose chromatography step as described previously (31Jones C.E. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27145-27154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1-ml column of Softlink monovalent avidin was treated as described above and then equilibrated with AT buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Na-TAPS, pH 8.5, 0.5 mm TCEP-HCl (Pierce)). A peak fraction of helicase from the Q-Sepharose column (∼1.5 mg) was loaded on this Softlink column, the column was washed with 1 ml of AT buffer, and biotin-helicase was eluted with AT buffer containing 5 mm biotin, dialyzed against AT buffer, and stored at -85 °C.

Reaction mixtures without proteins were incubated for 2 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was begun by adding a mixture of all the proteins except T4 RNaseH and ligase, which were added 30 s later to prevent ligation of the nicked templates before replication began. Biotin-tagged replication proteins replaced wild-type proteins as indicated. Unless otherwise noted, reactions were stopped by adding 20 μl of 45 mm EDTA, and 1.8% glut-araldehyde in 1× replication salts without MgCl, giving a final concentration of 0.6% glutaraldehyde. After 5 min at room temperature, the glutaraldehyde fixation was quenched by adding 20 μl of 400 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 20 mm EDTA, followed 10 min later by 20 μlof2.4 μm streptavidin (Molecular Probes) in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA to bind the biotin-tagged protein. The samples were placed on a rotator for 30 min at room temperature, and then filtered on 2-ml columns of 50- to 150-μm 2% agarose beads (Agarose Bead Technologies) in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm EDTA to remove unbound streptavidin and replication proteins. A 96-μl aliquot of the fraction containing the DNA-protein complexes was mixed with a 5′ biotinylated 300- or 179-bp DNA, amplified from Bluescript plasmid, to give a final concentration of 2 μg/ml (9.6 μm). The 179-bp DNA was used in Fig. 3F. The 300-bp DNA, which is more clearly visible on the micrographs, was used in all other figures. The samples were mixed on a rotator for 18–20 h at 4 °C to allow binding of the biotinylated DNA, and then filtered on 2-ml columns of the 2% agarose in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm EDTA to remove unbound biotinylated “DNA pointers.” Replication reactions for analysis on gels were carried out as described above for electron microscopy, except that RNase H and ligase were omitted so that the lagging strand fragments were not joined together. At the times indicated in the figures, aliquots of the reaction mixtures were mixed with an equal volume of 0.2 m EDTA to stop the synthesis, and the products were analyzed by 0.6% alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis and trichloroacetic acid precipitation (35Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. Hobbs L.J. Spacciapoli P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 560-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Samples were adsorbed to thin carbon foils, washed, air-dried, and rotary shadowcast with tungsten at high vacuum (37Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Samples were examined in an FEI Tecnai 12 instrument at 40 kV. Length measurements were made by capturing the images with a Gatan 4K charge-coupled device camera attached to the Tecnai 12 and using Digital Micrograph software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Images for publication were captured on the Gatan charge-coupled device or on sheet film and then scanned with an Imacon 848 film scanner, and the contrast was optimized and panels were arranged using Adobe Photo-shop software. We only analyzed molecules with a circle the same size as the starting template. Molecular Pointers to Proteins within the T4 Replication Complex— We have used biotinylated DNA as a molecular pointer to identify proteins within the T4 replication complex. A 16-residue peptide (SGLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) that is biotinylated on the lysine in vivo by the E. coli biotin ligase (BirA) enzyme (30Schatz P.J. Biotechnology (N. Y.). 1993; 11: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), followed by a Gly4 or a Pro4Gly linker, was inserted after the N-terminal methionine in T4 DNA polymerase, 41 helicase, and 59 helicase-loading protein, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purification methods for each protein included an affinity column (Softlink (Promega) or the higher capacity Streptavidin Mutein Matrix (Roche Applied Science)) to remove proteins without the biotin tag. The degree of biotinylation of the helicase and polymerase was higher with the Pro4Gly than the Gly4 linker, suggesting that the more rigid linker made the peptide more accessible to the biotin ligase. The biotin-tagged polymerase and 59 helicase loader had activity equivalent to the wild-type proteins (Fig. 2, A and C). The template is the 2.7-kb pUCNICK plasmid, nicked at the single recognition site for the N-BbvCIA nicking enzyme (34Jones C.E. Green E.M. Stephens J.A. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25721-25728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Reactions contained T4 DNA polymerase, 45 clamp, 44/62 clamp loader, primase, 41 helicase, 59 helicase loader, and 32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein. The lagging strand fragments were not joined, because no T4 RNase H or DNA ligase was added to these reactions. 59 helicase loader with the same tag at its C terminus retained ∼50% of the wild-type activity (data not shown). T4 41 helicase is required for both increasing the rate of leading strand synthesis by unwinding the duplex ahead of the polymerase and allowing the primase to make the pentamer primers that initiate the lagging strand fragments. The biotin-tagged helicase retains both these activities and is nearly as active as the wild-type helicase (Fig. 2B). We needed a DNA pointer that was long enough to extend beyond the large T4 replication complex (2Chastain P. Makhov A.M. Nossal N.G. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and be clearly visible on electron microscopy images. In our early experiments we used a pointer composed of a purified complex of a 179-bp biotinylated DNA duplex bound to a streptavidin tetramer (29Chastain II, P.D. Bowers J.L. Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36354-36362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, we have found that it is easier and just as efficient to add streptavidin to the fixed replicating molecules, remove unbound replication proteins and streptavidin by gel filtration, and then add a 179- or 300-bp biotinylated DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the replication reactions for electron microscopy, the lagging strand fragments were joined by T4 RNaseH and DNA ligase. These were added 30 s after the other enzymes to prevent ligation of the nicked templates before replication began. T4 Replication Complexes Contain Both Leading and Lagging Strand Polymerases—Our previous electron microscopy analysis of T4-replicating molecules showed a single complex at the replication fork that was large enough to contain the clamped leading and lagging strand polymerases, the heli-case, primase, and helicase loader, and ∼800 b of single-stranded DNA covered with 32 protein folded into a compact structure (2Chastain P. Makhov A.M. Nossal N.G. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There was frequently a double-stranded trom-bone loop, formed from the nascent lagging strand fragment, attached to the complex. The 300-bp biotinylated pointer clearly shows the presence of two polymerases in this complex on the 2.7-kb circular pUCNICK template (Fig. 3, A, B, and D) and on a 452-bp nicked minicircle (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 3C). The minicircle was designed to be large enough to be visible on the micrographs. In a series of six experiments with the biotin-tagged polymerase, 27–70% of the molecules scored had one"

However, the function of DcR3 on bone formation remains largely unknown. To understand the function of DcR3 in bone formation in vivo, transgenic mice overexpressing DcR3 were generated. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) of total body were significantly lower in DcR3 transgenic mice as compared with wild-type controls. The difference in BMD and BMC between DcR3 transgenic and control mice was confirmed by histomorphometric analysis, which showed a 35.7% decrease in trabecular bone volume in DcR3 transgenic mice in comparison with wild-type controls. The number of osteoclasts increased in DcR3 transgenic mice. In addition, local administration of DcR3 (30 μg/ml, 10 μl, once/day) into the metaphysis of the tibia via the implantation of a needle cannula significantly decreased the BMD, BMC, and bone volume of secondary spongiosa in tibia. Local injection of DcR3 also increased osteoclast numbers around trabecular bone in tibia. Furthermore, coadminstration of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor inhibitor/Fc chimera (TNFRSF1A) but not osteoprotegerin inhibited the action of DcR3. In addition, in an assay of osteoclast activity on substrate plates, DcR3 significantly increased the resorption activity of mature osteoclasts. Treatment with higher concentrations of DcR3 slightly increased nodule formation and alkaline phosphatase activity of primary cultured osteoblasts. These results indicate that DcR3 may play an important role in osteoporosis or other bone diseases.

These results indicate that DcR3 may play an important role in osteoporosis or other bone diseases. Bone is a complex tissue composed of several cell types that are continuously undergoing a process of renewal and repair termed “bone remodeling.” Two major cell types responsible for bone remodeling are osteoclasts, which resorb bone, and osteoblasts, which form new bone (1Tolar J. Teitelbaum S.L. Orchard P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 2839-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts are cells derived from the monocyte-macrophage lineage that have an important role in modeling bone during skeletal growth and in remodeling bone during adult life (2Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar). Increased osteoclast activity or uncoupling of osteoclastic bone resorption from bone formation results in focal or generalized bone loss and is a characteristic feature of bone diseases such as osteoporosis, Paget disease of bone, and cancer-associated bone disease (3Helfrich M.H. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 61: 514-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The importance of osteoclastic bone resorption in the pathogenesis of these diseases is reflected by the fact that the most successful drug treatment for bone disease works by inhibiting bone resorption (4Rodan G.A. Martin T.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1508-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). Recent findings indicated that two key molecules, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) 3The abbreviations used are: M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; DcR3, decoy receptor 3; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; RANKL, receptor for activation of NF-κB ligand; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TNFRSF1A, soluble TNF receptor inhibitor/Fc chimera; BMD, bone mineral density; BMC, bone mineral content; OAAS, osteoclast activity assay substrate; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; OPG, osteoprotegerin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcription. and the receptor for activation of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), are essential and sufficient to promote osteoclastogenesis (5Hofbauer L.C.

In addition, the overexpression of DcR3 has been reported in cases of silicosis or systemic lupus erythematous (21Otsuki T. Tomokuni A. Sakaguchi H. Aikoh T. Matsuki T. Isozaki Y. Hyodoh F. Ueki H. Kusaka M. Kita S. Ueki A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 119: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), as well as in bacterial antigen-stimulated monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (22Kim S. McAuliffe W.J. Zaritskaya L.S. Moore P.A. Zhang L. Nardelli B. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). DcR3 can block the effects of its known ligands (FasL, LIGHT, and TL1A) and contributes to tumor growth by impeding the immune response as well as inducing angiogenesis (23Yang C.R. Hsieh S.L. Teng C.M. Ho F.M. Su W.L. Lin W.W. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1122-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). On the other hand, DcR3 can also act as a regulator for the differentiation and maturation of myeloid cells, possibly through interaction with novel ligand(s) (24Hsu M.J. Lin W.W. Tsao W.C.

Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: S97-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) demonstrate that human DcR3 induces osteoclastogenesis from the cultures of monocyte, macrophage, and bone marrow cells. However, the regulatory action of DcR3 on bone remodeling in animals remains largely unknown. Here we report that DcR3 transgenic mice show a decrease of bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and bone volume, accompanied by an increase of osteoclast formation. The in vivo effect of DcR3 may play an important role in osteolytic bone diseases. Materials—α-MEM, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen. The osteoclast activity assay substrate (OAAS) was obtained from OCT USA, Inc. (Torrance, CA). Recombinant human M-CSF, RANKL, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) and ELISA kits for mouse TNF-α and RANKL and were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human soluble TNF receptor inhibitor/Fc chimera (TNFRSF1A) was obtained from GenScript Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). Vitamin C, β-glycerophosphate, and alizarin red-S were obtained from Sigma. The ELISA kit for C-terminal telopeptides of type-I collagen was obtained from Nordic Bioscience (Herlev, Denmark). The human DcR3 ELISA kit was obtained from Anawrahta Biotech (Taipei, Taiwan). Generation of DcR3 Transgenic Mice and Histological Examination—The DcR3 heterozygous transgenic mice were generated from a BALB/c background for at least six generations as described previously (26Hsu T.L. Wu Y.Y. Lai M.Z. Su W.B. Hsieh S.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of human DcR3 was subcloned into pPGK-Neo-bpA to regulate the expression of DcR3 ubiquitously under the control of PGK promoter. DcR3 transgenic mice were screened by PCR using the primers pGKP (sense, 5′-GCCAATAGCAGCTTTGCTC-3′) and DcR3–207 (antisense, 5′-TAGGTGGGTGTTTCTGCCAC-3′), which amplify a 350-bp fragment from the pPGK-DcR3 transgene. The DcR3 transgene-negative littermates were used as wild-type mice. BMD and BMC of full-body (body weight, 22–28 g) were determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometer (XR-26; Norland, Fort Atkinson, WI) using a mode for small subjects. A coefficient of variation of 0.7% was calculated from daily measurements of BMD on a lumbar phantom for more than 1 year. At the end of the program, the tibia was fixed and decalcified and then embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (5 μm) were cut longitudinally, and the sections were stained with Mayer's hematoxylin-eosin solution. Images of the growth plate and proximal tibia were photographed using Olympus microscope IX70. For measurement of the osteoclast number, the sections were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). Bone volume was calculated using image analysis software (Image-pro plus 3.0) and expressed as the percentage of bone area. All measurements were done in a single blind fashion. Local Administration of DcR3 into Tibia in Young Rats—Local injection of DcR3 into tibia of young rats was performed as described previously (27Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Huang T.H. Liu S.H. Fu W.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 440-449PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Fu W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22907-22916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 75–90 g were used. Implantation of a cannula (22-gauge needle) was done from the posteriolateral side into the proximal tibial metaphysis in both limbs of rats anesthetized with trichloroacetaldehyde. The cannula had its outer end in the subcutaneous tissue. DcR3 (30 μg/ml, 10 μl) was percutaneously injected into the proximal tibia through the cannula (once/day) for 7 consecutive days. The same volume of vehicle was injected into the contralateral side for comparison. The rats were sacrificed, and tibiae were removed on day 14. BMD and BMC of the tibia were measured with the same dual-energy x-ray absorptiometer as described above. At the end of the program, the tibia sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or TRAP as mentioned above. Detection of DcR3 Protein by Western Blot—To detect the tissue distribution of DcR3 protein in transgenic mice, tissues were harvested and lysed in cell lysis buffer (27Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Huang T.H. Liu S.H. Fu W.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 440-449PubMed Google Scholar). Total lysate at 30 μg were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis, using the anti-DcR3 monoclonal antibody (clone 3H5) (26Hsu T.L. Wu Y.Y. Lai M.Z. Su W.B. Hsieh S.L. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Real-time RT-PCR with SYBR Green Detection—RNA from 2-month-old calvaria was extracted with TRIzol (MDBio Inc, Taipei, Taiwan) following the manufacturer's instructions. 5 μg of RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript III first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR amplification was performed on a 7900 instrument (Applied Biosystems). Real-time RT-PCR fluorescence detection was performed in 96-well plates using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR primers are as follows: alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 5′-GTTGCCAAGCTGGGAAGAACAC-3′ and 5′-CCCACCCCGCTATTCCAAAC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-ATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATG-3′. Osteoclast Generation—Bone marrow cells were prepared by removing marrow from the femurs and tibiae of adult mice and flushing the bone marrow cavity with α-MEM, which was supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The non-adherent cells (hematopoietic cells) were collected after 24 h and used as osteoclast precursors. Cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in 24-well plates in the presence of human recombinant soluble RANKL (50 ng/ml) and M-CSF (20 ng/ml). The culture medium was replaced every 3 days. Osteoclast formation was measured by TRAP staining on days 2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively. In brief, adherent cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min and then stained with Naphthol AS-MX phosphate and tartrate solution for 1 h at 37°C. Osteoclast-like cells in each well were scored by counting the number of TRAP-positive and multinucleated cells containing more than three nuclei. Assay of Resorbing Activity of Osteoclast—Osteoclast precursors were isolated from mice long bones as mentioned above. The cells were resuspended in complete α-MEM medium and plated into a calcium phosphate apatite-coated OAAS plate at 1 × 106 cells/0.5 ml/well. The cells were cultured in the presence of M-CSF (20 ng/ml) plus RANKL (50 ng/ml). After 8 days of culture, the remaining cells in the plate were lysed using 1 n NaOH. Five images per well were obtained using inverted microscope (×200), and the resorbed area was measured using an image analyzer. Isolation of Mature Osteoclasts—Mature osteoclasts were isolated as described previously (29David J.P. Neff L. Chen Y. Rincon M. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 1730-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Long bones were isolated from 6-day-old rabbits (body weight, 70–90 g). After removal of muscle and cartilage, the bones were minced in α-MEM. Cells were dissociated from bone fragments by gentle vortexing, and then bone fragments were allowed to settle under normal gravity. The supernatant was removed and saved, and the mincing and sedimentation were repeated three more times. The supernatants were pooled and centrifuged for 5 min at 60 × g. The cells were plated in an OAAS plate, and after overnight incubation, the adherent cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with trypsin/EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C to remove contaminating cells. Additionally, treatment with 0.1% collagenase for 5 min at room temperature was performed to remove completely most of the stromal cells. The highly enriched osteoclasts (>90%) were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. The resorption activity of mature osteoclasts was then assayed after 2 days of culture as mentioned above. Primary Osteoblast Cultures—Primary osteoblastic cells were prepared by the method as described previously (30Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Liou H.C. Fu W.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The calvaria were dissected from fetal rats or mice, divided into small pieces, and then treated with 0.1% type I collagenase solution for 10 min at 37°C. The next two 20-min sequential collagenase digestions were then pooled and filtered through 70-μm nylon filters (Falcon, BD Biosciences). The cells were grown on the plastic cell culture dishes in 95% air, 5% CO2 with α-MEM, which was supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (pH adjusted to 7.6). The characteristics of osteoblasts were confirmed by morphology and the expression of ALP. Assay of Cell Proliferation—Osteoblasts (2 × 104 cells/well) were seeded on 24-well plates. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h before the addition of DcR3. After incubation with DcR3 for 24 h, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was assayed according to the protocol of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay chemiluminescence detection kit (Roche Applied Science) using a luminescence counter (TopCount; Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT). The counts per second correlate directly to the amount of DNA synthesis and the number of proliferating cells. Measurement of Alkaline Phosphatase Activity—Osteoblasts cultured in 24-well plates in the presence or absence of DcR3 were harvested in 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and the cell suspension was disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min, ALP activity in the supernatant was measured as described by Yang et al. (31Yang R.S. Chen Y.Z. Huang T.H. Tang C.H. Fu W.M. Lu B.Y. Lin W.L. Ultrasound Med. Biol. 2005; 31: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Measurement of Mineralized Matrix—The level of mineralized matrix was evaluated by the method described previously (31Yang R.S. Chen Y.Z. Huang T.H. Tang C.H. Fu W.M. Lu B.Y. Lin W.L. Ultrasound Med. Biol. 2005; 31: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 33Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Huang T.H. Lu D.Y. Chuang W.J. Huang T.F. Fu M.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 2047-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts were cultured in α-MEM containing vitamin C (50 μg/ml) and β-glycerophosphate (10 mm) for 2 weeks, and the medium was changed every 3 days. After incubation with DcR3 for 12 days, cells were washed twice with 20 mm Tris-buffered saline containing 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4) and fixed in ice-cold 75% ethanol (v/v) for 30 min and then air-dried. Calcium deposition was determined using alizarin red-S staining. Briefly, the ethanol-fixed cells and matrix were stained for 1 h with 40 mm alizarin red-S (pH 4.2) and extensively rinsed with water. Images of the mineralized matrixes were photographed using an Olympus microscope IX70. After photography, the bound staining was eluted with 10% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride, and alizarin red-S in samples was quantified by measuring absorbance at 550 nm and calculated according to a standard curve. 1 mol of alizarin red-S selectively binds about 2 mol of calcium. All protocols complied with institutional guidelines and were approved by Animal Care Committee of Medical College, National Taiwan University. Statistics—The values given are means ± S.E. The significance of difference between the experimental group and control was assessed by the Student's t test. The difference is significant if the p value is < 0.05. Attenuation of Bone Mass in DcR3 Transgenic Mice—To understand the function of DcR3 in bone remodeling in vivo, transgenic mice overexpressing DcR3 systemically were generated. The adult mice were used, and the age, sex, and body weight of transgenic mice were matched to the controls. BMD and BMC of total body, as assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, were significantly lower (11.9 and 17.1%, respectively) in DcR3 transgenic mice as compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 1, A and B). There is no difference in overall length and thickness of the bones (data not shown). Western blot analysis was performed on several tissues from 2-monthold wild-type controls and DcR3 transgenic mice with DcR3 antibody. DcR3 expression was found in blood, femur, brain, liver, spleen, lung, and heart in transgenic mice (Fig. 1C). The protein expression of DcR3 is higher in blood samples, femur, and spleen tissues. There is no DcR3 expression in these tissues of wild-type mice. The osteoclastic activity was evaluated by measuring the C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen in blood, and it shows that osteoclast activity increases in DcR3 transgenic mice (Fig. 1D). To evaluate the effect of DcR3 transgene expression on the markers of osteoblastic function, RNA levels of bone markers ALP were quantitated by real-time RT-PCR in calvaria bone. DcR3 transgene expression slightly increased ALP mRNA expression (Fig. 1E). Bone histomorphometric analysis in tibia showed that DcR3 transgenic mice had a 35.7% decrease in trabecular bone volume as compared with wild-type mice and a decrease of about 23.5 and 14.2% in the thickness of cortical and trabecular bone, respectively (Fig. 2 and Table 1). In addition, we also counted the number of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in the region of primary spongiosa. It was found that the number of osteoclasts significantly increased and that of the osteoblasts did not show significant change in DcR3 transgenic mice as compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 2 and Table 1).FIGURE 2Decrease of trabecular bone and increase of osteoclast formation in DcR3 transgenic mice.

Open table in a new tab Osteoclastogenesis Derived from Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Increases in DcR3 Transgenic Mice—Osteoclasts are specialized monocyte/macrophage family members and differentiate from bone marrow hematopoietic precursors. Formation of large TRAP-positive multinuclei osteoclasts in bone marrow-derived stromal cell cultures in the presence of M-CSF (20 ng/ml) and RANKL (50 ng/ml) increased in DcR3 transgenic mice as compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 3, A and C). The DcR3 protein level was up-regulated in the supernatant of cultured stromal cells obtained from DcR3 transgenic mice (wild-type, not detectable; DcR3 transgenic mice, 3.64 ± 0.49 ng/ml, n = 4). When the stromal cells were seeded in OAAS plates for 8 days in the presence of M-CSF plus RANKL, the resorption pits occurred. It was found that the resorption area increased in osteoclast cultures derived from DcR3 transgenic mice as compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3, B and D). Local Administration of DcR3 Decreased Bone Volume of Tibia in Young Rats—To simply look at the effect of exogenous application of DcR3 on trabecular bone, local injection of DcR3 into tibia in young rats was used (27Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Huang T.H. Liu S.H. Fu W.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 440-449PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Fu W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22907-22916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The tibia of mice are too small to be implanted with needle, so the tibia of rats were thus used in this experiment. Trabecular bone is composed of a lattice or network of branching bone spicules. The spaces between the bone spicules contain bone marrow. DcR3 (30 μg/ml, 10 μl, once/day) was locally administered into tibia for 7 consecutive days via an implantation of a needle cannula (22 gauge) in young rats weighing 75–90 g, and the rats were sacrificed later on day 14. The vehicle was injected into the contralateral side for comparison. As compared with the vehicle-injected side (Fig. 4A; the arrow shows the hole of injection site), DcR3 significantly decreased the bone volume of the secondary spongiosa (Fig. 4A). Trabecular bone in the secondary spongiosa decreased by 31.5% after local administration of DcR3. In addition, BMD and BMC also decreased after application of DcR3 (Table 2). The TRAP staining in secondary spongiosa also showed that osteoclasts were predominantly localized around the trabecular bone, and long term administration of DcR3 increased the formation of osteoclasts (Fig. 4B and Table 2). It has been previously reported that DcR3 induced formation of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, probably via the release of TNF-α (25Yang C.R. Wang J.H. Hsieh S.L. Wang S.M. Hsu T.L. Lin W.W. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: S97-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here, we show that coadministration of soluble TNFRSF1A (10 ng/ml) but not OPG (100 ng/ml) antagonized the decrease of BMD, BMC, and bone volume and the increase of the osteoclast number by DcR3 (Table 2), suggesting that TNF-α may be the downstream molecules involved in the bone action of DcR3.TABLE 2Effect of local administration of DcR3 on the bone turnoverControlDcR3DcR3 + TNFRSF1ADcR3 + OPGTNFRSF1AOPGN.Oc/BS (mm)1.81 ± 0.042.05 ± 0.06ap < 0.05 as compared with control groups.1.86 ± 0.03bp < 0.05 as compared with DcR3-treated groups.1.93 ± 0.031.76 ± 0.041.75 ± 0.04BMD (g/cm2)0.090 ± 0.0020.073 ± 0.003ap < 0.05 as"

Our study shows that in primitive ectoderm cells, the sphingolipid ceramide was elevated and co-distributed with the small GTPase Cdc42 and cortical F-actin at the apicolateral cell membrane. Pharmacological or RNA interference-mediated inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis enhanced apoptosis and impaired primitive ectoderm formation in embryoid bodies differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells. Primitive ectoderm formation was restored by incubation with ceramide or a ceramide analog. Ceramide depletion prevented plasma membrane translocation of PKCζ/λ, its interaction with Cdc42, and phosphorylation of GSK-3β, a substrate of PKCζ/λ. Recombinant PKCζ formed a complex with the polarity protein Par6 and Cdc42 when bound to ceramide containing lipid vesicles. Our data suggest a novel mechanism by which a ceramide-induced, apicolateral polarity complex with PKCζ/λ regulates primitive ectoderm cell polarity and morphogenesis.

Chem. 2005; 280: 26415-26424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This regulation is initiated by direct physical interaction of ceramide with atypical PKCζ or λ (5Wang G. Silva J. Krishnamurthy K. Tran E. Condie B.G. Bieberich E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26415-26424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Homozygous knock-out of PKCλ in mice results in lethality at embryonic day 9 because of severe defects of post-gastrulation morphology (6Soloff R.S. Katayama C. Lin M.Y. Feramisco J.R. Hedrick S.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3250-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This suggests that atypical PKCs are critical for aspects of early embryonic development, although the degree of functional overlap as well as specific effects and regulation of the two isoforms are not known yet. Our results obtained with ES cells suggest that ceramide-dependent regulation of atypical PKCs contributes to the function of PKCζ/λ during embryonic development. In the pregastrulation embryo, inner cell mass-derived cells give rise to two adjacent epithelia of polarized cells, the primitive endoderm and the underlying primitive ectoderm. The formation of the primitive ectoderm is followed by the removal of cells that are not in contact with the primitive endoderm derived basal lamina. These cells die by apoptosis giving rise to the proamniotic cavity, a process termed cavitation (7Rodda S.J. Kavanagh S.J. Rathjen J. Rathjen P.D. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 449-458PubMed Google Scholar). This developmental process is recapitulated in embryoid bodies (EBs) generated from in vitro differentiating ES cells. ES cell-derived EBs have been used to determine key regulatory factors of primitive germ layer formation and cavitation, and are a bona fide, in vitro model for early embryo morphogenesis (8Desbaillets I. Ziegler U. Groscurth P. Gassmann M. Exp. Physiol. 2000; 85: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 9Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R.

A key experiment to determine the significance of ceramide for cavitation and primitive ectoderm morphogenesis is depleting EBs of ceramide by disruption of ceramide biosynthesis. Ceramide biosynthesis is initiated and regulated by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), an enzyme consisting of the two subunits SPT-1 and SPT-2. Homozygous knock-out of SPT-1 or SPT-2 results in embryonic lethality at a stage of development well before E15 indicating the absolute requirement of ceramide biosynthesis for embryo development (11Hojjati M.R. Li Z. Jiang X.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1737: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In our study, ceramide biosynthesis was reduced in ES cells and EBs by transfection of SPT-1 and -2-specific RNAi or by incubation with the SPT inhibitor myriocin (or ISP-1) (12Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 13Hanada K. Nishijima M. Fujita T. Kobayashi S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1211-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the effect of SPT inhibition or depletion was due to the elimination of ceramide biosynthesis precursors rather than ceramide itself, we used a second inhibitor, fumonisin B1 (FB1). FB1 inhibits (dihydro)ceramide synthases, a group of enzymes catalyzing the penultimate step in ceramide biosynthesis. Their inhibition has been linked to neural tube defects in humans and animals caused by the disruption of sphingolipid biosynthesis, indicating the significance of ceramide or its derivatives for developmental processes prior to or during neurulation (14Gelineau-van Waes J.

Voss K.A. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Ceramide depletion elevated apoptosis and prevented primitive ectoderm morphogenesis in cultured EBs. Our results suggest that this was because of down-regulation of PKCζ/λ-mediated phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). This study shows, for the first time, that ceramide is asymmetrically distributed to the apicolateral membrane of primitive ectoderm cells. Further, our results suggest that this distribution initiates the ceramide-induced formation of an apical polarity complex of PKCζ/λ with Cdc42 and, subsequently, inactivation of GSK-3β and formation of cortical filamentous actin (F-actin). Hence, ceramide may act as a pacemaker linking the regulation of apoptosis of inner cell mass-derived cells to primitive ectoderm polarity and morphogenesis.

Ottenbrite R.M. Cancer Lett. 2002; 181: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All reagents were of analytical grade or higher. ES Cell Differentiation Protocol and Quantification of Proper Cavitation—The in vitro differentiation of mouse ES cells (ES-J1, ES-RW4) followed a previously published protocol (3Bieberich E. MacKinnon S. Silva J. Noggle S. Condie B.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Westmoreland J.J. Hancock C.R. Condie B.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Five μm myriocin was added to the EBs 8-10 h after trypsinization and resuspension of feeder-free ES cells and incubated for 4 days. Sixty μm S18 (a novel ceramide analog) was added to the myriocin-incubated EBs for the last 24 h starting at day 3 of the incubation period. For quantitation of primitive ectoderm formation, EBs were observed (blinded test) under the microscope, and those with a well defined layer of primitive ectoderm (as shown in Fig. 1A, 96 h) were scored as positive. In four independent experiments, EBs were counted from eight different fields, and results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was performed on the data; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Lipid Analysis—Total lipids were extracted from EBs as described previously (3Bieberich E. MacKinnon S. Silva J. Noggle S. Condie B.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The organic solvent was dried under a steady stream of nitrogen and the lipid fractions were purified using a silicic acid column following published procedures (18Dasgupta S. Hogan E.L. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the lipid extracts were applied to a silicic acid column (0.4 × 14 cm), and nonbinding lipids were washed out with 15-20 volumes of CHCl3. The ceramide fraction was then eluted with CHCl3:acetone 9:1 (v/v, 15 ml) and dried. The residue was taken up in solvent, and one-half of the solution was subjected to alkaline methanolysis for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was neutralized by the addition of 2 n CH3COOH, and the ceramide fraction was recovered by Folch partition. The lower phase was evaporated to dryness and the lipids resolved by HPTLC using running solvents CHCl3: CH3OH:CH3COOH (95:4.5:0.5; v/v) for ceramide and CHCl3: CH3OH:H2O (20:15:2.5; v/v) for sphingomyelin. Individual bands were visualized by staining with 3% cupric acetate in 8% phosphoric acid and comparing them to the migration distance of standard lipids. In Vitro Lipid-Protein Polarity Complex—The in vitro reconstitution of a lipid-protein polarity complex was performed following the LIMAC (lipid vesicle-mediated affinity chromatography) procedure as published previously (5Wang G. Silva J. Krishnamurthy K. Tran E. Condie B.G. Bieberich E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26415-26424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In brief, phosphatidylserine (PS, 420 μg) and C16-ceramide (107 μg) were dried from organic solvent and resuspended under sonication in 500 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Five μl of 10 mm MnCl2, 1 μl of Vybrant CM-diI, and 500 ng of PKCζ (human, recombinant) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated under gentle agitation for 60 min at 4 °C. Vybrant CM-diI stained PS/Cer vesicles were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet (pink) was resuspended in 100 μl of Tris buffer supplemented with GTPγS (100 μm), GDP (1 mm), GST-Par6 (100 ng), or GST-Cdc42 (500 ng) and further incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Annexin V-buffer (5 μl of a 20× stock solution) and annexin V-conjugated magnetic beads (50 μl) were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated under gentle agitation for another 30 min at 4 °C. Annexin V-MACS was performed following the supplier's protocol as described previously (2Bieberich E. Silva J. Wang G. Krishnamurthy K. Condie B.G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The elution fraction (1 ml) was supplemented with 10 μg of pure ovalbumin as the precipitation aid. The protein was concentrated by Wessel-Flugge precipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting as described previously (5Wang G. Silva J. Krishnamurthy K. Tran E. Condie B.G. Bieberich E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26415-26424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The amount of eluted lipid vesicles was quantified by the detection of Vybrant CM-diI (pink) in the organic (chloroform/methanol) phase of the Wessel-Flugge precipitation reaction. The amount of protein was normalized on equal amounts of lipid vesicles. Immunocyto-/Immunohistochemistry, FRET Analysis, and Quantification of F-actin Formation—EBs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Immunocytochemistry for ceramide was performed with cryosectioned EBs using the MAS0020 anti-ceramide antibody at a dilution of 1:30-1:50. All figures show antibody staining without the use of detergent for permeabilization to avoid loss or artifactual distribution of ceramide. The accuracy of the intracellular antigen distribution was confirmed in a second set of experiments using the same antibody combination after mild permeablization (0.1-0.2% Triton X-100, 5 min at room temperature) of fixed cells (data not shown). This procedure only slightly reduced the concentration of ceramide (supplemental Fig. S1C). The immunostaining of fixed EBs followed procedures described previously using a blocking solution of 3% ovalbumin, 2% donkey serum in PBS and concentrations of 5 μg/ml primary antibodies or 10 μg/ml secondary antibodies in 0.1% ovalbumin in PBS (5Wang G. Silva J. Krishnamurthy K. Tran E. Condie B.G. Bieberich E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26415-26424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-IgM, μ-chain-specific secondary antibody was followed by diaminobenzidine staining according to a protocol provided by the supplier (Vector Laboratories). Epifluorescence microscopy was performed with an Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) equipped with a Spot II charge-coupled device camera. Confocal fluorescence microscopy and Cy3-to-Cy5 FRET analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with a two-photon argon laser at 488 nm (Cy2), 543 nm (Cy3, Alexa Fluor® 546), or 633 nm (Cy5, Alexa Fluor® 647), respectively. Acceptor (Cy5) bleaching was achieved by repetitive scanning at 633 nm until the Cy5 signal was minimized. For quantification of apical F-actin staining, control and myriocin-incubated EBs were fixed and stained with Alexa Fluor® 647-labeled phalloidin. The number of EBs showing apical F-actin staining was counted from micrographs in three independent experiments. More than 50 EBs/group were counted, and the results are expressed as the mean percentage of EBs showing apical F-actin staining ± S.D. Primitive ectoderm formation was quantified in a blinded experiment. Blinding was achieved by coding micrographs and presenting them in random order (controls and treated samples) to three individuals for the analysis of primitive ectoderm morphology and cavitation. Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was prepared from control and myriocin-treated EBs using TRIzol® (Life Systems) following the manufacturer's protocol. Firststrand cDNA was synthesized using an Omniscript® RT kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The amount of template from each sample was adjusted until PCR yielded equal intensities of amplification for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. All real-time PCR reactions were performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix and an iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Primers used for real-time PCR were: FGF-5 sense, 5′-gtccgcgatccacagaac-3′; FGF-5 antisense, 5′-ctggaacagtgacggtgaag-3′. Real-time PCR reactions were normalized to the generation of equal amounts of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplification product. Antisense RNAi Transfection of ES Cells and Suppression of SPT-1 and SPT-2 in EBs—ES-J1 cells were cultured without feeder fibroblasts and transfected with either Stealth™ RNAi against SPT1 (SPTLC1, MSS218753, RNAi sequence 5′-aaaugugccauagaacccucgagga-3′) and SPT2 (SPTLC2, MSS209442, RNAi sequence 5′-uaugugagcacagcaaccagcaugg-3′) at a concentration of 100 nm each or Stealth™ RNAi negative control (Invitrogen catalog no. 12935-300, 200 nm) using the Lipofectamine 2000 procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Stealth™ RNAi was co-transfected with a fluorescein-conjugated double-stranded RNA oligomer (Invitrogen catalog no. 2013, 40 nm) to identify the transfected cells. The efficacy and specificity of the RNAi were confirmed by the transfection of 3T3 fibroblasts, resulting in the reduced expression of SPT1 or SPT2 consistent with the portion of transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S2B). Twelve hours post-transfection, EBs were prepared from the transfected ES cells, and apoptosis and primitive ectoderm morphogenesis were analyzed. Subcellular Fractionation, Membrane Translocation, and Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Cells were rinsed twice in icecold PBS, resuspended in HEPES-sucrose buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 2 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm each of EDTA, EGTA, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (with protease and phosphatase inhibitors added before use), and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer. Subcellular fractionation was performed by sequential centrifugation as follows: 1) 100 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells (pellet); 2) 900 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei (pellet); 3) 17,000 × g for 15 min to remove mitochondria and lysosomes (pellet); and 4) 110,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the cytosolic fraction (supernatant) and a membranous fraction (pellet) containing fragments of the cell membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi. All centrifugation steps were carried out at 4 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (2Bieberich E. Silva J. Wang G. Krishnamurthy K. Condie B.G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry of Apoptotic Cells—For flow cytometry, apoptosis was assayed using Vybrant apoptosis assay kit 2 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, EBs were trypsinized and passed through a 40-μm mesh screen. Cells were taken up in 100 μl of annexin V binding buffer and stained with Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) for 15 min at room temperature. Stained cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry measuring the fluorescence emission at 530 nm (FL1, annexin V) and >575 nm (FL2, PI). Miscellaneous—Protein concentrations were determined using the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad), which is a modification of the Lowry method, according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE was performed using the Laemmli method followed by immunoblotting. Ceramide Depletion Disrupts Primitive Ectoderm Morphogenesis— Feeder-free mouse ES cells (ES-J1, ES-RW4) were differentiated in suspension EB culture. Fig. 1A shows that the EBs underwent primitive endoderm formation, cavitation, and primitive ectoderm morphogenesis within 96 h. The effect of ceramide depletion on the composition of sphingolipids and ES cell lineage specification was determined using the SPT inhibitor myriocin (12Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 13Hanada K. Nishijima M. Fujita T. Kobayashi S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1211-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Suspension-cultured EBs were incubated with myriocin starting 10 h after reaggregation of trypsin-dissociated ES cells into EBs. Isolation of ceramide by silicic acid gel chromatography followed by HPTLC analysis (Fig. 1B) showed that myriocin incubation reduced ceramide (Cer, lane 3; control in lane 2) and sphingomyelin (SM, lane 9; control in lane 8) by more than 80%. Reduction of ceramide and sphingomyelin was also found when EBs were incubated with the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 (lanes 6 and 10), which confirmed that EBs were depleted of ceramide and sphingomyelin by inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis. After 72 h of cultivation, ceramidedepleted EBs were incubated for 24 h with 60 μm S18, a novel ceramide analog. which was not converted to ceramide or other sphingolipids (2Bieberich E. Silva J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 177-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Novel ceramide analogs have been synthesized in our laboratory and found to mimic many effects of ceramide such as induction of apoptosis in PAR-4-expressing differentiating ES cells, and binding and activation of PKCζ/λ in vitro and in stem cells. Fig. 1B shows that S18 was enriched to a final concentration equivalent to that of endogenous ceramide in control cells (Myr+S18, lane 13; control in lane 11). There was no significant alteration of the level of residual endogenous ceramide after S18 treatment, indicating that the novel ceramide analogs did not interfere with ceramide metabolism. Using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR we found that the gene expression of the primitive ectoderm marker FGF-5 was not significantly affected by incubation with myriocin (data not shown). This result suggested that the lineage specification of primitive ectoderm cells was not impaired by the inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis. However, 80% of the myriocin-treated EBs did not cavitate and failed to form a distinct layer of columnar primitive ectoderm cells (Fig. 1, C and D). This indicated that ceramide depletion increased the number of EBs with defective primitive ectoderm morphogenesis and cavity formation by 4-fold. After 72 h of cultivation, myriocin-treated EBs were incubated for 24 h with 60 μm S18 or 2 μm C16-ceramide. Replenishment of ceramide or substitution with S18 resulted in partial restoration of the proportion of EBs with well organized primitive ectoderm and defined cavity (Fig. 1, D and E, and supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). These results showed that inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis impaired primitive ectoderm morphogenesis, which was compensated by exogenously added ceramide or a ceramide analog. Our previous studies provided evidence that ceramide-mediated activation of aPKC promoted aPKC-dependent phosphorylation inactivation of GSK-3β (5Wang G. Silva J. Krishnamurthy K. Tran E. Condie B.G. Bieberich E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26415-26424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Consistently, formation of the primitive ectoderm layer was partially restored when myriocin-treated cells were incubated with a GSK-3β inhibitor, indirubin-3′-monoxime (Fig. 1, C and D, Myr+Ind). This result was also consistent with the observation that blocking aPKC with a specific inhibitor peptide completely abolished cavitation of EBs (Fig. 1D, PZI). Taken together, these results suggest that ceramide may have regulated primitive ectoderm formation by induction of aPKC-mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3β. Ceramide Depletion Induces Apoptosis—The pro-aminiotic cavity of the pregastrulation embryo and the central cavity of EBs result from apoptosis of cells that do not participate in the formation of the primitive ectoderm layer. Apoptosis during EB formation was quantified by flow cytometry using cells from dissociated EBs that were stained with Alexa 488-conjugated annexin V. Annexin V is a protein that binds specifically to PS exposed to the cell surface of apoptotic cells. Fig. 2A shows that the number of apoptotic cells was increased by 50% after EBs were treated with myriocin. The number of cells stained with PI and annexin V was also elevated after treatment with myriocin, indicating that a portion of cells underwent necrosis or were in a late stage of apoptosis. The increase of cell death was correlated with the reduction of primitive ectoderm morphogenesis (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that ceramide depletion elevated apoptosis within the EBs concurrent with disrupted primitive ectoderm formation. Myriocin-induced cell death was reduced when ceramide-depleted EBs were incubated with S18, consistent with the restorative effect of S18 on primitive ectoderm morphogenesis in ceramide-depleted EBs (Fig. 1, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). The morphological appearance of a densely Hoechst-stained cell mass in ceramide-depleted EBs indicated that the apoptotic cells persisted within the EBs (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1D). Fig. 2B shows that apoptotic cells were localized primarily underneath the emergent primitive ectoderm or within the center of the EBs (arrows pointing at cells with condensed nuclei). These cells also stained for TUNEL and active caspase-3, two assays indicating apoptosis in differentiating stem cells or embryos (supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). To determine the effect of the inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis in individual cells, we transfected feeder-free ES cells with RNAi, which suppressed the expression of SPT1 and SPT2 (supplemental Fig. S2B). The cells were co-transfected with a fluorescence-conjugated control oligonucleotide to identify the RNAi-transfected cells using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The control RNAi (scrambled) was detected in cells of both t"

https://openalex.org/W2071791431,"The low-fidelity DNA polymerases thought to be specialized in DNA damage processing are frequently misregulated in cancers. We show here that DNA polymerase kappa (polκ), prone to replicate across oxidative and aromatic adducts and known to function in nucleotide excision repair (NER), is downregulated in colorectal tumour biopsies. Contrary to the replicative polδ and polα, for which only activating domains were described, we identified an upstream 465-bp-long repressor region in the promoter of POLK. We also found an activating 237-bp region that includes stimulating protein-1 (SP1) and cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding sites. Mutations at one CRE-binding site led to a dramatic 80% decrease in promoter activity. Alterations of the SP1-binding site also affected, to a lesser extent, the transcription. Gel shift assays confirmed the role played by CRE/SP1 recognition sequences. Moreover, ectopic expression of SP1 or CRE-binding protein (CREB) protein favoured polκ transcription. Finally, we found that polκ downexpression in colorectal biopsies correlated with a decreased level of CREB and SP1 transcripts. This work shows that the promoter of POLK is cis-controlled and suggests that silencing of CREB and SP1 proteins could contribute to downregulation of this repair polymerase in colorectal tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2040099100,"Cystatin M is a potent endogenous inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases. In breast carcinoma, cystatin M expression is frequently downregulated. It has been shown that cystatin M expression suppressed growth and migration of breast cancer cells. We examined the methylation status of the CpG island promoter of cystatin M in four breast cancer cell lines (MDAMB231, ZR75-1, MCF7 and T47D), in 40 primary breast carcinoma and in corresponding normal tissue probes by combined bisulphite restriction analysis. To investigate the effects of cystatin M expression on the growth of breast carcinoma, cystatin M was transfected in T47D. The cystatin M promoter was highly methylated in all four-breast cancer cell lines. Primary breast tumours were significantly more frequently methylated compared to normal tissue samples (60 vs 25%; P=0.006 Fisher's exact test). Treatment of breast cancer cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), reactivated the transcription of cystatin M. Transfection of breast carcinoma cells with cystatin M caused a 30% decrease in colony formation compared to control transfection (P=0.002). Our results show that cystatin M is frequently epigenetically inactivated during breast carcinogenesis and cystatin M expression suppresses the growth of breast carcinoma. These data suggest that cystatin M may encode a novel epigenetically inactivated candidate tumour suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2039333617,"The scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) is highly expressed in hepatocytes, where it mediates the uptake of lipoprotein cholesterol, promotes the secretion of cholesterol into bile, and protects against atherosclerosis. Despite a strong correlation between the hepatic expression of SR-BI and biliary cholesterol secretion, little is known about SR-BI trafficking in response to changes in sterol availability. Using a well characterized polarized hepatocyte cell model, WIF-B, we determine that in cholesterol-depleted cells, SR-BI is extensively located on the basolateral surface, where it can access circulating lipoproteins. However, in response to cholesterol loading, SR-BI undergoes a slow transcytosis to the apical bile canaliculus independently of lipoprotein binding and new protein synthesis. In cholesterol-replete WIF-B cells, SR-BI that resides on the canalicular membrane is dynamically associated with defined microdomains and does not rapidly recycle to and from the subapical or basolateral regions. Taken together, these data demonstrate that hepatic SR-BI transcytosis is regulated by cholesterol and suggest that SR-BI has a stationary function on the bile canaliculus."
https://openalex.org/W2052350834,"Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is a natural allotetraploid derived from the interspecific hybridization between ancestral Nicotiana sylvestris and Nicotiana tomentosiformis. The majority of cultivated tobacco differs from both of its progenitor species in that tobacco typically contains nicotine as the primary alkaloid, in contrast to its two progenitors that accumulate nornicotine in the senescing leaves. However, most, if not all, tobacco cultivars possess an unstable mutation, commonly referred to as the conversion locus, that when activated mediates the conversion of a large percentage of nicotine to nornicotine in the senescing leaf. We have recently identified CYP82E4, a tobacco nicotine N-demethylase gene whose expression was highly induced during senescence in plants that have converted, and CYP82E3, a closely related homolog that exhibited no nicotine N-demethylase activity. In this study, domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis studies identified a single amino acid change that fully restored nicotine N-demethylase activity to CYP82E3. An examination of the N. tomentosiformis orthologs of CYP82E3 and CYP82E4 revealed that both are functional nicotine N-demethylase genes in N. tomentosiformis.

Pyridine alkaloids, such as nicotine, nornicotine, anabasine, and anatabine, have been detected in numerous species of the Nicotiana genus (1Sisson V.A. Severson R.F. Beitr. Tabakforsch. 1990; 14: 327-339Google Scholar) where they are thought to function as herbivore deterrents (2Metcalf R.L. Metcalf R.A. Destructive and Useful Insects.5th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). The production of pyridine alkaloids is elicited by herbivore attacks (3Baldwin I.T. Ohnmeiss T.E. J. Chem. Ecol. 1993; 19: 1143-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 4Baldwin I.T. Oecologia. 1988; 75: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) through a jasmonic acid-induced signaling pathway (5Halitschke R. Baldwin I.T.

Several studies have demonstrated that the alkaloid composition within the Nicotiana genus is species-specific and highly variable, and in the majority of the species a single alkaloid predominates (1Sisson V.A. Severson R.F. Beitr. Tabakforsch. 1990; 14: 327-339Google Scholar, 7Saitoh F. Noma M. Kawashima N. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 477-480Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For example, Nicotiana tomentosiformis primarily accumulates nornicotine, whereas in Nicotiana glauca anabasine is the major alkaloid (1Sisson V.A. Severson R.F. Beitr. Tabakforsch. 1990; 14: 327-339Google Scholar). Interestingly, the alkaloid profiles of some Nicotiana are different in green versus senescing (yellow) leaves. For instance, in the green leaves of Nicotiana sylvestris nicotine is the primary alkaloid, but a substantial portion of nicotine is converted into nornicotine once the leaves senesce through air-curing (1Sisson V.A. Severson R.F. Beitr. Tabakforsch. 1990; 14: 327-339Google Scholar). In cultivated tobacco alkaloid composition can vary because of the presence of an unstable locus, termed the “converter locus” (8Mann T.J. Weybrew J.A. Matzinger D.F. Hall J.L. Crop Sci. 1964; 4: 349-353Crossref Google Scholar). In commercial tobacco leaves that harbor an inactive converter locus, the alkaloid pool typically contains about 95% nicotine and 3% nornicotine (7Saitoh F. Noma M. Kawashima N. Phytochemistry. 1985; 24: 477-480Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These plants are frequently referred to as “nonconverters.” In some of the individuals, however, the converter locus becomes activated, and a large portion of nicotine is metabolized to nornicotine (9Burk L.G. Jeffrey R.N. Tob. Sci. 1958; 2: 139-141Google Scholar) giving rise to plants termed “converters.” Similar to N. sylvestris, nicotine to nornicotine metabolism in converter tobacco is induced during leaf senescence (10Wernsman E.A. Matzinger D.F. Tob. Sci. 1968; 12: 226-228Google Scholar). The accumulation of nornicotine in converter plants is undesirable, because nornicotine is a biochemical precursor of N′-nitrosonornicotine, a tobacco-specific nitrosamine that has been shown to exhibit carcinogenic properties in laboratory animals (11Hecht S.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 559-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar, 12Hecht S.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 13Hecht S.S. Hoffmann D. Cancer Surv. 1989; 8: 273-294PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, nornicotine has been recently recognized as an elicitor of protein glycation (14Dickerson T.J. Janda K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15084-15088Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and other biochemical processes that are detrimental to human health (15Katz J. Caudle R.M. Bhattacharyya I. Stewart C.M.

Intrieri M.C. Buiatti M. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 1997; 7: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), species that convert nicotine to nornicotine in senescing and green leaves, respectively (1Sisson V.A. Severson R.F. Beitr. Tabakforsch. 1990; 14: 327-339Google Scholar). As a result, the emergence of the nicotine-accumulating (nonconverter) phenotype of N. tabacum from its two progenitors would have required the inactivation of nornicotine-accumulating traits originating from both ancestral parents. Mann et al. (8Mann T.J. Weybrew J.A. Matzinger D.F. Hall J.L. Crop Sci. 1964; 4: 349-353Crossref Google Scholar) suggested that the nicotine-accumulating phenotype of nonconverter tobacco was developed by the successive inactivation of the two dominant conversion loci donated by the nornicotine-containing parental species, but to date such loci have not been identified. Another interesting question relates to the origin of the unstable conversion locus present in converter tobacco. In theory, either of the two progenitor species could have donated the conversion locus to tobacco, because nicotine to nornicotine conversion occurs in both N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis at one developmental stage. Classical genetic studies conducted by Mann et al. (8Mann T.J. Weybrew J.A. Matzinger D.F. Hall J.L. Crop Sci. 1964; 4: 349-353Crossref Google Scholar) demonstrated that the unstable conversion locus found in converter tobacco is allelic to the green leaf conversion locus of N. tomentosiformis and inherited as a dominant gene (8Mann T.J. Weybrew J.A. Matzinger D.F. Hall J.L. Crop Sci. 1964; 4: 349-353Crossref Google Scholar, 9Burk L.G. Jeffrey R.N. Tob. Sci. 1958; 2: 139-141Google Scholar, 23Griffith R.B. Valleau W.D. Stokes G.W. Science. 1955; 121: 343-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The observation that the unstable conversion locus was originated from green-leaf converter N. tomentosiformis was surprising, because the reversion of the conversion locus to the ancestral type in tobacco confers senescing leaf conversion phenotype characteristic to N. sylvestris. The apparent inconsistency between the time of nornicotine production and the origin of the unstable conversion locus in tobacco suggested that evolution of the alkaloid profile of modern tobacco involved complex genetic changes. We have previously isolated a closely related gene family, designated the CYP82E2 gene subfamily, whose collective transcript accumulation was up-regulated in converter versus nonconverter tobacco (24Siminszky B. Gavilano L. Bowen S.W. Dewey R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14919-14924Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Of these cDNAs, CYP82E4 was shown to mediate the metabolic conversion of nicotine to nornicotine when overexpressed in tobacco and yeast (24Siminszky B. Gavilano L. Bowen S.W. Dewey R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14919-14924Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Expression analysis of CYP82E4 revealed a >80-fold increase of transcript accumulation in the cured leaves of converter versus nonconverter plants demonstrating that CYP82E4 plays a central role in mediating nicotine N-demethylation in senescing leaves of tobacco (25Gavilano L.B.

To distinguish between orthologous P450 genes from tobacco and N. tomentosiformis, an Ntab or Ntom prefix is attached, respectively, to the name of the genes in the remaining part of the paper (e.g. NtabCYP82E4 or NtomCYP82E4). Because not all members of the NtabCYP82E2 gene subfamily exhibited nicotine N-demethylase (NND) 2The abbreviations used are: NND, nicotine N-demethylase; RT, real time. activity (24Siminszky B.

A. 2005; 102: 14919-14924Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the original goal of this study was to define the structural elements responsible for NND activity in the closely related P450 isoforms of the NtabCYP82E2 gene subfamily. Our results showed that a single base amino acid substitution in the coding region of another closely related isoform, NtabCYP82E3, is sufficient to confer NND activity to the encoded protein. DNA sequence and gene expression data also demonstrated that N. tomentosiformis possesses two active NND genes, NtomCYP82E3 expressed strongly in the green leaves and NtomCYP82E4 specifically up-regulated during senescence. We propose that during the evolution of modern tobacco, NtabCYP82E3 was impaired by a point mutation, and NtabCYP82E4 was inactivated by an unstable mutation resulting in the transcriptional suppression of the gene. Plant Materials—Green-leaf converter SC58(CTCT) tobacco line was generated by crossing an interspecific hybrid between N. tomentosiformis and Flue-cured tobacco variety 402 with Flue-cured tobacco cultivar SC58 followed by eight cycles of backcrossing of the progeny to the SC58 parent. In each generation, green-leaf converter individuals were selected and used in the subsequent cross with cultivar SC58. Finally, the conversion locus (CT) was fixed to homozygosity by self-pollinating the heterozygous introgressed lines and identifying individuals whose progeny no longer segregated for the green-leaf conversion trait SC58 (8Mann T.J. Weybrew J.A. Matzinger D.F. Hall J.L. Crop Sci. 1964; 4: 349-353Crossref Google Scholar). Other tobacco cultivars included in the study were full-sib double haploid burley lines DH98-325-5 (nonconverter) and DH98-325-6 (senescing-leaf converter). All genotypes were originally grown for 30 days in a growth chamber and then transferred to a controlled environment green-house equipped with supplemental lighting providing a 14/10-h light/dark cycle. Leaf samples were collected 30 days after transplanting. For curing, tobacco leaves were dipped in 0.2% ethephon, dried for 30 min at room temperature, and stored in dark until they turned yellow. Construction and Analysis of the NtabCYP82E3/NtabCYP82E4 Chimeras—Chimeric clones were generated by digesting the NtabCYP82E3 and NtabCYP82E4 cDNAs with restriction enzymes that recognize restriction sites conserved between the two cDNAs and replacing the resulting NtabCYP82E4 restriction fragment with the corresponding NtabCYP82E3 region. NtabCYP82E3/NtabCYP82E4 chimeras were subcloned into the pYeDP60 yeast expression vector, and the resulting constructs were introduced to yeast strain WAT11 as described (26Gietz D. Stjean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20 (1425): 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2898) Google Scholar). Yeast culturing, transgene induction, and preparation of yeast microsomes were performed as described previously (27Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal fractions were incubated for 45 min at 23 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, containing 0.5 mg of microsomal protein, 2.45 μm [pyrrolidine-2-14C]nicotine (Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA), and 0.75 mm NADPH in a total reaction volume of 150 μl. The reactions were arrested with 50 μl of acetone, and 50 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted on a 250-μm Whatman K6F silica plate. Conversion of nicotine to nornicotine was quantified by localizing and integrating the radioactive traces of nicotine with a Bioscan System 400 imaging scanner. Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Isolation and DNA Sequence Analysis of the CYP82E3 and CYP82E4 Orthologs—Plant genomic DNA was extracted by grinding a 100-mg fresh leaf sample in 500 μl of homogenization buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 1 m KCl, 10 mm EDTA) using the FastPrep FP120 Cell Disrupter (Qbiogene, Inc. Carlsbad, CA). P450s were amplified in a PCR containing 1 μl of leaf extract, 2 μm each primer, 200 μm each of dNTP, and 1.5 mm MgCl2 in a 50-μl final reaction volume. The primers used for the isolation of the various genomic P450 fragments are listed in Table 1. DNA amplification was performed in 30 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 15 s, primer annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 30 s. For the allele-specific amplification of the CYP82E3 orthologs, a 61 °C annealing temperature was used. PCR products were visualized on an ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gel and directly cloned into the pGEM® Easy cloning vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). DNA sequence of the clones were determined by the chain termination method (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52760) Google Scholar). Sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Purified RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (TURBO DNA-free; Ambion, Austin, TX). First strand cDNA was synthesized using 5 μg of total RNA using the StrataScript first-strand synthesis system (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). PCR amplification, cloning of the PCR products, and DNA sequencing of the P450 cDNAs were performed as described for the isolation of the genomic P450 fragments. The nucleotide sequences of the primers used in the PCR are listed in Table 1. Kinetic Analysis of NtomCYP82E3- and NtomCYP82E4-mediated Nicotine Metabolism—Yeast microsomes were prepared as described previously (27Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Nicotine concentration ranges used in the study were 3–467 and 0.6–13 μm for NtomCYP82E3 and NtomCYP82E4, respectively. Kinetic constants were determined by plotting enzyme activity versus substrate concentration and fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data by nonlinear least square method using Sigma Plot version 4.0. Significant differences between parameters were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (PROC GLM, SAS, 2000). Real Time-PCR Analysis—To measure the transcript abundance of the CYP82E3 and CYP82E4 orthologs, RT-PCR was employed using SYBR Green I fluorescence chemistry (30Morrison T.B. Weiss J.J. Wittwer C.T. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 954-962PubMed Google Scholar). A serial dilution of the P450 cDNAs clones was used as the templates for generating a calibration curve. The RT-PCR mixture contained 2.5 mm MgCl2, 125 μm each dNTP, 0.5 μm each primer, 0.5× SYBR Green I, 0.5 μg of cDNA (or 1 μl of reference plasmid), and 1.25 units of platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequences of the allele-specific P450 primers (E3RTF, E3RTR, E4RTF, and E4RTR) are listed in Table 1. RT-PCR was performed according to the following protocol: 95 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 50 s followed by final extension at 72 °C for 5 min in a Bio-Rad iCycler thermocycler (Bio-Rad) using a 220-bp fragment of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA as an internal standard. P450 cDNA concentration was calculated based on the transcript-specific calibration curve normalized to the internal standard. The purity of PCR products was determined by melting-curve analysis as described previously (31Ririe K.M. Rasmussen R.P. Wittwer C.T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). DNA sequence of the amplified cDNA fragments was confirmed by ligating the RT-PCR products into the pGEM-T Easy vector and sequencing 20 randomly selected clones of each cDNA fragment. The C330W Amino Acid Substitution Confers NND Activity to the NtabCYP82E3 cDNA—We have demonstrated previously that a group of P450 isozymes, designated the CYP82E2 gene subfamily, play a major role in the conversion of nicotine to nornicotine (24Siminszky B. Gavilano L. Bowen S.W. Dewey R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14919-14924Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We isolated five unique members of the CYP82E2 gene subfamily, of which only one isoform, NtabCYP82E4, was shown to encode an NND. NtabCYP82E3, the most closely related homolog to NtabCYP82E4, shares 95% predicted amino acid sequence identity with NtabCYP82E4 but conferred no NND activity when expressed in yeast or tobacco (24Siminszky B. Gavilano L. Bowen S.W. Dewey R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14919-14924Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The high amino acid sequence homology yet distinctly different NND activity between NtabCYP82E3 and NtabCYP82E4 provided us with an opportunity to identify unique structural elements that bestow NND activity to NtabCYP82E4. Our hypothesis was that one or few of the 30 polymorphic amino acids between NtabCYP82E3 and NtabCYP82E4 represent catalytically important residues for NND activity in NtabCYP82E4. To identify segments of the coding region that selectively impart NND activity to NtabCYP82E4, we employed domain swapping, a strategy that creates a fusion polypeptide from two (or more) protein sequences and thus facilitates the identification of domains that control the expression of traits (e.g. function) differentially encoded in the parent molecules. The high degree of sequence homology between NtabCYP82E3 and NtabCYP82E4 enabled us to identify three restriction sites (PmlI, SwaI, and EcoRV) located in the same position in both cDNAs (Fig. 1). Using these restriction sites as junction points, we replaced the 459-, 711-, and 1201-bp 5′-most coding region of NtabCYP82E4 with the corresponding gene fragments of NtabCYP82E3, yielding the P-K, S-K, and E-K hybrid constructs, respectively (Fig. 1). The chimeras were cloned into the yeast expression vector pYeD60, and the clones were used to transform the WAT11 yeast strain. In vitro yeast assays were used to quantify the NND activity of all three chimeras. The results showed that chimeras P-K and S-K retained NND activity, whereas E-K did not support nicotine demethylation, suggesting that an element required for NND activity is located between the SwaI and EcoRV restriction sites of NtabCYP82E4 (Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis, we replaced the SwaI-EcoRV fragment of NtabCYP82E4 with the corresponding region from NtabCYP82E3 (construct S-E) and tested the encoded protein for NND activity. Yeast microsomal extracts enriched in the S-E chimeric protein catalyzed the nicotine N-demethylation confirming the notion that the SwaI-EcoRV fragment of NtabCYP82E4 encodes amino acids necessary for NND activity. To further define amino acid residues essential for NND activity, site-directed mutagenesis experiments were conducted. The SwaI-EcoRV region of NtabCYP82E4 encodes 164 amino acids, 7 of which are polymorphic to NtabCYP82E3 (Fig. 2). The relatively few polymorphic amino acids encoded within the SwaI-EcoRV region of the NtabCYP82E4 and NtabCYP82E3 genes made it feasible to employ a mutation stacking approach for identifying catalytically important amino acids. Codons encoding all polymorphic amino acid residues in the SwaI-EcoRV fragment of the NtabCYP82E3 coding region were progressively substituted for the corresponding codons of the NtabCYP82E4 cDNA and expressed in yeast. Microsomal extracts isolated from yeast cells enriched in the single (K269N), double (K269N,I274Null), or triple (K269N,I274Null,T279A) mutant NtabCYP82E3 variants exhibited no NND activity. In contrast, strong NND activity was apparent when a microsomal extract containing the quadruple mutant (K269N,I274Null,T279A,C330W) NtabCYP82E3 protein was assayed. These results indicated that the 990C→G nucleotide substitution, encoding the C330W amino acid mutation, was necessary to confer NND activity to the NtabCYP82E3 cDNA. To determine whether the C330W substitution alone was sufficient to bestow NND activity to NtabCYP82E3, we tested the C330W NtabCYP82E3 single mutation variant in the yeast microsomal assay for nicotine metabolism. The results of the microsomal assay showed that C330W NtabCYP82E3 actively catalyzed the nicotine N-demethylation reaction. Finally, we introduced a reciprocal point mutation (990G→C) in the NtabCYP82E4 coding region to confirm that the Trp330 residue is essential for the NND function. As expected, the C330W substitution in NtabCYP82E4 resulted in a complete loss of NND activity as indicated by the yeast microsomal assay. Overall, these results showed that the C330W substitution is both necessary and sufficient to impart NND activity to NtabCYP82E3. N. tomentosiformis CYP82E3 Encodes a Functional NND–The observation that a single C330W substitution confers NND activity to NtabCYP82E3 led us to the hypothesis that the inactivation of NtabCYP82E3 by the W330C mutation may have represented one of the genetic changes responsible for the evolution of nicotine-retaining N. tabacum from its nicotine N-demethylating ancestors. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to amplify the CYP82E3 orthologs from N. tomentosiformis and N. sylvestris genomic DNA using NtabCYP82E3-specific primers. PCR products were detected only when genomic DNA isolated from N. tomentosiformis was used as template suggesting that in tobacco CYP82E3 originated from the N. tomentosiformis ancestral parent (data not shown). DNA sequence analysis of NtomCYP82E3 predicted a Trp amino acid residue at position 330 lending support to our hypothesis that NtomCYP82E3 encodes a functional NND gene (Table 2). In addition to the predicted C330W mutation, a second substitution (K118N) was also detected in NtomCYP82E3. The GenBank™ accession number of the genomic sequence of NtomCYP82E3 is EF042306. Heterologous expression of the NtomCYP82E3 cDNA in yeast, however, suggests that the K118N polymorphism is neutral given that NtomCYP82E3 also exhibits an NND activity similar to that displayed by the C330W NtabCYP82E3 mutant (Table 3).TABLE 2Polymorphic nucleotides and the encoded amino acids of the orthologous CYP82E3 genes isolated from various tobacco genotypes and N. tomentosiformisSamplePhenotypeN990 (AA330)aNucleotide numbering is based on cDNA sequences.N354 (AA118)DH98-325-5NCC (Cys)NDDH98-325-6SCC (Cys)A (Lys)SC58NCC (Cys)A (Lys)SC58(CTCT)GCG (Trp)T (Asn)N. tomentosiformisGCG (Trp)T (Asn)a Nucleotide numbering is based on cDNA sequences.

NtomCYP82E4 was considered a likely NND candidate, because NtabCYP82E4 has been shown previously to mediate the nicotine to nornicotine conversion in senescing tobacco leaves (24Siminszky B. Gavilano L. Bowen S.W. Dewey R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14919-14924Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of NtomCYP82E4 in nicotine N-demethylation, NtomCYP82E4 was isolated from N. tomentosiformis genomic DNA, and the nucleotide sequence of the gene was compared with that of NtabCYP82E4 derived from tobacco cultivar DH98-325-6. Sequence comparison revealed only two differences between NtomCYP82E4 and NtabCYP82E4 at nucleotide positions 56 and 300, where NtomCYP82E4 contained A and T, and NtabCYP82E4 showed T and C, respectively (Table 4). The 56A→ T nucleotide polymorphism encodes for a Phe19 amino acid residue in tobacco and a Tyr19 in N. tomentosiformis (Table 4).

Many tumors are hypoxic, but it is unknown if expression of Id proteins is regulated in hypoxic cells. Here we show that Id-1 is down-regulated in multiple primary, immortalized, and neoplastic hypoxic cell lines, and the transcriptional repressor ATF-3 is both necessary and sufficient for this hypoxia-induced repression of Id-1. Hypoxic up-regulation of ATF-3 is due in part to activation of the unfolded protein response, a cellular stress response. Remarkably, we observe that the unfolded protein response is de-regulated in all neuroblastoma cell lines tested. Indeed, in the absence of ATF-3 the hypoxia-induced transcription factor HIF-1 up-regulates Id-1 in hypoxic neuroblastoma cells. Hypoxic neuroblastoma cells diminish expression of some neuronal differentiation markers, and forced expression of ATF-3 in hypoxic neuroblastoma cells represses Id-1 and prevents the loss of these markers.

Many tumors are profoundly hypoxic and multiple studies have demonstrated that hypoxic tumors have a poorer prognosis than non-hypoxic tumors. Although the full etiology of this observation is unclear, many of the phenotypes associated with hypoxic cells are due to the induction and suppression of gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 1Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5197) Google Scholar). While the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF-1, is the best characterized inducer of gene transcription in hypoxic cells, it is clear that additional signaling pathways can both up-regulate and down-regulate gene expression in hypoxic cells (2Kitamuro T.

For example, most normal cells and many neoplastic cells undergo a growth arrest when hypoxic, whereas some stem cells and neoplastic cells continue to proliferate under hypoxic conditions (7Gardner L.B.

Neuroblastoma cells, when rendered hypoxic, lose some neuronal markers, leading to the hypothesis that they undergo hypoxic “de-differentiation” to immature neural crest cells (13Axelson H.

Despite the probability that hypoxic regulation of proliferation and differentiation play an important role in the aggressiveness of hypoxic tumors, the mechanisms by which hypoxic cells regulate proliferation and differentiation have not been fully delineated.The Id proteins play an important role in both proliferation and differentiation, although their regulation in hypoxic cells has not been well studied. Id proteins, consisting of Id-1, Id-2, Id-3, and Id-4, act as inhibitors of DNA binding and inhibitors of differentiation. These proteins contain helix-loop-helix (HLH) 2The abbreviations used are: HLH, helix-loop-helix; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcription; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; TGF, transforming growth factor; UPR, unfolded protein response; eiF2, eukaryotic initiation factor 2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. 2The abbreviations used are: HLH, helix-loop-helix; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcription; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; TGF, transforming growth factor; UPR, unfolded protein response; eiF2, eukaryotic initiation factor 2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. motifs, but unlike HLH transcription factors they do not contain DNA binding domains. Thus Id proteins can heterodimerize with HLH transcription factors, prevent these transcription factors from binding to DNA and transactivating genes, and act in a dominant negative fashion. Id proteins can heterodimerize with two classes of HLH transcription factors. Class I HLH transcription factors are ubiquitous and encompass the E2A transcription factor, which functions as a tumor suppressor and inhibits proliferation. Class II HLH transcription factors are tissue-specific and regulate genes necessary for nerve, muscle, and T cell development (reviewed in Ref. 14Ruzinova M.B. Benezra R.

All cells were grown in DMEM, 10% FCS, except for MEFs, which were grown in DMEM, 10% FCS, NEAA, and β-mercaptoethanol as described. Prior to experiments, all cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to DMEM with 1 gm/dl glucose, 10% FCS, 25 mm HEPES to buffer against acidosis. Cells were incubated at 37 °C degrees, in either 5% CO2, or in a Plas-Labs environmental chamber.

ATF-4 was detected in nuclear extracts prepared from cells treated as indicated in the figure legends. Antibodies against Id-1 (sc-488), ATF-3 (sc-188) eIF2α (sc 11386) and ATF-4 (sc-200) VEGF (sc-152) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, HIF-1α from Novus Biologicals, and eIF2α phosphorylated S51 from Epitomics. Immunoblots were quantitated on a Bio-Rad GS800 Calibration Densitometer.Gene Expression—RNA was isolated with TRIzol and cDNA made with 200 ng of total RNA using a Stratagene kit. 2% of the resulting cDNA was used for either real-time PCR with SybrGreen (Applied Biosystems) or semiquantitative RT-PCR with REDTaq ReadyMix (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR protocols consisted of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s for 33 (semiquantitative) or 45 (real-time) cycles. Data for real-time PCR was normalized to 18 S RNA.

After 24 h or recovery cells were rendered either hypoxic or maintained as normoxic for an additional 16 h, at which time luciferase activity was determined with the Promega luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol.Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA were performed as described (8Gardner L.B.

Oligonucleotides for the Id-1 promoter were 5′-AATGGGTGACGTCACAGGCCTG-3′ and mutant 5′-GGAATGGGAAACGTCACAGGCCTG-3′.XBP Splicing Assay—Cells were rendered hypoxic or treated with tunicamycin, RNA was isolated, and PCR was performed with the primers 5′-AAACAGAGTAGCAGCTCAGACTGC-3′ and 5′-TCCTTCTGGGTAGACCTCTGGGAG-3′. RT-PCR was then performed with SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.RESULTSId-1 Is Down-regulated in Hypoxic Cells via Transcriptional Repression Mediated by ATF-3—During the course of an unbiased screen to identify transcription factors with altered activity in hypoxic cells, we determined that Id-1 protein expression is diminished in a variety of hypoxic primary, immortalized, and transformed cell lines (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Because down-regulation of Id-1 might explain in part why some hypoxic cells undergo a growth arrest and/or differentiate, we pursued the mechanism for Id-1 down-regulation in hypoxic cells.Previous studies have demonstrated that Id-1 expression can be regulated at both the post-translational and transcriptional level (27Kang Y. Chen C.R. Massague J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 28Trausch-Azar J.S. Lingbeck J. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32614-32619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To delineate the mechanism for decreased Id-1 expression in hypoxic cells we first investigated potential post-translational regulation of Id-1 in hypoxic cells. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) stably expressing tagged Id-1 from a retroviral construct were treated with cycloheximide, and lysates were collected at regular intervals and subjected to immunoblot to assess stability of the Id-1 protein. There was no significant difference in the half-life of endogenous versus exogenous Id-1 proteins in normoxic cells (Fig. 1B) demonstrating that overexpression of exogenous Id-1 does not affect the kinetics of its degradation. In contrast to endogenous Id-1 protein expression, exogenous Id-1 expression (where Id-1 transcription is mediated by a retroviral LTR promoter instead of the native Id-1 promoter) was not repressed in hypoxic cells (Fig. 1B) suggesting that endogenous Id-1 is regulated at the transcriptional level in hypoxic cells. In addition, the half-life of exogenous Id-1 protein was not significantly altered in hypoxic cells compared with normoxic cells (Fig. 1B, with the average of three independent experiments ± S.E. shown graphically below). Together, these data demonstrate that Id-1 translation and degradation are not altered in hypoxic cells and suggest Id-1 may be transcriptionally repressed in hypoxic cells.We next examined directly whether transcriptional repression of the Id-1 promoter occurs in hypoxic cells. MEFs rendered hypoxic demonstrated a rapid decrease in Id-1 mRNA as determined by semiquantitative PCR and quantitative PCR (Fig. 1, C and D). To determine whether the decrease of Id-1 mRNA in hypoxic cells is due to direct transcriptional repression of the Id-1 promoter or a result of decrease in Id-1 mRNA stability, we transfected a luciferase construct containing ∼1.4 kilobases of the Id-1 proximal promoter (26Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Massague J. Rosa J.L. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3176-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) into human kidney epithelial cells and rendered these cells hypoxic for 16 h. When compared with transfected normoxic cells, there was a significant repression of the Id-1 promoter-driven reporter in hypoxic cells (Fig. 1E). In total, these data demonstrate that transcription of Id-1 is repressed in hypoxic cells.We then pursued the mechanism by which Id-1 is transcriptionally repressed in hypoxic cells. TGFβ-1 has recently been reported to down-regulate Id-1 mRNA in immortalized HaCAT (human keratinocytes) cells via an ATF-3 binding site in the Id-1 proximal promoter (27Kang Y. Chen C.R. Massague J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). ATF-3 is a member of a family of stress-induced transcription factors. Whereas other ATF family members are transcriptional activators, ATF-3 has been reported to serve either as a transcriptional activator or repressor, depending on the cellular context (reviewed in Ref. 29Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). We found that HaCAT cells also down-regulate Id-1 and up-regulate ATF-3 when rendered hypoxic (Fig. 1F), as do a number of other normal and transformed cell lines (Fig. 1G and data not shown). Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed a greater than 5-fold reduction of Id-1 mRNA and 5-fold up-regulation of ATF-3 mRNA in wild-type MEFs by 4 h (Fig. 1D). Importantly Id-1 RNA is not repressed in hypoxic ATF-3–/– MEFs, and in fact a modest but significant up-regulation of Id-1 mRNA was noted in hypoxic ATF-3–/– MEFs at 8 h (Fig. 1D). Similarly, Id-1 protein expression was only mildly repressed in hypoxic ATF-3–/– MEFs as compared with wild-type MEFs (data not shown). In contrast to the native Id-1 proximal promoter, an Id-1 promoter construct with a mutated ATF site was not repressed in hypoxic cells (Fig. 1E). Thus hypoxia-induced ATF-3 is necessary for the hypoxic repression of Id-1.ATF-3 Is Induced in Hypoxic Cells in Part by the Unfolded Protein Response—Since our data demonstrate that ATF-3 is necessary for the hypoxia-induced down-regulation of Id-1, we next focused on the mechanism of the hypoxic up-regulation of ATF-3. ATF-3 is induced by cytokines and a variety of stresses, including UV irradiation, DNA damage, and ischemia/reperfusion (reviewed in Ref. 29Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). The transcriptional activator ATF-4 has also been implicated in the up-regulation of ATF-3 (23Jiang H.Y. Wek S.A. McGrath B.C. Lu D. Hai T. Harding H.P. Wang X. Ron D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). ATF-4, in turn, can be induced by multiple stresses including protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is a stress response pathway in which a global inhibition of protein synthesis leads to increased expression of stress response genes which serve to adapt cells to this increased stress. One of the central mechanisms in this stress response is the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eIF2α on serine 51 by the UPR-activated PERK kinase (30Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2369) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2α by the PERK kinase leads to both general translational inhibition and a paradoxical increased translation of a small subset of proteins, including ATF-4. Because both activation of the UPR and up-regulation of ATF-4 have recently been demonstrated to occur in hypoxic cells (31Blais J.D. Filipenko V. Bi M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Koumenis C. Wouters B.G.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1114-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), we explored whether hypoxic activation of the UPR and up-regulation of ATF-4 leads to the hypoxic up-regulation of ATF-3 and subsequent repression of Id-1.When compared with wild-type MEFs, ATF-3 induction was diminished in hypoxic ATF-4–/– MEFs (Fig. 2A) and PERK-MEFs (Fig. 2B). In hypoxic MEFs in which the endogenous eIF2α gene has been genetically replaced by an eIF2α allele, which cannot be phosphorylated (S51A) (and thus the PERK dependent branch of the UPR cannot be activated) (24Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), ATF-4 expression was entirely blunted, and both ATF-3 induction and Id-1 repression were diminished 3-fold (Fig. 2C, quantitation in right panel). Consistent with hypoxic activation of the unfolded protein response, ATF-4 mRNA was not increased in hypoxic cells suggesting that the increased expression of ATF-4 is due to translational regulation (Fig. 2D). Also consistent with activation of the UPR pathway, ATF-3 and an additional ATF-4 target CHOP were induced at the mRNA level in hypoxic cells (Fig. 2D). Thus we conclude that in hypoxic cells PERK is activated, leading to eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF-4 generation, which in turn leads to ATF-3 induction and Id-1 repression (Fig. 2E). Because some detectable ATF-3 is generated in hypoxic PERK–/–, ATF-4–/–, and eIF2α S51A cells, there are additional mechanisms for the hypoxic induction of ATF-3 (dashed lines in Fig. 2E). Other signaling pathways implicated in the induction of ATF-3 include the p38/MAP kinase signaling pathway (reviewed in Ref. 29Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar); however, we did not note either activation of p38 in hypoxic MEFs or alteration of ATF-3 expression with p38 inhibition in hypoxic MEFs (data not shown). We have, however, noted significant stabilization of ATF-3 mRNA in hypoxic cells. 3L. B. Gardner, unpublished data. What role this prolongation of ATF-3 mRNA half-life has in explaining UPR independent mechanisms for ATF-3 induction and Id-1 repression in hypoxic cells remains to be determined.FIGURE 2ATF-3 is induced in hypoxic cells via the unfolded protein response. ATF4–/– (A), PERK–/– MEFs (B), and eIF2a S51A knock-in MEFs (lacking phosphorylatable eIF2a) (C) along with their wild-type counterparts were rendered hypoxic for 16 h, and expression of ATF-3, ATF-4, and Id-1 was determined by immunoblots. Coomassie Blue (coom.) staining serves as a loading control.

Although we observed that Id-1 protein is down-regulated in over 10 cell lines, including several neural and astrocytoma cell lines, when rendered hypoxic (data not shown), previous literature suggested that Id-1 and Id-2 mRNA are actually induced in several hypoxic neuroblastoma cell lines at short time points (19Jogi A.

Evidence demonstrating differential extents of cross-bridge-dependent activation of force, especially at acidic pH, in myofilaments in which slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI) replaced cardiac TnI (cTnI) indicates the significance of a His in ssTnI that is an homologous Ala in cTnI. We compared cross-bridge-dependent activation in myofilaments regulated by cTnI, ssTnI, cTnI(A66H), or ssTnI(H34A). A drop from pH 7.0 to 6.5 induced enhanced cross-bridge-dependent activation in cTnI myofilaments, but depressed activation in cTnI(A66H) myofilaments. This same drop in pH depressed cross-bridge-dependent activation in both ssTnI myofilaments and ssTnI(H34A) myofilaments. Compared with controls, cTnI(A66H) myofilaments were desensitized to Ca2+, whereas there was no difference in the Ca2+-force relationship between ssTnI and ssTnI(H34A) myofilaments. The mutations in cTnI and ssTnI did not affect Ca2+ dissociation rates from cTnC at pH 7.0 or 6.5. However, at pH 6.5, cTnI(A66H) had lower affinity for cTnT than cTnI. We also probed cross-bridge-dependent activation in myofilaments regulated by cTnI(Q56A). Myofilaments containing cTnI(Q56A) demonstrated cross-bridge-dependent activation that was similar to controls containing cTnI at pH 7.0 and an enhanced cross-bridge-dependent activation at pH 6.5. We conclude that a localized N-terminal region of TnI comprised of amino acids 33–80, which interacts with C-terminal regions of cTnC and cTnT, is of particular significance in transducing signaling of thin filament activation by strong cross-bridges.

Structural data generally support the biochemical data demonstrating that whereas Ca2+ is able to move Tm partially on the thin filament, complete movement of Tm away from myosin binding sites on actin requires strongly bound cross-bridges (7Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The results of these studies indicate that binding of a cross-bridge to a structural unit (7 actins; 1 Tn; 1 Tm) can affect near neighbor structural units by cooperative spread of activation. There is evidence that cardiac muscle may depend more on this mode of activation than skeletal muscle (8Moss R.L. Nwoye L.O. Greaser M.L. J. Physiol. 1991; 440: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Wolff M.R. McDonald K.S. Moss R.L. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 154-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, strongly bound cross-bridges enhance the affinity of cTnC for Ca2+ (10Pan B.S. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7839-7849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an effect unique to cardiac myofilaments (11Wang Y.P. Fuchs F. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1995; 27: 1235-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Yet, there is little information related to the molecular basis for these differences or the protein-protein interactions critical to the feedback effects of strong cross-bridges on activation. An important clue came from studies of Morimoto et al. (12Morimoto S. Ohta M. Goto T. Ohtsuki I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), who compared the effects of pH on the ability of strongly bound rigor cross-bridges to activate tension at pCa 9.0 in skinned cardiac fiber bundles reconstituted with Tn complexes containing either cTnI or ssTnI. The acidic pH induced reduction in cross-bridge-dependent activation of skinned fiber bundles was significantly blunted when cTnI was replaced with ssTnI. Moreover, skinned fiber bundles in which cTnC had been specifically extracted demonstrated the same cross-bridge-dependent activation at neutral and acidic pH. Inasmuch as cTnI-(33–80) forms a binding interface with the C-lobe of cTnC (13Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) with the tightest interaction between cTnI and cTnC being a peptide comprised of amino acids 39–58 (14Ferrieres G. Pugniere M. Mani J.C. Villard S. Laprade M. Doutre P. Pau B. Granier C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the results of Morimoto et al. (12Morimoto S. Ohta M. Goto T. Ohtsuki I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) suggested a critical role of this near N-terminal region of TnI in cross-bridge-dependent activation. In considering what might be important variations between cTnI and ssTnI in the N-terminal region, we noted that an Ala at position 66 in cTnI is replaced by His at the homologous position 34 in ssTnI. We hypothesized that this substitution may be of significance based on evidence reported by Dargis et al. (16Dargis R. Pearlstone J.R. Barrette-Ng I. Edwards H. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34662-34665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). They demonstrated that the relative resistance of fast skeletal myofilaments to deactivation by acidic pH, when compared with cardiac myofilaments, is due in large part to His-130 within the C-terminal end of fsTnI, which is Ala-162 at the homologous amino acid in cTnI. The homologous His is at amino acid 131 in ssTnI. Reconstitution with the mutant, cTnI(A162H), rendered cardiac myofilament preparations relatively insensitive to deactivation by acidic pH. In the present experiments, we compared effects of pH on cross-bridge-dependent activation of force generated by detergent-skinned fiber bundles from the hearts of mice in which we exchanged endogenous cTn complexes with those containing mutant cTnI(A66H), ssTnI(H34A), or cTnI(Q56A). Our data support the hypothesis that an N-terminal region of cTnI, which binds tightly to C-terminal regions of cTnC and cTnT, is of special significance in transducing signals from strongly bound cross-bridges that spread activation in the thin filament. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Cardiac Troponin and Slow Skeletal Troponin I and Mutant Proteins—Human cardiac TnC, adult mouse cardiac TnT, and wild-type mouse cardiac TnI were expressed and purified as previously described (17Sumandea M.P. Pyle W.G. Kobayashi T. De Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35135-35144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Adult rat ssTnI cDNA (which differs from mouse ssTnI by only 1 residue found at the very C-terminal end) was previously cloned into a pET3a vector (generously provided by Dr. Anne F. Martin) and selectively mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The construct was verified by DNA sequencing and designated ssTnI(H34A). Adult mouse cTnI was cloned into a pET3d vector and selectively mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and designated cTnI(A66H) or cTnI(Q56A). Rat WT ssTnI and recombinant rat ssTnI(H34A) were expressed in Rosetta BL21(DE3) cells grown overnight in Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. Cells were harvested and purified by the method previously described (17Sumandea M.P. Pyle W.G. Kobayashi T. De Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35135-35144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) with the modification of replacing the urea/Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, with the following buffer: 6 m urea, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. Cells were lysed and the supernatant fraction was applied to a DE52 anion exchange column. Flow-through was collected and applied to an SP-Sepharose column and eluted with a 0.5 m NaCl gradient. Proteins were further purified using an immobilized cTnC affinity column as previously described (18Guo X. Wattanapermpool J. Palmiter K.A. Murphy A.M. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15210-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of heterotrimeric Tn complexes was done as previously described (19Kobayashi T. Yang X. Walker L.A. Van Breemen R.B. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 38: 213-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cloning and Expression of GST Fusion Cardiac and Slow Skeletal Troponin I—DNAs encoding cTnI and ssTnI were amplified by PCR using Platinum pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). cTnI PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes and ssTnI PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and directly subcloned in-frame into the glutathione S-transferase (GST) vector pGEX-5X1 (Amersham Biosciences) at the BamHI/XhoI or BamHI/EcoRI sites, respectively. DNA encoding cTnI(A66H) was amplified by PCR to introduce the specific restriction sites, digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and subcloned into the GST vector pGEX-5X1 as above. For the GST-ssTnI(H34A) construct, DNA encoding GST-ssTnI was mutated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For protein expression, each GST-TnI plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells and grown in 100 ml of Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C, which was induced after 3 h with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cell culture was centrifuged and the supernatant fraction discarded. The remaining pellet was resuspended in Buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, with 1 mm DTT and 0.1 mm benzamidine added. The cells were lysed by sonication on ice and the cell lysate was centrifuged. The supernatant fraction containing the protein was saved and stored at 4 °C up to 1 week for further use. Whole Troponin Complex Exchange into Detergent-skinned Myofilaments—Male CD-1 mice (age 3–4 months) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (5 mg/kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection. Hearts were quickly excised and left ventricular papillary muscles were dissected into fiber bundles (4–5 mm long and 150–250 μm in diameter) in high relax buffer (HR) containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm free Mg2+, 5 mm MgATP2–, 12 mm creatine phosphate, 10 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma) with free Ca2+ concentration at 10–9 m and ionic strength adjusted to 150 mm with KCl with concentrations calculated by a computer program (20Godt R.E. Lindley B.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 279-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). To extract membranes, the skinned fiber bundles were placed for 4 h at 4°C in HR with 1% Triton X-100 added and then transferred to exchange buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, with ∼18 μm recombinant Tn complex and incubated overnight at 4 °C. All solutions contained a mixture of protease inhibitors as previously described (21Burkart E.M. Sumandea M.P. Kobayashi T. Nili M. Martin A.F. Homsher E. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11265-11272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Measurements of Cross-bridge and Ca2+-dependent Activation of Force at pH 7.0 and pH 6.5—The skinned fiber bundles were mounted between a micromanipulator and force transducer with cellulose-acetate glue. Resting sarcomere length was set at 2.0 μm as determined using laser diffraction patterns, cross-sectional area measurements were made, and isometric tension was recorded on a chart recorder (22Wolska B.M. Keller R.S. Evans C.C. Palmiter K.A. Phillips R.M. Muthuchamy M. Oehlenschlager J. Wieczorek D.F. De Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at 22 °C. The myofilaments were initially placed in HR and then subjected to sequential decreases in [MgATP] (10–3-10–8 m) or increasing Ca2+ concentration (10–8–10–4.5 m) and force was recorded. HR buffer (10–9 m Ca2+) contained 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0 or 6.5, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm free Mg2+, 5 mm MgATP2–, 12 mm creatine phosphate, 10 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma), and ionic strength was adjusted to 150 mm with KCl. For force-Ca2+ measurements, Ca2+ was varied by mixing HR with HR to which CaCl2 had been added to achieve 10–4.5 m free Ca2+. For MgATP-force measurements, Mg and ATP were varied in HR buffer to achieve a range of concentrations at ionic strength 0.15 m and 10–9 m Ca2+. All solutions included a mixture of protease inhibitors: 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and brought to a final pH of 7.0 or 6.5 with KOH. The multiequilibria in the solutions used in these experiments were computed using binding constants given by Godt and Lindley (20Godt R.E. Lindley B.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 279-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) as previously described. Extra fiber bundles were removed from exchange buffer, rinsed in HR solution, then placed in 10 μl of 1% SDS and stored at –20 °C for later analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Ca2+ Activation with the Addition of NEM-S1—The effects of NEM-S1 on Ca2+-activated force have been previously described by Swartz and Moss (23Swartz D.R. Moss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20497-20506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated myosin S1 from rabbit fast skeletal muscle and modified it with NEM as previously described (23Swartz D.R. Moss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20497-20506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control or whole Tn-exchanged fiber bundles were mounted between a force transducer and micromanipulator as described above then initially bathed in HR, switched to a maximally activating Ca2+ solution (10–4.5 m), and then fully relaxed in HR. The first series of Ca2+ activations (10–8–10–4.5 m) was done without NEM-S1; then the fiber bundles were immersed in a HR bath containing 6 μm NEM-S1 for 15 min. This incubation was followed with a second full series of Ca2+ activations. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Fiber bundles were prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis to determine the extent of exchange of endogenous for recombinant Tn complex as previously described (24Chandra M. Montgomery D.E. Kim J.J. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 867-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Exchange of Tn was determined by the presence of recombinant cTnT, which contained a 9-amino acid c-Myc tag at the N terminus of the recombinant cTnT that retarded its mobility in 15% SDS-PAGE (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio 200:1) and separated the exogenous cTnT from the endogenous cTnT. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm) and probed with a mouse monoclonal primary antibody (Sigma CT-3) against cTnT followed by a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma, A2304). The signal was detected using an ECL-plus Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences). Fig. 1 shows examples of the exchange of cTnI with exogenous Tn complexes. Standards were a recombinant Tn complex containing c-Myc-tagged cTnT (run in lane 1) and a mouse heart ventricular homogenate (run in lane 2). Lanes 3–6 contained skinned fiber bundles in which the native Tn complex was exchanged with Tn reconstituted with c-Myc-tagged cTnT and with cTnI, cTnI(A66H), ssTnI, or ssTnI(H34A). Exchange of the native complexes containing cTnI(A66H), ssTnI, or ssTnI(H34A) demonstrated an 80–90% replacement. On the other hand, exchange of native cTnI with exogenous Tn containing cTnI indicated about a 50% replacement. We have done control experiments demonstrating no difference in the Ca2+-force relationships of fiber bundles treated with exchange buffer alone or with exchange buffer containing cTnI-cTnTmyc-cTnC. As previously reported (17Sumandea M.P. Pyle W.G. Kobayashi T. De Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35135-35144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we found a similar difference in the ability of complexes containing native cTnI to replace endogenous Tn complexes, but no difference in the Ca2+-tension relationship, as we would expect in view of the replacement of native complexes with endogenous complexes. ELISA and Binding Assay—To determine the affinity of cardiac TnT for the various TnIs, the ELISA-based solid-phase protein binding assay was carried out similar to that previously described (25Biesiadecki B.J. Schneider K.L. Yu Z.B. Chong S.M. Jin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13825-13832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Ogut O. Jin J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16581-16590Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The concentration of Escherichia coli cell lysates containing GST-tagged fusion proteins of cardiac, slow skeletal, or mutant TnI required to completely saturate the well of Reacti-bind glutathione-coated plates (Pierce) was first determined by standard ELISA (27Wang J. Jin J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) carried out with the anti-TnI specific monoclonal antibody C5 (Research Diagnostics Inc.). The affinity of TnT for TnI was then determined by incubating 100 μl of GST-TnI E. coli lysate at an excess concentration to ensure complete saturation of glutathione on buffer A (0.1 m KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0) washed Reacti-bind glutathione-coated plates (Pierce) at room temperature for 2 h. Following a wash with buffer A to remove unbound TnI and contaminants, the unoccupied plastic surface was blocked by incubation with 150 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin in buffer A for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was then washed three times in buffer A and TnT binding to the immobilized GST-TnI was carried out by incubation with serial dilutions of cTnT in buffer A from 13.5 nm. Following TnT incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the plate was washed three times with buffer A and the TnT that remained bound to TnI quantified by the anti-TnT monoclonal antibody CT-3 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) as previously described (24Chandra M. Montgomery D.E. Kim J.J. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 867-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Biesiadecki B.J. Schneider K.L. Yu Z.B. Chong S.M. Jin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13825-13832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in triplicate and the EC50 for cTnT binding to TnI determined from titration curves relating [cTnT] to percent bound cTnT. Determination of Ca2+ Dissociation Rates—Ca2+ dissociation (koff) rates from recombinant Tn complexes containing cTnI, ssTnI, cTnI(A66H), or ssTnI(H34A) at either pH 7.0 or 6.5 were measured in a stopped-flow apparatus using the fluorescent Ca2+ chelator Quin-2 as previously described (28Gomes A.V. Venkatraman G. Davis J.P. Tikunova S.B. Engel P. Solaro R.J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49579-49587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Each recombinant complex (∼6 μm) was prepared in the following buffer: 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0 or 6.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm Mg2+. This solution was rapidly mixed with an equal volume of Quin-2 (150 μm) in the same buffer at 15 °C. As Ca2+ dissociated from cTnC, it was chelated by Quin-2 resulting in an increased fluorescent signal. The fluorescence was monitored through a 510-nm broad band-pass interference filter with excitation at 330 nm. Each trace represents the average of five individual shots (which was repeated multiple times) and fit with a single exponential from which the koff for Ca2+ exchange with cTnC was calculated. Statistical Analysis—The relationship between [MgATP] or [Ca2+] and tension were fit to the Hill equation using nonlinear least squares regression to obtain [MgATP]50 or [Ca2+]50 and Hill coefficient (nH) (Prism GraphPad software). Statistical differences of [MgATP]50 or [Ca2+]50 and nH were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (SigmaStat software). Statistical differences in tension developed before and after NEM-S1 treatment was determined by paired Student's t test. Statistical differences in Ca2+ dissociation rates from cTnC were determined by Student's t test. Binding affinity EC50 were analyzed by repeated measures of one-way analysis of variance with at least n = 3. All values are presented as mean ± S.E. with significance set at p < 0.05. Rigor Cross-bridge-dependent Activation—Our aim was to determine whether signals generated by strongly bound cross-bridges that affect cooperative activation of the thin filament are modified by the N-terminal region of cTnI. One approach to this aim involved activating skinned cardiac fiber bundles with rigor cross-bridges in the absence of Ca2+ (pCa 9.0) by varying the concentration of MgATP. As shown in Fig. 2, the relationship between [MgATP] and tension was not significantly different between myofilaments containing cTnI ([MgATP]50 = 16.54 ± 0.78 μm) and myofilaments containing cTnI(A66H) ([MgATP]50 = 16.10 ± 1.59 μm) at pH 7.0. A decrease from pH 7.0 to 6.5 induced an inhibition of cross-bridge-dependent activation in both preparations as indicated by the leftward shift of the tension-[MgATP] relationship. However, inhibition of cross-bridge-dependent activation at pH 6.5 was significantly greater in myofilaments containing cTnI(A66H) ([MgATP]50 = 6.30 ± 0.09 μm) than in myofilaments containing cTnI ([MgATP]50 = 10.27 ± 0.36 μm). Data in Fig. 3 compare results at pH 7.0 and 6.5 in myofilaments containing either ssTnI or ssTnI(H34A) in place of cTnI. In this series of experiments, activation of tension by rigor cross-bridges in myofilaments containing ssTnI at pH 7.0 ([MgATP]50 = 10.6 ± 0.74 μm) was diminished at pH 6.5 ([MgATP]50 = 6.42 ± 0.26 μm). However, tension developed by myofilaments containing ssTnI(H34A) were less sensitive to rigor cross-bridge activation than those containing ssTnI at both pH 7.0 ([MgATP]50 = 8.78 ± 0.47 μm) and 6.5 ([MgATP]50 = 4.13 ± 0.13 μm). The Hill coefficient was significantly increased for all the myofilament preparations at pH 6.5 compared with pH 7.0. Ca2+-dependent Activation—We also compared the tension-[Ca2+] relationship at pH 7.0 and 6.5 in myofilaments containing cTnI, ssTnI, mutant cTnI(A66H), or mutant cTnI(H34A). Data in Fig. 4 show that at both pH 7.0 and 6.5, myofilaments containing cTnI(A66H) were desensitized to Ca2+ (pH 7.0 [Ca2+]50 = 2.60 ± 0.15 μm; pH 6.5 [Ca2+]50 = 10.53 ± 1.28 μm) compared with cTnI (pH 7.0 [Ca2+]50 = 1.85 ± 0.03 μm; pH 6.5 [Ca2+]50 = 6.86 ± 0.15 μm). In a separate series of experiments shown in Fig. 5, ssTnI myofilaments ([Ca2+]50 = 2.37 ± 0.10 μm) and ssTnI(H34A) myofilaments ([Ca2+]50 = 2.57 ± 0.14 μm) were more sensitive to Ca2+ activation than cTnI myofilaments ([Ca2+]50 = 4.12 ± 0.23 μm) at pH 7.0. Moreover, the presence of both ssTnI ([Ca2+]50 = 7.78 ± 0.30 μm) and ssTnI(H34A) ([Ca2+]50 = 7.62 ± 0.84 μm) induced a greater resistance to deactivation at pH 6.5 than occurred with cTnI myofilaments ([Ca2+]50 = 10.68 ± 0.25 μm). The Hill coefficient for the tension-Ca2+ relationship of cTnI myofilaments was greater than that seen with either ssTnI or ssTnI(H34A) myofilament but remained unchanged compared with cTnI(A66H). The Hill coefficient was not significantly altered by the change in pH in any of the myofilament preparations.FIGURE 5Force-Ca2+ relationship in skinned myofilaments containing cTnI, ssTnI or ssTnI(H34A). A comparison of cTnI myofilaments at pH 7.0 ([Ca2+]50 = 4.12 ± 0.23 μm) showed that myofilaments containing either ssTnI or ssTnI(H34A) were more sensitive to Ca2+ to the same extent (ssTnI [Ca2+]50 = 2.37 ± 0.10 μm; ssTnI(H34A) [Ca2+]50 = 2.57 ± 0.14 μm). At pH 6.5 both ssTnI and ssTnI(H34A) demonstrated the same degree of resistance to acidic deactivation (ssTnI, [Ca2+]50 = 7.78 ± 0.30 μm; ssTnI(H34A), [Ca2+]50 = 7.62 ± 0.84 μm) compared with cTnI myofilament ([Ca2+]50 = 10.68 ± 0.25 μm). Data are presented as mean ± S.E., n = 5–8 fiber bundles from 3 different hearts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NEM-S1-Induced Cross-bridge Activation of Ca2+-dependent Tension—To determine the relative contribution of strongly bound cross-bridges in myofilaments activated with Ca2+, we employed NEM-S1, a strongly binding myosin analogue, to enhance endogenous cross-bridge cycling (23Swartz D.R. Moss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20497-20506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data are displayed as a plot of tension versus submaximal Ca2+ levels inasmuch as this is the range in which cross-bridge-dependent activation is prevalent and where normal heart function occurs (29Campbell K. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 254-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Fabiato A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 457-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In Fig. 6, we show data from measurements of Ca2+-activated tension in cTnI myofilaments and cTnI(A66H) myofilaments before (white bars) and after (black bars) NEM-S1 treatment. The submaximal tension developed before NEM-S1 treatment in cTnI myofilaments was greater compared with that seen with cTnI(A66H) at pH 7.0 (Fig. 6, A and C). Myofilaments containing cTnI(A66H) were also deactivated to a greater extent at pH 6.5 than cTnI myofilaments (Fig. 6, B and D). After NEM-S1 treatment, there was increased cross-bridge activation at pH 7.0 leading to increased tension in both cTnI and cTnI(A66H) myofilaments over a broad range of Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 6, A and C). Although all myofilaments became deactivated at pH 6.5, the ability of NEM-S1 to activate the thin filament and increase tension was relatively enhanced compared with that seen at pH 7.0 (Fig. 6, B and D). The tension developed at a given [Ca2+] before NEM-S1 compared with the -fold increase in that tension after NEM-S1 treatment is given as a value in the inset of each graph to demonstrate the relative ability of NEM-S-1 to activate tension in myofilaments regulat"
https://openalex.org/W2057089368,"In ionotropic glutamate receptors, agonist binding occurs in a conserved clam shell-like domain composed of the two lobes D1 and D2. Docking of glutamate into the binding cleft promotes rotation in the hinge region of the two lobes, resulting in closure of the binding pocket, which is thought to represent a prerequisite for channel gating. Here, we disrupted D1D2 interlobe interactions in the NR2A subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors through systematic mutation of individual residues and studied the influence on the activation kinetics of currents from NR1/NR2 NMDA receptors heterologously expressed in HEK cells. We show that the mutations affect differentially glutamate binding and channel gating, depending on their location within the binding domain, mainly by altering koff and kcl, respectively. Whereas impaired stability of glutamate in its binding site is the only effect of mutations on one side of the ligand binding pocket, close to the hinge region, alterations in gating are the predominant consequence of mutations on the opposite side, at the entrance of the binding pocket. A mutation increasing D1D2 interaction at the entrance of the pocket resulted in an NMDA receptor with an increased open probability as demonstrated by single channel and whole cell kinetic analysis. Thus, the results indicate that agonist-induced binding domain closure is itself a complex process, certain aspects of which are coupled either to binding or to gating. Specifically, we propose that late steps of domain closure, in kinetic terms, represent part of channel gating. In ionotropic glutamate receptors, agonist binding occurs in a conserved clam shell-like domain composed of the two lobes D1 and D2. Docking of glutamate into the binding cleft promotes rotation in the hinge region of the two lobes, resulting in closure of the binding pocket, which is thought to represent a prerequisite for channel gating.

We show that the mutations affect differentially glutamate binding and channel gating, depending on their location within the binding domain, mainly by altering koff and kcl, respectively. Whereas impaired stability of glutamate in its binding site is the only effect of mutations on one side of the ligand binding pocket, close to the hinge region, alterations in gating are the predominant consequence of mutations on the opposite side, at the entrance of the binding pocket. A mutation increasing D1D2 interaction at the entrance of the pocket resulted in an NMDA receptor with an increased open probability as demonstrated by single channel and whole cell kinetic analysis. Thus, the results indicate that agonist-induced binding domain closure is itself a complex process, certain aspects of which are coupled either to binding or to gating. Specifically, we propose that late steps of domain closure, in kinetic terms, represent part of channel gating. Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) 4The abbreviations used are: iGluR, ionotropic glutamate receptor; AMPA, (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazlyl)-propionic acid; LBD, ligand binding domain; MNI, 4-methoxy-7-nitroindoline; NI, 7-nitroindoline; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; WT, wild type. are the major mediators of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain and play important roles both in neuronal development and synaptic function (1Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). They are tetrameric protein complexes (2Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2954-2961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) in which each subunit is composed of (i) an extracellular amino-terminal domain, (ii) a ligand binding domain (LBD), sharing sequence homology to bacterial periplasmic binding proteins, (iii) a membrane-associated domain with the transmembrane helices M1–M4 that forms the ion pore, and (iv) an intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain (4Mayer M.L. Armstrong N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 161-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The family of iGluRs is divided into the subclasses of AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors that differ, among other things, in their ligand specificities (1Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the pharmacological differences, crystal structures have been obtained for LBDs of subunits from all three subclasses of iGluRs (5Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E.

Lobe D1 is formed from residues preceding the first transmembrane domain (M1) and the C-terminal residues of the extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4, whereas the N-terminal part of this loop forms lobe D2. LBD structures in complex with different ligands (10Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 11Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L.

Neuron. 2005; 47: 71-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) have shed light on the molecular mechanism of ligand binding and, in the absence of structural information on the transmembrane domain, have led to the formulation of hypotheses on how agonist binding may be coupled to channel gating. Agonists differ from antagonists in that they promote closure of the LBD clam shell through rotation of lobe D2 toward D1. In a largely mechanical model of receptor activation (11Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), this motion is thought to generate conformational strain within the tetrameric receptor complex that transduces to the membrane regions and, eventually, causes channel opening. Several studies in AMPA and kainate iGluRs (6Mayer M.L. Neuron. 2005; 45: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 7Nanao M.H. Green T. Stern-Bach Y. Heinemann S.F.

Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) relating structure to agonist efficacy show that the degree of domain closure induced by different agonists correlates with their functional activity. Interestingly, there is evidence that the glycine binding domain of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor does not exhibit a similar correlation between domain closure and agonist efficacy (8Furukawa H. Gouaux E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2873-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 12Inanobe A. Furukawa H. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2005; 47: 71-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recent structure-function data show that engineering sterical restrictions within the glutamate-binding pocket of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor is correlated to the degree of agonist efficacy (13Laube B. Schemm R. Betz H. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 994-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), implicating that the action of glutamate and glycine on the NR2 and NR1 subunits, respectively, may induce different structural mechanisms underlying agonist efficacy. However, although crystallographic data have uncovered the difference between agonist- and antagonist-bound LBD structures, kinetic studies are essential to elucidate the sequence and timing of conformational changes following agonist binding and their relationship to gating. Recently, one such study was performed for GluR2 AMPA receptors and has demonstrated that destabilizing the closed conformation of the binding domain through single amino acid mutations at the D1D2 interface reduces receptor open probability (14Robert A. Armstrong N. Gouaux J.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Kinetically, the results place LBD closure as an intermediate step of receptor activation between ligand binding and channel opening, with domain closure being a prerequisite for channel opening but kinetically separate from it. At the same time, domain closure also contributes to apparent ligand affinity, because only the open state of the binding domain is permissive for dissociation of the ligand. The kinetic scheme proposed by Robert et al. (14Robert A. Armstrong N. Gouaux J.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), however, is derived from the effects of mutations at only one position in the binding domain. It is, therefore, based on the assumption that binding domain closure is itself a concerted step that can be monitored accurately by looking at single positions along the D1D2 interface. Here, we provide a more systematic exploration of the contributions of interdomain contacts in an iGluR LBD to ligand binding and channel gating. To this end, we introduced mutations into the NR2A subunit of NMDA receptors, targeting several D1D2 interactions predicted to stabilize the closed conformation of the binding domain and determined the kinetics of ligand binding and channel opening of the resulting receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. Our study reveals differential kinetic effects of the mutations depending on their location in the binding domain, arguing for the existence of distinct kinetic steps in the conformational rearrangements necessary for binding domain closure. In Vitro Mutagenesis—Single amino acid mutations of the NR2A subunit were introduced into the pCis WT vector (15Gorman C.M. Gies D. McCray G. DNA Protein Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar) with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. All mutations were verified by partial DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated glass coverslips. After 24 h, cells were cotransfected with green fluorescent protein (in the pGreenLantern vector (Invitrogen)) and the NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2A (both in the pCis vector) using the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen) and a DNA ratio of 1:10:30 (green fluorescent protein/NR1/NR2A). Transfected cells were incubated in the presence of 2 μm 3-(2-carboxyethyl)-4,6-dichloro-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid and 200 μm to 1 mm d-2-aminophosphonovalerate (both from Tocris) for 24–48 h before electrophysiological recordings. Flash Photolysis and Whole Cell Recording—Flash photolysis was used for fast application of glutamate in whole cell recording experiments, with NI- and MNI-caged glutamate (from Sigma and Tocris, respectively) as photolabile precursors. Both compounds are suitable for studies on NMDA receptors (16Canepari M. Nelson L. Papageorgiou G. Corrie J.E. Ogden D. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2001; 112: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Maier W. Corrie J.E. Papageorgiou G. Laube B. Grewer C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 142: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with MNI-caged amino acids being characterized by higher photorelease efficiency compared with the NI-based precursors (18Papageorgiou G. Corrie J.E. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 8197-8205Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). MNI-caged glutamate, therefore, was used preferentially with low affinity mutant receptors. The setup for solution exchange and photorelease of NMDA receptor agonists was as described previously (17Maier W. Corrie J.E. Papageorgiou G. Laube B. Grewer C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 142: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, it consisted of a quartz tube (350-μm diameter) from which solutions emerged with a speed of 5–10 cm/s and a quartz fiber (365-μm diameter) positioned perpendicular to it that served as the laser light guide. For whole cell recordings, cells were lifted from the coverslip and positioned between solution outlet and optical fiber. This configuration allowed complete solution exchange around the cell within 100–200 ms and optional photorelease of l-glutamate from its caged precursors through a light flash (345 nm, 15 ns) from an excimer laser-pumped dye laser (Lambda Physik). The amount of ligand released in photolysis experiments was controlled by attenuating the laser light with neutral density filters. Typical light intensities applied to cells were in the range of 50–400 mJ/cm2. In this range, the concentration of released glutamate is a nearly linear function of light intensity, and absolute concentrations can be calculated after initial calibration as described (17Maier W. Corrie J.E. Papageorgiou G. Laube B. Grewer C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 142: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine EC50 values of WT and mutant NMDA receptors, dose-response curves of glutamate-induced currents were analyzed in independent experiments by a rapid solution exchange application system in the presence of 50 μm glycine as described previously (19Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All whole cell recordings were done at a holding potential of -60 mV in extracellular solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.85 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4. Recording pipettes had resistances of 1.5–3 megaohms and were filled with intracellular solution composed of 145 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4. Data were low pass-filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at a sampling rate of 12 kHz. Single Channel Recording—Single channel data for WT NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2A(N668D) receptors transiently expressed in HEK293 cells were obtained from patches in the inside-out configuration as described previously (19Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The membrane potential was clamped at -100 mV. The bath/internal solution in these experiments contained 141 mm potassium gluconate, 2.5 mm NaCl, 11 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4. The pipette/external solution contained 125 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 0.85 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES also at pH 7.4 and was supplemented with the agonists l-glutamate and glycine at concentrations of 100 nm and 20 μm, respectively. Data were filtered at 10 kHz, digitized at 48 kHz, and stored on digital audio tape (DTR 1204; Biologic, Claix, France). For analysis, data were replayed from tape and sampled at 10 kHz. Tables of channel opening and closing events were generated with the TAC software (Instrutech). Open and shut time distributions were calculated using the method of maximum likelihood and the pStat program of the pclamp 6.0 package (Axon Instruments). Data Analysis and Statistics—Photorelease of ligands from NI-caged precursors occurs on a time scale of microseconds or below (t½ ≈ 150 ns for an NI acetate model compound (20Morrison J. Wan P. Corrie J.E. Papageorgiou G. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2002; 1: 960-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)). This is orders of magnitude faster than activation kinetics with millisecond time constants reported for NMDA receptors (e.g. see Refs. 21Clements J.D. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1991; 7: 605-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar and 22Chen N. Luo T. Raymond L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6844-6854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the time course of currents in our flash photolysis experiments is independent of the rate of ligand release and instead reflects intrinsic receptor kinetics. To interpret the observed kinetics in terms of rate constants of distinct steps of the activation process, we used the kinetic model shown in Scheme 1. R+2L2kon⇌koffRL+Lkon⇌2koffRL2kop⇌kclRL2 (Eq. 1) Here, R denotes the receptor, and L denotes the ligand that is photoreleased during the course of the experiment. kon and koff are the rate constants for ligand binding and dissociation, and kop and kcl are those for channel opening and closing. The model takes into account that two molecules of glutamate have to bind to the NMDA receptor. It assumes that their binding sites are equal (i.e. that they can be occupied and freed in any order, and, for simplicity, that they are independent of each other (i.e. there is no cooperativity between them)). Because all flash photolysis experiments were done in the presence of saturating concentrations of the co-agonist glycine, steps for glycine binding could be omitted from the kinetic scheme, assuming that the glycine binding sites are always occupied, independent of the glutamate concentration. In order to determine kinetic properties of WT and mutant receptors, the model was translated into a Berkeley Madonna (Macey and Oster) equation file. The software was used to run a least squares fit procedure with a Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm and the four rate constants in the model as free parameters to give the best match between sets of experimentally observed currents at different ligand concentrations and theoretical currents predicted by the model. Theoretical currents were calculated for each iteration of the fitting routine with a numerical integration method (4th order Runge-Kutta, 100-μs time interval), using the current values of the rate constants. From the rate constants, the dissociation constant and open probability were calculated as KD = koff/kon and Po = kop/(kop + kcl). We used numerical integration of the differential equations, because analytical integration of the full set of differential equations by using preequilibrium simplification methods was not possible in this system. The reason for this was that the high affinity of the NMDA receptor for glutamate results in a small ligand dissociation rate constant, koff, which is in the same range as kop and kcl. Thus, it cannot be assumed that the ligand binding equilibrium is fast in comparison with the channel-opening equilibrium, a simplification that has been used in the past for analyzing the kinetics of other ligand-gated ion channels with lower affinities for the ligand (e.g. see Ref. 23Matsubara N. Hess G.P. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1992; 31: 5477-5487Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Desensitization was omitted from the simplified kinetic scheme used for determination of the channel opening rates. This simplification is justified, because desensitization in NMDA receptors is 100–1000-fold slower than channel activation, as shown in supplemental Table 1. Furthermore, the rate of desensitization is not significantly changed by the mutations studied here, except by T494N (2-fold larger desensitization time constant). Therefore, a maximum of 6% of receptors desensitize during the time window of the current activation used for analysis of the channel opening kinetics. Rate constants were determined, and KD and Po were calculated independently for each cell recorded from. Values are presented here as means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance with a Tukey-Kramer post-test was used to test for differences between rate constants of WT and mutant receptors after logarithmic transformation. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05, highly significant at p < 0.01, and extremely significant at p < 0.001. Molecular Modeling and Prediction of Effects of Mutations— Since this work was carried out before publication of the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of the NR2A subunit (9Furukawa H. Singh S.K. Mancusso R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 438: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), candidate residues for mutagenesis were chosen based on a modeled structure. This model of the NR2A LBD with bound l-glutamate was generated based on the published (10Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) crystal structure of the GluR2 binding domain (Protein Data Bank entry 1FTJ) using the Sybyl 6.9 software (Tripos Associates) with residue numbering as in Ref. 24Chen P.E. Geballe M.T. Stansfeld P.J. Johnston A.R. Yuan H. Jacob A.L. Snyder J.P. Traynelis S.F. Wyllie D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1470-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar. The modeling procedure was analogous to that described previously for the binding domain of NR2B (25Wittekindt B. Malany S. Schemm R. Otvos L. Maccecchini M.L. Laube B. Betz H. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Together with models of the NR2B binding domain with and without glutamate, this model was used to identify amino acid residues that may contribute to binding domain closure and that, therefore, represent candidate residues for mutagenesis and kinetic analysis of the resulting mutated receptors. Specifically, we were looking for residues that are involved in energetically favorable interactions between D1 and D2 across the binding cleft that are stronger in the ligand-bound than in the apo state. Such residues should help in stabilizing the closed conformation of the binding domain, and their mutation should change the equilibrium between the open and closed state of the binding domain. If binding domain closure is a prerequisite for channel gating, we hypothesized that a strong interaction between such residues might also change the equilibrium between the open and closed states of the ion channel. Although model-based, all of our predicted D1D2 interactions were later shown to be essentially correct with the advent of the crystal structure of the NR2A LBD (Protein Data Bank entry 2A5S). To evaluate the effects of mutations, model structures of some of the mutated binding domains were obtained from the NR2A WT model with bound glutamate by manual exchange of the respective residues and subsequent dynamization and minimization of the structures. Differing from Ref. 25Wittekindt B. Malany S. Schemm R. Otvos L. Maccecchini M.L. Laube B. Betz H. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, dynamization was run for 10,000 fs (with 1-fs intervals) at low simulated temperature (20 K, 20-fs coupling factor) on the core of the binding domain (defined by an 8-Å radius around Glu394, Lys465, Asn668, and Asp712 and including about a quarter of total atoms in the model). In this way, overall structure remained largely preserved, whereas regions around mutations were allowed to settle into relatively unstrained conformations. In addition, published interaction propensity values (26Williams G. Doherty P. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 153Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) were used to estimate the impact of mutations on the strength of the corresponding D1D2 interaction. These values are based on a set of 1073 known protein structures and a distance cut-off of 4.5 Å used to define an interaction. Interactions across the NR2A D1D2 Interface That Stabilize the Closed Conformation of the Binding Domain—From our NR2 binding domain models, we could identify two main regions in which agonist-induced D1D2 interactions are formed. These are located on opposite sides of the binding pocket, facing the ammonium group or the two carboxyl groups of the agonist, respectively. The first region comprises residues Glu394 and Thr494 in D1 (yellow balls 1 and 4 in Fig. 1A) and Tyr711 and Asp712 in D2 (gray balls) of NR2A. Residues that contribute to the domain interactions in the second region are Lys465 in D1 and Asn668 in D2 (yellow balls 2 and 5 in Fig. 1A). Our model and the now published crystal structure of the NR2A LBD agree in that they both suggest differential roles of the agonist in the formation of the interactions in these two regions. Domain interactions in the first region directly involve the bound agonist. The ammonium group of l-glutamate, for example, interacts with Thr494, which, in turn, forms a hydrogen bond with Asp712. Via a water molecule (present in the crystal structure), the agonist also interacts with Glu394, which itself contacts Tyr711. Thus, l-glutamate brings together the D1/D2 interaction partners Glu394/Tyr711 and Thr494/Asp712 in a complex network of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the agonist does not form direct contacts to any of the interacting residues in the second region. Two prominent interactions in this region are single hydrogen bonds between Lys465 in D1 and Asn668 in D2 (Fig. 1D) and between Lys465 and Glu672 (not shown). Glu672 is located within helix F of the binding domain, and Asn668 is located immediately N-terminal of it. This helix carries two residues, Ser670 and Thr671, that are critical for binding the carboxyl groups of l-glutamate (24Chen P.E. Geballe M.T. Stansfeld P.J. Johnston A.R. Yuan H. Jacob A.L. Snyder J.P. Traynelis S.F. Wyllie D.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1470-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and moves toward the agonist and the D1 lobe during domain closure. Thus, D1D2 contacts in this region are induced by the agonist indirectly by promoting the movement of helix F. To investigate the importance of D1D2 interactions for receptor activation, we decided to study the effects of mutations at positions 394, 494, 465, and 668, targeting the two interactions in region 1 described above and one of the interactions in region 2. A total of six mutations, E394A, T494N, K465N, K465E, N668K, and N668D, were chosen to selectively disrupt or enhance individual interdomain contacts expected to affect differentially the stability of the D1D2 interface. Especially, we wanted to examine (i) the contribution of the hydrogen bond between Lys465 and Asn668 by mutations K465E, N668D, K465N, and N668K to binding and to gating and (ii) the importance of Glu394 and Thr494 for hinge region interactions, which according to the model should interfere with the interaction network either strongly (E394A) or in a relatively mild way (T494N). Additionally, we characterized another mutation, H466A, that we predicted to impair ligand binding. The imidazole ring system of His466 provides a hydrophobic environment for the glutamate backbone, which should contribute significantly to stability of the ligand-receptor complex (Fig. 1D). For the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors, a role for the homologous histidine residue, His460, in ligand binding, but not in gating, is suggested by the finding that its mutation to alanine increases the EC50 of the resulting receptors for glutamate by more than 400-fold (13Laube B. Schemm R. Betz H. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 994-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but does not affect the efficacy of the partial agonist NMDA relative to l-glutamate (13Laube B. Schemm R. Betz H. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 994-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Kinetic Effects of the Mutations—For a first characterization of the NR2A mutants, we determined glutamate dose-response curves and calculated the respective EC50 values and Hill coefficients (nH) by using a conventional capillary application system. Of the seven substitutions introduced, six significantly affected the EC50 value of glutamate (supplemental Table 1). The respective Hill coefficients were in the range of 1.02–1.35 (i.e. not different from the value obtained with the WT protein) (nH = 1.27 ± 0.19; supplemental Table 1). Together these data corroborate earlier reports showing that mutations introduced at the D1D2 interface of iGluRs affect apparent glutamate affinity (13Laube B. Schemm R. Betz H. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 994-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Robert A. Armstrong N. Gouaux J.E. Howe J.R. J.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7650-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of the mutations on receptor activation, rate constants for glutamate binding and dissociation as well as for channel opening and closing of the mutant receptors were compared with the corresponding values of WT receptors. Using our whole cell approach and kinetic model of receptor activation, we found the following values for the WT parameters (n = 8 cells): kon = 5 × 107 ± 0.6 × 107 m-1 s-1, koff = 160 ± 30 s-1, kop = 380 ± 70 s-1, kcl = 250 ± 40 s-1. From these parameters, the open probability PO can be calculated as 0.59 ± 0.08, and the dissociation constant KD can be calculated as 3.3 ± 0.5 μm. These values and our relatively simple kinetic model are sufficient to describe adequately the lag and the rising phases of receptor currents induced by a range of agonist concentrations in our experiments (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2060962487,"Trophoblast fusion in placenta is an important event for preservation of a healthy pregnancy. This process takes place throughout the pregnancy and is crucial for the formation of syncytiotrophoblast layer. Syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 are strong candidate regulators of fusion from retroviral origin. Syncytin-A and syncytin-B are other candidates from retroviral origin in Muridae. The active role of syncytin in driving fusion of trophoblast has been identified, but its fusion mechanism is still unclear. As an intact retroviral envelope protein, syncytin-A shares similar structure profiling with other viral envelope fusion proteins, especially in the regions of N- and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR, respectively). In this paper, we showed that SynA 1 + 2 of syncytin-A (residues 445-536, including predicted NHR, CHR, and a natural linker) could form trimer and exhibited significant α-helix structure and high thermo-stability. Limited proteolysis result identified a stable protease-resistant core of SynA 1 + 2, which was in good agreement with computational modeling data. NHR and CHR could interact with each other <i>in vitro</i>, too. Different from the previous studies, the disulfide-bonded linker was apparently vital to the stability of fusion core structure. By biological assays, NHR was shown to be inhibitive to cell-cell fusion, with IC<sub>50</sub> value about 5.4 μm, but CHR seemed to have no inhibitory activity even at 50 μm. From both biochemical and functional data, we first gave an explanation how syncytin-A mediated cell fusion. The insight into the mechanism of syncytin-A-mediated cell-cell fusion may provide a crucial clue to placental cytotrophoblast morphogenesis."

Following interleukin (IL)-3 withdrawal in FL5.12 cells, Bax undergoes a conformational change that results in its mitochondria targeting, cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9, and apoptosis. Cells overexpressing Casp9DN (dominant negative caspase-9) or treated with the caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh increased viability but failed to increase clonogenic survival. We find that caspase-inhibited cells had a significant fraction of viable cells (herein termed rescued cells) that failed to initiate cell division after IL-3 add back. The rescued cells had reduced mitochondrial potential, stained for active Bax, and had reduced staining with dihydroethidium, an agent sensitive to superoxide levels. Readdition of IL-3 after deprivation demonstrated that Bax activation was reversed, whereas altered 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide and dihydroethidium staining persisted for days. Furthermore, the rescued cells were resistant to rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. The cells were highly sensitive to 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis and proposed anti-cancer agent. We conclude that the inhibition of caspase-9 allows cells to retain viability, but cells have prolonged mitochondrial dysfunction and enter a unique nondividing state that shares some properties with malignant cells."
