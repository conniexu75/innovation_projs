https://openalex.org/W2035252462,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a ligand for receptors that clear remnants of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins. Lack of apoE is, therefore, expected to cause accumulation in plasma of cholesterol-rich remnants whose prolonged circulation should be atherogenic. ApoE-deficient mice generated by gene targeting were used to test this hypothesis and to make a mouse model for spontaneous atherosclerosis. The mutant mice had five times normal plasma cholesterol, and developed foam cell-rich depositions in their proximal aortas by age 3 months. These spontaneous lesions progressed and caused severe occlusion of the coronary artery ostium by 8 months. The severe yet viable phenotype of the mutants should make them valuable for investigating genetic and environmental factors that modify the atherogenic process."
https://openalex.org/W1999876280,"The cellular transcription factor E2F, previously identified as a component of early adenovirus transcription, has now been shown to be important in cell proliferation control. E2F appears to be a functional target for the action of the tumor suppressor protein Rb that is encoded by the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene. The disruption of this E2F-Rb interaction, as well as a complex involving E2F in association with the cell cycle-regulated cyclin A-cdk2 kinase complex, may be a common mechanism of action for the oncoproteins encoded by the DNA tumor viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2073360590,"In CNS synapses, the synaptic junctional complex with associated postsynaptic density is presumed to contain proteins responsible for adhesion between pre- and postsynaptic membranes and for postsynaptic signal transduction. We have found that a prominent, brain-specific protein (PSD-95) enriched in the postsynaptic density fraction from rat brain is highly similar to the Drosophila lethal(1)discs-large-1 (dlg) tumor suppressor protein. The dlg protein is associated with septate junctions in developing flies and contains a guanylate kinase domain that is required for normal control of cell division. The sequence similarity between dlg and PSD-95 suggests that molecular mechanisms critical for growth control in developing organisms may also regulate synapse formation, stabilization, or function in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2046388858,"The mechanisms responsible for long-lasting, activity-dependent decreases in synaptic efficacy are not well understood. We have examined the initial steps required for the induction of long-term depression (LTD) in CA1 pyramidal cells by repetitive low frequency (1 Hz) synaptic stimulation. This form of LTD was synapse specific, was saturable, and required activation of post-synaptic NMDA receptors. Loading CA1 cells with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA prevented LTD, whereas lowering extracellular Ca2+ resulted in the induction of LTD by stimulation that previously elicited long-term potentiation. Following LTD, synaptic strength could be increased to its original maximal level, indicating that LTD is reversible and not due to deterioration of individual synapses. Induction of homosynaptic LTD therefore requires an NMDA receptor-dependent change in postsynaptic Ca2+ which may be distinct from that required for long-term potentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2101625991,"The subunit stoichiometry of the mammalian K+ channel KV1.1 (RCK1) was examined by linking together the coding sequences of 2-5 K+ channel subunits in a single open reading frame and tagging the expression of individual subunits with a mutation (Y379K or Y379R) that altered the sensitivity of the channel to block by external tetraethylammonium ion. Two lines of evidence argue that these constructs lead to K+ channel expression only through the formation of functional tetramers. First, currents expressed by tetrameric constructs containing a single mutant subunit have a sensitivity to tetraethylammonium that is well fitted by a single site binding isotherm. Second, a mutant subunit (Y379K) that expresses only as part of a heteromultimer contributes to the expression of functional channels when coexpressed with a trimeric construct but not a tetrameric construct."
https://openalex.org/W1992494265,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), are thought to act at an integration point for multiple biochemical signals because they are activated by a wide variety of extracellular signals, rapidly phosphorylated on threonine and tyrosine, and highly conserved. A critical protein kinase lies upstream of MAP kinase and stimulates the enzymatic activity of MAP kinase. The structure of this protein kinase, denoted MEK1, for MAP kinase or ERK kinase, was elucidated from a complementary DNA sequence and shown to be a protein of 393 amino acids (43,500 daltons) that is related most closely in size and sequence to the product encoded by the Schizosaccharomyces pombe byr1 gene. The MEK gene was highly expressed in murine brain, and the product expressed in bacteria phosphorylated the ERK gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1990543766,"Altered processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a central event in the formation of amyloid deposits in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. To investigate whether cellular APP processing is controlled by cell-surface neurotransmitter receptors, human embryonic kidney (293) cell lines were transfected with the genes for human brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Stimulation of m1 and m3 receptor subtypes with carbachol increased the basal release of APP derivatives within minutes of treatment, indicating that preexisting APP is released in response to receptor activation. Receptor-activated APP release was blocked by staurosporine, suggesting that protein kinases mediate neurotransmitter receptor-controlled APP processing."
https://openalex.org/W1990925999,"Murine D type cyclins associate with a catalytic subunit (p34PSK-J3) with properties distinct from known cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). Mouse p34PSK-J3 shows less than 50% amino acid identity to p34cdc2, p33cdk2, and p36cdk3, lacks a PSTAIRE motif, and does not bind to p13suc1. Cyclin D1-p34PSK-J3 complexes accumulate in macrophages during G1 and decline in S phase, whereas complexes involving cyclins D2 and D3 form in proliferating T cells. Although histone H1 kinase activity is not detected in cyclin D or PSK-J3 immunoprecipitates, cyclin D-p34PSK-J3 complexes assembled in vitro stably bind and phosphorylate the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) and an Rb-like protein (p107) but do not interact with pRb mutants that are functionally inactive. Thus, p34PSK-J3 is a cyclin D-regulated catalytic subunit that acts as an Rb (but not H1) kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2033356439,"Linkage analysis was used to search the genome for chromosomal regions harboring familial Alzheimer's disease genes. Markers on chromosome 14 gave highly significant positive lod scores in early-onset non-Volga German kindreds; a Zmax of 9.15 (theta = 0.01) was obtained with the marker D14S43 at 14q24.3. One early-onset family yielded a lod score of 4.89 (theta = 0.0). When no assumptions were made about age-dependent penetrance, significant results were still obtained (Zmax = 5.94, theta = 0.0), despite the loss of power to detect linkage under these conditions. Results for the Volga German families were either negative or nonsignificant for markers in this region. Thus, evidence indicates a familial Alzheimer's disease locus on chromosome 14."
https://openalex.org/W1976051330,"Since its invention a few years ago, the atomic force microscope has become one of the most widely used near-field microscopes. Surfaces of hard sample are imaged routinely with atomic resolution. Soft samples, however, remain challenging. An overview is presented on the application of atomic force microscopy to organic samples ranging from thin ordered films at molecular resolution to living cells. Fundamental mechanisms of the image formation are discussed, and novel imaging modes are introduced that exploit different aspects of the tip-sample interaction for local measurements of the micromechanical properties of the sample. As examples, images of Langmuir-Blodgett films, which map the local viscoelasticity as well as the friction coefficient, are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2000646975,"Approximately half of the neurons produced during embryogenesis normally die before adulthood. Although target-derived neurotrophic factors are known to be major determinants of programmed cell death—apoptosis—the molecular mechanisms by which trophic factors interfere with cell death regulation are largely unknown. Overexpression of the bcl-2 proto-oncogene in cultured sympathetic neurons has now been shown to prevent apoptosis normally induced by deprivation of nerve growth factor. This finding, together with the previous demonstration of bcl-2 expression in the nervous system, suggests that the Bcl-2 protein may be a major mediator of the effects of neurotrophic factors on neuronal survival."
https://openalex.org/W2069633077,"It is generally assumed for most species that mortality rates increase monotonically at advanced ages. Mortality rates were found to level off and decrease at older ages in a population of 1.2 million medflies maintained in cages of 7,200 and in a group of approximately 48,000 adults maintained in solitary confinement. Thus, life expectancy in older individuals increased rather than decreased with age. These results cast doubt on several central concepts in gerontology and the biology of aging: (i) that senescence can be characterized by an increase in age-specific mortality, (ii) that the basic pattern of mortality in nearly all species follows the same unitary pattern at older ages, and (iii) that species have absolute life-span limits."
https://openalex.org/W2065655440,"A Monte Carlo quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM-MM) simulation method was used to determine the contributions of the solvent polarization effect to the total interaction energies between solute and solvent for amino acid side chains and nucleotide bases in aqueous solution. In the present AM1-TIP3P approach, the solute molecule is characterized by valence electrons and nucleus cores with Hartree-Fock theory incorporating explicit solvent effects into the total Hamiltonian, while the solvent is approximated by the three-point charge TIP3P model. The polarization energy contributes 10 to 20 percent of the total electrostatic energy in these systems. The performance of the hybrid AM1-TIP3P model was further validated by consideration of bimolecular complexes with water and by computation of the free energies of solvation of organic molecules using statistical perturbation theory. Excellent agreement with ab initio 6-31G(d) results and experimental solvation free energies was obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2056302193,"Two types of calcium (Ca2+) signaling-propagating intercellular Ca2+ waves of increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and nonpropagating oscillations in [Ca2+]i-co-exist in a variety of cell types. To investigate this difference in Ca2+ signaling, airway epithelial cells were loaded with heparin, an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor antagonist, by pulsed, high-frequency electroporation. Heparin inhibited propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves but not oscillations of [Ca2+]i. In heparin-free cells, Ca2+ waves propagated through cells displaying [Ca2+]i oscillations. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools with the Ca2+-pump inhibitor thapsigargin also inhibited the propagation of Ca2+ waves. These studies demonstrate that the release of Ca2+ by IP3 is necessary for the propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves and suggest that IP3 moves through gap junctions to communicate intercellular Ca2+ waves."
https://openalex.org/W2036337207,"During early development of the mammalian cerebral cortex, young neurons migrate outward from the site of their final mitosis in the ventricular zone into the cortical plate, where they form the adult cortex. Time-lapse confocal microscopy was used to observe directly the dynamic behaviors of migrating cells in living slices of developing cortex. The majority of cells migrated along a radial pathway, consistent with the view that cortical neurons migrate along radial glial fibers. A fraction of cells, however, turned within the intermediate zone and migrated orthogonal to the radial fibers. This orthogonal migration may contribute to the tangential dispersion of clonally related cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2058095641,"We inserted into the germline of mice either a mutant or wild-type allele from a patient with retinitis pigmentosa and a missense mutation (P23H) in the rhodopsin gene. All three lines of transgenic mice with the mutant allele developed photoreceptor degeneration; the one with the least severe retinal photoreceptor degeneration had the lowest transgene expression, which was one-sixth the level of endogenous murine rod opsin. Of two lines of mice with the wild-type allele, one expressed approximately equal amounts of transgenic and murine opsin and maintained normal retinal function and structure. The other expressed approximately 5 times more transgenic than murine opsin and developed a retinal degeneration similar to that found in mice carrying a mutant allele, presumably due to the overexpression of this protein. Our findings help to establish the pathogenicity of mutant human P23H rod opsin and suggest that overexpression of wild-type human rod opsin leads to a remarkably similar photoreceptor degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2006369305,"Experimental systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation can be used to address fundamental questions about genetic and nongenetic determinants of longevity. Analysis of large cohorts of ten genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster raised under conditions that favored extended survival has revealed variation between genotypes in both the slope and location of age-specific mortality curves. More detailed examination of a single genotype showed that the mortality trajectory was best fit by a two-stage Gompertz model, with no age-specific increase in mortality rates beyond 30 days after emergence. These results are contrary to the limited life-span paradigm, which postulates well-defined, genotype-specific limits on life-span and brief periods of intense and rapidly accelerating mortality rates at the oldest age."
https://openalex.org/W2053111401,"The C-terminal half of the p105 precursor of the NF-kappa B p50 subunit contains ankyrin-like repeats similar to those in I kappa B molecules, which are known to retain NF-kappa B complexes in the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that in various cell lines p105 is found associated with either c-rel or p65 in the cytoplasm and serves I kappa B-like functions. p105 retains c-rel or p65 in the cytoplasm in cotransfection experiments in COS cells. It also inhibits DNA binding by c-rel in gel retardation assays. Stable interaction of p105 with c-rel or p65 requires the putative dimerization domain in the conserved rel homology region of p105, as well as a second contact with the I kappa B-related C-terminal part of p105. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that cytoplasmic complexes of p105 with c-rel or p65 give rise to cytoplasmic as well as nuclear p50-c-rel and p50-p65, respectively, probably through processing of p105. Thus, p105, like the I kappa Bs, controls the subcellular localization and hence the transcriptional activity of at least two other members of the rel/NF-kappa B family."
https://openalex.org/W2128957878,"Observation of filamentous actin (F-actin) in living cells is currently limited to the resolution of the light microscope. Higher resolution procedures require sample fixation and preclude dynamic studies. The atomic force microscope (AFM) can image and manipulate samples at very high, sometimes atomic resolution by scanning a fine tip over the surface of interest and detecting physical interactions between the tip and sample. This study demonstrates that F-actin can be readily resolved in living cells with the AFM and that the dynamic properties of F-actin are easily observed."
https://openalex.org/W2050247865,A detailed experimental study of the water trimer is reported. A vibration-rotation-tunneling band of the perdeuterated cluster has been measured near 89.6 wavenumbers by tunable far infrared laser absorption spectroscopy. The data indicate a chiral six-membered ring structure with rapid quantum tunneling occurring between the enantiomers. The observed vibration involves torsional motion of the water subunits about each hydrogen bond axis. It is speculated that larger water clusters would also exhibit transient chirality and that similar effects may be found in liquid water.
https://openalex.org/W2024172421,"Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be repaired by gene conversions or by deletions resulting from single-strand annealing between direct repeats of homologous sequences. Although rad1 mutants are resistant to x-rays and can complete DSB-mediated mating-type switching, they could not complete recombination when the ends of the break contained approximately 60 base pairs of nonhomology. Recombination was restored when the ends of the break were made homologous to donor sequences. Additionally, the absence of RAD1 led to the frequent appearance of a previously unobserved type of recombination product. These data suggest RAD1 is required to remove nonhomologous DNA from the 3′ ends of recombining DNA, a process analogous to the excision of photodimers during repair of ultraviolet-damaged DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2031853229,"Anterior-posterior polarity of the Drosophila embryo is initiated during oogenesis through differential maternal RNA localization. The RNA of the anterior morphogen bicoid is localized to the anterior pole of the embryo, where bicoid protein controls head and thorax development. The RNA of the posterior morphogen nanos is localized to the posterior pole, where nanos protein is required for abdomen formation. Here we show that the nanos 3′ untranslated region, like that of the bicoid RNA, is sufficient for RNA localization. We have used the bicoid RNA localization signal to mislocalize nanos, producing embryos with two sources of nanos protein. Such embryos form two abdomens with mirror image symmetry. Embryos with nanos RNA localized only to the anterior have greater nanos gene activity than embryos with nanos RNA localized posteriorly. We propose a role for RNA localization in regulating nanos activity."
https://openalex.org/W1979455742,"Precursor messenger RNA splicing requires multiple factors including U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 small nuclear RNA′s. The crosslinking reagent psoralen was used to analyze the interactions of these RNA′s with an adenovirus precursor messenger RNA in HeLa nuclear extract. An endogenous U2-U4-U6 crosslinkable complex dissociated upon incubation with precursor messenger RNA. During splicing, U1, U2, U5, and U6 became crosslinked to precursor messenger RNA and U2, U5, and U6 became crosslinked to excised lariat intron. U2 also formed a doubly crosslinked complex with U6 and precursor messenger RNA. The U1, U5, and U6 crosslinks to the precursor messenger RNA mapped to intron sequences near the 5′ splice site, whereas the U2 crosslink mapped to the branch site. The kinetics of crosslink formation and disappearance delineates a temporal pathway for the action of small RNA′s in the spliceosome. Potential base pairing interactions between conserved sequences in the small nuclear RNA′s and precursor messenger RNA at the sites of crosslinking suggest that the 5′ splice site is defined in several steps prior to the first cleavage event."
https://openalex.org/W1994912172,"Monoclonal antibody 6F8 was used to characterize and clone fasciclin IV, a new axonal glycoprotein in the grasshopper, and to study its function during growth cone guidance. Fasciclin IV is dynamically expressed on a subset of axon pathways in the developing CNS and on circumferential bands of epithelial cells in developing limb buds. One of these bands corresponds to the location where the growth cones of the Ti1 pioneer neurons make a characteristic turn while extending toward the CNS. Embryos cultured in the 6F8 antibody or Fab exhibit aberrant formation of this axon pathway. cDNA sequence analysis suggests that fasciclin IV has a signal sequence; long extracellular, transmembrane, and short cytoplasmic domains; and shows no homology with any protein in the available data bases. Thus, fasciclin IV appears to be a novel integral membrane protein that functions in growth cone guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2105946796,"H-NS is an abundant structural component of bacterial chromatin and influences many cellular processes, including recombination, transposition, and transcription. We have studied the mechanism of action of H-NS at the osmotically regulated proU promoter. The interaction of H-NS with a curved DNA element located downstream of the proU promoter is required for normal regulation of expression. Heterologous curved sequences can replace the regulatory role of the proU curve. Hence, the luxAB and lacZ reporter genes, which differ in the presence or absence of a curve, can indicate very different patterns of transcription. H-NS interacts preferentially with these curved DNA elements in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo the interaction of H-NS with curved DNA participates in the control of plasmid linking number. The data suggest that H-NS-dependent changes in DNA topology play a role in the osmoregulation of proU expression."
https://openalex.org/W2083888914,"Described here are neural networks capable of predicting a drug's mechanism of action from its pattern of activity against a panel of 60 malignant cell lines in the National Cancer Institute's drug screening program. Given six possible classes of mechanism, the network misses the correct category for only 12 out of 141 agents (8.5 percent), whereas linear discriminant analysis, a standard statistical technique, misses 20 out of 141 (14.2 percent). The success of the neural net indicates several things. (i) The cell line response patterns are rich in information about mechanism. (ii) Appropriately designed neural networks can make effective use of that information. (iii) Trained networks can be used to classify prospectively the more than 10,000 agents per year tested by the screening program. Related networks, in combination with classical statistical tools, will help in a variety of ways to move new anticancer agents through the pipeline from in vitro studies to clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W1966631359,"The crystal structure of the DNA repair enzyme endonuclease III, which recognizes and cleaves DNA at damaged bases, has been solved to 2.0 angstrom resolution with an R factor of 0.185. This iron-sulfur [4Fe-4S] enzyme is elongated and bilobal with a deep cleft separating two similarly sized domains: a novel, sequence-continuous, six-helix domain (residues 22 to 132) and a Greek-key, four-helix domain formed by the amino-terminal and three carboxyl-terminal helices (residues 1 to 21 and 133 to 211) together with the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The cluster is bound entirely within the carboxyl-terminal loop with a ligation pattern (Cys-X6-Cys-X2-Cys-X5-Cys) distinct from all other known [4Fe-4S] proteins. Sequence conservation and the positive electrostatic potential of conserved regions identify a surface suitable for binding duplex B-DNA across the long axis of the enzyme, matching a 46 angstrom length of protected DNA. The primary role of the [4Fe-4S] cluster appears to involve positioning conserved basic residues for interaction with the DNA phosphate backbone. The crystallographically identified inhibitor binding region, which recognizes the damaged base thymine glycol, is a seven-residue beta-hairpin (residues 113 to 119). Location and side chain orientation at the base of the inhibitor binding site implicate Glu112 in the N-glycosylase mechanism and Lys120 in the beta-elimination mechanism. Overall, the structure reveals an unusual fold and a new biological function for [4Fe-4S] clusters and provides a structural basis for studying recognition of damaged DNA and the N-glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic-lyase mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1975817822,"Replication forks, moving opposite to the direction of transcription, are arrested at the 3' ends of the 35S transcription units in the rDNA locus of S. cerevisiae. Because of its position and polarity, we tested the hypothesis that this replication fork barrier (RFB) results from the act of transcription. Three results contradict this hypothesis. First, the RFB persists in a strain containing a disruption of the gene for the 135 kd subunit of RNA polymerase I. Second, the RFB causes a polar arrest of replication forks when transplanted to a plasmid. Third, transcription by RNA polymerase II of a plasmid copy of the 35S transcription unit lacking the RFB does not generate a barrier. We propose that replication forks are arrested in a directional manner through the binding of one or more proteins to two closely spaced sites in the RFB."
https://openalex.org/W2017860616,"A novel B cell-restricted activity, required for high levels of octamer/Oct-dependent transcription from an immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) promoter, was detected in an in vitro system consisting of HeLa cell-derived extracts complemented with fractionated B cell nuclear proteins. The factor responsible for this activity was designated Oct coactivator from B cells (OCA-B). OCA-B stimulates the transcription from an IgH promoter in conjunction with either Oct-1 or Oct-2 but shows no significant effect on the octamer/Oct-dependent transcription of the ubiquitously expressed histone H2B promoter and the transcription of USF- and Sp1-regulated promoters. Taken together, our results suggest that OCA-B is a tissue-, promoter-, and factor-specific coactivator and that OCA-B may be a major determinant for B cell-specific activation of immunoglobulin promoters. In light of the evidence showing physical and functional interactions between Oct factors and OCA-B, we propose a mechanism of action for OCA-B and discuss the implications of OCA-B for the transcriptional regulation of other tissue-specific promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2040005689,"Advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) form spontaneously from glucose-derived Amadori products and accumulate on long-lived tissue proteins. AGEs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several of the complications of aging and diabetes, including atherosclerosis and renal disease. With the use of recently developed AGE-specific antibodies, an AGE-modified form of human hemoglobin has been identified. Termed hemoglobin-AGE (Hb-AGE), this modified species accounts for 0.42 percent of circulating hemoglobin in normal individuals but increases to 0.75 percent in patients with diabetes-induced hyperglycemia. In a group of diabetic patients treated with the advanced glycosylation inhibitor aminoguanidine, Hb-AGE levels decreased significantly over a 1-month period. Hemoglobin-AGE measurements may provide an index of long-term tissue modification by AGEs and prove useful in assessing the contribution of advanced glycosylation to a variety of diabetic and age-related complications."
https://openalex.org/W2059931536,"The noncytotoxic rat mast cell tumor line RBL was transfected with genes for the cytotoxic lymphocyte granule proteins cytolysin (perforin) and granzyme A, giving transfectants with mRNA and protein expression levels comparable with cloned cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Both RBL-cytolysin and RBL-cytolysin-granzyme A transfectants showed extremely potent killing of red cell targets and lysed 20%-60% of EL4 lymphoma targets at an effector-to-target ratio of 30. RBL transfectants expressing only granzyme A were not cytotoxic. Significant EL4 DNA breakdown accompanying lysis was observed only with RBL that was transfected with both cytolysin and granzyme A. These results support the granule-exocytosis model for lymphocyte cytotoxicity and show that effector granzyme A plays a role in target cell DNA breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W2075809176,"Deoxyspergualin (DSG) is a potent immunosuppressant whose mechanism of action remains unknown. To elucidate its mechanism of action, an intracellular DSG binding protein was identified. DSG has now been shown to bind specifically to Hsc70, the constitutive or cognate member of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) protein family. The members of the Hsp70 family of heat shock proteins are important for many cellular processes, including immune responses, and this finding suggests that heat shock proteins may represent a class of immunosuppressant binding proteins, or immunophilins, distinct from the previously identified cis-trans proline isomerases. DSG may provide a tool for understanding the function of heat shock proteins in immunological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1985956159,"SV40 T antigen (Tag) expression directed to cerebellar Purkinje cells resulted in the generation of three transgenic mouse lines that displayed ataxia, a neurological phenotype characteristic of cerebellar dysfunction. Onset of symptoms and cerebellar pathology, characterized by specific Purkinje cell degeneration, appeared to be directly dependent upon transgene copy number. The SV5 line (containing > 30 transgene copies), exhibited embryonic transgene expression that caused selective death of immature Purkinje cells and a subsequent block in cerebellar development and ataxia at 2 weeks. The developmental effect of the disruption of Purkinje cells in SV5 mice suggests that a normal complement of these cells is required for early development of the cerebellar cortex, especially granule cell proliferation and migration from external to internal layers. Transgene expression in a second line, SV4 (10 copies), was detectable during the second postnatal week. Death of mature Purkinje cells in the SV4 line resulted in onset of ataxia at 9 weeks. Ataxia in a third line, SV6 (2 copies), was detected after 15 weeks. The distinct cerebellar phenotypes of the SV4-6 lines correlate with specific Tag-induced Purkinje cell ablation as opposed to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2017921325,"Unequal homologous recombination events between green and red cone pigment genes produce the red-green or green-red hybrid pigment genes found in many individuals with variant color vision. Photobleaching difference absorption spectroscopy of hybrid pigments produced in cultured cells shows that the spectral sensitivity of each hybrid pigment is intermediate between the parental green and red pigment sensitivities. Amino acids encoded by exons 2, 3, 4, and 5 produce spectral shifts at the wavelength of maximal absorbance of 0 to 4, 0 to 4, 3 to 4, and 15 to 21 nanometers, respectively, the exact value depending on the identities of amino acids elsewhere in the hybrid."

https://openalex.org/W1969795354,"The ferric enterobactin receptor (FepA) is a high-affinity ligand-specific transport protein in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Deletion of the cell-surface ligand-binding peptides of FepA generated mutant proteins that were incapable of high-affinity uptake but that instead formed nonspecific, passive channels in the outer membrane. Unlike native FepA, these pores acted independently of the accessory protein TonB, which suggests that FepA is a gated porin and that TonB acts as its gatekeeper by facilitating the entry of ligands into the FepA channel. The sequence homology among TonB-dependent proteins suggests that all ligand-specific outer membrane receptors may function by this gated-porin mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2098195130,"The TDS4 gene of S. cerevisiae was isolated as an allele-specific high copy suppressor of mutations within the basic region of the TATA-binding protein (TBP). The gene is essential for viability and encodes a 596 aa protein. The first 300 aa of the TDS4 protein exhibit significant sequence similarity to the RNA polymerase II transcription factor TFIIB. However, TDS4 is required for RNA polymerase III transcription in vivo and in vitro. Antibodies specific for TDS4 or TBP react with the TFIIIB complex, indicating that both proteins are components of the RNA polymerase III initiation complex. These findings suggest that the RNA polymerase II and III initiation mechanisms are extremely similar, and they explain how the TATA-binding protein can function in both systems."
https://openalex.org/W1981704287,"Many neural systems behave as arrays of coupled oscillators, with characteristic phase coupling. For example, the rhythmic activation patterns giving rise to swimming in fish are characterized by a rostral-to-caudal phase delay in ventral root activity that is independent of the cycle duration. This produces a traveling wave of curvature along the body of the animal with a wavelength approximately equal to the body length. Here a simple mechanism for phase coupling in chains of equally activated oscillators is postulated: the synapses between the cells making up a ""unit oscillator"" are simply repeated in neighboring segments, with a reduced synaptic strength. If such coupling is asymmetric in the rostral and caudal directions, traveling waves of activity are produced. The intersegmental phase lag that develops is independent of the coupling strength over at least a tenfold range. Furthermore, for the unit oscillator believed to underlie central pattern generation in the lamprey spinal cord, such coupling can result in a phase lag that is independent of frequency."
https://openalex.org/W2013822929,"The development of high brightness and short pulse width (< 200 picoseconds) x-ray lasers now offers biologists the possibility of high-resolution imaging of specimens in an aqueous environment without the blurring effects associated with natural motions and chemical erosion. As a step toward developing the capabilities of this type of x-ray microscopy, a tantalum x-ray laser at 44.83 angstrom wavelength was used together with an x-ray zone plate lens to image both unlabeled and selectively gold-labeled dried rat sperm nuclei. The observed images show ∼500 angstrom features, illustrate the importance of x-ray microscopy in determining chemical composition, and provide information about the uniformity of sperm chromatin organization and the extent of sperm chromatin hydration."
https://openalex.org/W2001170107,"In the energy transduction of muscle contraction, it is important to know the nature and extent of conformational changes of the head portion of the myosin molecules. In the presence of magnesium adenosine triphosphate (MgATP), fairly large conformational changes of the myosin head [subfragment-1 (S1)] in solution were observed by small-angle x-ray scattering with the use of synchrotron radiation as an intense and stable x-ray source. The presence of MgATP reduced the radius of gyration of the molecule by about 3 angstrom units and the maximum chord length by about 10 angstroms, showing that the shape of S1 becomes more compact or round during hydrolysis of MgATP. Comparison with various nucleotide-bound S1 complexes that correspond to the known intermediate states during ATP hydrolysis indicates that the shape of S1 in a key intermediate state, S1-bound adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate [S1**.ADP.P(i)], differs significantly from the shape in the other intermediate states of the S1 adenosine triphosphatase cycle as well as that of nucleotide-free S1."
https://openalex.org/W2067935776,"Using an enhancer detection screen, we have identified castor, a new gene required for embryonic CNS development in Drosophila. Embryos that lack castor expression have a diminished CNS axonal network and express engrailed aberrantly late in CNS development. castor is unique among the previously described genes involved in Drosophila neurogenesis in that its expression is restricted to a subset of delaminated CNS neuroblasts and to ventral midline glial precursor cells. The putative castor gene product contains a novel zinc-binding domain and multiple transcriptional activation domains, suggesting that it acts as a transcription factor necessary for the development of a subset of CNS neuronal precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1998146679,"Notch locus EGF-like element mutations spl, altering eye development, and AxE2, affecting wing and sensilla development, are modified by mutations at Delta. It is shown that two allele-specific suppressors of spl involve single amino acid substitutions in the 4th (DIsup5) and 9th (DIsup4 EGF-like elements of the Delta protein. Cultured cells producing spl or AxE2 aggregate with cells producing wild-type Delta or DIsup5 protein, and DIsup5-producing cells adhere to cells producing wild-type Notch protein. However, spl, AxE2, and DIsup5 are each defective in promoting these cell affinities, as none of the mutant proteins can compete with the corresponding wild-type proteins for formation of cell aggregates. Thus, widely separated EGF-like elements of Notch and Delta appear to participate in functional molecular interactions between the proteins. DIsup5 does not improve adhesiveness of spl in vitro, so suppression in vivo may involve altered developmental signaling by spl-DIsup5 complexes, rather than modified cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2084064912,"Peptidic renin inhibitors have been poorly absorbed across the intestine or rapidly eliminated by the liver and have been reported to have oral bioavailabilities of less than 2%. A peptide-based renin inhibitor, A-72517 (molecular mass of 706 daltons), was devised that has oral bioavailabilities of 8, 24, 32, and 53% in the monkey, rat, ferret, and dog, respectively. Dose-related reductions in blood pressure, plasma renin activity, and plasma angiotensin II in parallel with increased plasma drug concentrations were observed after oral administration of A-72517 to conscious, salt-depleted dogs. Thus, peptide-based molecules of sizable molecular mass can be absorbed intact into the systemic circulation of animals. These findings support the potential of peptide-based drugs for oral administration."
https://openalex.org/W2015378446,"We show that rat retinal ganglion cell axons exhibit no topographic specificity in growth along the rostral-caudal axis of the embryonic superior colliculus (SC). Position-related, morphological differences are not found between temporal and nasal axon growth cones. However, embryonic retinal axons respond in vitro to a position-dependent molecular property of SC membranes. In vivo, regional specificity in side branching is the earliest indication that axons make topographic distinctions along the rostral-caudal SC axis. Our contrasting in vivo and in vitro results indicate that molecules encoding rostral-caudal position in the SC neither guide nor restrict retinal axon growth, but may promote the development of topographic connections by controlling specificity in the extension or stabilization of branches."
https://openalex.org/W2025463284,"We stained synaptic vesicles in frog motor nerve terminals with FM1-43 and studied changes in the shape and position of vesicle clusters during nerve stimulation. Each stained vesicle cluster appeared as a fluorescent spot. During repetitive nerve stimulation the spots gradually dimmed, most without changing shape or position. Occasionally, however, a spot moved, appearing in some cases to stream toward and coalesce with a neighboring spot. This suggests the existence of translocation mechanisms that can actively move vesicles in a coordinated fashion between vesicle clusters. Within single clusters, we saw no signs of such directed vesicle movements. Fluorescent spots in terminals viewed from the side with a confocal microscope did not shrink toward the presynaptic membrane during nerve stimulation, but dimmed uniformly. This suggests that vesicles continuously mix within a cluster during destaining and provides no evidence of active vesicle translocators within single vesicle clusters for moving vesicles to the presynaptic membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2007591831,"The identities of the DNA polymerases required for conversion of single-strand (ss) M13 DNA to double-strand (ds) M13 DNA were examined both in injected Xenopus laevis oocytes and in an oocyte nuclear extract. Inhibitors and antibodies specific to DNA polymerases alpha and beta were used. In nuclear extracts, inhibition by the antibody to polymerase beta could be reversed by purified polymerase beta. The polymerase beta inhibitors, dideoxythymidine triphosphate (ddTTP) and dideoxycytidine triphosphate (ddCTP), also blocked DNA synthesis and indicated that polymerase beta is involved in the conversion of ssDNA to dsDNA. These results also may have particular significance for emerging evidence of an ssDNA replication mode in eukaryotic cells."
