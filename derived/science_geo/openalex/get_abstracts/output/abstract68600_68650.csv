https://openalex.org/W1516397282,"The degradation of glucocorticoid-induced tyrosine amino-transferase and of general cellular proteins in hepatoma (HTC) cells in culture is by the deprivation of both amino acids and of serum, and by lowering the pH of the medium. This enhanced degradation, but not the normal degradation, is inhibited by inhibitors of protein synthesis. Sodium fluoride and other inhibitors of cellular ATP production profoundly inhibit the degradation of tyrosine aminotransferase and other proteins. This effect was shown, in the case of tyrosine aminotransferase, to be rapidly reversible and exerted by a mechanism different from the inhibition of protein synthesis. It is proposed that ATP participates in an early phase of enzyme degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1568500493,"Abstract A secondary administration of estradiol-17β to chicks augments the incorporation of 3H-uridine and 3H-lysine into oviduct magnum RNA and protein, respectively. The incorporation of isotopes into ovalbumin, the major protein synthesized by this tissue, is enhanced to a greater extent than into total protein. There is a concomitant organization of monosomes into polysomes during the first 9 hours of secondary stimulation. Actinomycin D, at a dose of 5 mg per kg, blocks the estrogen-mediated increase in isotope incorporation into RNA, total protein, and ovalbumin. At a slightly lower dose of actinomycin D, 2 mg per kg, the induction of protein synthesis, including ovalbumin, is almost normal, although the incorporation of 3H-uridine into bulk RNA is inhibited to nearly the same extent as at the higher dose. Isotope incorporation into ribosomal RNA appears to be selectively inhibited. This result agrees with earlier findings which suggested that rRNA synthesis is not required for the induction of ovalbumin synthesis during early secondary stimulation. Although we have tried several hormonal combinations and chick sera, we have been unable to induce ovalbumin synthesis in explants of the oviduct magnum in tissue culture. Once ovalbumin synthesis has been induced in vivo, however, ovalbumin continues to be synthesized in tissue culture. The electrophoretic pattern on sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gels of soluble proteins synthesized in vivo and in culture are the same. Thus, the tissue culture technique can be used confidently to measure the synthesis of specific proteins. Protein synthesis was investigated in both short (20 min) and long term (30 hour) cultures. Kinetic studies of protein synthesis during short incubations suggest that ovalbumin is synthesized and released from polysomes at the same rate as the average oviduct protein. Insulin is necessary in long term cultures to maintain the incorporation of isotopes into protein; it has no differential effect on ovalbumin synthesis. During a 30-hour culture period, the rate of ovalbumin synthesis declines relative to total soluble protein synthesis, with a half-life of about 14 hours. The addition of actinomycin D inhibits 3H-uridine incorporation into RNA by 95%, but has little effect on ovalbumin synthesis; however, the synthesis of nonsecretory proteins is inhibited (half-life = 7 hours). The secretory proteins, ovalbumin and conalbumin, become a larger proportion of the proteins synthesized after actinomycin D treatment. We conclude that ovalbumin messenger RNA (or some factor which regulates ovalbumin synthesis) is not synthesized in explants in tissue culture, but it has a longer intrinsic half-life than bulk mRNA (or factors). The details of the immunoprecipitation methods employed to detect and measure ovalbumin synthesis are presented. The sodium dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel electrophoretic technique used to verify the specific precipitation of ovalbumin has general applicability for proving the specificity of immunoprecipitation of antigens from radioactive homogenates."

https://openalex.org/W2145412799,"A special proteolipid (a hydrophobic protein) has been extracted and purified from nerve-ending membranes and total particulate matter of gray areas of the central nervous system. Such a proteolipid shows a high affinity for binding d-tubocurarine, serotonin, and atropine and has been called receptor proteolipid. The interaction of this proteolipid with atropine sulfate was studied with light scattering and polarization of fluorescence. The changes observed, which follow a cooperative type of curve, were attributed to the aggregation of the proteolipid macromolecules. Such a phenomenon was then observed under the electron microscope. A receptor proteolipid having a high affinity for binding acetylcholine, hexamethonium, and other cholinergic drugs was isolated and purified from electric tissue of fishes and from electroplax membranes. Such a proteolipid was also extracted from membranes from which acetylcholinesterase had been removed, and it was concluded that this enzyme and the receptor proteolipid are two different macromolecules. A high affinity binding site with a dissociation constant of K1 equal to 10(-7) and about ten sites with K2 equal to 10(-5) were recognized in the receptor proteolipid. Under the electron microscope the receptor proteolipid of brain appears as a rod-shaped macromolecule which may assume paracrystalline arrays with 10(-8) molar atropine sulfate. Similarly the receptor proteolipid from electric tissue and from skeletal muscle may form paracrystalline arrays under the action of acetylcholine and hexamethonium. A model of the cholinergic receptor based on the properties of the proteolipid is presented. Preliminary work indicates the possibility of obtaining a biophysical response to acetylcholine when the receptor proteolipid is embedded in artificial bilayered lipid membrance."
https://openalex.org/W1638893987,"The nuclear membrane from rat hepatocytes has been examined for components of the DPNH and TPNH electron transport chains as well as two drug-metabolizing enzymes, benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase and an aminoazo dye N-demethylase, in control and phenobarbital-treated animals. The enzyme induction phenomenon characteristic of the microsomes was not observed with the nuclear membrane for any of the enzymes or pigments studied. The nuclear electron transport enzyme DPNH-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome b5 were found to follow the same pattern as their microsomal counterparts. Thus, in each case, the reductase level was depressed in the treated animals while the cytochrome b5 level was not significantly altered. In control animals, the specific activity of TPNH-cytochrome c reductase in the nuclear membrane was approximately one-third that found for the same enzyme associated with the microsomes. The specific activity of this enzyme remained unchanged after phenobarbital was administered. The occurrence of cytochrome P-450 in the nuclear membrane was variable. No cytochrome P-450 was demonstrable in membranes from phenobarbital-treated animals, but low levels were detected in three out of 10 individual control preparations. Measurable amounts of aryl hydroxylase and N-demethylase were found in the nuclear membrane which corresponded to 7 and 11% of the specific activity obtained for the same enzymes in the microsomal membrane, respectively. Failure of these enzymes to be induced suggests that they are not of microsomal origin. Clearly, the differential response of the nuclear and microsomal membranes to phenobarbital indicates that quite distinct regulatory mechanisms must be operative for the two membranes with respect to the metabolic control of TPNH-cytochrome c reductase and the drug-metabolizing enzymes."

Perinatal undernutrition also suppressed the accumulation of brain dopamine. Paradoxically, the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase, the enzyme thought to be rate-limiting in catecholamine biosynthesis, was significantly increased in brains from undernourished animals."
https://openalex.org/W1504103470,"In the presence of urea and molecular oxygen, spinach ferredoxin is rapidly denatured. The product of this reaction contains substantial amounts of sulfur in the oxidation state of zero covalently bound to the protein. The origin of the sulfur-zero was shown to be the labile sulfide of the native protein. The S(0) could be released from the protein as S2- with a strong reducing agent such as dithiothreitol or as S(0) with cyanide or sulfite anions. Sedimentation analysis showed the protein to be polymeric, existing as a dimer. Ferricyanide could replace oxygen as a source of oxidizing equivalents. With this oxidant the stoichiometry of the reaction was found to be 9 moles per mole of ferredoxin. This has been explained by the oxidation of 5 RSH to 5/2 RSSR and 2 S2- to 2 S(0). It is proposed that the S(0) is bound to the protein as a trisulfide (RSSSR). The ferricyanide titer of a number of iron-sulfur proteins has been determined and correlated with the S(0) content of the urea-ferricyanide denatured proteins. The oxidation stoichiometries are consistent with a generalization of the above formulation. Thus 8 to 10 moles of ferricyanide are consumed by the two-iron proteins and approximately 30 by the bacterial ferredoxins. With the two-iron proteins, 60 to 80% of the labile sulfide was found as bound S(0) while with bacterial ferredoxins about 50% of the labile sulfide was detected as bound S(0). In the case of putidaredoxin it was found that the same amount of S(0) was bound when the protein was air-denatured in the absence of urea and mercaptoethanol as when the protein was denatured in aerobic urea solution. It is proposed that the oxygen sensitivity of many non-heme iron labile-sulfide proteins finds explanation in the oxidation of their mercaptide-sulfide system."
https://openalex.org/W1598943218,"Following cortisol binding to the specific glucocorticoid receptors of thymus cells at 37° (a process which takes about 7 min), there is a 5- to 10-min lag period before a cortisol effect can be observed on glucose 6-phosphate accumulation after a glucose pulse. Evidence is presented that during this period the signal initiated by cortisol binding traverses an irreversible, an actinomycin D-sensitive, and a temperature-sensitive step. The irreversible step is shown by the fact that removal of cortisol from the glucocorticoid receptors (by displacement with cortexolone, a metabolically inactive glucocorticoid competitor, or by washing) well before any metabolic effect has appeared does not prevent the subsequent appearance of the cortisol effect. The actinomycin D-sensitive step is shown by the fact that, whereas addition of actinomycin D to thymus cells together with cortisol prevents the cortisol effect from developing subsequently, addition of actinomycin D 5 min after cortisol does not prevent the cortisol effect. To produce these actions, actinomycin D must be used at 100 µg per ml. This same concentration is necessary to inhibit RNA synthesis rapidly in thymus cells by about 80%. The temperature-sensitive step is shown by the fact that the duration of the lag period preceding the appearance of a cortisol effect increases markedly at temperatures below 37° to more than 120 min at 20°. The duration of the lag period at 37° can be shortened if cells are first incubated with cortisol at 20°. The temperature dependence of the irreversible step is such that it cannot be identical with, but must precede, the temperature-dependent step. The actinomycin D-sensitive step may or may not be identical with one of the other two steps."
https://openalex.org/W1608203262,"The oxygen affinity of mouse hemoglobin is greatly lowered by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). The higher the pH, the smaller the size of the effect. The pH dependence of this shift in log p50 resembles a titration curve with an apparent pK of 7.76. This value is close to that reported for the α-NH2 groups of deoxyhemoglobin. The addition of 1 to 2 moles of 2,3-DPG per mole of hemoglobin decreases the value of n in Hill's equation. Further addition causes n to return to normal values. However, estimation of the overall free energy of interaction shows that 2,3-DPG does not affect interaction. The changes in n are therefore believed either to reflect the presence of mixtures of hemoglobins combined to varying extents with 2,3-DPG or the fact that the free 2,3-DPG concentration is continuously increasing during oxygenation. The Bohr effects at 20°, between pH 7.0 and 7.5, of hemoglobins from mouse, man, and elephant are approximately -0.52, -0.48, and -0.30, respectively; these values become -0.9, -0.7, and -0.44, respectively, in the presence of 1 mole of 2,3-DPG per mole of hemoglobin. Carbon dioxide abolishes the effect of 2,3-DPG on the oxygen equilibrium of mouse hemoglobin at pCO2 = 60 mm Hg, pH 7.3, and 20°. The higher the pCO2 the lower is the pH at which CO2 abolishes the 2,3-DPG effect. Mouse hemoglobin digested with carboxypeptidase A is devoid of a 2,3-DPG effect. In contrast, the oxygen equilibrium of hemoglobin digested with carboxypeptidase B shows a 2,3-DPG effect. We conclude that 2,3-DPG binds at the same sites as does CO2, namely at the NH2-termini of the α and β chains, but that interaction of 2,3-DPG with the β chain is functionally the most important. Mechanisms are proposed to explain both the effects of CO2 and of 2,3-DPG. The CO2, bound as carbamate (-NHCOO-), and the 2,3-DPG anion are both believed to reduce the oxygen affinity because the introduction of the negative charge interferes with the conformation change associated with oxygenation. We conclude that hemoglobins from different mammals are not physiologically equivalent and do not by themselves provide support for the theory of selectively neutral mutations. Instead, the properties of the oxygen equilibria of mammalian hemoglobins appear to reflect an adaptation of the metabolic needs of the animal."
https://openalex.org/W1529610859,"Rubredoxin, a red nonheme iron protein previously shown to be an essential electron carrier in an enzyme system from Pseudomonas oleovorans which hydroxylates fatty acids and hydrocarbons, has been isolated in large quantities by an improved procedure. The protein is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 19,000 as determined by sedimentation studies and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. It contains a single methionine residue and 10 cysteine residues and, unlike rubredoxins isolated from anaerobic bacteria, histidine and arginine. The isolated form of this protein, which contains 1 atom of iron and is called (1Fe)-rubredoxin, is readily converted to a form which contains 2 atoms of iron and is called (2Fe)-rubredoxin. The oxidized form of (1Fe)-rubredoxin has absorption maxima at 497, 380, and 280 mµ with an A280:A497 ratio of about 6.3, and (2Fe)-rubredoxin has maxima at 495, 378, and 280 mµ with an A280:A495 ratio of about 3.7. The two forms of rubredoxin have highly similar electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. One electron is accepted per atom of iron by each form of rubredoxin, as determined by anaerobic titrations with dithionite or with DPNH in the presence of a catalytic amount of rubredoxin-DPN reductase. Studies on the sulfhydryl content of apo- , (1Fe)- , and (2Fe)-rubredoxin indicated that each iron atom is coordinated by the sulfur atoms of 4 cysteine residues, as has been shown by others for rubredoxin from anaerobic bacteria. Aporubredoxin in which the sulfhydryl groups were protected by formation of the mercaptoethanol mixed disulfide was cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and the two resulting peptides were isolated. Each peptide was converted by treatment with mercaptoethanol and ferrous ions to an iron-containing form with an absorption spectrum typical of a rubredoxin. Determination of the carboxymethylcysteine content of the peptides formed when (1Fe)-rubredoxin was treated with iodoacetamide and then cleaved with cyanogen bromide established that the iron atom is chelated by the group of cysteine residues located near the COOH-terminal end of the molecule. The iron-containing peptide arising from the COOH-terminal portion of rubredoxin can serve as an electron carrier in hydroxylation, whereas that arising from the NH2-terminal portion can not. This was determined by the rate of hydrocarbon hydroxylation under aerobic conditions in the presence of a reduced pyridine nucleotide, a rubredoxin reductase, and the bacterial ω-hydroxylase. (1Fe)- and (2Fe)-rubredoxin function equally well on a molar basis as electron carriers. In contrast, rubredoxins from anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium pasteurianum and Peptostreptococcus elsdenii), the Chromatium high potential iron protein, and spinach ferredoxin show no significant activity over a wide concentration range. Since the immediate environments of the iron atoms in the various rubredoxins are highly similar, it is apparent that other structural features must be essential for the protein to function as an electron carrier in hydroxylation."
https://openalex.org/W2047380714,"The determination of bilateral symmetry of chick blastodiscs occurring during the second half of the uterine period is only indirectly caused by the intrauterine rotation of the egg. As a result of this rotation the blastodisc is forced into an oblique position and the force of gravity affects the symmetrization process. The same result may be artificially achieved, without rotation, by forcing the blastodisc into an oblique position."
https://openalex.org/W1520698553,"Abstract Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GP-dehydrogenase) isolated from rabbit muscle by the procedure of Ferdinand (Biochem. J., 92, 578 (1964)), has two previously unreported properties. 1. The coenzyme-binding sites usually filled with NAD+ in native GP-dehydrogenase contain instead the NAD+ degradation product, ADP-ribose. 2. Several of the four active sites contain covalently bound 3-phosphoglyceroyl group. The enzyme isolated by the Ferdinand procedure is in reality the acyl enzyme intermediate in the physiological oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The occurrence of ADP-ribose appears to be a consequence of the isolation procedure in vitro, but the recovery of acyl enzyme suggests that GP-dehydrogenase is in an acylated state in vivo. The data required to estimate the sarcoplasmic concentrations of NAD+, NADH, the glycolytic intermediates, and the glycolytic enzymes are available in the literature. These estimates and the known effect of acylation on the GP-dehydrogenase-NAD+ affinity suggest two physiological regulatory roles for acyl-GP-dehydrogenase in muscle. One function is the regulation of coenzyme activities and oxidation-reduction potential as the affinity of enzyme for NAD+ changes with degree of acylation, itself dependent on the metabolic state of the tissue. The other is the buffering by acyl enzyme of the more dilute glycolytic intermediates during rapid changes in metabolic state. Although these roles must be considered hypothetical, the finding in skeletal muscle of levels of acylated GP-dehydrogenase much higher than those of many glycolytic intermediates should lead to revision of the accepted glycolytic pathway to include 3-phosphoglyceroyl-GP-dehydrogenase as a significant metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W1651047244,"Abstract Pig heart muscle aconitase has been purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedimentation in the ultracentrifuge. The protein has an s20,w = 6.16, a molecular weight of 89,000, a D20,w value of 6.68 x 10-7 cm2 per sec, a frictional ratio, f/f0, of 1.08, and an isoelectric point of 9.1. The presence of 1.02 ± 0.11 moles of iron per 89,000 g of aconitase is revealed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. At 77°K, the electron spin resonance spectrum of aconitase has a signal at g = 4.1 arising from high spin iron(III). The iron(III) is thought to have a structural rather than a catalytic role since the electron spin resonance spectrum is unchanged upon addition of iron(II), cysteine, or citrate. The optical spectrum of aconitase shows a broad nonspecific absorption from 300 to 600 nm at 25°. Aconitase specifically requires iron(II) for activity and the time-dependent activation by iron(II) is fit by the consecutive combination of 2 iron(II) ions with the enzyme. The transverse relaxation rate, 1/T2, of aconitase-bound iron(III) decreases with increasing temperature and the longitudinal relaxation rate, 1/T1, increases with temperature below 22° and decreases with increasing temperature above 22°, yielding a correlation time τc = 1 x 10-11 sec. The inequality of the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates indicates that protons are rapidly exchanging (g6 x 105 sec-1) between bulk solvent and the coordination sphere of the iron(III). The molar relaxivity, 1/T1p[Fe], for aconitase (5900 m-1 sec-1) at 22° indicates that aconitase-bound iron(III) is about half as effective as free iron (III) in relaxing the protons of water. From the Solomon-Bloembergen equation and assuming an iron to proton distance of 2.4 ± 0.1 A from crystallographic data, it is calculated that 3 ± 1 water molecules remain in the inner coordination sphere of aconitase-bound iron(III)."

https://openalex.org/W2133214214,"It is widely accepted that metabolites of glucose rather than glucose itself trigger insulin release from β-cells. If so, level changes of such metabolites ought to occur in β-cells within seconds of a glucose pulse. To examine this hypothesis, glucose, glucose-6-P, fructose-diP plus triose-P, 6-P-gluconate, ATP, and P-creatine were measured in individual rat islets after intravenous infusion for 1 to 60 min of glucose, mannoheptulose, and xylitol, or combinations of these compounds. Insulin levels in serum were determined concomitantly. Some of the animals were fasted for 5 or 6 days prior to glucose infusion. Individual islets were dissected from freeze-dried sections sampled with quick freezing methods. The sensitivity and specificity needed for analysis of metabolites and cofactors were gained by using enzymatic fluorometric procedures combined with an oil well method and enzymatic cycling of pyridine nucleotides. Serum insulin was determined immunochemically. Insulin levels in peripheral blood rose within 1 min of injection of glucose. Mannoheptulose as well as fasting blocked this glucose effect. Penetration of glucose, although very rapid, was carrier mediated, since under special conditions mannoheptulose and also xylitol caused exit countertransport of glucose from the β-cells. This shows that mannoheptulose has effects on glucose metabolism of islets that are independent of its ability to inhibit phosphorylation. Most of the metabolites and cofactors measured were unchanged during the first 5 min of glucose infusion. Fructose-diP plus triose-P rose within 1 min in fed animals, but also increased when insulin release was blocked in various ways. After 1 hour of hyperglycemia there was a marked rise in all metabolites and cofactors save ATP. The metabolic changes induced by glucose infusion in severely fasted animals, indicate that islet cell metabolism was stimulated, although insulin release was blocked. These results and reports by other investigators suggest that glucose itself rather than its metabolites triggers insulin secretion."

Unlike the other activities, the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity is separated, early in the purification, into two fractions. The minor fraction is that associated with aminoacyltransferase II, while the major one is distinct in many of its properties from the transfer factor. Approximately 1 mole of 3H-adenosine diphosphoribose can be covalently bound to 1 mole of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1570385971,"Abstract Previous work has shown that the synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate by mitochondria from guinea pig liver was controlled by the availability of intramitochondrial oxalacetate. In this study, the livers of fed and fasted guinea pigs were freeze clamped to identify those factors associated with enhanced rates of gluconeogenesis in vivo. The oxidation-reduction potential of the intramitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides was markedly shifted toward oxidation in livers of fasted as compared with livers of fed guinea pigs. This transition in the oxidation-reduction potential was recreated in incubations with isolated guinea pig liver mitochondria, and the relative rates of malate, aspartate, and P-enolpyruvate synthesis from a variety of substrates were followed. The rate of P-enolpyruvate formation relative to the rates of aspartate and malate formation was markedly increased at oxidation-reduction potentials resembling those found in the livers of fasted as compared with livers of fed guinea pigs. Those factors regulating the formation of the various gluconeogenic precursors are discussed and the interrelationships of these mechanisms are analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W1548792450,"Thiocyanate ion is oxidized at acid pH by hydrogen peroxide to sulfate and cyanide. The reaction is catalyzed in the erythrocyte by hemoglobin acting as a peroxidase (donor: H2O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.7). Kinetic studies show thiocyanate ion fulfills criteria for a substrate for the peroxidase. The peroxidase activity is enhanced by haptoglobin and inhibited by azide, aminotriazole, fluoride, iodide, and cyanide. No other enzyme catalyzing this reaction was found in hemolysates of bovine blood. Oxyhemoglobin was a more active catalyst than methemoglobin but was rapidly converted to the latter in the incubation system. Equivalent amounts of sulfate and cyanide were produced initially, but the cyanide was converted to cyanate and ammonia. The conversion was not rapid nor catalyzed by hemoglobin except in the presence of thiocyanate. The enzymic reaction resembles the acid-catalyzed oxidation of thiocyanate by hydrogen peroxide. Oxidation of sulfur dicyanide, a proposed intermediate product, was catalyzed also by hemoglobin. Cyanide produced in vivo is converted in part to thiocyanate by sulfur transferase systems. The thiocyanate-cyanide cycle probably accounts for some of the physiological effects of thiocyanate."
https://openalex.org/W1958209217,"The galactose-binding protein of Escherichia coli is shown to exist in two forms, each representing different conformational states. These two forms are in equilbrium with each other, and exhibit binding affinities toward galactose that differ by at least a factor of 10. These properties of the galactose-binding protein are in agreement with the requirements postulated for a carrier molecule involved in active transport. The active transport of galactose through the cell membrane would then involve preferential association of galactose to State I of the protein (highly binding active) on the outside of the cell membrane and subsequent dissociation of galactose from State II (less binding active) on the inside of the membrane. The energy necessary for accumulation of galactose inside the cell might be explained by an energy-dependent continuous transformation from one state to the other followed by an energy independent reversal of this reaction. The maintenance of the different forms of the binding protein on respective sides of the cell membrane could thus explain active transport of galactose in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1599282595,"Abstract Escherichia coli has a specific active transport system for magnesium which can be studied with the radioisotope 28Mg. The accumulation of 28Mg is temperature-dependent and inhibited by cyanide, dinitrophenol, and m-chlorophenyl carbonylcyanide hydrazone. The initial rate of uptake of 28Mg shows typical saturation kinetics with a Km = 18 µm magnesium and a Vmax = 0.56 µmole per min per 1012 cells at 25° in Tris medium. Neither calcium nor strontium compete with, inhibit, or stimulate the transport of 28Mg. However, manganese shows complex effects on cellular magnesium metabolism. (a) Manganese appears to be a competitive inhibitor for the magnesium accumulation system with a Ki = 0.5 mm manganese in Tris. (b) The addition of high (5 to 10 mm) manganese causes the rapid loss of 28Mg from previously loaded cells and a net loss of magnesium, as if mangenese were displacing internal bound magnesium which then leaves the cells via the magnesium transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1488199919,"Abstract Concentrations of total non-heme iron and ferritin iron were determined for whole livers and isolated Kupffer cells of rats before and after iron treatment. Rats were injected either once, with iron dextran (25 mg of iron), or multiple times, with hemoglobin (totaling 16 mg of iron) or iron dextran (totaling 140 mg of iron), 1 or 16 to 20 weeks before use. Particularly at the highest iron dosage, the liver contained a large proportion of the dose administered as non-heme iron, and, in control rats or rats treated with 16 to 25 mg of iron, 70 to 80% of this iron was in the form of ferritin. A nonhepatocyte fraction, containing mostly Kupffer cells, was isolated from each liver after differential digestion of the hepatocytes by Pronase. In all cases, very little ferritin could be shown in the Kupffer cell fraction by antibody precipitation or disc' electrophoresis following extraction of the cells with heat treatment, sonic oscillation, and detergents, in various combinations. The Kupffer cell fraction did, however, contain at least two other forms of non-heme iron visualizable by electrophoresis as a very slow migrating band and as large brown granules which did not enter the gel. These granules were isolated in the case of the rats treated with 140 mg of iron and had an iron-protein ratio of 1.9. Based on known values for the percentage of nonhepatocyte nuclei in liver, the total contents of non-heme and ferritin iron in hepatocytes and nonhepatocytes were calculated. The hepatocytes invariably contained almost all of the ferritin iron while the Kupffer cell fraction contained almost all of the nonferritin, non-heme iron. The protein content of the Kupffer cell fraction was commensurate with its estimated contribution to liver volume."

https://openalex.org/W2135907114,"Abstract It has been shown that the action of 90% 1,2-propanediol on urease results in a dissociation that is symmetrical and results in 240,000 dalton units. Ultraviolet absorption and optical rotatory dispersion studies indicate no conformational change, and no loss of enzymatic activity was observed. The 240,000-dalton form of urease reassociated to a value twice this when the pH was reduced from 9.2 to 7.0. The product of reassociation was identical with the starting material by the criteria of electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation and measurements of ultraviolet absorption, optical rotatory dispersion, and enzymatic activity. The results indicated a single binding area which does not interact with the active site of the enzyme. The interaction between the 240,000 dalton units in the 480,000-dalton form during reassociation does not involve disulfide bonds. Dissociation at pH values lower than 9.2, initially described, has been accomplished, indicating that pH change is not a determining factor for the process. It is proposed that the action of glycols or glycerol in this dissociation can be attributed to interference with the water structure of the solvent around the binding areas of the urease subunits. This results in a favorable entropy change predominantly contributing to the free energy of dissociation. Ultracentrifuge studies in the presence of 1,2-propanediol under the dissociating conditions supported the above conclusions based on studies in buffers. Comparative studies with ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, and glycerol indicate that the same type of dissociation occurs in all three. Studies of the stability of the dissociated urease show that, upon long exposure in ethylene glycol or 1,2-propanediol, changes occur that lead to loss of enzymatic activity. These changes are accompanied by an apparent reassociation followed by polymerization or denaturation. The apparent reassociation is distinguishable from normal association-dissociation and conditions are described for its elimination.

The preparation, which was shown to be homogeneous by zonal electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, isoelectric focusing, and gel filtration, had a median lethal dose 50% (LD50) toward mice of 0.044 µg per g of body weight. The molecular weight of the toxic protein, as determined by sedimentation velocity and diffusion experiments, was found to be 7200. The minimum molecular weight calculated from amino acid analysis was 7000. The isoelectric point, determined by isoelectric focusing, was 9.2. Although hyaluronidase, alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, phospholipase A, acetylcholinesterase, DNase, leucine amino peptidase, and clotting activity could all be detected in unfractionated venom; no enzymatic activity could be found in the purified toxin. The compound N-bromosuccinimide completely destroyed the toxicity of the preparation, which, under the conditions employed, strongly suggests that tryptophan is necessary for toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1541513915,"Abstract Lysozyme was purified from a pooled sample of Peking duck egg whites by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Three different lysozymes were found, and each was shown to be pure by several criteria. The three enzymes were like chicken lysozyme in molecular size and specific activity, although they could be distinguished from it, as well as from one another, by electrophoretic and immunological criteria. The three duck enzymes were shown to be very similar to one another on the basis of amino acid composition (in particular, all lacked histidine) and immunological tests. Lysozyme was then partially purified from 44 individual duck egg whites and subjected to starch gel electrophoresis at pH 5.3, at which the three different lysozymes are readily distinguishable from each other. Each individual egg white contained either any one of the three lysozymes alone or a combination of any two of them. No single egg white contained all three duck lysozymes. The frequency of the six different phenotypes, as well as the marked similarity of the three enzymes to one another, leads us to suggest the existence of three alleles at one locus in the duck population which we examined."

https://openalex.org/W2001753453,"When large doses of L-dopa (1000 milligrams per kilogram, given subcutaneously) were administered to rats, the rate of catecholamine synthesis was increased in both the heart and adrenal gland. It is likely that increases also occur in other sympathetically innervated tissues. When the same dose of L-dopa was given daily for 4 or 7 days, the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase in the adrenal were lowered in comparison to controls. These findings may be a further indication of the existence of a regulatory mechanism which modifies endogenous levels of tyrosine hydroxylase in response to changes in the biosynthetic demand for norepinephrine."

https://openalex.org/W1597091566,"Abstract Evidence concerning conformational changes in aspartate transcarbamylase of Escherichia coli is reviewed in order to evaluate the level of structural organization at which the changes relevant to allosteric behavior take place, and to assess the contribution of each kind of subunit to this behavior. It is suggested that the conformational change responsible for allosteric behavior is a slight quaternary rearrangement, rather than a tertiary structural change which modifies the active centers. A functional unit is postulated which consists of two catalytic chains separated by a dimer of the regulatory chains. The conformational change resulting in allosteric behavior is generated by the pivoting of the regulatory dimer between two positions, in one of which the two catalytic sites are blocked by the dimer. In the catalytically active conformation the blocking portions of the regulatory dimer become exposed. The unit is symmetrical and acts in a concerted manner. This hypothesis accounts for the observations that (a) both homotropic and heterotropic effects depend on the integrity of the regulatory subunits; (b) the intact, isolated catalytic trimer is incapable of allosteric behavior; (c) in the T state not only is there no catalytic activity, but the active sites cannot bind substrate; (d) the reactivity of thiol groups and peptide bonds of the regulatory subunit is increased when substrate is bound to the catalytic subunit; and (e) upon treatment with mercurials the enzyme dissociates into regulatory dimers and catalytic trimers, rather than into mixed protomers. Depending on the manner in which three such functional units are linked together to form the complete oligomer, the allosteric properties can be amplified and can yield either concerted or sequential behavior. The properties of two such oligomers are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1539518274,"The α and β chains of human hemoglobin are functionally nonequivalent. In tetrameric human methemoglobin, the β chains react with sodium dithionite about 10-fold faster, and with sodium azide about 6-fold faster than the α chains. In addition, the isosbestic point for oxidized heme-reduced heme differs for the α and β chains within the intact tetramer. The differential reactivity of the chains toward azide and dithionite was used to measure the concentrations of the oxidized α and β chains in mixtures of methemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. The ratio of concentration of oxidized β to oxidized α chains decreased as the proportion of methemoglobin was progressively decreased, in the presence of catalytic amounts of the electron-mediating dye thionine. Therefore, the β chains have a higher half-reduction potential than the α chains. Furthermore, nearly the same difference in apparent oxidation potential was found at pH 6.1, where the Hill coefficient for the oxidation-reduction reaction is 1.4, and at pH 8.7, where the Hill coefficient is 2.5. We obtained an estimate of the heme-heme interaction energy contributed by the αβ dimer from these results and from the known equilibrium curves for the oxidation-reduction reaction. The estimated αβ dimer interaction energy is much smaller than the experimentally measured interaction energy of the tetramer. We conclude that since the αβ dimer contributed only a small fraction of the total interaction energy at alkaline pH, the hemoglobin tetramer is the important functional unit in the oxidation-reduction reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1578436558,"Abstract Purified aminoacyltransferase II was analyzed to determine molecular size and to investigate the possibility of subunits. The molecular weight was determined to be 87,500 by sedimentation-diffusion, 105,500 by high speed equilibrium ultracentrifugation, and 94,000 to 105,000 by gel filtration. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated one principal component of molecular weight 89,000. These results indicate that the enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 96,500 ± 9,000. The enzyme underwent a specific breakdown upon aging at 0–5deg; into components of approximately 64,000, 42,000, and 37,000. Various treatments were used in an attempt to speed the breakdown, but the resulting gel patterns were different from that produced by aging. Experiments with the 3H-adenosine diphosphoribose derivatives of the enzyme and of the breakdown products indicated that 3H-adenosine diphosphoribose was present in the undergraded enzyme and in one or both of the smaller breakdown components, but not in the 64,000 molecular weight component. Although both the undergraded enzyme and a fragment could accept 3H-adenosine diphosphoribose, no evidence for a fragment active in amino acid incorporation or in ribosome-dependent GTPase was obtained."

https://openalex.org/W1521629662,"We have extensively purified the release factors R1 and R2 from Escherichia coli. These proteins can each mediate polypeptide chain termination. The physiological substrate for this reaction is a completed polypeptide chain in a peptidyl-transfer RNA-messenger RNA-ribosome complex. The reaction consists of recognition of a chain-terminating signal in the mRNA and hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA ester bond, releasing the polypeptide chain. For the purification we were guided by two kinds of assay, the hexapeptide release assay and the formylmethionine release assay, each named according to the molecule released in a model reaction analogous to physiological chain termination. The two factors have different codon specificities, R1 acting in response to UAG or UAA, and R2 in response to UGA or UAA. Both factors were purified from a 1-kg batch of frozen E. coli MRE600 by a scheme which carried the material through four steps before reaching a branch point at the fifth step, when R1- and R2-rich fractions were produced. The two fractions were then treated similarly but separately through three more steps. The products were studied by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using both routine and sodium dodecyl sulfate techniques. For the 6.4 mg of purified R1, we estimate 85% purity after 2,000-fold purification. For the 9.4 mg of purified R2, we estimate 99% purity after 1,500-fold purification. Our results indicate that each release factor consists of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 44,000 for R1 and 47,000 for R2. We calculate that there are about 500 molecules of R1 and 700 molecules of R2 per E. coli cell."
https://openalex.org/W1540783945,"Abstract A dipeptidase that hydrolyzes l-Ala-Gly and a wide spectrum of other l-α-dipeptides has been purified 800-fold from the soluble fraction of Ehrlich-Lettre mouse actesis tumor cells. The highest specific activity (micromoles of dipeptide hydrolyzed at 40° per min per mg of protein) achieved was 2,600 with Ala-Gly, the substrate with which purification was followed. With the best substrate, Ala-Ile, this specific activity was equivalent to a molecular activity (moles of dipeptide hydrolyzed at maximum velocity at 40° per min per mole of enzyme) of 2 x 106. Instability of the enzyme at this high activity prevented determination of homogeneity; a sample of molecular activity of 1 x 106 (Ala-Gly specific activity, 1,360) was estimated to be 50% pure by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Studies with metal chelators indicate that the dipeptidase is a metalloenzyme. For instance, o-phenanthroline completely inhibited the enzyme activity (50% at 0.1 mm), whereas m-phenanthroline had no effect. Although atomic absorption analyses showed a correlation of zinc content with enzyme activity in the final chromatographic step and a value of 0.9 ± 0.1 g atom of zinc per mole of enzyme of specific activity 2,600 (Ala-Gly), it has not been confirmed that the dipeptidase is a zinc metalloenzyme. The enzyme was separated from leucine aminopeptidase, prolidase, and tripeptidase by Sephadex G-150 filtration and, by comparison with standard proteins, was shown to have a molecular weight of 85,000 ± 5,000. The dipeptidase hydrolyzes only l-α-dipeptides with a free amino and carboxyl group. Kinetic studies of 15 dipeptides have shown the Km values to vary between 0.4 and 22 mm and the relative Vmax values (Ala-Gly standard, Vmax = 1) to vary from 5.3 (Ala-Ile) to 0.01 (Gly-Gly). Inhibition by high substrate concentrations (3 to 50 mm) was observed in cases where the Km was low. Peptides with small NH2- terminal and bulky nonpolar COOH-terminal R groups were preferred. The hydrolyses of the relatively poor substrates, Pro-Gly and Gly-Gly, were activated by mm Mn2+ and Co2+, respectively, whereas that of Ala-Gly was inhibited by both these metals as well as by 10 other metals. No evidence was obtained that these hydrolyses were carried out by separate enzymes: the enzyme peaks were congruent, the ratios of activities were constant throughout purification, and the activities toward the three substrates decayed at the same rate on exposure to 30° for periods up to 24 hours."
https://openalex.org/W1551783093,"Abstract Two stable conformational states of cytochrome b5 reductase, the active holoenzyme and an inactive flavoprotein species, have been obtained in identical buffers between pH 10.7 and 11.5. Physical and chemical characterization of these two protein forms showed that the catalytically active species is a much more compact polypeptide in which one or both of the tryptophanyl residues and the flavin are in a more nonpolar environment. The transition from holoenzyme to the more swollen enzyme form also exposes one cysteinyl and one tyrosyl residue to the medium and destroys the pyridine nucleotide-binding site. Moreover, the swollen enzyme conformation, in contrast to the active enzyme, is attacked by proteolytic enzymes. Prolonged tryptic digestion produced a compact, stable flavin-binding peptide of approximately 10,000 molecular weight. The characterization of the pH dependence and kinetics of the transitions between the two reductase structures suggests that the state of ionization of basic amino acid residues, as well as exposure of the buried cysteinyl and sulfhydryl residues, contribute significantly to the stability of the two species in the alkaline pH region and the observed hysteresis during the cycle of inactivate enzyme formation and regeneration of active reductase. The swollen, inactive conformation is stabilized between pH 8.5 and 10.3 by formation of the mersalyl complex with the additional sulfhydryl group which is reactive in this protein species."
https://openalex.org/W1558601061,"Abstract Both ergosta-5,24(28)-dien-3β-ol and stigmasta-5,trans-24(28)-dien-3β-ol were metabolized in Tetrahymena pyriformis to give the respective Δ5,7,22,24(28)-tetraenes, vis. ergosta-5,7,trans-22,24(28)-tetraen-3β-ol and stigmasta-5,7,-trans-22,trans-24(28)-tetraen-3β-ol. While stigmasta-5, trans-24(28)-dien-3β-ol yielded some triene (stigmasta-5,7, trans-24(28)-trien-3β-ol), stigmasta-5,cis-24(28)-dien-3β-ol was converted almost entirely to the triene (stigmasta-5,7,-cis-24(28)-trien-3β-o1). No dealkylation at C-24 occurred. The results are interpreted to mean that, in the enzyme-substrate complex for the introduction of a Δ22 bond, the side chain assumes a conformation in which C-20, C-22, C-23, C-24, C-25, C-28, and (if present) C-29 lie in a plane, and one side of the plane is exposed to the enzyme with cis-elimination of 2 hydrogen atoms. Such a conformation is thermodynamically favorable with the 24-methylene and trans-24-ethylidene sterols, allowing 22,23-dehydrogenation to occur, but unfavorable with the cis-24-ethylidene sterol, thereby restricting 22,23-dehydrogenation. Since in all three cases the Δ7 bond was introduced, the capacity of the side chain to assume one or the other of these conformations appears to be irrelevant in the formation of a complex with the Δ7-oxidoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1604657279,"Abstract The biosynthesis of the neutral trisaccharide, 3-O-β-d-galactosyl-4-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-xylose of the heparin-protein linkage region, has been investigated. A microsomal fraction of heparin-producing mouse mastocytoma catalyzed the incorporation of galactose from UDP-galactose into endogenous as well as exogenous substrates. Partial acid hydrolysis of 14C-galactose-labeled endogenous acceptor yielded several fragments with the characteristics of neutral oligosaccharides previously isolated from the heparin-protein linkage region and, in addition, a compound with the chromatographic properties of N-acetyllactosamine. The stepwise synthesis of the neutral trisaccharide was investigated with separate assays for the two galactosyl transferase reactions, with exogenous acceptors such as d-xylose (product, 4-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-xylose) and 4-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-xylose (product, 3-O-β-d-galactosyl-4-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-xylose). Treatment of the particulate enzyme with ammonium hydroxide in the presence of Tween 20 resulted in the solubilization of considerable amounts of galactosyltransferase activities. Whereas only 4% of the UDP-galactose-d-xylose galactosyltransferase was brought into solution by treatment of the enzyme with detergent at neutral pH, about one-third of the transferase activity related to the synthesis of the second galactose moiety was recovered in the supernatant under similar conditions, indicating that the two reactions are catalyzed by two different enzymes. A third galactosyltransferase which catalyzed the transfer of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine was also detected in the microsome particles. This enzyme was solubilized by the same procedure as that used for the two transferases mentioned above but was discriminated from the latter by its stability toward heat and by fractionation with ethanol."

https://openalex.org/W1482598799,"Abstract δ-Aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity is increased in hepatic homogenates from mice that have been fasted or treated (or both) with 3,5-dicarbethoxy-1,4-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (DDC). Comparison of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity in livers from adult female mice of 15 inbred strains showed significant differences (p l 0.01) among the strains in the amount of enzyme activity normally present and in the amount present after induction. After DDC administration, δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity increased at a linear rate for 12 hours and then reached a plateau at a level that was maintained until at least 20 hours after drug administration. Strain differences were maintained over a range of DDC doses from 28 mg per kg to 500 mg per kg (the highest dose tested). No significant differences in plasma DDC levels were noted between strains of and induced activity. Representative strains with high and low DDC-induced enzyme activity were compared in detail. Neither modification of the glycine, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, or EDTA concentrations nor substitution of other buffers for the usual Tris buffer changed the relative enzyme activities of homogenates. Addition of succinyl coenzyme A or a succinyl CoA generating system increased total homogenate activity to the same extent in high and low strains. In animals from both classes, added succinate inhibited δ-aminolevulinate production. When hepatic homogenates of DDC-treated mice were fractionated by differential centrifugation, no substantial differences were noted among strains in the subcellular distribution of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity. Our data suggest that among inbred strains of mice there are either differences in the number of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase enzyme molecules present or differences in the catalytic activity of a structurally modified enzyme produced in response to fasting or DDC administration (or both) and that genetic factors are responsible for this heterogeneity of response."

Alkylated lipoyl dehydrogenase, inactive in the DPNH-lipoamide dehydrogenase reaction, forms the corresponding cadmium compound. The latter appears more stable than the cadmium compound of the unalkylated enzyme. The activity profile of the cadmium compound is characterized by increased rates of 2,6-dichloroindophenol and quinone reductase, little change in ferricyanide reductase, decreased pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase, and highly inhibited DPNH-lipoamide dehydrogenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1529599013,"The techniques of fluorescence enhancement and fluorescence polarization were used to study the binding of NADPH and structurally similar pyridine nucleotides to pigeon and rat liver fatty acid synthetases. NADPH, on binding to the enzyme, changes from a closed to an open conformation and the nicotinamide ring becomes associated with hydrophobic groups of the protein. The orientation of NADPH when bound to enzyme is such as to permit the transfer of radiant energy from tryptophan residues of the protein to the nicotinamide moiety of NADPH. The binding affinity of the enzyme for the coenzyme is considerably reduced by removal of the 2'-ribose phosphate (NADH), and by oxidation of the pyridine ring (NADP), but it is only slightly decreased by alteration of substituents on the adenine and pyridine rings (deamino-NADP and acetylpyridine-NADP). Enzyme-bound NADH is not aligned with the enzyme in the same manner as NADPH. The binding of NADPH to enzyme is competitively inhibited by pyridine nucleotide analogues, and at higher concentrations, by the ions of inorganic salts structurally unrelated to NADPH. Hence, electrostatic forces of attraction between charged groups on the coenzyme and the enzyme appear to have an important role in maintaining enzyme-coenzyme association."

https://openalex.org/W1577138558,"Abstract In biotin deficiency, aspartic acid becomes a limiting factor in the growth of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790. Suboptimal concentrations of l-aspartate in biotin-deficient medium produce partial growth followed by lysis, which is typical of cell wall lysis due to depletion of an amino acid essential for cell wall biosynthesis. d-Aspartate, which is utilized by the cells with considerable less efficiency than the l isomer, can prevent depletion lysis when present at high concentrations. Irrespective of aspartate concentration, a minimal concentration of biotin is so indispensable for normal growth that at lower biotin concentrations partial growth occurs followed by cell lysis. l-Aspartate-14C included in the growth medium is incorporated into d-aspartate isolated from the cell wall. Dilution with endogenously synthesized amino acid is a function of aspartate and biotin concentrations. Wall and protein aspartic acids were isolated from cells grown with dl-aspartate-1-14C or with dl-aspartate-4-14C and selectively decarboxylated with chloramine-T in alkali to locate the position of 14C in the molecule. Lack of randomization of 14C between the α- and β-carboxyl groups indicated the absence of a symmetrical intermediate with enzymically indistinguishable carboxyl groups (fumarate) in the pathway between l- and d-aspartic acid. Cell wall d-aspartate isolated from cells grown on l-aspartate-15N contained nearly the same 15N content as the l-aspartate in the medium, indicating that d-aspartate is formed from l-aspartate via racemization."
https://openalex.org/W1550967622,"Abstract The rate of binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) to apoglutamate decarboxylase has been measured as a function of coenzyme concentration at 20°, pH 4.9, by measuring the change in absorbance at 355 mµ and 427 mµ and by measuring enzyme activity versus time. All three measures give the same rate, and first order kinetics is observed for at least three half-lives. A plot of 1/kobs versus 1/[PLP] gives an excellent straight line over a 20-fold range of PLP concentration. These results are interpreted in terms of a two-step mechanism involving rapid initial formation of an enzyme-PLP complex followed by slow formation of the catalytically active enzyme-PLP Schiff base. The rate of the second step is more than a 100-fold slower than the rate of the corresponding Schiff base formation involving PLP and n-butylamine."
