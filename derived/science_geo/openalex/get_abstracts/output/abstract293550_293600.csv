https://openalex.org/W2031305523,"The dynamics and spectroscopy of silicon nanocrystals that emit at visible wavelengths were analyzed. Size-selective precipitation and size-exclusion chromatography cleanly separate the silicon nanocrystals from larger crystallites and aggregates and provide direct evidence for quantum confinement in luminescence. Measured quantum yields are as high as 50 percent at low temperature, principally as a result of efficient oxide passivation. Despite a 0.9-electron-volt shift of the band gap to higher energy, the nanocrystals behave fundamentally as indirect gap materials with low oscillator strength."
https://openalex.org/W2084692340,"Supercomputer simulations predict the creation of an unexpectedly stable form of atomic matter when ordinary atoms are irradiated by very intense, high-frequency laser pulses. In the rising edge of a very intense pulse of ionizing radiation, the atom's wave function distorts adiabatically into a distribution with two well-separated peaks. As the intensity increases, the peak spacing increases so that the atomic electron spends more time far from the nucleus and the ionization rate decreases. This leads to the surprising and counter-intuitive result that the atom becomes more stable as the ionizing radiation gets stronger."
https://openalex.org/W2052980750,"A combination of chemical vapor deposition and scanning tunneling microscopy techniques have been used to produce nanometer-scale, iron-containing deposits with high aspect ratios from an iron pentacarbonyl precursor both on a substrate and on the tunneling tip itself. The structure and composition of the resulting nanodeposits were determined by transmission electron microscopy and high spatial resolution Auger electron spectroscopy. Either polycrystalline, relatively pure, body-centered-cubic iron or disordered carbon-rich material can be deposited, depending on the bias conditions of the tip sample junction and the precursor pressure. Two mechanisms of decomposition are inferred from the growth phenomenology."
https://openalex.org/W1974572513,"Global warming caused by an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, is the direct result of greenhouse gas-induced radiative forcing. When a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide is considered, this forcing differed substantially among 15 atmospheric general circulation models. Although there are several potential causes, the largest contributor was the carbon dioxide radiation parameterizations of the models."

https://openalex.org/W2025054353,"Evaporation of sea water and gypsum precipitation on south Bonaire produce dense brines having a high ratio of magnesium to calcium. Recent dolomite is a common replacement product in the associated carbonate sediments. A mass balance indicates that brine is being refluxed downward today, and the Pleistocene dolomite on north Bonaire could have been produced by similar reflux of brine."
https://openalex.org/W2010487987,"In silt loam soil heavily infested with European wireworm, a single treatment with aldrin or hepta chlor prevented reinfestation for 9 years, even when the soil was under continuous cultivation. Toxic residues were determined by bioassay with Drosophila melanogaster Meig. By gasliquid chromatographic analysis, the residues were found to be mainly dieldrin and heptachlor epoxide."
https://openalex.org/W2083149978,"Gas chromatographic columns, greatly extended in length by the use of paired columns in a recycling apparatus, have been used to separate butane (n-C4H10) from deuterated butane (n-C4D10) and methane (C H4) from deuterated methane (C D4). The separation of monotritiated cyclobutane (C4 H7T) from cyclobutane (C4H8) is nearly complete. This procedure is generally applicable to a wide variety of separations of isotopic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2028477195,A dense seismograph network in the Imperial Valley recorded a series of earthquake swarms along the Imperial and Brawley faults and a diffuse pattern of earthquakes along the San Jacinto fault. Two known geothermal areas are closely associated with these earthquake swarms. This seismicity pattern demonstrates that seismic slip is occurring along both the Imperial-Brawley and San Jacinto fault systems.

https://openalex.org/W2039085033,"Low concentrations of long-chain alkenylsuccinic acids and certain of their derivatives inhibit stomatal opening in a tobacco-leaf disk assay, and when used as a spray. The monomethyl ester of decenylsuccinic acid is presently the most effective of this class of compounds. Stomatal closure induced with this substance is accompanied by a significant reduction in the rate of transpiration. These inhibitors probably close stomata by altering the permeability of the membranes of the guard cells."

https://openalex.org/W2006120778,"The newly developed femtosecond field emission camera was used to observe the time dependence of field emission through a single copper phthalocyanine molecule adsorbed on a tungsten tip. In many of the individual 212-picosecond-long recordings, the field emission was found to oscillate with a frequency between 5 × 1010 and 20 × 1010 hertz. The oscillations, which were not observed from a bare tip, are believed to arise from the vibration of a single molecule with respect to the surface. Numerical simulations confirmed the statistical significance of the data."

https://openalex.org/W2042916816,"It might be possible to prepare difluoride by beta decay of tritium, lithium-6 transmutation, or alpha-particle bombardment. In the first method, which may be the most feasible, tritiated potassium bifluoride could be used as a host lattice. The beta-decay recoil energy would not dislodge the daughter helium atom from the host site, thus helium difluoride could perhaps be formed in an ideally shaped lattice site."

https://openalex.org/W4292139667,"In Christopher Anderson's News & Comment article ""Rocky road for Federal Research Inc."" (22 Oct., p. 496), a comment from National Institutes of Health neuroscientist Michael Rogawski regarding Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) delays did not refer to his own CRADA experiences, which he says were not characterized by inordinate delays. Rogawski was referring to the effect on scientists in general of the delays inherent in what he considers appropriate scientific and administrative review."
