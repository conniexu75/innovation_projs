https://openalex.org/W2767493192,"Sensory, motor and cognitive operations involve the coordinated action of large neuronal populations across multiple brain regions in both superficial and deep structures. Existing extracellular probes record neural activity with excellent spatial and temporal (sub-millisecond) resolution, but from only a few dozen neurons per shank. Optical Ca2+ imaging offers more coverage but lacks the temporal resolution needed to distinguish individual spikes reliably and does not measure local field potentials. Until now, no technology compatible with use in unrestrained animals has combined high spatiotemporal resolution with large volume coverage. Here we design, fabricate and test a new silicon probe known as Neuropixels to meet this need. Each probe has 384 recording channels that can programmably address 960 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing-compatible low-impedance TiN sites that tile a single 10-mm long, 70 × 20-μm cross-section shank. The 6 × 9-mm probe base is fabricated with the shank on a single chip. Voltage signals are filtered, amplified, multiplexed and digitized on the base, allowing the direct transmission of noise-free digital data from the probe. The combination of dense recording sites and high channel count yielded well-isolated spiking activity from hundreds of neurons per probe implanted in mice and rats. Using two probes, more than 700 well-isolated single neurons were recorded simultaneously from five brain structures in an awake mouse. The fully integrated functionality and small size of Neuropixels probes allowed large populations of neurons from several brain structures to be recorded in freely moving animals. This combination of high-performance electrode technology and scalable chip fabrication methods opens a path towards recording of brain-wide neural activity during behaviour."

The mechanisms that control the establishment of astrocyte morphology are unknown, and it is unclear whether impairing astrocytic infiltration of the neuropil alters synaptic connectivity. Here we show that astrocyte morphogenesis in the mouse cortex depends on direct contact with neuronal processes and occurs in parallel with the growth and activity of synaptic circuits. The neuroligin family cell adhesion proteins NL1, NL2, and NL3, which are expressed by cortical astrocytes, control astrocyte morphogenesis through interactions with neuronal neurexins. Furthermore, in the absence of astrocytic NL2, the formation and function of cortical excitatory synapses are diminished, whereas inhibitory synaptic function is enhanced. Our findings highlight a previously undescribed mechanism of action for neuroligins and link astrocyte morphogenesis to synaptogenesis. Because neuroligin mutations have been implicated in various neurological disorders, these findings also point towards an astrocyte-based mechanism of neural pathology."

https://openalex.org/W2767809844,"Observations of an event (several energetic eruptions leading to a terminal explosion that is surprisingly hydrogen-rich) with the spectrum of a supernova do not match with other observations of supernovae. Thousands of 'core-collapse' supernovae have been observed over the past 15 years, with common observational elements such as hydrogen absorption lines that slow over time and a single light-curve peak or luminosity that plateaus for around 100 days before declining. Iair Arcavi and colleagues report observations of the supernova iPTF14hls, which does not display the usual elements. Its light curve has multiple peaks and extends over 600 days. They conclude that the properties could be explained by ejection of several tens of solar masses of gas a few hundred days before the explosion, but there is no viable explanation for how this occurred. Although multiple pre-supernova eruptions are predicted by the pulsational pair instability, that model is inconsistent with the energetics involved here and the continued presence of hydrogen absorption lines with no decrease in velocity. Every supernova so far observed has been considered to be the terminal explosion of a star. Moreover, all supernovae with absorption lines in their spectra show those lines decreasing in velocity over time, as the ejecta expand and thin, revealing slower-moving material that was previously hidden. In addition, every supernova that exhibits the absorption lines of hydrogen has one main light-curve peak, or a plateau in luminosity, lasting approximately 100 days before declining1. Here we report observations of iPTF14hls, an event that has spectra identical to a hydrogen-rich core-collapse supernova, but characteristics that differ extensively from those of known supernovae. The light curve has at least five peaks and remains bright for more than 600 days; the absorption lines show little to no decrease in velocity; and the radius of the line-forming region is more than an order of magnitude bigger than the radius of the photosphere derived from the continuum emission. These characteristics are consistent with a shell of several tens of solar masses ejected by the progenitor star at supernova-level energies a few hundred days before a terminal explosion. Another possible eruption was recorded at the same position in 1954. Multiple energetic pre-supernova eruptions are expected to occur in stars of 95 to 130 solar masses, which experience the pulsational pair instability2,3,4,5. That model, however, does not account for the continued presence of hydrogen, or the energetics observed here. Another mechanism for the violent ejection of mass in massive stars may be required."
https://openalex.org/W2767680158,"Nervous systems combine lower-level sensory signals to detect higher-order stimulus features critical to survival, such as the visual looming motion created by an imminent collision or approaching predator. Looming-sensitive neurons have been identified in diverse animal species. Different large-scale visual features such as looming often share local cues, which means loom-detecting neurons face the challenge of rejecting confounding stimuli. Here we report the discovery of an ultra-selective looming detecting neuron, lobula plate/lobula columnar, type II (LPLC2) in Drosophila, and show how its selectivity is established by radial motion opponency. In the fly visual system, directionally selective small-field neurons called T4 and T5 form a spatial map in the lobula plate, where they each terminate in one of four retinotopic layers, such that each layer responds to motion in a different cardinal direction. Single-cell anatomical analysis reveals that each arm of the LPLC2 cross-shaped primary dendrites ramifies in one of these layers and extends along that layer's preferred motion direction. In vivo calcium imaging demonstrates that, as their shape predicts, individual LPLC2 neurons respond strongly to outward motion emanating from the centre of the neuron's receptive field. Each dendritic arm also receives local inhibitory inputs directionally selective for inward motion opposing the excitation. This radial motion opponency generates a balance of excitation and inhibition that makes LPLC2 non-responsive to related patterns of motion such as contraction, wide-field rotation or luminance change. As a population, LPLC2 neurons densely cover visual space and terminate onto the giant fibre descending neurons, which drive the jump muscle motor neuron to trigger an escape take off. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the selective feature detection that flies use to discern and escape looming threats."
https://openalex.org/W2767331694,"Professional competency is a fundamental concept in nursing, which has a direct relationship with quality improvement of patient care and public health. Organizational commitment as a kind of affective attachment or sense of loyalty to the organization is an effective factor for professional competency.This study was conducted to evaluate the nurses´ professional competency and their organizational commitment as well as the relationship between these two concepts.This descriptive-analytic study was conducted at the hospitals affiliated with a University of Medical Sciences, in the southeast of Iran in 2016. The sample included 230 nurses who were selected using stratified random sampling. Data were gathered by three questionnaires including socio-demographic information, competency inventory for registered nurse (CIRN) and Allen Meyer's organizational commitment.Results showed that professional competency (Mean±SD: 2.82±0.53, range: 1.56-4.00) and organizational commitment (Mean±SD: 72.80±4.95, range: 58-81) of the nurses were at moderate levels. There was no statistically significant correlation between professional competency and organizational commitment (ρ = 0.02; p = 0.74). There were significant differences in professional competency based on marital status (p = 0.03) and work experience (p<0.001).The results highlighted that the nurses needed to be more competent and committed to their organizations. Developing professional competency and organizational commitment is vital, but not easy. This study suggests that human resource managers should pursue appropriate strategies to enhance the professional competency and organizational commitment of their nursing staff. It is necessary to conduct more comprehensive studies for exploring the status and gaps in the human resource management of healthcare in different cultures and contexts."

https://openalex.org/W2767328381,"The abyssal ocean is broadly characterized by northward flow of the densest waters and southward flow of less-dense waters above them. Understanding what controls the strength and structure of these interhemispheric flows—referred to as the abyssal overturning circulation—is key to quantifying the ocean’s ability to store carbon and heat on timescales exceeding a century. Here we show that, north of 32° S, the depth distribution of the seafloor compels dense southern-origin waters to flow northward below a depth of about 4 kilometres and to return southward predominantly at depths greater than 2.5 kilometres. Unless ventilated from the north, the overlying mid-depths (1 to 2.5 kilometres deep) host comparatively weak mean meridional flow. Backed by analysis of historical radiocarbon measurements, the findings imply that the geometry of the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic basins places a major external constraint on the overturning structure. The geometry of the ocean floor sets key regime transitions in the circulation of deep ocean waters. Deep ocean circulation, below about 2.5 kilometres (km), is a key driver of oceanic uptake or release of heat and carbon. A few regions, such as the North Atlantic, are known sources of deep water formation, but the processes that control the movement of deep waters remain as opaque as the abyss itself. Now, Casimir de Lavergne and colleagues show that the characteristic flow patterns—northward below 4 km depth and southward between 2.5 km and 4 km—are tied to the distribution of the ocean floor at certain depths. Essentially, the bathymetry of the ocean, rather than extrinsic properties such as climate gradients, drives key features of deep ocean circulation. The authors incorporate an analysis of radiocarbon into their model that reveals a shadow layer between the surface and deep ocean, with stagnant properties and high potential for long-term carbon storage."
https://openalex.org/W2767483910,"This paper reports on an online contrastive vignette study investigating the public's views of gene editing for therapy and enhancement in adult and prenatal contexts. The study, comprising quota samples of 1000 respondents per country, involved 10 European countries and the United States. Vignettes featuring gene editing for therapy compared to enhancement are seen as more morally acceptable and gain more support. Adult therapy attracts majority support, while prenatal enhancement elicits almost complete rejection. The assessment of adult enhancement and prenatal therapy are more ambivalent. These results and the respondents’ accounts of the reasons behind the decision point to a focus on the uses of gene editing, rather than the technology itself. The study is a contribution to understanding the practical dimensions of the ethical question: how can gene editing contribute to human flourishing?"

https://openalex.org/W2768060060,"Tissue remodeling is a crucial process in animal development and disease progression. Coordinately controlled by the two main insect hormones, juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), tissues are remodeled context-specifically during insect metamorphosis. We previously discovered that two matrix metalloproteinases (Mmps) cooperatively induce fat body cell dissociation in Drosophila. However, the molecular events involved in this Mmp-mediated dissociation are unclear. Here we report that JH and 20E coordinately and precisely control the developmental timing of Mmp–induced fat body cell dissociation. We found that during the larval–prepupal transition, the anti-metamorphic factor Kr-h1 transduces JH signaling, which directly inhibited Mmp expression and activated expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (timp) and thereby suppressed Mmp–induced fat body cell dissociation. We also noted that upon a decline in the JH titer, a prepupal peak of 20E suppresses Mmp–induced fat body cell dissociation through the 20E primary-response genes, E75 and Blimp-1, which inhibited expression of the nuclear receptor and competence factor βftz-F1. Moreover, upon a decline in the 20E titer, βftz-F1 expression was induced by the 20E early–late response gene DHR3, and then βftz-F1 directly activated Mmp expression and inhibited timp expression, causing Mmp–induced fat body cell dissociation during 6–12 h after puparium formation. In conclusion, coordinated signaling via JH and 20E finely tunes the developmental timing of Mmp–induced fat body cell dissociation.

Our findings shed critical light on hormonal regulation of insect metamorphosis. Tissue remodeling plays crucial roles during animal development and disease progression. The fat body in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which is analogous to the vertebrate liver and adipose tissue, has emerged as an excellent model to study tissue remodeling (1Nelliot A.

We previously showed that Mmp1 preferentially cleaves Drosphila epithelial-cadherin–mediated cell–cell junctions, whereas Mmp2 preferentially degrades basement membrane (BM) components and thus destroys cell–BM junctions, resulting in the complete dissociation of fat body tissues into individual cells (2Jia Q.

MMPs are extracellular Zn2+-dependent endopeptidases that are responsible for degrading cell–cell junctions, cell–BM junctions, and BM components. In vivo, Mmp activities are finely tuned at different levels, from gene expression to zymogen activation and endogenous inhibition. In terms of endogenous inhibition, Mmps are typically regulated by TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases) (4Gaffney J. Solomonov I. Zehorai E. Sagi I.

Although vertebrates contain more than 20 Mmps and 4 TIMPs, Drosophila possesses only two Mmps and a single timp (5Page-McCaw A. Serano J. Santé J.M. Rubin G.M.

In addition, although Mmps induce fat body cell dissociation, timp overexpression suppresses fat body cell dissociation in Drosophila (2Jia Q. Liu Y. Liu H. Li S. Mmp1 and Mmp2 cooperatively induce Drosophila fat body cell dissociation with distinct roles.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 7535Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Developmental transitions in Drosophila are regulated by two major insect hormones: the steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH). Two pulses of 20E, in conjunction with the nuclear receptor complex consisting of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle, were shown to induce larval–prepupal–pupal metamorphosis (7Riddiford L.M. Cherbas P. Truman J.W. Ecdysone receptors and their biological actions.Vitam. Horm. 2000; 60: 1-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, during the larval–prepupal transition, 20E induces the expression of several 20E primary-response genes, including E74 (Ecdysone-induced protein 74), E75, E93, Br-C (Broad complex), and Blimp-1 (B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1) (8Yamanaka N. Rewitz K.F. O'Connor M.B. Ecdysone control of developmental transitions: lessons from Drosophila research.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2013; 58: 497-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The 20E early–late response gene DHR3 controls the termination of the 20E signal pulse during the larval–prepupal transition; DHR3 also induces the expression of βftz-F1, which acts as a competence factor for EcR-ultraspiracle to respond to the subsequent 20E signal pulse during the prepupal–pupal transition. Importantly, E75 prevents DHR3-mediated inhibition of 20E signaling and DHR3-induced βftz-F1 expression through physical interaction and competition for retinoic acid receptor–related response elements (9Lam G.T.

Therefore, the 20E-induced transcriptional cascade, including E75, Blimp-1, DHR3, and βftz-F1, governs the two 20E signal pulses during Drosophila metamorphosis (8Yamanaka N. Rewitz K.F.

The two 20E pulses are likely involved in the regulation of fat body cell dissociation in Drosophila: blockade of the 20E receptor prevents fat body cell dissociation (15Cherbas L. Hu X. Zhimulev I.

EcR isoforms in Drosophila: testing tissue-specific requirements by targeted blockage and rescue.Development. 2003; 130: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), whereas βftz-F1 overexpression induces Mmp2 expression and premature fat body cell dissociation (3Bond N.D.

Biol. 2011; 360: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, detailed studies are required to clarify the precise molecular mechanisms by which the two 20E pulses regulate fat body cell dissociation.

However, nothing is known about whether and how Kr-h1 mediates JH signals to inhibit fat body cell dissociation in Drosophila. During insect metamorphosis, a series of cellular events, including programmed cell death, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell dissociation, occurs in a context-specific manner. Previous investigations indicate all of the events are coordinately controlled by JH and 20E (7Riddiford L.M. Cherbas P. Truman J.W. Ecdysone receptors and their biological actions.Vitam. Horm. 2000; 60: 1-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jindra M. Palli S.R. Riddiford L.M. The juvenile hormone signaling pathway in insect development.Annu. Rev.

However, our current understanding of how the same two hormones induce different cellular processes at distinct, yet precise, developmental timing is very limited. Here, we discovered that JH and 20E coordinately and precisely control the developmental timing of Mmp–induced fat body cell dissociation in Drosophila at both the mRNA and enzymatic levels. This study provides an example to better understand hormonal regulation of tissue remodeling during insect metamorphosis. The developmental timing of fat body cell dissociation is strictly controlled in Drosophila and occurs only within a small window immediately before pupation, from 6 h APF to 12 h APF (1Nelliot A.

Mmp1 and Mmp2 cooperatively induce Drosophila fat body cell dissociation with distinct roles.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 7535Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous reports (19Abdou M.A. He Q. Wen D. Zyaan O. Wang J. Xu J. Baumann A.A. Joseph J. Wilson T.G. Li S. Wang J.

Likewise, the Kr-h1 mutant (Kr-h1k04411) showed enhanced fat body cell dissociation at 6 h APF. By contrast, fat body cell dissociation was inhibited at 12 h APF when Kr-h1 was specifically overexpressed in the fat body (Lsp2-Gal4>UAS-Kr-h1) (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). According to our previous study, Mmp1 and Mmp2 cooperatively induce Drosophila fat body cell dissociation, each assuming a distinct role (2Jia Q. Liu Y. Liu H. Li S. Mmp1 and Mmp2 cooperatively induce Drosophila fat body cell dissociation with distinct roles.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 7535Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether JH signaling prevents fat body cell dissociation by regulating Mmp expression. We performed a Western blot analysis (2Jia Q. Liu Y. Liu H. Li S. Mmp1 and Mmp2 cooperatively induce Drosophila fat body cell dissociation with distinct roles.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 7535Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and detected increased protein levels for both Mmps at 6 h APF in the fat body of animals lacking JH signaling, including Aug21-Gal4 > UAS-grim, Met27gce2.5k, and Kr-h1k04411, whereas protein levels decreased at 12 h APF in the fat body of the Kr-h1–overexpressing animals, Lsp2-GAL4 > UAS-Kr-h1 (Fig. 1B). Using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), we also detected up-regulated mRNA levels for both Mmps at 6 h APF in the fat body of animals lacking JH signaling and down-regulated mRNA levels at 12 h APF in the fat body of the Kr-h1–overexpressing animals (Fig. 1, C and D). After examining the role of Kr-h1 in regulating Mmp expression and fat body cell dissociation, we determined its developmental profile in the fat body. We previously reported that the JHRR-LacZ reporter recapitulates the responsiveness of Kr-h1 to JH and Met/gce (24He Q. Wen D. Jia Q. Cui C. Wang J. Palli S.R. Li S.

Chem. 2014; 289: 27874-27885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry indicated that JHRR-LacZ was non-detectable in the fat body of the feeding larvae, emerged upon the initiation of wandering (IW), peaked at 3 h after IW (AIW), gradually decreased from 6 h AIW to the white prepupal stage (WPP), and became barely detectable at 3 h APF (Fig. 1E). These results were consistent with previous reports describing developmental profiles for JH titers (21Wen D. Rivera-Perez C. Abdou M. Jia Q. He Q. Liu X. Zyaan O. Xu J. Bendena W.G. Tobe S.S. Noriega F.G. Palli S.R. Wang J. Li S.

Hormonal cross talk in insect development.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 6-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that the developmental profile of Kr-h1 expression was several hours delayed when compared with that of JHRR-LacZ. Kr-h1 mRNA levels in the fat body of w1118 animals gradually increased upon IW to 3 h APF but dramatically decreased thereafter (Fig. 1F). The developmental profile for Kr-h1 mRNA expression corroborates previous findings (22Minakuchi C. Zhou X. Riddiford L.M. Kruppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) mediates juvenile hormone action during metamorphosis of Drosophila melanogaster.Mech. Dev. 2008; 125: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 31Pecasse F. Beck Y. Ruiz C. Richards G. Kruppel-homolog, a stage-specific modulator of the prepupal ecdysone response, is essential for Drosophila metamorphosis.Dev. Biol. 2000; 221: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), indicating that it should be activated by both JH and 20E with overlapping effects. The detailed molecular mechanisms by which JH and 20E coordinately induce Kr-h1 expression warrant further investigation. Nevertheless, the experimental data show that the anti-metamorphic factor Kr-h1 transduces JH signaling to repress Mmp expression and prevent fat body cell dissociation during the larval–prepupal transition in Drosophila. We next examined whether Kr-h1 overexpression in Drosophila Kc cells represses Mmp expression to the same extent as that in the fat body. Although Mmp2 expression was not significantly repressed, the down-regulation of Mmp1 expression was significant (Fig. 2A). Thus, we focused on investigating how Kr-h1 represses Mmp1 expression in Kc cells. To identify the Kr-h1 response region in the Mmp1 promoter, we employed a dual luciferase assay system and Kc cells. A 3-kb promoter region of Mmp1 (−3000 to 0 upstream of the transcriptional start site) was cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector. Upon Kr-h1 overexpression, this promoter region exhibited ∼25% of the luciferase activity achieved with EGFP overexpression (Fig. 2B). Five truncated regions were also cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector, and Kr-h1 overexpression inhibited three truncated regions (−3000 to −1000, −2000 to 0, and −2000 to −1000) the same degree as the 3-kb promoter region (Fig. 2B). Considering some preliminary ChIP and qPCR results, we deleted two small fragments (−1770 to −1530 and −1473 to −1308) from the −2000 to −1000 region in the pGL3-Basic vector. Although the former construct still exhibited similar inhibitory responses, the latter showed no response to Kr-h1 overexpression (Fig. 2B). The −1473 to −1308 fragment was then cloned into the pGL3-promoter vector, which responded to Kr-h1 inhibition (Fig. 2C). KBSs were previously identified in the promoter regions of Br-C and E93 in the silkworm (27Kayukawa T. Nagamine K. Ito Y. Nishita Y. Ishikawa Y. Shinoda T.

Molecular mechanism underlying juvenile hormone-mediated repression of precocious larval-adult metamorphosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and we searched to determine whether the consensus sequence TGACCTNNNNYAAC was also conserved in the −1473 to −1308 region of the Drosophila Mmp1 promoter. We found a sequence, CTCAATAACCTATGCCACAT (−1407 to −1427), that was similar to the consensus sequence above (Fig. 2D). After the core consensus sequence TAACCTA was deleted from the −2000 to −1000 fragment-containing pGL3-Basic vector, the promoter region did not respond to Kr-h1 inhibition any longer (Fig. 2B). Then either one copy or four copies of CTCAATAACCTATGCCACAT were individually cloned into the pGL3-promoter vector. One copy of the sequence produced an inhibitory response similar to the −1473 to −1308 fragment, whereas four copies of the sequence resulted in luciferase activity that was reduced by half compared with that with EGFP overexpression (Fig. 2C), suggesting the sequence CTCAATAACCTATGCCACAT in the Mmp1 promoter is a KBS. To validate this hypothesis, we performed EMSA with three tandem repeats of CTCAATAACCTATGCCACAT and His tag–purified Kr-h1 protein. Importantly, Kr-h1 and CTCAATAACCTATGCCACAT formed a protein–DNA complex. In competition assays, the specific band disappeared upon the addition of 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled probe but not a nonspecific competitor (Fig. 2E). Thus, our experimental data identified a true KBS in the Mmp1 promoter. In conclusion, Kr-h1 transduces JH signaling to repress fat body cell dissociation through the direct inhibition of Mmp1 expression during the larval–prepupal transition. To better understand how the two 20E pulses regulate fat body cell dissociation during Drosophila metamorphosis, we first re-examined the roles of EcR and βftz-F1 in this process (3Bond N.D. Nelliot A. Bernardo M.K. Ayerh M.A. Gorski K.A. Hoshizaki D.K. Woodard C.T. βftz-F1 and matrix metalloproteinase 2 are required for fat-body remodeling in Drosophila.Dev.

When a dominant-negative mutant of EcR (EcRDN) was overexpressed (Lsp2-Gal4>UAS-EcRDN) or βftz-F1 expression was reduced by RNAi (Lsp2-Gal4>UAS-βftz-F1-dsRNA), fat body cell dissociation was inhibited at 12 h APF. By contrast, when βftz-F1 was overexpressed (Lsp2-Gal4>UAS-βftz-F1), fat body cell dissociation increased 10-fold at 6 h APF (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2).

This stress tolerance poses a risk for food safety, but relatively little is known about the molecular and cellular regulation of this adaptation mechanism. To determine the genetic components involved in Salmonella's cellular response to desiccation, we performed a global transcriptomic analysis comparing S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells equilibrated to low water activity (aw 0.11) and cells equilibrated to high water activity (aw 1.0). The analysis revealed that 719 genes were differentially regulated between the two conditions, of which 290 genes were up-regulated at aw 0.11. Most of these genes were involved in metabolic pathways, transporter regulation, DNA replication/repair, transcription and translation, and, more importantly, virulence genes. Among these, we decided to focus on the role of sopD and sseD. Deletion mutants were created and their ability to survive desiccation and exposure to aw 0.11 was compared to the wild-type strain and to an E. coli O157:H7 strain. The sopD and sseD mutants exhibited significant cell viability reductions of 2.5 and 1.3 Log (CFU/g), respectively, compared to the wild-type after desiccation for 4 days on glass beads. Additional viability differences of the mutants were observed after exposure to aw 0.11 for 7 days. E. coli O157:H7 lost viability similarly to the mutants. Scanning electron microscopy showed that both mutants displayed a different morphology compared to the wild-type and differences in production of the extracellular matrix under the same conditions. These findings suggested that sopD and sseD are required for Salmonella's survival during desiccation."

Prevalence of myopia defined as myopic refractive error of ≥-0.50 diopters (D),≥-1D,≥-6D,≥-8D and ≥-10D was 70.9%(95% confidence intervals (CI):70.5,71.4), 60.9% (95%CI:60.4,61.4), 8.6%(95%CI:8.4,8.9), 2.2%(95%CI:2.0,2.4), and 0.3% (95%CI:0.3,0.4), respectively. The frequency of high myopia (≥-6D, ≥-8D, ≥-10D) increased from 1.5% (95%CI:1.0,2.0), 0.4% (95%CI:0.1,0.6) and 0.1% (95%CI:0.00,0.02), respectively in 10-year-olds to 19.4% (95%CI:17.3,21.6), 5.2% (95%CI:4.0,6.4) and 0.9% (95%CI:0.4,1.5), respectively, in 18-year-olds. Mean refractive error in the 18-year-olds was -3.74±2.56D (median:-3.63D;range:-19.6D to + 6.25D). Higher prevalence of high myopia (≥-6D and ≥-8D) was correlated (all P<0.001) with older age (OR:1.18, and 1.15, respectively), female gender (OR: 1.44 and 1.40, respectively), higher body mass index (OR: 1.02 and 1.03, respectively), taller body height (OR: 1.03 and 1.02, respectively), urban region of habitation (OR: 1.26 and 1.33, respectively) and higher school type (OR:1.57 and 2.22, respectively). Prevalence of severe high myopia (≥-10D) was associated only with older age (P<0.001; OR: 1.44; 95%CI: 1.31, 1.59) but not with any education-related parameter such as higher school type (P = 0.48), urban region of habitation (P = 0.07) or female gender (P = 0.37).In this most recent survey, prevalence of high myopia (≥-6D:19.4%;≥-8D:5.2%;≥-10D:0.9%) in 18-year-old school children was higher than in previous surveys from mainland China.

In this study, we examine the impact of baseline and ongoing cannabis use, and whether these are impacted differentially by gender.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using anonymized electronic medical records from 58 clinics offering opioid agonist therapy in Ontario, Canada. One-year treatment retention was the primary outcome of interest and was measured for patients who did and did not have a cannabis positive urine sample in their first month of treatment, and as a function of the proportion of cannabis-positive urine samples throughout treatment.Our cohort consisted of 644 patients, 328 of which were considered baseline cannabis users and 256 considered heavy users. Patients with baseline cannabis use and heavy cannabis use were at increased risk of dropout (38.9% and 48.1%, respectively). When evaluating these trends by gender, only female baseline users and male heavy users are at increased risk of premature dropout.Both baseline and heavy cannabis use are predictive of decreased treatment retention, and differences do exist between genders. With cannabis being legalized in the near future, physicians should closely monitor cannabis-using patients and provide education surrounding the potential harms of using cannabis while receiving treatment for opioid use disorder."

https://openalex.org/W2767273310,"Background Reporting quality of randomized controlled trial (RCT) abstracts is important as readers often make their first judgments based on the abstracts. This study aims to assess the reporting quality of psychiatry RCT abstracts published before and after the release of Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for Abstracts (CONSORT-A) guidelines. Methods MEDLINE/PubMed search was conducted to identify psychiatric RCTs published during 2005–2007 (pre-CONSORT) and 2012–2014 (post-CONSORT). Two independent reviewers assessed abstracts using a 18-point overall quality score (OQS) based on the CONSORT-A guidelines. Linear regression analysis was conducted to analyze factors associated with reporting quality. Results Among 1,927 relevant articles, 285 pre-CONSORT and 214 post-CONSORT psychiatric RCT abstracts were included for analysis. The mean OQS improved from 6.9 (range: 3–13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.7–7.2) to 8.2 (range: 4–16; 95% CI: 7.8–8.5) after the CONSORT-A guidelines. Despite improvement, methods of randomization, allocation concealment, and funding source remained to be insufficiently reported (<5%) even after the release of CONSORT-A. High-impact general medical journals, multicenter design, positive outcome, and structured abstracts were associated with better reporting quality. Conclusions The reporting quality in psychiatric RCT abstracts, although improved, remains suboptimal. To improve reporting quality of psychiatry RCT abstracts, greater efforts by both investigators and journal editors are required to enhance better adherence to the CONSORT-A guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2767344641,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a major incretin that controls glucose homeostasis. The secretion of mature GLP-1 is regulated via GPCRs, including bile acid receptor G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1, which uses cAMP signaling to enhance the exocytosis of GLP-1-containing vesicles. However, the role of cAMP-mediated transcription has not been clearly demonstrated to date. In this study, we explored the role of cAMP response element-binding protein/CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CREB/CRTC2)-dependent transcription on GLP-1 secretion in the L cells. We found that the reduced CREB/CRTC2 activity impaired the cAMP-dependent increase in GLP-1 secretion, whereas expression of constitutively active CRTC2 increased GLP-1 exocytosis from the L cells. Close investigation revealed that expression of not only proglucagon but also PC1/3, an endopeptidase for GLP-1 maturation, is transcriptionally regulated by CREB/CRTC2. Furthermore, expression of peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor coactivator 1 α is also reduced upon depletion of CRTC2, leading to the decreased expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) genes, reduced ATP levels, and calcium concentrations in the L cells. Finally, we observed that intestine-specific CRTC2 knockout mice displayed reduced GLP-1 expression, leading to the lower plasma GLP-1 levels, impaired glucose tolerance, and decreased insulin-containing β cells in pancreatic islets.

By changing the conformation of its protein substrates, PIN1 increases the activities of key proteins that promote cell cycle progression and oncogenesis. Moreover, it has been shown that PIN1 stabilizes and increases the level of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27, which inhibits cell cycle progression by binding cyclin A– and cyclin E–CDK2. Notwithstanding the associated increase in the p27 level, PIN1 expression promotes rather than retards cell proliferation. To explain the paradoxical effects of PIN1 on p27 levels and cell cycle progression, we hypothesized that PIN1 relieves CDK2 inhibition by suppressing the CDK inhibitory activity of p27. Here, we confirmed that PIN1-expressing cells exhibit higher p27 levels but have increased CDK2 activities and higher proliferation rates in the S-phase compared with Pin1-null fibroblasts or PIN1-depleted hepatoma cells. Using co-immunoprecipitation and CDK kinase activity assays, we found that PIN1 binds the phosphorylated Thr187–Pro motif in p27 and reduces p27’s interaction with cyclin A– or cyclin E–CDK2, leading to increased CDK2 kinase activity.

In a novel task that borrows elements of the ‘word superiority’ and ‘word inversion’ paradigms, we investigate whether holistic word recognition is impaired in dyslexia. In Experiment 1 students with dyslexia and controls judged the similarity of pairs of 6- and 7-letter words or pairs of words whose letters had been partially jumbled. The stimuli were presented in both upright and inverted form with orthographic regularity and orientation randomized from trial to trial. While both groups showed sensitivity to orthographic regularity, both word inversion and letter jumbling were more detrimental to skilled than dyslexic readers supporting the idea that the latter may read in a more analytic fashion. Experiment 2 employed the same task but using shorter, 4- and 5-letter words and a design where orthographic regularity and stimuli orientation was held constant within experimental blocks to encourage the use of either holistic or analytic processing. While there was no difference in reaction time between the dyslexic and control groups for inverted stimuli, the students with dyslexia were significantly slower than controls for upright stimuli. These findings suggest that holistic word recognition, which is largely based on the detection of orthographic regularity, is impaired in dyslexia."
https://openalex.org/W2767950681,"The hypoxic response is a stress response triggered by low oxygen tension. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play a prominent role in the pathobiology of hypoxia-associated conditions, including pulmonary hypertension (PH) and polycythemia. The c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), a stress-activated protein kinase that consists of two ubiquitously expressed isoforms, JNK1 and JNK2, and a tissue-specific isoform, JNK3, has been shown to be activated by hypoxia. However, the physiological role of JNK1 and JNK2 in the hypoxic response remains elusive. Here, using genetic knockout cells and/or mice, we show that JNK2, but not JNK1, up-regulates the expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α and contributes to hypoxia-induced PH and polycythemia. Knockout or silencing of JNK2, but not JNK1, prevented the accumulation of HIF-1α in hypoxia-treated cells. Loss of JNK2 resulted in a decrease in HIF-1α and HIF-2α mRNA levels under resting conditions and in response to hypoxia. Consequently, hypoxia-treated Jnk2−/− mice had reduced erythropoiesis and were less prone to polycythemia because of decreased expression of the HIF target gene erythropoietin (Epo). Jnk2−/− mice were also protected from hypoxia-induced PH, as indicated by lower right ventricular systolic pressure, a process that depends on HIF. Taken together, our results suggest that JNK2 is a positive regulator of HIFs and therefore may contribute to HIF-dependent pathologies. The hypoxic response is a stress response triggered by low oxygen tension. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play a prominent role in the pathobiology of hypoxia-associated conditions, including pulmonary hypertension (PH) and polycythemia. The c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), a stress-activated protein kinase that consists of two ubiquitously expressed isoforms, JNK1 and JNK2, and a tissue-specific isoform, JNK3, has been shown to be activated by hypoxia. However, the physiological role of JNK1 and JNK2 in the hypoxic response remains elusive. Here, using genetic knockout cells and/or mice, we show that JNK2, but not JNK1, up-regulates the expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α and contributes to hypoxia-induced PH and polycythemia. Knockout or silencing of JNK2, but not JNK1, prevented the accumulation of HIF-1α in hypoxia-treated cells. Loss of JNK2 resulted in a decrease in HIF-1α and HIF-2α mRNA levels under resting conditions and in response to hypoxia. Consequently, hypoxia-treated Jnk2−/− mice had reduced erythropoiesis and were less prone to polycythemia because of decreased expression of the HIF target gene erythropoietin (Epo). Jnk2−/− mice were also protected from hypoxia-induced PH, as indicated by lower right ventricular systolic pressure, a process that depends on HIF. Taken together, our results suggest that JNK2 is a positive regulator of HIFs and therefore may contribute to HIF-dependent pathologies."

https://openalex.org/W2767319512,"RhoGC is a fusion protein from the aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii, combining a type I rhodopsin domain with a guanylyl cyclase domain. It has generated excitement as an optogenetics tool for the manipulation of cyclic nucleotide signaling pathways. To investigate the regulation of the cyclase activity, we isolated the guanylyl cyclase domain from Escherichia coli with (GCwCCRho) and without (GCRho) the coiled-coil linker. Both constructs were constitutively active but were monomeric as determined by size-exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation, whereas other class III nucleotidyl cyclases are functional dimers. We also observed that crystals of GCRho have only a monomer in an asymmetric unit. Dimers formed when crystals were grown in the presence of the non-cyclizable substrate analog 2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine-5′-triphosphate, MnCl2, and tartrate, but their quaternary structure did not conform to the canonical pairing expected for class III enzymes. Moreover, the structure contained a disulfide bond formed with an active-site Cys residue required for activity. We consider it unlikely that the disulfide would form under intracellular reducing conditions, raising the possibility that this unusual dimer might have a biologically relevant role in the regulation of full-length RhoGC. Although we did not observe it with direct methods, a functional dimer was identified as the active state by following the dependence of activity on total enzyme concentration. The low affinity observed for GCRho monomers is unusual for this enzyme class and suggests that dimer formation may contribute to light activation of the full-length protein."

https://openalex.org/W2750884562,"Inferring the directionality of interactions between cellular processes is a major challenge in systems biology. Time-lagged correlations allow to discriminate between alternative models, but they still rely on assumed underlying interactions. Here, we use the transfer entropy (TE), an information-theoretic quantity that quantifies the directional influence between fluctuating variables in a model-free way. We present a theoretical approach to compute the transfer entropy, even when the noise has an extrinsic component or in the presence of feedback. We re-analyze the experimental data from Kiviet et al. (2014) where fluctuations in gene expression of metabolic enzymes and growth rate have been measured in single cells of E. coli. We confirm the formerly detected modes between growth and gene expression, while prescribing more stringent conditions on the structure of noise sources. We furthermore point out practical requirements in terms of length of time series and sampling time which must be satisfied in order to infer optimally transfer entropy from times series of fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W2767444519,"The rapid spreading of polymyxin E (colistin) resistance among bacterial strains through the horizontally transmissible mcr-1 and mcr-2 plasmids has become a serious concern. The emergence of these genes in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), a group of human pathogenic bacteria was even more worrisome, urging us to investigate the prevalence of mcr genes among STEC isolates. A total of 1000 STEC isolates, recovered from livestock, wildlife, produce and other environmental sources in a major production region for leafy vegetables in California during 2006–2014, were screened by PCR for the presence of plasmid-borne mcr-1 and mcr-2. All isolates tested yielded negative results, indicating if any, the occurrence rate of mcr-1/mcr-2 among STEC was very low in this agricultural region. This study provides valuable information such as sample size needed and methodologies for future surveillance programs of antimicrobial resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2768072517,"8-oxoG, a common DNA lesion resulting from reactive oxygen species (ROS), has been shown to be associated with cancer initiation. hOGG1 DNA glycosylase is the primary enzyme responsible for excision of 8-oxoG through base excision repair (BER). Integrins are members of a family of cell surface receptors that mediate the cell-cell and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. Integrins are involved in almost every aspect of carcinogenesis, from cell differentiation, cell proliferation, metastasis to angiogenesis. Loss of ITGA2 expression was associated with enhanced tumor intravasation and metastasis of breast and colon cancer. XPD gene encodes DNA helicase enzyme that is involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). It is shown in previous research that XPD homozygous wildtype Lys/Lys genotype was associated with higher odds of NPC.We conducted a 1 to N case-control study involving 300 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cases and 533 controls matched by age, gender and ethnicity to investigate the effect of hOGG1 Ser326Cys, ITGA2 C807T and XPD Lys751Gln polymorphisms on NPC risk. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis were conducted to explore the association of allele combinations with NPC risk. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP-PCR) was used for DNA genotyping.No significant association was observed between hOGG1 Ser326Cys and ITGA2 C807T polymorphisms with NPC risk after adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, cigarette smoking, alcohol and salted fish consumption. Lys/Lys genotype of XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism was associated with increased NPC risk (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.06-2.43). Subjects with history of smoking (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.26-2.60), and salted fish consumption before age of 10 (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.30-2.42) were observed to have increased odds of NPC. The odds of developing NPC of CGC haplotype was significantly higher compared to reference AGC haplotype (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.06-4.58).The allele combination of CGC from hOGG1, ITGA2 and XPD polymorphisms was significantly associated with increased odds of NPC."

https://openalex.org/W2767754387,"Ubiquitination is a crucial post-translational modification that can target proteins for degradation. The E3 ubiquitin ligases are responsible for recognizing substrate proteins for ubiquitination, hence providing specificity to the process of protein degradation. Here, we describe a genetic modifier screen that identified E3 ligases that modified the rough-eye phenotype generated by expression of cindrRNAi transgenes during Drosophila eye development. In total, we identified 36 E3 ligases, as well as 4 Cullins, that modified the mild cindrRNA mis-patterning phenotype. This indicates possible roles for these E3s/Cullins in processes that require Cindr function, including cytoskeletal regulation, cell adhesion, cell signaling and cell survival. Three E3 ligases identified in our screen had previously been linked to regulating JNK signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2767503392,"With the development of high-throughput genomic analysis, sequencing a mouse primary cancer model provides a new opportunity to understand fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis and progression. Here, we characterized the genomic variations in a hepatitis-related primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model. A total of 12 tumor sections and four adjacent non-tumor tissues from four mice were used for whole exome and/or whole genome sequencing and validation of genotyping. The functions of the mutated genes in tumorigenesis were studied by analyzing their mutation frequency and expression in clinical HCC samples. A total of 46 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were detected within coding regions. All SNVs were only validated in the sequencing samples, except the Hras mutation, which was shared by three tumors in the M1 mouse. However, the mutated allele frequency varied from high (0.4) to low (0.1), and low frequency (0.1-0.2) mutations existed in almost every tumor. Together with a diploid karyotype and an equal distribution pattern of these SNVs within the tumor, these results suggest the existence of subclones within tumors. A total of 26 mutated genes were mapped to 17 terms describing different molecular and cellular functions. All 41 human homologs of the mutated genes were mutated in the clinical samples, and some mutations were associated with clinical outcomes, suggesting a high probability of cancer driver genes in the spontaneous tumors of the mouse model. Genomic sequencing shows that a few mutations can drive the independent origin of primary liver tumors and reveals high heterogeneity among tumors in the early stage of hepatitis-related primary hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2767830804,"Cruveilhier described in 1834 the human flexor pollicis brevis (FPB), a muscle of the thenar compartment, as having a superficial and a deep head, respectively, inserted onto the radial and ulnar sesamoids of the thumb. Since then, Cruveilhier’s deep head has been controversially discussed. Often this deep head is confused with Henle’s “interosseous palmaris volaris” or said to be a slip of the oblique adductor pollicis. In the 1960s, Day and Napier described anatomical variations of the insertions of Cruveilhier’s deep head, including its absence, and hypothesized, that the shift of the deep head’s insertion from ulnar to radial facilitated “true opposability” in anthropoids. Their general thesis for muscular arrangements underlying the power and precision grip is sound, but they did not delineate their deep head from Henle’s muscle or the adductor pollicis, and their description of the attachments of Cruveilhier’s deep head were too vague and not supported by a significant portion of the anatomical literature. Here, we reinvestigated Cruveilhier’s deep head to resolve the controversy about it and because many newer anatomy textbooks do not describe this muscle, while it is often an obvious functionally (writing, texting, precision grip) and clinically significant thenar muscle. For the first time, we empirically delineated Cruveilhier’s deep head from neighboring muscles with which it was previously confused. We observed 100% occurrence of the uncontested deep head in 80 human hands, displaying a similar variability of insertions as Day and Napier, but in significantly different numbers. Furthermore, we found variability in the origin and included as important landmarks the trapezoid and the ligamentum carpi radiatum. We tested the assertion regarding the evolutionary morphology and its role in the improvements in thumb movements during various precision grips. Our overall conclusions differ with respect to the developmental and evolutionary origin of the FPB heads."
