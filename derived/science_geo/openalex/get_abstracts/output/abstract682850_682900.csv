https://openalex.org/W3205911129,"Aim The long-term stress, anxiety and job burnout experienced by healthcare workers (HCWs) are important to consider as the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic stresses healthcare systems globally. The primary objective was to examine the changes in the proportion of HCWs reporting stress, anxiety, and job burnout over six months during the peak of the pandemic in Singapore. The secondary objective was to examine the extent that objective job characteristics, HCW-perceived job factors, and HCW personal resources were associated with stress, anxiety, and job burnout. Method A sample of HCWs (doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, administrative and operations staff; N = 2744) was recruited via invitation to participate in an online survey from four tertiary hospitals. Data were gathered between March-August 2020, which included a 2-month lockdown period. HCWs completed monthly web-based self-reported assessments of stress (Perceived Stress Scale-4), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and job burnout (Physician Work Life Scale). Results The majority of the sample consisted of female HCWs (81%) and nurses (60%). Using random-intercept logistic regression models, elevated perceived stress, anxiety and job burnout were reported by 33%, 13%, and 24% of the overall sample at baseline respectively. The proportion of HCWs reporting stress and job burnout increased by approximately 1·0% and 1·2% respectively per month. Anxiety did not significantly increase. Working long hours was associated with higher odds, while teamwork and feeling appreciated at work were associated with lower odds, of stress, anxiety, and job burnout. Conclusions Perceived stress and job burnout showed a mild increase over six months, even after exiting the lockdown. Teamwork and feeling appreciated at work were protective and are targets for developing organizational interventions to mitigate expected poor outcomes among frontline HCWs."
https://openalex.org/W3210539052,"The brain exhibits distinct patterns of recurrent activity closely related to behavioral state. The neural mechanisms that underlie state-dependent activity in the awake animal are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that two types of state-dependent activity, rapid arousal/movement-related signals and a 3–5 Hz alpha-like rhythm, in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice strongly correlate with activity in the visual thalamus. Inactivation of V1 does not interrupt arousal/movement signals in most visual thalamic neurons, but it abolishes the 3–5 Hz oscillation. Silencing of the visual thalamus similarly eradicates the alpha-like rhythm and perturbs arousal/movement-related activation in V1. Intracellular recordings in thalamic neurons reveal the 3–5 Hz oscillation to be associated with rhythmic low-threshold Ca2+ spikes. Our results indicate that thalamocortical interactions through ionotropic signaling, together with cell-intrinsic properties of thalamocortical cells, play a crucial role in shaping state-dependent activity in V1 of the awake animal."
https://openalex.org/W3208428791,"Thermoregulatory behavior is a basic motivated behavior for body temperature homeostasis. Despite its fundamental importance, a forebrain region or defined neural population required for this process has yet to be established. Here, we show that Vgat-expressing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LHVgat neurons) are required for diverse thermoregulatory behaviors. The population activity of LHVgat neurons is increased during thermoregulatory behavior and bidirectionally encodes thermal punishment and reward (P&R). Although this population also regulates feeding and caloric reward, inhibition of parabrachial inputs selectively impaired thermoregulatory behaviors and encoding of thermal stimulus by LHVgat neurons. Furthermore, two-photon calcium imaging revealed a subpopulation of LHVgat neurons bidirectionally encoding thermal P&R, which is engaged during thermoregulatory behavior, but is largely distinct from caloric reward-encoding LHVgat neurons. Our data establish LHVgat neurons as a required neural substrate for behavioral thermoregulation and point to the key role of the thermal P&R-encoding LHVgat subpopulation in thermoregulatory behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3166546750,"Moral foundations theory posits five moral foundations, however 5-factor models provide poor fit to the data. Here, in five studies, each with large samples (total N = 11,496), we construct and replicate a well-fitting model of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ). In study 1 (N = 2,271) we tested previously theorised models, confirming none provide adequate fit. We then developed a well-fitting model of the MFQ. In this model, the fairness/reciprocity and harm/care foundations were preserved intact. The binding foundations, however, divided into five, rather than the original three foundations. Purity/sanctity split into independent foundations of purity and sanctity. Similarly, Ingroup/loyalty divided into independent factors of loyalty to clan and loyalty to country. Authority/respect was re-focussed on hierarchy, losing one item to the new sanctity foundation and another into loyalty to country. In addition to these 7 foundations, higher-level factors of binding and individualizing were supported, along with a general/acquiescence factor. Finally, a “moral tilt” factor corresponding to coordinated left-leaning vs. right-leaning moral patterns was supported. We validated the model in four additional studies, testing replication of the 7-foundation model in data including from US, Australia, and China (total N = 9,225). The model replicated with good fit found in all four samples. These findings demonstrate the first well-fitting replicable model of the MFQ. They also highlight the importance of modelling measurement structure, and reveal important additional foundations, and structure (binding, individualizing, tilt) above the foundations."
https://openalex.org/W3205239798,"Aims Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion can be estimated by multiple indices from fasting blood samples or blood samples obtained during oral glucose tolerance tests. The test-retest reliability of these indices in repeated measurements within the same individuals can strongly vary. Methods We analyzed data of persons without diabetes who underwent two repeated OGTTs. For each measurement pair, we calculated multiple commonly used indices for the assessment of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. We then evaluated the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) and discriminant ratio for each index. Results 89 persons underwent two OGTTs with a median interval of 86 days (IQR 64–249). Among indices of insulin sensitivity derived from fasting blood samples, the revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index had the smallest coefficient of variation (2.8 ± 2.1%) whereas the C-peptide based homeostasis model assessment 2 had the highest discriminant ratio (1.97 (1.65–2.39)). As for insulin sensitivity indices that are based on OGTT, the oral glucose insulin sensitivity index had the smallest coefficient of variation (6.5 ± 5.1%). The highest discriminant ratio was found for the non-esterified fatty acids-based insulin sensitivity index (NEFA-ISI, 2.70 (2.30–3.22)). For the assessment of insulin secretion from fasting variables, the lowest mean coefficient of variation was found for C-peptide based homeostasis model assessment 2 beta with 10.8 ± 8% and the highest discriminant ratio for the C-peptide / Glucose-Ratio (2.18 (1.84–2.63)). Among indices assessing insulin secretion from an OGTT, the lowest coefficient of variation was found for the ratio of the areas under the C-peptide and glucose curves from 0 to 120 minutes with 11.3 ± 9.7%. Conclusion The data reveal large differences in the reproducibility and the discrimination capability of different indices that assess insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion. Our findings can aid the selection of an appropriate index in clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W3205450755,"Oncogenic KRAS drives cancer growth by activating diverse signaling networks, not all of which have been fully delineated. We set out to establish a system-wide profile of the KRAS-regulated kinase signaling network (kinome) in KRAS-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We knocked down KRAS expression in a panel of six cell lines and then applied multiplexed inhibitor bead/MS to monitor changes in kinase activity and/or expression. We hypothesized that depletion of KRAS would result in downregulation of kinases required for KRAS-mediated transformation and in upregulation of other kinases that could potentially compensate for the deleterious consequences of the loss of KRAS. We identified 15 upregulated and 13 downregulated kinases in common across the panel of cell lines. In agreement with our hypothesis, all 15 of the upregulated kinases have established roles as cancer drivers (e.g., SRC, TGF-β1, ILK), and pharmacological inhibition of one of these upregulated kinases, DDR1, suppressed PDAC growth. Interestingly, 11 of the 13 downregulated kinases have established driver roles in cell cycle progression, particularly in mitosis (e.g., WEE1, Aurora A, PLK1). Consistent with a crucial role for the downregulated kinases in promoting KRAS-driven proliferation, we found that pharmacological inhibition of WEE1 also suppressed PDAC growth. The unexpected paradoxical activation of ERK upon WEE1 inhibition led us to inhibit both WEE1 and ERK concurrently, which caused further potent growth suppression and enhanced apoptotic death compared with WEE1 inhibition alone. We conclude that system-wide delineation of the KRAS-regulated kinome can identify potential therapeutic targets for KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer.

We conclude that system-wide delineation of the KRAS-regulated kinome can identify potential therapeutic targets for KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of 10% (1Siegel R.L. Miller K.D. Fuchs H.E. Jemal A. Cancer statistics, 2021.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2021; 71: 7-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (5546) Google Scholar). Despite significant advances in our understanding of the genetic and molecular drivers of PDAC (2Network C.G.A.R. Integrated genomic characterization of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Cancer Cell. 2017; 32: 185-203.e113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), effective targeted therapies are still lacking. Current standards of care are comprised of conventional cytotoxic drugs (3Roth M.T. Cardin D.B. Berlin J.D. Recent advances in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.F1000Res. 2020; 9 (F1000 Faculty Rev-131)Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mutational activation of the KRAS oncogene is the initiating genetic event and is found in 95% of PDACs (4Stalnecker C.A. Der C.J. RAS, wanted dead or alive: Advances in targeting RAS mutant cancers.Sci. Signal. 2020; 13eaay6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There is now substantial experimental evidence that KRAS is essential for the maintenance of PDAC growth, and consequently, the National Cancer Institute has identified the development of anti-KRAS therapeutic strategies as one of the four major initiatives in the field (https://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/ctac/archive/0313/PCwgReport.pdf). Recent early stage clinical findings with direct inhibitors of one KRAS mutant, G12C, support the potential clinical impact of an effective KRAS inhibitor (5Hallin J. Engstrom L.D. Hargis L. Calinisan A. Aranda R. Briere D.M. Sudhakar N. Bowcut V. Baer B.R. Ballard J.A. Burkard M.R. Fell J.B. Fischer J.P. Vigers G.P. Xue Y. et al.The KRAS(G12C) inhibitor MRTX849 provides insight toward therapeutic susceptibility of KRAS-mutant cancers in mouse models and patients.Cancer Discov. 2020; 10: 54-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 6Canon J. Rex K. Saiki A.Y. Mohr C. Cooke K. Bagal D. Gaida K. Holt T. Knutson C.G. Koppada N. Lanman B.A. Werner J. Rapaport A.S. San Miguel T. Ortiz R. et al.The clinical KRAS(G12C) inhibitor AMG 510 drives anti-tumour immunity.Nature. 2019; 575: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). However, while KRASG12C mutations are common in lung adenocarcinoma, they comprise only 2% of KRAS mutations in PDAC (4Stalnecker C.A. Der C.J. RAS, wanted dead or alive: Advances in targeting RAS mutant cancers.Sci. Signal. 2020; 13eaay6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Waters A.M. Der C.J. Kras: The critical driver and therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2018; 8a031435Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Therefore, indirect strategies to block aberrant KRAS signaling remain arguably the best approach for the majority of KRAS-mutant PDAC (8Papke B. Der C.J. Drugging RAS: Know the enemy.Science. 2017; 355: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). One key approach is to inhibit downstream effector signaling. Of the multitude of KRAS effectors, at least four are validated drivers of KRAS-dependent PDAC growth (7Waters A.M. Der C.J. Kras: The critical driver and therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2018; 8a031435Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The best characterized and potentially most crucial is the RAF–mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)–ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. That activated Braf can phenocopy mutant Kras and, together with Tp53 mutations, drive full development of metastatic PDAC in mouse models, which supports the key role of the MAPK cascade in driving Kras-dependent PDAC growth (9Collisson E.A. Trejo C.L. Silva J.M. Gu S. Korkola J.E. Heiser L.M. Charles R.P. Rabinovich B.A. Hann B. Dankort D. Spellman P.T. Phillips W.A. Gray J.W. McMahon M. A central role for RAF-->MEK-->ERK signaling in the genesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). While the substrates of RAF and MEK kinases are highly restricted, ERK1/2 serine/threonine kinase activation can cause direct or indirect phosphorylation of a diverse spectrum of more than one thousand proteins (10Unal E.B. Uhlitz F. Bluthgen N. A compendium of ERK targets.FEBS Lett. 2017; 591: 2607-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since ERK substrates include other protein kinases (e.g., ribosomal S6 kinases 1–4, MAPK-interacting kinase 2, and mitogen- and stress-activated kinases 1/2), ERK activation can regulate a highly diverse phosphoproteome (11Cargnello M. Roux P.P. Activation and function of the MAPKs and their substrates, the MAPK-activated protein kinases.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2011; 75: 50-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). However, the specific components are context dependent, and the ERK-regulated phosphoproteome downstream of KRAS in PDAC is not well delineated. The second best characterized KRAS effectors are PI3Ks (12Castellano E. Downward J. RAS interaction with PI3K: More than just another effector pathway.Genes Cancer. 2011; 2: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). KRAS activation of PI3K promotes formation of phosphatidylinositol-(3–5)-triphosphate, leading to activation of the AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) serine/threonine kinases. Activation of PI3K–AKT–mTOR signaling has also been observed as a compensatory response to ERK inhibition, driving resistance to ERK MAPK inhibitors (13Hayes T.K. Neel N.F. Hu C. Gautam P. Chenard M. Long B. Aziz M. Kassner M. Bryant K.L. Pierobon M. Marayati R. Kher S. George S.D. Xu M.

Hayden J.E. et al.Acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors mediated by a RAF kinase switch in melanoma can be overcome by cotargeting MEK and IGF-1R/PI3K.Cancer Cell. 2010; 18: 683-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Thus, concurrent PI3K inhibition synergistically enhances the antitumor activity of ERK MAPK inhibitors (9Collisson E.A. Trejo C.L. Silva J.M. Gu S. Korkola J.E. Heiser L.M. Charles R.P. Rabinovich B.A. Hann B. Dankort D. Spellman P.T. Phillips W.A. Gray J.W. McMahon M. A central role for RAF-->MEK-->ERK signaling in the genesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Other key KRAS effectors include the RAL (RAS like) and RAC small GTPases, which activate TANK-binding kinase 1 and p21-activated kinase serine/threonine kinases (7Waters A.M. Der C.J. Kras: The critical driver and therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2018; 8a031435Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). With their high tractability as therapeutic targets, these and other protein kinase components of KRAS effector signaling have been pursued as indirect approaches to KRAS inhibition (15Furuse J. Nagashima F. Emerging protein kinase inhibitors for treating pancreatic cancer.Expert Opin. Emerg. Drugs. 2017; 22: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We propose that still other kinases may also be of interest as targets in KRAS-mutant PDAC. In addition, a limitation of essentially all targeted anticancer therapies is the onset of treatment-induced acquired resistance (16Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Compensatory pathways in oncogenic kinase signaling and resistance to targeted therapies: Six degrees of separation.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Murray B.W. Miller N. Durability of kinase-directed therapies–A network perspective on response and resistance.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2015; 14: 1975-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In response to pharmacological inhibition of a key cancer driver, cancer cells can induce a complex array of responses that functionally compensate for target inhibition. One major mechanism of resistance is loss of the negative feedback signaling that tempers the strength of growth regulatory signaling networks (18Terrell E.M. Morrison D.K. Ras-mediated activation of the Raf family kinases.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2019; 9a033746Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For example, although aberrant ERK activation can drive cancer growth, excessive ERK activity is deleterious, causing growth cessation through induction of senescence or apoptosis (19Unni A.M. Lockwood W.W. Zejnullahu K. Lee-Lin S.Q. Varmus H. Evidence that synthetic lethality underlies the mutual exclusivity of oncogenic KRAS and EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma.Elife. 2015; 4e06907Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Unni A.M. Harbourne B. Oh M.H. Wild S. Ferrarone J.R. Lockwood W.W. Varmus H. Hyperactivation of ERK by multiple mechanisms is toxic to RTK-RAS mutation-driven lung adenocarcinoma cells.Elife. 2018; 7e33718Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Ambrogio C. Barbacid M. Santamaria D. In vivo oncogenic conflict triggered by co-existing KRAS and EGFR activating mutations in lung adenocarcinoma.Oncogene. 2017; 36: 2309-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, a multitude of ERK-dependent negative feedback loops exist to dampen ERK activity (22Lake D. Correa S.A. Muller J. Negative feedback regulation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2016; 73: 4397-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Thus, upon pharmacological inhibition of ERK, loss of ERK-dependent negative feedback leads to ERK reactivation to overcome inhibitor action. Similar responses are also seen upon inhibition of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway (23Chandarlapaty S. Negative feedback and adaptive resistance to the targeted therapy of cancer.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An important strategy to improve the long-term efficacy of targeted therapies is the elucidation of treatment-induced resistance mechanisms, which can then be used to identify drug combinations capable of blocking or even reversing the onset of resistance. Unbiased system-wide screening methods applied for this purpose include powerful genetic approaches such as CRISPR- or RNAi-mediated loss of function or complementary DNA (cDNA) overexpression/activation gain-of-function screens (24Wood K.C. Mapping the pathways of resistance to targeted therapies.Cancer Res. 2015; 75: 4247-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For example, a CRISPR–Cas9 screen demonstrated that ERK reactivation is a primary mechanism limiting the efficacy of KRASG12C inhibitors (25Lou K. Steri V. Ge A.Y. Hwang Y.C. Yogodzinski C.H. Shkedi A.R. Choi A.L.M. Mitchell D.C. Swaney D.L. Hann B. Gordan J.D. Shokat K.M. Gilbert L.A. KRAS(G12C) inhibition produces a driver-limited state revealing collateral dependencies.Sci. Signal. 2019; 12eaaw9450Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These findings have guided initiation of ongoing clinical trials to evaluate KRASG12C inhibitors in combination with inhibitors that act either upstream (e.g., on epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], SH2 domain–containing phosphatase-2 [SHP2], SOS1 [SOS Ras/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1]) or downstream (e.g., on MEK) of KRAS (NCT03600883, NCT04185883, and NCT04330664). Similarly, Wood et al. (24Wood K.C. Mapping the pathways of resistance to targeted therapies.Cancer Res. 2015; 75: 4247-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) applied an activated signaling expression library to identify both known and novel mechanisms that drive resistance to ERK MAPK inhibitors (26Martz C.A. Ottina K.A. Singleton K.R. Jasper J.S. Wardell S.E. Peraza-Penton A. Anderson G.R. Winter P.S. Wang T. Alley H.M. Kwong L.N. Cooper Z.A. Tetzlaff M. Chen P.L. Rathmell J.C. et al.Systematic identification of signaling pathways with potential to confer anticancer drug resistance.Sci. Signal. 2014; 7ra121Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In a complementary approach, our chemical library screen demonstrated that concurrent inhibition of other ERK MAPK components, to block compensatory ERK reactivation, synergistically enhanced the efficacy of RAF inhibitors in KRAS-mutant PDAC (27Ozkan-Dagliyan I. Diehl J.N. George S.D. Schaefer A. Papke B. Klotz-Noack K. Waters A.M. Goodwin C.M. Gautam P. Pierobon M. Peng S. Gilbert T.S.K. Lin K.H. Dagliyan O. Wennerberg K. et al.Low-dose vertical inhibition of the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade causes apoptotic death of KRAS mutant cancers.Cell Rep. 2020; 31107764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In light of the key role of kinome reprogramming in driving resistance, it is crucial to be able to detect changes in kinase activity and/or expression in response to pharmacological inhibition of an oncogenic signaling driver. Chemical proteomics is a particularly powerful experimental technique that enables kinome-wide profiling of these changes. One version of this type of assay, multiplexed inhibitor bead (MIB)/MS, incorporates MIBs, coupled to MS (28Bantscheff M. Hopf C. Kruse U. Drewes G. Proteomics-based strategies in kinase drug discovery.Ernst. Schering Found. Symp. Proc. 2007; : 1-28PubMed Google Scholar). MIBs, comprised of broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors covalently coupled to Sepharose beads, can be used to monitor protein kinase expression and/or activation, where MIB-associated kinases are identified by MS. In our initial application of MIB/MS, we identified activation of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in response to MEK inhibitor (MEKi) treatment that may drive MEKi resistance in KRAS-mutant breast cancer (29Duncan J.S. Whittle M.C. Nakamura K. Abell A.N. Midland A.A. Zawistowski J.S. Johnson N.L. Granger D.A. Jordan N.V. Darr D.B. Usary J. Kuan P.F. Smalley D.M. Major B. He X. et al.Dynamic reprogramming of the kinome in response to targeted MEK inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer.Cell. 2012; 149: 307-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Accordingly, concurrent inhibition of RTKs and MEK more effectively impaired transformed and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo than MEKi alone. We have also applied MIB/MS to identify novel inhibitors of chemotherapy-resistant PDAC (30Krulikas L.J. McDonald I.M. Lee B. Okumu D.O. East M.P. Gilbert T.S.K. Herring L.E. Golitz B.T. Wells C.I.

Herring L.E. Haar L.L. Gilbert T.S.K. Goldfarb D. Richards K.L. Graves L.M. Lawrence D.S. Dasatinib is preferentially active in the activated B-cell subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.J. Proteome Res. 2019; 18: 522-534PubMed Google Scholar), and identify EGFR/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 activation of the MEK5–ERK5 MAPK cascade as compensatory response to ERK1/2 inhibition, which drives resistance to ERK inhibitor (ERKi) treatment by stabilizing the MYC oncoprotein (32Vaseva A.V. Blake D.R. Gilbert T.S.K. Ng S. Hostetter G. Azam S.H. Ozkan-Dagliyan I. Gautam P. Bryant K.L. Pearce K.H. Herring L.E. Han H. Graves L.M. Witkiewicz A.K.

In the present study, we hypothesized that a system-wide delineation of KRAS-regulated kinases can identify therapeutic targets that may not have been considered based on our current knowledge of KRAS effector signaling networks. We speculated that KRAS may require additional kinases beyond the classical RAF–MEK–ERK and PI3K–AKT–mTOR effector pathways to promote its transforming functions, and that these would be downregulated upon KRAS depletion. In contrast, we anticipated that yet other kinases would be upregulated as compensatory responses to this depletion. Thus, identification of both upregulated as well as downregulated kinases may establish novel targets for anti-KRAS therapies. We therefore applied the kinome-wide MIB/MS assay to elucidate an unbiased profile of the KRAS-dependent kinome in PDAC. Our strategy further elucidates the complex spectrum of protein kinases functionally linked to aberrant KRAS activation and identifies unanticipated signaling vulnerabilities and potential therapeutic approaches for PDAC. Although oncogenic KRAS effector signaling activates the ERK MAPK cascade and other protein kinases, we speculated that the full spectrum of KRAS-regulated protein kinases remained to be elucidated. To gain a full understanding of the KRAS-dependent kinome in KRAS-mutant PDAC, we suppressed KRAS expression in a panel of six KRAS-mutant PDAC cell lines using validated siRNA (Fig. S1A). Although all cell lines harbor mutant KRAS and show KRAS-dependent growth (13Hayes T.K. Neel N.F. Hu C. Gautam P. Chenard M. Long B. Aziz M. Kassner M. Bryant K.L. Pierobon M. Marayati R. Kher S.

After 72 h, a time point at which compensatory changes in the kinome have been initiated in response to loss of KRAS (27Ozkan-Dagliyan I. Diehl J.N. George S.D. Schaefer A. Papke B. Klotz-Noack K.

Our approach detected a total of 227 kinases of sufficient abundance for quantification in one or more PDAC cell lines (Fig. S1C). As expected, given the genetic heterogeneity of PDAC tumors, there was significant heterogeneity in the kinase profile of each cell line (Fig. S1C). Interestingly, the quantified kinases were upregulated and downregulated to the same degree (63 and 62 kinases, respectively; Fig. S1D). Across all six lines, we identified 15 kinases that were significantly upregulated and 13 that were downregulated in common (Figs. 1A and S1E). To determine if the deregulated kinases represented specific subgroups, we applied the UniProt kinase classification annotation that is based in part on catalytic domain sequence identity and in part on biological function (Fig. S1F). Notably, although the downregulated kinases did not share much sequence identity (7/13 or 53.8% were “other” kinases versus 32/227 or 14.1% of all detected kinases) (Fig. S1, F and G), nearly all have established roles in regulating cell cycle transitions, particularly through mitosis (e.g., Aurora kinase A [AURKA], CHK1 [CHEK1], WEE1) (Table S2). In contrast, the upregulated kinases were enriched in tyrosine kinases and tyrosine kinase–like kinases (7/15; 46.7%), which comprised 23.3% (53/227) of all detected kinases (Fig. S1, F and H). Strikingly, a driver role in cancer has been attributed to all 15 upregulated kinases (e.g., ERK1 [MAPK3] [Table S3], SRC, and Janus kinase [JAK]), supporting the strong likelihood that upregulated kinases serve compensatory growth-promoting roles that attenuate the deleterious consequences of KRAS deficiency. Supporting this possibility, we showed recently that ERKi treatment of PDAC cell lines caused upregulation of SRC activity and that concurrent SRC inhibition further enhanced ERKi–mediated growth suppression (32Vaseva A.V. Blake D.R. Gilbert T.S.K. Ng S. Hostetter G. Azam S.H. Ozkan-Dagliyan I. Gautam P. Bryant K.L. Pearce K.H. Herring L.E. Han H. Graves L.M. Witkiewicz A.K.

To complement these kinome analyses, we used reverse phase protein array (RPPA) pathway activation mapping (38Baldelli E. Calvert V. Hodge A. VanMeter A. Petricoin 3rd, E.F. Pierobon M. Reverse phase protein microarrays.Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1606: 149-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to evaluate the signaling consequences of 72 h of siRNA-mediated KRAS suppression (Fig. S1I). The RPPA panel included 149 phospho-specific and total antibodies to monitor the activation state or expression, respectively, of signaling proteins involved in regulation of cell proliferation, survival, motility, and others (Table S4 and Data File S4). One caution regarding RPPA analyses is the limited repertoire of validated antibodies included in the analyses. Since only antibodies that recognize a single band by Western blot analyses of total cellular proteins can be used, our analyses did not include antibodies that monitored signaling with some of our identified KRAS-dependent kinases. As expected, phosphorylated and total ERK proteins were increased, consistent with loss of ERK-dependent negative feedback signaling (Fig. S1J). Nevertheless, phosphorylation of key ERK substrates important for driving ERK-dependent growth (ribosomal S6 kinase, ELK1, and MYC) remained strongly suppressed (Fig. S1J). Thus, similar to our previous observations with pharmacological inhibition of ERK (13Hayes T.K. Neel N.F. Hu C. Gautam P. Chenard M. Long B. Aziz M. Kassner M. Bryant K.L. Pierobon M. Marayati R.

Among the decreases in expression and/or activation of multiple proteins involved in cell cycle regulation were a dramatic reduction in the mitotic marker, phosphorylated histone H3 at Ser10, as well as loss of the proliferation markers Ki67 and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein at Ser780 (Fig. S1I). RPPA analyses also revealed alterations in expression (e.g., Bcl-2-like protein 11, BIM) or phosphorylation (e.g., FAS-associated death domain protein, FADD Ser194) of proteins associated with apoptosis, a well-described consequence of loss of mutant KRAS function (39Singh A. Greninger P. Rhodes D. Koopman L. Violette S. Bardeesy N. Settleman J.

Finally, reductions were also detected in phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein, involved in regulation of protein translation (Fig. S1, I and J). Thus, KRAS loss is associated with the activation and inactivation of diverse growth regulatory signaling pathways. We next wanted to determine the contribution of the ERK MAPK effector pathway to the regulation of the KRAS-dependent kinome. We treated the same panel of six PDAC cell lines for 24 h with the ERK1/2-selective inhibitor SCH772984 (ERKi) (40Morris E.J. Jha S. Restaino C.R. Dayananth P. Zhu H. Cooper A. Carr D. Deng Y. Jin W.

https://openalex.org/W3209350855,"Fructooligosaccharides and their anhydrides are widely used as health-promoting foods and prebiotics. Various enzymes acting on β-D-fructofuranosyl linkages of natural fructan polymers have been used to produce functional compounds. However, enzymes that hydrolyze and form α-D-fructofuranosyl linkages have been less studied. Here, we identified the BBDE_2040 gene product from Bifidobacterium dentium (α-D-fructofuranosidase and difructose dianhydride I synthase/hydrolase from Bifidobacterium dentium [αFFase1]) as an enzyme with α-D-fructofuranosidase and α-D-arabinofuranosidase activities and an anomer-retaining manner. αFFase1 is not homologous with any known enzymes, suggesting that it is a member of a novel glycoside hydrolase family. When caramelized fructose sugar was incubated with αFFase1, conversions of β-D-Frup-(2→1)-α-D-Fruf to α-D-Fruf-1,2':2,1'-β-D-Frup (diheterolevulosan II) and β-D-Fruf-(2→1)-α-D-Fruf (inulobiose) to α-D-Fruf-1,2':2,1'-β-D-Fruf (difructose dianhydride I [DFA I]) were observed. The reaction equilibrium between inulobiose and DFA I was biased toward the latter (1:9) to promote the intramolecular dehydrating condensation reaction. Thus, we named this enzyme DFA I synthase/hydrolase. The crystal structures of αFFase1 in complex with β-D-Fruf and β-D-Araf were determined at the resolutions of up to 1.76 Å. Modeling of a DFA I molecule in the active site and mutational analysis also identified critical residues for catalysis and substrate binding. The hexameric structure of αFFase1 revealed the connection of the catalytic pocket to a large internal cavity via a channel. Molecular dynamics analysis implied stable binding of DFA I and inulobiose to the active site with surrounding water molecules. Taken together, these results establish DFA I synthase/hydrolase as a member of a new glycoside hydrolase family (GH172)."

However, the substrate repertoire of ADAMTS8 and regulation of its activity are incompletely understood. Although considered a proteoglycanase because of high sequence similarity and close phylogenetic relationship to the proteoglycan-degrading proteases ADAMTS1, 4, 5, and 15, as well as tight genetic linkage with ADAMTS15 on human chromosome 11, its aggrecanase activity was reportedly weak. Several post-translational factors are known to regulate ADAMTS proteases such as autolysis, inhibition by endogenous inhibitors, and receptor-mediated endocytosis, but their impacts on ADAMTS8 are unknown. Here, we show that ADAMTS8 undergoes autolysis at six different sites within its spacer domain. We also found that in contrast to ADAMTS4 and 5, ADAMTS8 levels were not regulated through low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)-mediated endocytosis. Additionally, ADAMTS8 lacked significant activity against the proteoglycans aggrecan, versican, and biglycan. Instead, we found that ADAMTS8 cleaved osteopontin, a phosphoprotein whose expression is upregulated in PAH. Multiple ADAMTS8 cleavage sites were identified using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Osteopontin cleavage by ADAMTS8 was efficiently inhibited by TIMP-3, an endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTS1, 4, and 5, as well as by TIMP-2, which has no previously reported inhibitory activity against other ADAMTS proteases.

Recently, ADAMTS8 expression was found to be increased in lungs of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (7Omura J. Satoh K. Kikuchi N. Satoh T. Kurosawa R. Nogi M. Ohtsuki T.

In addition, mice bearing a targeted deletion of Adamts8, either in their pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PA-SMCs) or cardiomyocytes, showed reduced right ventricular systolic pressure and reduced right ventricular hypertrophy, compared with wild-type (WT) mice when subjected to hypoxia-induced PAH. These results suggested a role for ADAMTS8 in the pathogenesis of PAH, potentially contributing to the severity of this condition (7Omura J. Satoh K. Kikuchi N. Satoh T. Kurosawa R. Nogi M. Ohtsuki T. Al-Mamun M.E. Siddique M.A.H. Yaoita N. Sunamura S. Miyata S. Hoshikawa Y. Okada Y. Shimokawa H. ADAMTS8 promotes the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension and right ventricular failure: A possible novel therapeutic target.Circ. Res. 2019; 125: 884-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the biological roles of ADAMTS8 and its proteolytic activity are still poorly understood due to lack of biochemical characterization and elucidation of its substrate repertoire. ADAMTS8 comprises a prodomain (Pro), a metalloproteinase (Mp) domain, a disintegrin-like (Dis) domain, a central thrombospondin-like (TSR) motif, a cysteine-rich (CR) domain, a spacer (Sp) domain, and a C-terminal TSR motif (Fig. 1A). ADAMTS8 has the highest sequence homology with ADAMTS1, 4, 5, and 15, four ADAMTS family members endowed with the distinct ability to cleave extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycans (4Apte S.S. ADAMTS proteins: Concepts, challenges, and prospects.Methods Mol. Biol. 2020; 2043: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and phylogenetic analysis has placed it in the evolutionary cluster that contains these proteases (16Huxley-Jones J. Apte S.S. Robertson D.L. Boot-Handford R.P. The characterisation of six ADAMTS proteases in the basal chordate Ciona intestinalis provides new insights into the vertebrate ADAMTS family.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1838-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ADAMTS8 gene locus is tightly linked with the ADAMTS15 locus in both humans and mice (PMID17509843), suggesting an especially close relationship with this protease, about which there is also scarce information. Although ADAMTS8 is therefore considered a proteoglycanase, its only reported substrate is aggrecan, the predominant proteoglycan in articular cartilage (17Collins-Racie L.A. Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Annis-Freeman B. Agostino M.J. Arai M. DiBlasio-Smith E. Dorner A.J. Georgiadis K.E. Jin M. Tan X.Y. Morris E.A. LaVallie E.R. ADAMTS-8 exhibits aggrecanase activity and is expressed in human articular cartilage.Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, aggrecan was cleaved by ADAMTS8 only at extremely high enzyme/substrate ratios, suggesting that it may not be a major or preferred substrate (17Collins-Racie L.A. Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Annis-Freeman B. Agostino M.J. Arai M. DiBlasio-Smith E. Dorner A.J. Georgiadis K.E. Jin M. Tan X.Y. Morris E.A. LaVallie E.R. ADAMTS-8 exhibits aggrecanase activity and is expressed in human articular cartilage.Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The ability of ADAMTS8 to cleave other proteoglycans, such as versican and biglycan, has so far not been reported. Post-translationally, ADAMTS proteases are regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), interactions with cell-associated glycosaminoglycans, and endocytic clearance by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) (18Yamamoto K. Wilkinson D. Bou-Gharios G. Targeting dysregulation of metalloproteinase activity in osteoarthritis.Calcif. Tissue Int. 2021; 109: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Whether ADAMTS8 is regulated through these mechanisms has not yet been investigated but may have an immediate relevance for its activity in diseases such as PAH. To fill the gap in our understanding of ADAMTS8 as a protease and potential proteoglycanase, we generated purified recombinant ADAMTS8 and characterized its proteolytic activity, susceptibility to TIMP inhibition and regulation by LRP1-mediated endocytosis. We report here that ADAMTS8 exhibits striking differences in substrate repertoire, susceptibility to endogenous inhibitors, and endocytic regulation compared with ADAMTS1, 4, 5, and 15. Our results therefore suggest that ADAMTS8 is functionally distinct from other members of the proteoglycanase subfamily, despite its homology and evolutionary relationship with that group. Constructs expressing FLAG-tagged full-length WT ADAMTS8, and its active site mutant (E364Q, hereafter designated as “EQ”), were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells, an expression system previously used successfully for purification of recombinant ADAMTS1, 4 and 5 (19Santamaria S.

Since ADAMTS proteases are known to bind ECM via ionic interactions, frequently requiring heparin for release into the culture medium (1Kuno K. Matsushima K.

While heparin had little effect on the ADAMTS8 levels in the cell lysate, increased levels of ADAMTS8 (both WT and EQ) were present in the conditioned medium when heparin was added during expression (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that ADAMTS8 remains bound to the cell-ECM monolayer unless heparin is added. Once released into the medium, ADAMTS8 was present in two forms, with apparent molecular weights of ∼100 and 75 kDa, corresponding to the predicted size of zymogen and furin-cleaved mature (activated) forms of the enzyme, respectively. Addition of heparin mainly increased the abundance of the furin-activated form of ADAMTS8 and ADAMTS8 EQ (Fig. 1B). While WT ADAMTS8 was detected at much lower levels than ADAMTS8 EQ in the medium, both in the presence and in the absence of heparin, similar levels of the two forms were present in the cell lysate regardless of whether heparin was added or not (Fig. 1, B and C). Immunoblots with higher protein content loaded on the gel showed the presence of additional bands in both WT and EQ transfections in conditioned media and cell lysates, but bands intermediate in size between those corresponding to the zymogen and the mature forms of the enzyme were present exclusively in the WT transfections (Fig. 1C). Together, the results suggest that WT ADAMTS8 may undergo autolysis in the extracellular milieu, likely following furin activation, similar to that previously shown for other ADAMTS proteases (21Gendron C.

Both ADAMTS8 constructs were subsequently expressed at larger scale in the presence of heparin and purified using anti-FLAG affinity chromatography.

Following competitive elution with FLAG peptide, the two ADAMTS8 constructs were subjected to buffer exchange to remove the FLAG peptide and quantified by absorbance as described in the Experimental procedures section. The total yields of WT and EQ ADAMTS8 were 1.8 and 4.4. mg/l, respectively, approximately 60- and 36-fold higher than similarly purified WT ADAMTS5 (30 μg/l) (21Gendron C. Kashiwagi M. Lim N.H. Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Hughes C. Caterson B. Nagase H. Proteolytic activities of human ADAMTS-5. Comparative studies with ADAMTS-4.J. Biol.

The molecular forms and their purity were assessed using immunoblot and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 2A). Both anti-FLAG and polyclonal anti-ADAMTS8 antibodies detected the zymogen as well as mature forms in each preparation. Both antibodies also detected additional bands, which were present only in WT ADAMTS8 before as well as after purification (Figs. 2, A and B and 1C), suggesting autolysis. To further verify protein quality, the WT ADAMTS8 preparation was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2B). More rapid migration under non-reducing conditions was indicative of correctly formed intramolecular disulfide bonds and a native-like conformation. Under reducing conditions, both the zymogen and mature forms migrated through the gel at a slightly higher molecular weight than predicted by their amino acid sequences (approximately 100 and 75 kDa versus 95 and 70 kDa, respectively). This suggested the presence of a post-translational modification such as glycosylation in the secreted protein. NetNGlyc 1.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) predicted five potential N-glycosylation sites in ADAMTS8: one in the Pro domain (344N), one in the Mp domain (400N), two in the Dis domain (465N and 490N), and one in the CysR domain (599N). To verify the presence of N-linked glycosylations, purified ADAMTS8 WT and EQ were treated with PNGase-F prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2C). A shift in molecular weight of ∼5 kDa was observed between PNGase F-treated and untreated conditions, resulting in observed protein masses similar to those predicted for the two proteins, suggesting that the higher than expected molecular mass resulted from addition of N-linked glycans. PNGase-F treatment also highlighted several additional bands, which, like those observed in Figures 2, A and B and 1C, were specifically seen in WT ADAMTS8. We hypothesized that these bands may represent glycoforms of autolytic products. Since autolysis could remove domains necessary for proteolytic activity, we tested our hypothesis that ADAMTS8 undergoes autolysis using high-resolution liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), applying a method we previously developed to identify novel cleavage sites in versican (24Martin D.R. Santamaria S. Koch C.D. Ahnström J. Apte S.S. Identification of novel ADAMTS1, ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 cleavage sites in versican using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach.Journal of Proteomics. 2021; 249104358Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We identified ADAMTS8 semi-tryptic and tryptic peptides and determined their relative abundance in medium from WT and EQ constructs with this label-free quantitative approach. Identifying peptides with a semi-tryptic N-terminus (indicating the P1′ amino acid residue just downstream of the scissile bond, nomenclature after Schecter & Berger) (25Schechter I. Berger A. On the size of the active site in proteases. I. Papain.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar) or a semi-tryptic C-terminus (i.e., indicating the P1 amino acid residue) at quantitatively higher abundance in WT ADAMTS8 would suggest putative sites of autolysis. Furthermore, identification and quantitation of the corresponding tryptic peptides bridging/spanning the putative cleavage sites at higher abundance in ADAMTS8 EQ would provide additional support for the identified ADAMTS8 autolytic cleavages (Fig. 3A). Following a 24 h incubation of either WT or EQ ADAMTS8, seven semi-tryptic internal peptides were identified only in WT ADAMTS8 preparations (Figs. 3B and S1 and Table S1), including the N-terminal and C-terminal semi-tryptic peptides indicating a cleavage site at Ala734- Leu735. The analysis suggested six sites where WT ADAMTS8 was subject to autolysis: Ala734- Leu735, Tyr742-Leu743, Gln789-Leu790, Leu790-Leu791, Met816-Gln817, and Ser818-Ser819 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, all of these cleavage sites are located within the ADAMTS8 Sp domain (Fig. 3D and Table S1), which in other ADAMTS proteases is involved in substrate recognition (19Santamaria S. Yamamoto K. Teraz-Orosz A. Koch C. Apte S.S. de Groot R. Lane D.A. Ahnström J. Exosites in hypervariable loops of ADAMTS spacer domains control substrate recognition and proteolysis.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 10914Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Only a single tryptic peptide comprising residues 346 to 381 was significantly higher in the WT compared with the EQ (z-score of 4.9). This peptide may indicate a tryptic-like autolytic specificity of ADAMTS8 although it could conceivably result from a contaminant protease, which is an unlikely possibility since both constructs were expressed under identical conditions. No tryptic peptides were observed at significantly higher levels in the EQ as compared with the WT, with the highest being the peptide comprising residues 261 to 269 and having a z-score of only 1.6 (Fig. 3C). Heparin increased ADAMTS8 levels in the medium of HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B). Heparin is therefore likely to bind to ADAMTS8 and exert this effect by either competing with binding to ECM, competing with binding to LRP1 or a combination of both scenarios (26Yamamoto K. Murphy G. Troeberg L. Extracellular regulation of metalloproteinases.Matrix Biol. 2015; 44-46: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). LRP1 is known to post-translationally regulate the activity of ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 through their endocytic clearance from the extracellular milieu (27Yamamoto K. Owen K. Parker A.E. Scilabra S.D. Dudhia J. Strickland D.K. Troeberg L. Nagase H. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)-mediated endocytic clearance of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-4 (ADAMTS-4): Functional differences of non-catalytic domains of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 in LRP1 binding.J.

LRP-1-mediated endocytosis regulates extracellular activity of ADAMTS-5 in articular cartilage.FASEB J. 2013; 27: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We aimed to establish if ADAMTS8 also undergoes such post-translational regulation. We found that ADAMTS8 did not bind purified human LRP1 in a solid-phase binding assay (Fig. S2), suggesting that it may not be internalized through this receptor. We therefore compared the uptake of WT ADAMTS8 by LRP1 WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and LRP1 knockout MEFs. Purified recombinant WT ADAMTS8 was added to either LRP1 WT or LRP1 knockout MEFs. After 8 h incubation, media were collected, proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in SDS-sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 4). No difference was observed between LRP1 WT and LRP1 knockout MEFs, with approximately 85% of the starting material present at the end of the incubation period. In comparison, approximately 75% of ADAMTS5 disappeared from the medium of WT LRP1 MEFs, while its levels were maintained in medium incubated with LRP1 knockout cells (Fig. 4). These results suggest that, in contrast to ADAMTS5, ADAMTS8 is not regulated by LRP1-mediated endocytosis. Following overall protein characterization, the enzymatic activity of purified recombinant ADAMTS8 was tested against a range of protein substrates. ADAMTS8 activity was initially tested against α2-macroglobulin (α2M), a general substrate and plasma inhibitor of metalloproteinases (Fig. 5A). Cleavage of α2M by proteases generally occurs in a bait region of ∼30 amino acids (690Pro-Thr728) (29Garcia-Ferrer I. Marrero A. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Goulas T. α2-Macroglobulins: Structure and function.Subcell. Biochem. 2017; 83: 149-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Following 24 h incubation at equimolar concentrations, ADAMTS8-mediated proteolysis of α2M was observed, confirming its enzymatic activity. The cleavage products were similar to those of ADAMTS1, here used as a positive control (Fig. 5A). Since ADAMTS8 was reported to cleave aggrecan (17Collins-Racie L.A. Flannery C.R. Zeng W.

ADAMTS-8 exhibits aggrecanase activity and is expressed in human articular cartilage.Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), its aggrecanase activity was tested against purified bovine aggrecan and compared with that of ADAMTS1, ADAMTS4, and ADAMTS5, which cleave aggrecan at the Glu392-Ala393 bond (human aggrecan numbering, Uniprot accession number: P16112) (Fig. 5B). In the presence of as little as 5 nM ADAMTS5, a 250-kDa band, corresponding to the C-terminal cleavage fragment 393ARGSVIL, was detected by the neoepitope antibody BC3 after 2 h digestion. Only a faint band was detected in the ADAMTS4 digest (5 nM), in agreement with its lower aggrecanase activity compared with ADAMTS5 (20Fushimi K. Troeberg L. Nakamura H. Lim N.H. Nagase H.

Patients were mostly male (n = 314 [84.6%]) and of South Asian origin (n = 231 [62.3%]). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 182 (49.1%) patients for a median of 11 days (25-75% interquartile range: 6-17). During the ICU stay, renal replacement therapy was required in 87 (23.5%) and vasopressor therapy in 190 (51.2%) patients. ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 9 (IQ: 5-17) and 18 (IQ: 13-29) days, respectively and ICU and hospital mortality rates were both 20.2%. In a multivariable analysis with in-hospital mortality as the dependent variable, greater Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score on ICU admission, diarrhea prior to hospital admission, greater, admission from hospital ward, and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio on admission to the ICU were independently associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality.In this cohort of patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital in the UAE, COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Identifying patients at high risk of death may help detect future therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W3205713464,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A)†,‡ is an essential protein that requires a unique amino acid, hypusine, for its activity. Hypusine is formed exclusively in eIF5A post-translationally via two enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. Each of the genes encoding these proteins, Eif5a, Dhps, and Dohh, is required for mouse embryonic development. Variants in EIF5A or DHPS were recently identified as the genetic basis underlying certain rare neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. To investigate the roles of eIF5A and DHPS in brain development, we generated four conditional KO mouse strains using the Emx1-Cre or Camk2a-Cre strains and examined the effects of temporal- and region-specific deletion of Eif5a or Dhps. The conditional deletion of Dhps or Eif5a by Emx1 promotor-driven Cre expression (E9.5, in the cortex and hippocampus) led to gross defects in forebrain development, reduced growth, and premature death. On the other hand, the conditional deletion of Dhps or Eif5a by Camk2a promoter-driven Cre expression (postnatal, mainly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus) did not lead to global developmental defects; rather, these KO animals exhibited severe impairment in spatial learning, contextual learning, and memory when subjected to the Morris water maze and a contextual learning test. In both models, the Dhps-KO mice displayed more severe impairment than their Eif5a-KO counterparts. The observed defects in the brain, global development, or cognitive functions most likely result from translation errors due to a deficiency in active, hypusinated eIF5A. Our study underscores the important roles of eIF5A and DHPS in neurodevelopment."
https://openalex.org/W3207397197,"Clinical procedural skills are vital components of medical education. Increased student intake and limited capacity of medical schools necessitate more efficient ways to deliver clinical skill teaching. This study employed a flipped classroom, peer-assisted learning approach to deliver clinical skill teaching. It aimed to determine the influence of pre-class demonstration video watching and in-class student-student interactions on clinical skill acquisition.In 2017, a cohort of 205 medical students in their penultimate year of undergraduate medical study were recruited, and they learned bag mask ventilation and intravenous cannulation during this study. The participants watched a demonstration video before class, and then underwent self-directed practice as triads. Afterwards, each participant video-recorded their skill performance and completed post-class questionnaires. The videos were evaluated by two blinded assessors.A hundred and thirty-one participants (63.9%) completed the questionnaire. For bag mask ventilation, participants who claimed to have watched the corresponding demonstration video before class achieved higher performance scores (those who watched before class: 7.8 ± 1.0; those who did not: 6.3 ± 1.7; p < 0.01). For intravenous cannulation, while there is no significant difference in performance scores (those who watched before class: 14.3 ± 1.3; those who did not: 14.1 ± 1.4; p = 0.295), those who watched the video before class received less interventions from their peers during triad practice (those who watched before class: 2.9 ± 1.8; those who did not: 4.3 ± 2.9; p < 0.05). The questionnaire results showed that most participants preferred the new approach of clinical skill teaching and perceived it to be useful for skill acquisition.The flipped classroom, same-level peer-assisted learning model is potentially an effective way to address the current challenges and improve the efficiency of clinical procedural skill teaching in medical schools."
https://openalex.org/W3209400584,"Retinotopic maps of many visual areas are thought to follow the fundamental principles described for the primary visual cortex (V1), where nearby points on the retina map to nearby points on the surface of V1, and orthogonal axes of the retinal surface are represented along orthogonal axes of the cortical surface. Here we demonstrate a striking departure from this mapping in the secondary visual area (V2) of the tree shrew best described as a sinusoidal transformation of the visual field. This sinusoidal topography is ideal for achieving uniform coverage in an elongated area like V2, as predicted by mathematical models designed for wiring minimization, and provides a novel explanation for periodic banded patterns of intra-cortical connections and functional response properties in V2 of tree shrews as well as several other species. Our findings suggest that cortical circuits flexibly implement solutions to sensory surface representation, with dramatic consequences for large-scale cortical organization."
https://openalex.org/W3204993626,"During a psychotherapy session, the counselor typically adopts techniques which are codified along specific dimensions (e.g., 'displays warmth and confidence', or 'attempts to set up collaboration') to facilitate the evaluation of the session. Those constructs, traditionally scored by trained human raters, reflect the complex nature of psychotherapy and highly depend on the context of the interaction. Recent advances in deep contextualized language models offer an avenue for accurate in-domain linguistic representations which can lead to robust recognition and scoring of such psychotherapy-relevant behavioral constructs, and support quality assurance and supervision. In this work, we propose a BERT-based model for automatic behavioral scoring of a specific type of psychotherapy, called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), where prior work is limited to frequency-based language features and/or short text excerpts which do not capture the unique elements involved in a spontaneous long conversational interaction. The model focuses on the classification of therapy sessions with respect to the overall score achieved on the widely-used Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS), but is trained in a multi-task manner in order to achieve higher interpretability. BERT-based representations are further augmented with available therapy metadata, providing relevant non-linguistic context and leading to consistent performance improvements. We train and evaluate our models on a set of 1,118 real-world therapy sessions, recorded and automatically transcribed. Our best model achieves an F1 score equal to 72.61% on the binary classification task of low vs. high total CTRS."
https://openalex.org/W3205983312,"Nonalcohol-associated fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive hepatic accumulation of fat that can progress to steatohepatitis, and currently, therapeutic options are limited. Using a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model of NAFLD, we determined the effects of the synthetic retinoid, AC261066, a selective retinoic acid receptor β2 (RARβ2) agonist, on the global liver transcriptomes and metabolomes of mice with dietary-induced obesity (DIO) using genome-wide RNA-seq and untargeted metabolomics. We found that AC261066 limits mRNA increases in several presumptive NAFLD driver genes, including Pklr, Fasn, Thrsp, and Chchd6. Importantly, AC261066 limits the increases in the transcript and protein levels of KHK, a key enzyme for fructose metabolism, and causes multiple changes in liver metabolites involved in fructose metabolism. In addition, in cultured murine hepatocytes, where exposure to fructose and palmitate results in a profound increase in lipid accumulation, AC261066 limits this lipid accumulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that in a human hepatocyte cell line, RARβ is required for the inhibitory effects of AC261066 on palmitate-induced lipid accumulation. Finally, our data indicate that AC261066 inhibits molecular events underpinning fibrosis and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects. In conclusion, changes in the transcriptome and metabolome indicate that AC261066 affects molecular changes underlying multiple aspects of NAFLD, including steatosis and fibrosis. Therefore, we suggest that AC261066 may have potential as an effective therapy for NAFLD."

https://openalex.org/W3206193117,"Previous reports have shown the benefits of intradialytic exercise to patients undergoing hemodialysis. However, most of those studies assessed the effects of exercise in middle-aged patients and little is known about advanced-age patients undergoing hemodialysis. Therefore, the present randomized controlled trial was performed to determine the effectiveness of exercise therapy in advanced-age patients undergoing hemodialysis. This non-blinded, randomized controlled parallel trial enrolled a total of 101 patients who were randomly assigned to intradialytic exercise (n = 51) or usual care (n = 50) groups. The training program included both resistance and aerobic exercises and was performed three times per week for 6 months. The aerobic exercise intensity was adjusted to a target Borg score of 13 for 20 minutes. Four types of resistance exercises were performed using elastic tubing, with three sets of 10 exercises performed at moderate intensity (13/20 on the Borg scale). The usual care group received standard care. Lower extremity muscle strength, Short Physical Performance Battery score, and 10-m walking speed were the outcomes and were evaluated before the hemodialysis session and after 6 months of training. There were statistically significant improvements in Short Physical Performance Battery score (effect size, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.15‒1.95) in the exercise group relative to the control group. There were no statistically significant differences in lower extremity muscle strength or in the 10-m walking speed between the two groups. These findings suggest that 6 months of intradialytic training could improve physical function in older patients undergoing hemodialysis."
https://openalex.org/W3206202835,"Background Vaccine hesitancy is a complex, contested social phenomenon and existing research highlights the multifaceted role of trust in strengthening vaccine confidence. However, understanding public engagement with vaccination through the lens of (mis)trust requires more contextual evidence on trust’s qualitative determinants. This includes expanding the geographic focus beyond current studies’ focus on High Income Countries. Furthermore, obstacles remain in effectively integrating social science findings in the design of vaccine deployment strategies, and in ensuring that those who implement interventions and are affected by them are directly involved in producing knowledge about vaccination challenges. Methods We piloted a community-led ethnographic approach, training Community Health Workers (CHWs) in Kambia District, Sierra Leone, in qualitative social science methods. Methods included participant observation, participatory power mapping and rumour tracking, focus group discussions and key stakeholder interviews. CHWs, with the support of public health officials and professional social scientists, conducted research on vaccination challenges, analysed data, tested new community engagement strategies based on their findings and elicited local perspectives on these approaches. Results Our findings on vaccine confidence in five border communities highlighted three key themes: the impact of prior experiences with the health system on (mis)trust; relevance of livelihood strategies and power dynamics for vaccine uptake and access; and the contextual nature of knowledge around vaccines. Across these themes, we show how expressions of trust centered on social proximity, reliability and respect and the role of structural issues affecting both vaccine access and confidence. The pilot also highlighted the value and practical challenges to meaningfully co-designed research. Conclusion There is scope for broader application of a community-led ethnographic approach will help redesign programming that is responsive to local knowledge and experience. Involving communities and low-cadre service providers in generating knowledge and solutions can strengthen relationships and sustain dialogue to bolster vaccine confidence."

Conserved adapter protein complexes at the Golgi (AP-3), the endosome (AP-1), or the plasma membrane (AP-2) with their conserved core domain and flexible ear domains mediate this function. These complexes also rely on the small GTPase Arf1 and/or specific phosphoinositides for membrane binding. The structural details that influence these processes, however, are still poorly understood. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the full-length stable 300 kDa yeast AP-3 complex. The structures reveal that AP-3 adopts an open conformation in solution, comparable to the membrane-bound conformations of AP-1 or AP-2. This open conformation appears to be far more flexible than AP-1 or AP-2, resulting in compact, intermediate, and stretched subconformations. Mass spectrometrical analysis of the cross-linked AP-3 complex further indicates that the ear domains are flexibly attached to the surface of the complex. Using biochemical reconstitution assays, we also show that efficient AP-3 recruitment to the membrane depends primarily on cargo binding. Once bound to cargo, AP-3 clustered and immobilized cargo molecules, as revealed by single-molecule imaging on polymer-supported membranes.

Eukaryotic cells have membrane-enclosed organelles, which carry out specialized functions, including compartmentalized biochemical reactions, metabolic channeling, and regulated signaling, inside a single cell. The transport of proteins, lipids, and other molecules between these organelles is mediated largely by small vesicular carriers that bud off at a donor compartment and fuse with the target membrane to deliver their cargo. The generation of these vesicles has been subject to extensive studies and has led to the identification of numerous coat proteins that are required for their formation at different sites (1Gomez-Navarro N.

Coat proteins can be monomers, but in most cases, they consist of several proteins, which form a heteromeric complex. Heterotetrameric adapter protein (AP) complexes are required at several endomembranes for cargo binding. Five well-conserved AP-complexes with differing functions have been identified in mammalian cells, named AP-1–AP-5, of which three (AP-1–AP-3) are conserved from yeast to human (3Hirst J.,D.

Owen D. Harrison S.C. Molecular structure, function, and dynamics of clathrin-mediated membrane traffic.Cold Spring Harb. Persp. Biol. 2014; 6a016725Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The recruitment of these complexes to membranes is not entirely conserved. They all require cargo binding, yet AP-1 binds Arf1-GTP with the γ and β1 subunit and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) via a proposed conserved site on its γ-subunit (7Heldwein E.E. Macia E. Wang J. Yin H.L. Kirchhausen T. Harrison S.C. Crystal structure of the clathrin adaptor protein 1 core.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AP-2, on the other hand, interacts with PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane via its α, β2, and μ2 subunits (9Gaidarov I. Keen J.H.

AP-3 recognizes cargo at the Golgi via two sorting motifs in the cytosolic segments of membrane proteins: a Yxxφ sorting motif, as found in yeast in the SNARE Nyv1 or the Yck3 casein kinase, which binds to a site in μ3, as shown for mammalian AP-3, which is similar to μ2 in AP-2 (12Wen W.

AP-3-dependent trafficking and disease: The first decade.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This suggests that the AP-3 complex has features that are quite different from AP-1 and AP-2 complexes, which cooperate with clathrin in vesicle formation (2Kirchhausen T. Owen D. Harrison S.C. Molecular structure, function, and dynamics of clathrin-mediated membrane traffic.Cold Spring Harb. Persp. Biol. 2014; 6a016725Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Among the three conserved AP complexes, the function of the AP-3 complex is the least understood. Arf1 is necessary for efficient AP-3 vesicle generation in mammalian cells and shows a direct interaction with the β3 and δ subunits of AP-3 (27Ooi C.E. Dell'Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S.

In addition, in vitro experiments on mammalian AP-3 using liposomes or enriched Golgi membranes suggest Arf1 as an important factor in AP-3 recruitment, whereas acidic lipids do not have a major effect, in contrast to what was found for AP-1 and AP-2 (7Heldwein E.E.

A. 1998; 95: 11199-11204Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Another study showed that membrane recruitment of AP-3 depends on the recognition of sorting signals in cargo tails and PI3P (31Baust T. Anitei M. Czupalla C. Parshyna I. Bourel L. Thiele C. Krause E. Hoflack B. Protein networks supporting AP-3 function in targeting lysosomal membrane proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1942-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), similar to AP-1 recruitment via cargo tails, Arf1 and PI4P (32Baust T. Czupalla C. Krause E. Bourel-Bonnet L. Hoflack B. Proteomic analysis of adaptor protein 1A coats selectively assembled on liposomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3159-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, since AP-1 and AP-3 are both recruited to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in yeast (33Day K.J. Casler J.C. Glick B.S. Budding yeast has a minimal endomembrane system.Dev. Cell. 2018; 44: 56-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the mechanism of their recruitment likely differs. Even though Arf1 is required, yeast AP-3 seems to be present at the TGN before the arrival of the Arf1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec7 (33Day K.J. Casler J.C. Glick B.S. Budding yeast has a minimal endomembrane system.Dev. Cell. 2018; 44: 56-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This implies the necessity for additional factors at the TGN and a distinct mechanism to allow for spatial and temporal separation of AP-1 and AP-3 recruitment to membranes. Structural data on mammalian AP-1 and AP-2 “core” complexes without the hinge and ear domains of their large subunits revealed that both exist in at least two very defined conformational states: a “closed” cytosolic state, where the cargo-binding sites are buried within the complex, and an “open” state, where the same sites are available to bind cargo (7Heldwein E.E.

Binding of Arf1 to AP-1 or PI(4,5)P2 in case of AP-2 induces a conformational change in the complexes that enables them to bind cargo molecules carrying a conserved acidic di-Leucine or a Tyrosine-based motif, as for all three AP complexes in yeast (8Ren X.

Additional conformational states and intermediates have been reported for both, mammalian AP-1 and AP-2 complex. AP-1, for example, can be hijacked by the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) proteins viral protein u (Vpu) and negative factor (Nef), resulting in a hyper-open conformation of AP-1 (36Shen Q.-T.

An emerging model over the past years has suggested that APs have several binding sites that allow for the stabilization of membrane binding and the open conformation of the complexes, but there are initial interactions required that dictate their recruitment to the target membrane. Although these interaction sites for mammalian AP-1 and AP-2 have been identified in great detail based on interaction analyses and structural studies (8Ren X. Farias G.G. Canagarajah B.J.

Although the “trunk” segment of AP-1 and AP-2 is known quite well by now, information on hinge and ear domains in context of these complexes is largely missing.

Furthermore, during tethering of AP-3 vesicles with the yeast vacuole, the δ−subunit Apl5 of the yeast AP-3 complex binds to the Vps41 subunit of the HOPS complex as a prerequisite of fusion (18Schoppe J.

Sec17 (α-SNAP) and an SM-tethering complex regulate the outcome of SNARE zippering in vitro and in vivo.Elife. 2017; 6: 4563Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we applied single particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) to analyze the purified full-length AP-3 complex from yeast and unraveled the factors required for AP-3 recruitment to membranes by biochemical reconstitution. Our data reveal that a surprisingly flexible AP-3 complex requires a combination of cargo, PI4P, and Arf1 for membrane binding, which explains its function in selective cargo sorting at the Golgi. The mammalian adapter protein complexes AP-1 and AP-2 have been analyzed in the past in some detail by structural and functional analyses. However, little is known about the AP-3 complex. AP-3 vesicle biogenesis requires Arf1 (27Ooi C.E. Dell'Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S. ADP-Ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) regulates recruitment of the AP-3 adaptor complex to membranes.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), though it is not clear which other factors are required for AP-3 recruitment and function at the Golgi. We therefore generated a yeast strain to overproduce and purify the heterotetrameric full-length AP-3 complex for further analyses regarding its structure and membrane targeting (Fig. 1A). For this, all subunits, the δ-subunit Apl5, the β3-subunit Apl6, the μ3-subunit Apm3, and the σ-subunit Aps3, were placed under the control of the inducible GAL1-promoter. The AP-3 complex was then purified by affinity purification via a C-terminal 3xFLAG-tag on Apl5, which does not impair function in vivo (19Angers C.G. Merz A.J. HOPS interacts with Apl5 at the vacuole membrane and is required for consumption of AP-3 transport vesicles.Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and subsequent gel filtration. The complex appeared as a stable heterotetramer with an apparent equimolar stoichiometry of the subunits and eluted as a single peak, corresponding to about 300 kDa (Fig. 1, B and C). During the purification process, we did not have any evidence for aggregation or proteolysis, indicating that the full-length complex includes the ear domains. As a control for functional assays, we further overproduced all subunits and purified the full-length AP-1 complex via a 3xFLAG-tag on the respective γ-adaptin Apl4 (Fig. 1D). As for the AP-3 complex, AP-1 forms a full-length heterotetrameric complex in solution (Fig. 1, E and F). To understand the mechanistic differences between AP-3 and the other adaptor protein complexes at the molecular level, we analyzed the full-length yeast AP-3 complex by single particle cryo-EM (Fig. S1A). We selected ∼1 million single particles and processed them in SPHIRE (44Moriya T. Saur M. Stabrin M. Merino F. Voicu H. Huang Z. Penczek P.A. Raunser S. Gatsogiannis C. High-resolution single particle analysis from electron cryo-microscopy images using SPHIRE.J. Vis. Exp. 2017; 55448Google Scholar, 45Stabrin M. Schoenfeld F. Wagner T. Pospich S. Gatsogiannis C. Raunser S. TranSPHIRE: Automated and feedback-optimized on-the-fly processing for cryo-EM.Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The 2D class averages and the 3D reconstruction suggested that AP-3 adapts an open conformation (Fig. S1). Although the 2D class averages of the AP-3 complex showed distinct secondary structure elements suggesting a potential for high resolution, the 3D reconstruction was limited to ∼15 Å, indicating a high flexibility or heterogeneity of the complex. Indeed, 3D sorting in SPHIRE (44Moriya T. Saur M. Stabrin M. Merino F. Voicu H. Huang Z. Penczek P.A. Raunser S. Gatsogiannis C. High-resolution single particle analysis from electron cryo-microscopy images using SPHIRE.J. Vis. Exp. 2017; 55448Google Scholar) resulted in five classes, particularly in the positions of the N-terminal domains of the Apl5 and Apl6 subunits vary (Fig. S1A, Movie S1). Although each class contained between 100k–150k particles, the resolution of the 3D reconstructions did not improve after 3D sorting, indicating that the particles in the five classes were still too heterogenous. Therefore, we applied the neural network-based approach of cryoDRGN (46Zhong E.D. Bepler T. Berger B. Davis J.H.

This report describes that the silencing of the synaptotagmin-5 (OsSYT-5) gene encoding the rice Ca2+ sensing protein with a C2 domain led to a significant improvement of rice tolerance to water deficit stress. Transgenic lines with suppressed expression of the OsSYT-5 gene exhibited an enhanced photosynthetic rate but reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration during water deficit stress. The abscisic acid (ABA) content under both normal and drought conditions was elevated in the leaves of the transgenic rice as compared to the wild type. The silencing of the OsSYT-5 gene affected the expression of several genes associated with ABA-related stress signaling in the transgenic rice plants. In the water deficit experiment, the transgenic lines with a silenced OsSYT-5 gene exhibited symptoms of drought stress seven days later than the wild type. Transgenic lines with suppressed OsSYT-5 gene expression exhibited higher pollen viability and produced more grains compared to the wild type at both normal and drought stress conditions."

Herein, we used chemical mapping to determine the secondary structure of segment 8 viral RNA (vRNA) of the pandemic A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) strain of IAV. Additionally, this long, naturally occurring RNA served as a model to evaluate RNA mapping with 4-thiouridine (4sU) crosslinking. We explored 4-thiouridine as a probe of nucleotides in close proximity, through its incorporation into newly transcribed RNA and subsequent photoactivation. RNA secondary structural features both universal to type A strains and unique to the A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) strain were recognized. 4sU mapping confirmed and facilitated RNA structure prediction, according to several rules: 4sU photocross-linking forms efficiently in the double-stranded region of RNA with some flexibility, in the ends of helices, and across bulges and loops when their structural mobility is permitted. This method highlighted three-dimensional properties of segment 8 vRNA secondary structure motifs and allowed to propose several long-range three-dimensional interactions. 4sU mapping combined with chemical mapping and bioinformatic analysis could be used to enhance the RNA structure determination as well as recognition of target regions for antisense strategies or viral RNA detection."

We investigated moral judgments in the context of the contemporary global crisis among older adults, who are at greatest personal risk from the pandemic. We hypothesized that during this pandemic, individuals would give fewer utilitarian responses to hypothetical dilemmas, accompanied by higher levels of confidence and emotion elicitation. Our pre-registered analysis (https://osf.io/g2wtp) involved two waves of data collection, before (2014) and during (2020) the COVID-19 pandemic, regarding three categories of moral dilemmas (personal rights, agent-centered permissions, and special obligations). While utilitarian responses considered across all categories of dilemma did not differ, participants during the 2020 wave gave fewer utilitarian responses to dilemmas involving personal rights; that is, they were less willing to violate the personal rights of others to produce the best overall outcomes."

Hyperphosphorylation of CERT’s serine-repeat motif (SRM) decreases its functionality. Some forms of inherited intellectual disability (ID) have been associated with a serine-to-leucine substitution in the SRM (S132L mutation) and a glycine-to-arginine substitution outside the SRM (G243R mutation) in CERT; however, it is unclear if mutations outside the SRM disrupt the control of CERT functionality. In the current investigation, we identified a new CERT1 variant (dupAA) in a patient with mild ID that resulted from a frameshift at the C-terminus of CERT1. However, familial analysis revealed that the dupAA variant was not associated with ID, allowing us to utilize it as a disease-matched negative control for CERT1 variants that are associated with ID. Biochemical analysis showed that G243R and S132L, but not dupAA, impair SRM hyperphosphorylation and render the CERT variants excessively active. Additionally, both S132L and G243R mutations but not dupAA caused the proteins to be distributed in a punctate subcellular manner. On the basis of these findings, we infer that the majority of ID-associated CERT variants may impair SRM phosphorylation-dependent repression, resulting in an increase in sphingomyelin production concurrent with CERT subcellular redistribution.

Intellectual disability (ID) is a developmental disorder that includes intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains (1American Psychiatric AssociationDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.5th Ed. American Psychiatric Association Publishing, Washington, DC2013Crossref Google Scholar). ID has an overall general prevalence in the population of approximately 1%, which varies by age (1American Psychiatric AssociationDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.5th Ed. American Psychiatric Association Publishing, Washington, DC2013Crossref Google Scholar). Although the origins of ID are complex and diverse, specifying the origin of ID is crucial for developing rational intervention methods to ameliorate disorders. By using whole-exon sequencing analysis, several independent studies recently showed that de novo mutations in CERT1 are associated with ID (Fig. 1A) (2de Ligt J. Willemsen M.H. van Bon B.W.

Intellectual disability-associated gain-of-function mutations in CERT1 that encodes the ceramide transport protein CERT.PLoS One. 2020; 15e0243980Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A few ID-associated variants in the CERT SRM have been experimentally shown to impair the SRM phosphorylation-dependent repression mechanism (7Murakami H. Tamura N. Enomoto Y. Shimasaki K. Kurosawa K. Hanada K. Intellectual disability-associated gain-of-function mutations in CERT1 that encodes the ceramide transport protein CERT.PLoS One. 2020; 15e0243980Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, whether ID-associated variants located at non-SRM regions affect the function of CERT remains unknown. In this study, we found a novel, although noncausative, mutation in CERT1 in a patient with ID. We demonstrated, using comparative analyses of wild-type, ID-associated, and noncausative CERT variants, that various CERT variants with ID-associated mutations frequently impair SRM phosphorylation-dependent repression, resulting in an increase in SM synthesis concurrent with CERT subcellular redistribution. The proband is a 9-year-old boy who was born to a nonconsanguineous Moroccan family. He was referred for evaluation of ID to the Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain. He presented with psychomotor developmental delay at 2 years old. At that age, he walked without support and he presented with speech delay with a limited number of words and no phrasing. He had a behavioral disorder that frequently shifted from one activity to another and exhibited recurrent mannerisms, such as repeatedly putting his hand to his mouth. In contrast, socialization skills and eye contact were normal. He was born at term by an uneventful cesarean section and weighed 5000 g. His neonatal period was normal. His family history was unremarkable, except for one younger sister with developmental delay. On physical examination at 9 years old, the vital signs were normal. Facial dysmorphism was not present. He had obesity (weight: 61.9 kg, >99th percentile, height: 140 cm, 73rd percentile) and macrocephaly (cranial circumference: 57.5 cm, >99th percentile, 3.17 standard deviations [SDs]). Abdominal, cardiac, and pulmonary examinations were unremarkable. The patient was intellectually impaired with good eye contact. He was able to engage in a conversation with diminished vocabulary. He showed repetitive behavior (stereotypies) with emotions. The remainder of his neurological examination (cranial nerves, motor and sensory function, and reflexes) was normal. He was cognitively delayed and could not independently perform activities of daily living. At 9 years old, he was able to run, jump, and go up and down stairs. He ate using his hands and he required help with dressing and bathing. He named classmates from his classroom. He verbalized common words and two- or three-word phrases. He identified and wrote his name and surname. He knew how to count to 19. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – Fifth Edition showed a full scale composite score of 55, which was consistent with a mild ID (Table S1). However, he did not meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder. Metabolic tests, including measurement of serum ammonia and lactate levels, thyroid and liver function tests, blood gas analysis, serum amino acid chromatography, MS/MS, and the urine organic acid profile were applied. However, all results were within normal limits. Similarly, video electroencephalography, auditory-evoked potentials, and brain MRI were normal, while the visual evoked potential showed a delay in nerve conduction through the optical pathways (P2 wave at 136 ms, amplitude of 15–20 μV). Conventional karyotype analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis (MLPA) for ID, Prader–Willi methylation testing, and X-fragile analysis were normal. Array comparative genomic hybridization detected an approximately 493 Kb duplication of chromosome band 15q11.2 (22.756.505–23.249.681) and an approximately 127 Kb deletion of chromosome band 8p11.22 (39.258.894–39.386.158). These were not considered to cause the patient’s neurological symptoms. The TruSight One Expanded Sequencing Panel (Illumina) detected a COL4A3BP variant (NM: 001130105.1 [COL4A3BP]: c.2242_2243dupAA; p.[Pro749fs]). Other variants of interest that were not considered to cause the patient’s ID were also detected (Table S2). The Gene Nomenclature Committee of the Human Genome Organization revised the official symbol of the gene from COL4A3BP to CERT1 in 2019 (https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/HGNC:2205). Additionally, in most human tissue types, the predominant transcript of CERT1 encodes a ceramide transport protein, CERT, of 598 amino acid residues (7Murakami H. Tamura N. Enomoto Y. Shimasaki K. Kurosawa K. Hanada K. Intellectual disability-associated gain-of-function mutations in CERT1 that encodes the ceramide transport protein CERT.PLoS One. 2020; 15e0243980Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hereafter use the amino acid numbering of CERT for the CERT1 gene product (Fig. 1A). The frameshift dupAA variant changes the terminal four amino acid residues (PILF) in wild-type (WT) CERT to ten amino residues (SLFCSSINRY) (Fig. 1B). Although the heterozygous variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Fig. 1, A and B), we concluded that it was noncausative of ID because it was segregated from ID in familial analysis. We came to this conclusion because the mother has the same variant, although she has no ID (Fig. 1A). By contrast, a sister of the patient does not have the variant although she was diagnosed with ID. The father does not have the variant (data not shown). To validate the effect of the dupAA mutation on the function of CERT, we established dupAA mutation knockin (KI) HCT116 cell lines (Fig. S1). In line with the Sanger sequence analysis, heterozygous and homozygous KI cell lines did not show any defects in CERT function in biochemical studies (Fig. S1). Therefore, we confirmed that the dupAA mutation was not causative in this patient with ID. While the dupAA was not associated with ID, we considered that this CERT variant could serve as an invaluable negative control to ID-associated CERT variants. Phosphorylation of multiple serine/threonine residues of the CERT SRM downregulates the activity of CERT (11Kumagai K. Kawano M. Shinkai-Ouchi F. Nishijima M. Hanada K.

Serine-to-alanine substitution at the 132nd position (S132A) in CERT was shown to render the protein constitutively active (11Kumagai K. Kawano M. Shinkai-Ouchi F. Nishijima M. Hanada K.

However, human whole-exon sequencing studies have recently shown various examples of missense mutations (e.g., S132L, S135C, S135P, and S138C) that generate amino acid replacements in the SRM of CERT and are associated with inherited ID disorders (2de Ligt J.

Intellectual disability-associated gain-of-function mutations in CERT1 that encodes the ceramide transport protein CERT.PLoS One. 2020; 15e0243980Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Amino acids that are affected by the ID-associated CERT1 variants are highly conserved in model organisms (Fig. S2). In addition to serine residues in the SRM of CERT, glycine residue for the ID-associated G243R substitution, which is located in a non-SRM region, is also conserved, except for in Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. S2). However, whether ID-associated variants located in non-SRM regions in CERT affect the phospho-state of the SRM, the activity of CERT, and/or subcellular localization remain unknown. Therefore, we decided to compare biochemical and cell biological features of S132L (which was expected to impair SRM phosphorylation) and G243R. To achieve this aim, we also used two controls, including WT CERT and a novel, but ID-unrelated variant, CERT dupAA. To characterize CERT mutants in the absence of endogenous CERT, we used a HCT116 CERT1 knockout (KO) cell line, in which both alleles of CERT1 were disrupted in human colon-cancer-derived HCT116 cells. Various constructs encoding CERT mutants tagged with influenza hemagglutinin (HA) or monomeric Venus (mVenus) were stably expressed in the HCT116 CERT1 KO cells and analyzed. Similar to the endogenous CERT in HCT116 cells, the ectopically expressed HA- or mVenus-tagged WT CERT showed a major hyperphosphorylated form, while the ectopically expressed HA- or mVenus-tagged CERT S132L only displayed de/hypophosphorylated forms (Figs. 2 and 3A). These findings are in line with our previous study on CERT S132A (11Kumagai K. Kawano M. Shinkai-Ouchi F. Nishijima M. Hanada K. Interorganelle trafficking of ceramide is regulated by phosphorylation-dependent cooperativity between the PH and START domains of CERT.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17758-17766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the marked shift from hyperphosphorylated to de/hypophosphorylated forms was also observed for the ectopically expressed HA- or mVenus-tagged CERT G243R, but not CERT dupAA (Figs. 2 and 3A). We then assessed the activity of CERT by metabolic labeling of SM with radioactive serine. Labeling of SM, but not other sphingolipids [i.e., ceramide and glucosylceramide (GlcCer)] or glycerophospholipids (i.e., phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine), was reduced in CERT1 KO cells compared with parental HCT116 cells. This reduction was restored to parental control levels when mVenus-tagged WT CERT was expressed in CERT1 KO cells (Fig. 3B). When the mutant CERT S132L or G243R constructs were expressed, the levels of labeled SM were significantly higher than those observed in the WT CERT rescued cells (p-value, S132L-0.016, and G243R-0.020) (Fig. 3B). This finding occurred despite almost equal or lower expression levels of these CERT mutants compared with WT CERT levels (Fig. 3A). By contrast, expression of the mutant CERT dupAA restored SM synthesis, but not beyond the WT control level (Fig. 3B). This finding indicated that CERT dupAA was functional for ER-to-Golgi trafficking of ceramide. The sensitivity to lysenin, which is an SM-binding cytolysin, was monitored as another measure of SM synthesis (8Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M.

Cells that expressed the CERT S132L and G243R mutants, but not the dupAA mutant, showed higher lysenin sensitivity compared with WT CERT expressing cells (p-value, S132L-0.006, and G243R-0.004) (Fig. 3C).

When compared with the WT cell control, not only the amount of ceramide but also that of GlcCer increased in CERT1 KO cells (Fig. 4), possibly due to compensatory responses to the decrease in the amount of SM, in agreement with a previous study (15Yamaji T. Hanada K. Establishment of HeLa cell mutants deficient in sphingolipid-related genes using TALENs.PLoS One. 2014; 9e88124Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These alterations were abolished by WT CERT ectopic expression in CERT1 KO cells (Fig. 4). However, under our experimental condition, when the ID-associated variants S132L and G243R were ectopically expressed in CERT1 KO cells, there was no significant difference in sphingolipid levels in the variant-expressing cells compared with the WT CERT-expressing cells (Fig. 4). Therefore, the sphingolipid composition of the whole cell did not change, even though abnormally activated CERT variants were expressed. We recently showed that ID-associated S135P and S135C substitutions in CERT caused these proteins to become abnormally active and induce a punctate subcellular distribution (7Murakami H. Tamura N. Enomoto Y. Shimasaki K. Kurosawa K. Hanada K. Intellectual disability-associated gain-of-function mutations in CERT1 that encodes the ceramide transport protein CERT.PLoS One. 2020; 15e0243980Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). When mVenus-tagged CERT variants were expressed in HCT116 CERT1 KO cells, WT CERT was diffused throughout the cytoplasm with partial enrichment in the perinuclear regions, which are adjacent to a 130-kDa cis-Golgi matrix protein (GM130) (Fig. 5). The CERT S132L and G243R mutants showed a punctate distribution pattern, and part of the puncta was costained with the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP)-A (Fig. 5). By contrast, CERT dupAA showed no punctate distribution and showed a pattern that was similar to that of CERT WT (Fig. 5). These results taken together with our previous studies showing analogous behavior of other activated CERT mutants (i.e., S132A, S135A, S135C, S135P, and S315E), which showed a punctate distribution (7Murakami H. Tamura N. Enomoto Y. Shimasaki K. Kurosawa K. Hanada K.

This conclusion supports our previous proposal that the intracellular punctate distribution pattern of CERT mutants may be applicable as a molecular diagnostic assay to assess whether CERT is abnormally activated by CERT1 mutations. Clinical genetic sequencing is frequently used to diagnose individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, including ID.

https://openalex.org/W3207753639,"Vestigial-like family member 3 (VGLL3), a member of the vestigial-like family, is a cofactor of the TEA-domain-containing transcription factor (TEAD). Although elevation in VGLL3 expression is associated with inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory sarcomas and autoimmune diseases, the molecular mechanisms underlying VGLL3-mediated inflammation remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between elevated VGLL3 expression and the levels of NF-κB, a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in inflammation. NF-κB was found to be activated in a cell line stably expressing VGLL3. Mechanistically, VGLL3 was shown to promote the expression and secretion of the potent NF-κB-activating cytokine interleukin (IL)-1α, probably through its association with TEADs. As VGLL3 is a target of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling, we analyzed IL-1α induction upon TGF-β stimulation. TGF-β stimulation was observed to induce IL-1α secretion and NF-κB activation, and VGLL3 was associated with this phenomenon. The TGF-β transcription factors Smad3 and Smad4 were shown to be necessary for inducing VGLL3 and IL-1α expression. Lastly, we found that VGLL3-dependent IL-1α secretion is involved in constitutive NF-κB activation in highly malignant breast cancer cells. Collectively, the findings suggested that VGLL3 expression and TGF-β stimulation activate the inflammatory response by inducing IL-1α secretion."
https://openalex.org/W3204982237,"To assess the repeatability of multiple automatic vessel density (VD) measurements and the effect of image averaging on vessel detection by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).An observational study was conducted in a series of healthy volunteers and patients with macular oedema. Five sequential OCTA images were acquired for each eye using the OptoVue HD device. The effect of the averaging of the 5 acquisitions on vessel detection was analysed quantitatively using a pixel-by-pixel automated analysis. In addition, two independent retina experts qualitatively assessed the change in vessel detection in averaged images segmented in 9 boxes and compared to the first non-averaged image.The automatic VD measurement in OCTA images showed a good repeatability with an overall mean intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.924. The mean ICC was higher in healthy eyes compared to eyes with macular oedema (0.877 versus 0.960; p < 0.001) and in the superficial vascular plexus versus the deep vascular complex (0.967 versus 0.888; p = 0.001). The quantitative analysis of the effect of the averaging showed that averaged images had a mean gain of 790.4 pixels/box, located around or completing interruptions in the vessel walls, and a mean loss of 727.2 pixels/box. The qualitative analysis of the averaged images showed that 99.6% of boxes in the averaged images had a gain in vessel detection (i.e., vessels detected in the averaged image but not in the non-averaged image). The loss of pixels was due to a reduction in background noise and motion artifacts in all cases and no case of loss of vessel detection was observed.The automatic VD measurement using the OptoVue HD device showed a good repeatability in 5 acquisitions in a row setting. Averaging images increased vessel detection, and in about a third of boxes, decreased the background noise, both in healthy eyes and, in a greater proportion, in eyes with macular oedema."
https://openalex.org/W3205165846,"Background Trans women face disproportionate burden of adverse health outcomes, including mental health issues. Very little is known about suicidal behavior among trans women in low- and middle-income settings, such as Brazil. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of lifetime suicidal behavior and to identify its associated factors among Brazilian trans women. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 345 trans women living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We examined the prevalence of suicidal behavior (ideation and suicide attempt) and its associated factors using stepwise backward Poisson regression analysis with robust variance. Results Suicidal ideation was present among 47.25% of participants, and the prevalence of lifetime suicide attempt was 27.25%. Trans women with prior physical violence perpetrated by a family member had significantly higher prevalence of suicidal ideation (adjusted prevalence ratios [aPR]1.37), whereas those who reported sex work had lower prevalence ratio of suicidal ideation (aPR 0.76). Suicide attempt was significantly associated with living alone (aPR 1.48), physical violence by a casual partner (aPR 1.92), and sexual violence by a family member (aPR 1.69). Depression was significantly associated with both outcomes (aPR 1.90 for suicidal ideation and aPR 2.21 for suicide attempt). Conclusion Suicidal behavior prevalence rates among Brazilian trans women were alarming and directly linked to violence and poor mental health. Effective mental health and public health policies addressing violence against trans women are urgently needed to prevent suicidal behavior among this highly vulnerable population."

However, the etiology and exact molecular mechanism of LIHC are still not fully understood, which makes it urgent for us to further study the molecular events behind.In this study, differences in mRNA expression between LIHC samples and normal adjacent samples were found through analyzing the TCGA database, and key targets were sought. We analyzed 371 LIHC samples and 50 normal adjacent samples according to P <0.01 and logFC>2.5, a total of 1092 genes were identified differentially expressed, including 995 up-regulated genes and 97 down-regulated genes. We predicted the interactions of these differentially expressed mRNAs, and used Cyto-Hubba to locate the hub gene-dynein cytoplasmic 1 intermediate chain 1 (DYNC1I1).Survival analysis showed that DYNC1I1 was a prognostic factor for LIHC male patients. Functional enrichment indicated that DYNC1I1 and differentially expressed interacting proteins were involved in the cell cycle.In conclusion, this study discovers that DYNC1I1 can be used as a prognostic marker for LIHC male patients."
https://openalex.org/W3205293571,"Obligate coastline taxa generally occupy very limited areas, especially when there is a close affinity with a specific coast type. Climate change can be a meaningful threat for them, reducing suitable habitat or forcing migration events. Cistus ladanifer subsp. sulcatus is an endemic plant of Portugal, known to occur only in the top of its south-western coast’s prominent cliffs. In spite of being included in the annexes II and IV of the European Habitats Directive of Natura 2000 Network, this taxon is still understudied, especially regarding the effects of climate change on its distribution. To overcome such gap, Maxent was used to model the current distribution of C . ladanifer subsp. sulcatus and project its future distribution considering different General Circulation Models, periods (2050 and 2070) and Representation Concentration Pathways (4.5 and 8.5). The results suggested an extensive range contraction in the future, and extinction is a possible scenario. The proximity to littoral cliffs is crucial for this plant’s occurrence, but these formations are irregularly distributed along the coast, hindering range expansions, further inhibited by a small dispersal capacity. C istus ladanifer subsp. sulcatus will probably remain confined to south-western Portugal in the future, where it will continue to face relevant threats like human activity, reinforcing the need for its conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3205734831,"Poor sperm morphology and an elevated DNA fragmentation level are considered to be related to spermiogenesis malfunctions as a result of genetic mutations and effects of environmental factors, including industrial pollution. Standardized cross-sectional population studies of sperm morphology defects and sperm DNA fragmentation, especially in regions with increased environmental pollution may be helpful to investigate an influence of industrial pollution and other population-related factors on spermiogenesis process. The aim of present study was to estimate an influence industrial pollution on sperm morphogenesis and sperm DNA fragmentation in men from the general population of the Western Siberia. The Novosibirsk and Kemerovo cities are located to same climatic conditions in Western Siberia but the Kemerovo city is characterized by increased environmental pollution especially by particulate matter (PM). The male volunteers living in Novosibirsk (n = 278) and Kemerovo (n = 258) were enrolled. Percentages of sperm morphological defects are counted after staining native ejaculate smears by Diff-Quick kits. DNA fragmentation was estimated by a SCSA technique. The residents of Kemerovo were characterized by lowered sperm count and sperm motility, elevated DNA fragmentation, poor sperm morphology and increased incidence of morphological effects of head (pyriform, elongated, round, abnormal acrosome and vacuolated chromatine), asymmetrical neck insertion and excess residual cytoplasm. Moreover, elevated DNA fragmentation was associated with lowered sperm count, sperm motility and increased percentages of several sperm morphology defects, with the place of residence affecting the relationships between conventional semen parameters, sperm morphology and DNA fragmentations. Our study suggests that excessive sperm head elongation and impaired acrosome formation can contribute to sperm morphology deterioration in men from polluted areas. Regional features in the relationships between sperm morphology, sperm count and DNA fragmentation were shown, suggesting an importance of studying sperm morphology pattern in men from different regions."
https://openalex.org/W3206164918,"The purpose of this study was to examine whether racial and ethnic differences in retinal microvasculature are detectable with quantitative measures derived from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).OCTA scans and fundus photography were obtained in 447 eyes from 271 patients with and without diabetes between April and October 2018. Fundus photos were graded by the hospital reading center for diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity. Eight OCTA parameters relating to the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), superficial vascular perfusion, and deep vascular perfusion were analyzed for significant differences between race and ethnicity groups, self-reported by patients and organized according to National Center for Health Statistics groupings. Multiple regression was then used to adjust estimates for possible confounding by age, gender, hypertension, and last hemoglobin A1c level.Significant differences in FAZ area were found between white and non-white patients. After adjustment, the differences between white and all non-white groups were statistically significant (p<0.05) among patients with mild to moderate DR. In those without diabetes, the Hispanic and Asian groups had significantly larger FAZ areas (p<0.005) than NH white patients. In those with mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), NH Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients also had significantly larger FAZ areas than NH white patients (p<0.005).Significant differences in FAZ area exist among different racial and ethnic groups. These results highlight the importance of considering and further studying race and ethnicity in OCTA analyses of the retinal microvasculature."

Southeast Asian countries where several boundary lines exist were considered as the origin of seagrasses. We hypothesize that the boundary lines, such as Wallace's and Lydekker's Lines, may act as marine geographic barriers to the population structure of Halophila major. Seagrass samples were collected at three islands in Vietnamese waters and analyzed by the molecular maker ITS. These sequences were compared with published ITS sequences from seagrasses collected in the whole region of interest. In this study, we reveal the haplotype and nucleotide diversity, linking population genetics, phylogeography, phylogenetics and estimation of relative divergence times of H. major and other members of the Halophila genus. The morphological characters show variation. The results of the ITS marker analysis reveal smaller groups of H. major from Myanmar, Shoalwater Bay (Australia) and Okinawa (Japan) with high supporting values. The remaining groups including Sri Lanka, Viet Nam, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Two Peoples Bay (Australia) and Tokushima (Japan) showed low supporting values. The Wallacea region shows the highest haplotype and also nucleotide diversity. Non-significant differences were found among regions, but significant differences were presented among populations. The relative divergence times between some members of section Halophila were estimated 2.15-6.64 Mya."
https://openalex.org/W3207042802,"Since the 2008 global food crisis, food security vulnerability has been a prominent topic in the food policy debate. However, vulnerability is inherently difficult to conceptualize and is more challenging to operationalize and measure. This study constructs a mathematical model and takes China as a case study to measure the vulnerability and sensitivity of China with its partners in the international grain trade. The results show that 1) the degree of interdependence between China and its grain trading partners is asymmetric, which generates trade vulnerability or economic power; 2) the vulnerability of China's food trade shows a high spatiotemporal heterogeneity among countries: the higher vulnerability zones are concentrated in North America and Northeast Asia, and the scope of the higher vulnerability zones tends to expand; 3) Our results also reveal that China also has different sensitivities to fluctuations in grain markets from different countries, and the higher sensitive zones of the grain trade in China are mainly distributed in America, Europe, and Oceania. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a methodology for food trade vulnerability assessment and examines the influence of international food trade on food security in importing countries, measured using the vulnerability index and sensitivity index. Nevertheless, the conclusions of this study can be considered preliminary, and there remains great potential for future studies to deepen and broaden our analyses further."
https://openalex.org/W3205250852,"Epidemiological data suggest that inflammation and innate immunity play significant roles in the pathogenesis of age-related hearing loss (ARHL) in humans. In this mouse study, real-time RT-PCR array targeting 84 immune-related genes revealed that the expressions of 40 genes (47.6%) were differentially regulated with greater than a twofold change in 12-month-old cochleae with ARHL relative to young control mice, 33 (39.3%) of which were upregulated. These differentially regulated genes (DEGs) were involved in functional pathways for cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling, TNF signaling, and Toll-like receptor signaling. An NF-κB subunit, Nfkb1, was upregulated in aged cochleae, and bioinformatic analyses predicted that NF-κB would interact with the genomic regulatory regions of eight upregulated DEGs, including Tnf and Ptgs2. In aging cochleae, major proinflammatory molecules, IL1B and IL18rap, were upregulated by 6 months of age and thereafter. Remarkable upregulations of seven immune-related genes (Casp1, IL18r1, IL1B, Card9, Clec4e, Ifit1, and Tlr9) occurred at an advanced stage (between 9 and 12 months of age) of ARHL. Immunohistochemistry analysis of cochlear sections from the 12-month-old mice indicated that IL-18r1 and IL-1B were localized to the spiral ligament, spiral limbus, and organ of Corti. The two NF-κB-interacting inflammatory molecules, TNFα and PTGS2, immunolocalized ubiquitously in cochlear structures, including the lateral wall (the stria vascularis and spiral ligament), in the histological sections of aged cochleae. IBA1-positive macrophages were observed in the stria vascularis and spiral ligament in aged mice. Therefore, inflammatory and immune reactions are modulated in aged cochlear tissues with ARHL."

Structural details of these interactions are unclear because of the unavailability of recombinant full-length ALIX, owing to difficulties in expressing ALIX-PRD in bacteria and its disordered nature. Intact ALIX was, however, successfully produced using a baculovirus–insect cell expression system (14Zhai Q. Landesman M.B. Chung H.-Y. Dierkers A. Jeffries C.M. Trewhella J. Hill C.P. Sundquist W.I.

We recently discovered that the N-terminal portion of ALIX-PRD (residues 703–800) is disordered, whereas its C-terminal tyrosine-rich portion (residues 800–868) forms amyloid fibrils that disassemble on Src-mediated hyperphosphorylation (16Elias R.D. Ma W. Ghirlando R. Schwieters C.D. Reddy V.S. Deshmukh L. Proline-rich domain of human ALIX contains multiple TSG101-UEV interaction sites and forms phosphorylation-mediated reversible amyloids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 24274-24284Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on cellular redistribution and functions of ALIX are unclear. Using recombinant ALIX domains and a range of biophysical methods, including NMR, fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS), we elucidate how tyrosine phosphorylation affects the interplay between ALIX conformation, assembly, and function (poor bacterial expression and the overall size, ∼96 kDa, do not allow for a similar study in the context of full-length ALIX). Codon optimization coupled with a single-point mutation permitted expression of full-length ALIX-PRD in Escherichia coli. We show that PRD forms reversible β-sheet–rich fibrils modulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs), Src-mediated phosphorylation, and human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B)–mediated dephosphorylation of its conserved tyrosine residues. We establish that Bro1 binds to hyperphosphorylated PRD and to analogs of late endosomal membranes. The close correlation between the regions of Bro1 that associate with hyperphosphorylated PRD and with anionic phospholipids elucidates the underlying mechanism of PRD-mediated autoinhibition of ALIX–membrane interactions and how tyrosine phosphorylation causes redistribution of ALIX away from late endosomal membranes into the cytosol. The current work made use of five recombinant ALIX constructs (Fig. 1, B and C). These include constructs representing the individual Bro1 and V domains (residues 1–359 and 360–702, respectively), a construct comprising both the Bro1 and V domains (residues 1–702; referred to as Bro1-V), and two constructs representing the N-terminal portion of PRD, PRD703–800Strep (residues 703–800), and the entire PRD, PRD703–868Strep (residues 703–868); “Strep” denotes a noncleavable C-terminal strep-affinity tag (17Schmidt T.G.

Protoc. 2007; 2: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) that facilitated purification of intact PRD constructs from their truncated fragments using affinity chromatography. The latter are generated during heterologous expression of ALIX-PRD in E. coli because of translational arrest induced by its polyproline motifs. PRD703–868Strep carries a P801G point mutation to resolve issues with protein expression in E. coli. We previously established that the 800GPPYP804 segment of ALIX-PRD is responsible for ribosomal stalling in E. coli, resulting in essentially no expression of wildtype PRD beyond residue 801 (16Elias R.D.

Using dye-binding assays with amyloid-specific probes, thioflavin T (ThT) and congo red (CR), and TEM, we previously established that the C-terminal tyrosine-rich fragment of ALIX-PRD (PRD800–868) forms rope-like fibrils that dissolve into monomeric units on Src-mediated hyperphosphorylation (16Elias R.D. Ma W. Ghirlando R. Schwieters C.D. Reddy V.S. Deshmukh L. Proline-rich domain of human ALIX contains multiple TSG101-UEV interaction sites and forms phosphorylation-mediated reversible amyloids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 24274-24284Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Because of the poor solubility of PRD800–868 (<30 μM; pH 4.5–7), the data reported in our prior study were collected on a fusion protein with an N-terminal solubility enhancement tag comprising the B1 domain of protein G (GB1) (18Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Design of an expression system for detecting folded protein domains and mapping macromolecular interactions by NMR.Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast to PRD800–868, PRD703–868Strep was more soluble (∼300 μM; pH 4.5–8), which allowed us to characterize its aggregation properties and its interactions with Src in the absence of a GB1 tag. LC–ESI–TOFMS analyses of Src-mediated phosphorylation revealed the formation of hyperphosphorylated PRD703–868Strep with phosphorylation of six to ten (out of 15) tyrosine residues (Fig. 2A and Table S1). ThT emission assays confirmed the presence of β-sheet–rich conformations for PRD703–868Strep aggregates (Fig. 2B). Spectral-shift assays carried out using CR demonstrated clear shifts toward 540 nm, further validating their amyloidogenic nature (Fig. 2C). For these assays, the soluble N-terminal fragment, PRD703–800Strep (16Elias R.D. Ma W. Ghirlando R. Schwieters C.D. Reddy V.S. Deshmukh L. Proline-rich domain of human ALIX contains multiple TSG101-UEV interaction sites and forms phosphorylation-mediated reversible amyloids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 24274-24284Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and hyperphosphorylated PRD703–868Strep served as negative controls. NMR analysis revealed a near-perfect superimposition of 1H–15N transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)–heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of these two proteins, establishing Src-mediated dissolution of PRD703–868Strep aggregates into NMR-amenable soluble monomers and the complete lack of interactions between the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of PRD (Fig. S2). Backbone resonance assignments of hyperphosphorylated PRD703–868Strep were not feasible owing to the complexity and heterogeneity of its phosphorylation pattern. However, a narrow chemical shift dispersion (∼7.7–8.7 ppm) suggested that the hyperphosphorylated PRD703–868Strep is disordered in solution. TEM analyses revealed the presence of rope-like unbranched PRD703–868Strep filaments, characteristic of amyloid fibrils (Fig. 2D). CD spectroscopic data confirmed the presence of β-sheet conformations in these fibrils (Fig. 2E), corroborating the presence of amyloid structure. The corresponding CD spectrum of hyperphosphorylated PRD703–868Strep validated its random-coil conformation. To identify the fibril core resistant to protease treatment, a limited digestion of PRD703–868Strep fibrils was carried out using proteinase K (PK) (Fig. 2, F and G). Based on band intensities of the reaction mixture comprising intact protein and the proteolyzed products monitored using SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2F), we conclude that PRD703–868Strep fibrils are resistant to PK digestion as the band for PRD703–868Strep persisted after ∼60 min of incubation with PK, albeit at a lower intensity than the corresponding band at time 0. In contrast, the soluble PRD703–800Strep was completely hydrolyzed by PK within ∼5 min of the reaction. LC–tandem MS (LC–MS/MS) analysis of PK digestion of PRD703–868Strep fibrils revealed that the two most abundant fragments were localized in the C-terminal region, residues 800 to 813 and 840 to 863 (Figs. 2G and S3), indicating that these motifs likely participate in the formation of the fibril core. A limited PK digestion (incubation time of ∼5 min) was also performed on hyperphosphorylated PRD703–868Strep, and the corresponding cleavage products were identified using LC–MS/MS, which permitted identification of phosphorylated tyrosine residues, namely 803, 806, 809, 812, 829, 833, 837, 846, and 854 (Fig. S4). Nothing definitive can be said about the phosphorylation status of the remaining tyrosine residues because of sequencing coverage gaps arising from problems associated with proteolytic digestion of PRD703–868Strep. Note that the tyrosine-rich portion of PRD703–868Strep, residues 800 to 868, carries no native lysine and arginine residues (cf., Fig. 1A) and, thus, cannot be probed by traditional trypsin-based proteomics (19Tsiatsiani L. Heck A.J. Proteomics beyond trypsin.FEBS J. 2015; 282: 2612-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). PK digestion of hyperphosphorylated PRD703–868Strep was not analyzed by SDS-PAGE because of smearing of protein bands owing to phosphorylation (20Baudier J. Cole R.D. Phosphorylation of tau proteins to a state like that in Alzheimer's brain is catalyzed by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase and modulated by phospholipids.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17577-17583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the impact of tyrosine phosphorylation on PRD703–868Strep polymerization, aggregation kinetics using ThT fluorescence were monitored. PRD703–868Strep exhibited sigmoidal aggregation profiles, a hallmark of fibril formation (Fig. 2H). To establish Src-mediated dissolution of PRD703–868Strep fibrils, Src and ATP were added to PRD703–868Strep samples upon reaching a stationary phase (at ∼3 h; Fig. 2H), which resulted in a significant loss of ThT signal with a corresponding half-life (t1/2) of ∼0.2 h. The remaining PRD703–868Strep samples were mixed with either Src or ATP and displayed no drop in ThT signals, indicating that Src or ATP do not affect PRD703–868Strep fibrils. Remarkably, judging by the rapid appearance of characteristic sigmoidal ThT profiles (t1/2 ∼0.5 h; Fig. 2I), dephosphorylation of hyperphosphorylated PRD703–868Strep by PTP1B resulted in restoration of fibrils, whereas the hyperphosphorylated PRD703–868Strep without PTP1B showed no sigmoidal ThT profile (activity of recombinant PTP1B was measured using the malachite green assay; Fig. S5. For Src, the activity was measured using the ADP-Glo assay, described in our previous work (16Elias R.D. Ma W. Ghirlando R. Schwieters C.D. Reddy V.S. Deshmukh L. Proline-rich domain of human ALIX contains multiple TSG101-UEV interaction sites and forms phosphorylation-mediated reversible amyloids.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 24274-24284Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar)). Although the exact identity of the phosphatase that works in tandem with ALIX is not known, PTP1B was suggested to regulate the endosomal sorting machinery (21Stuible M. Abella J.V. Feldhammer M. Nossov M. Sangwan V. Blagoev B. Park M. Tremblay M.L. PTP1B targets the endosomal sorting machinery: Dephosphorylation of regulatory sites on the endosomal sorting complex required for transport component STAM2.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23899-23907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These observations establish that PRD703–868Strep forms rope-like β-sheet–rich fibrils that dissolve into soluble monomers on hyperphosphorylation by Src and that the removal of phosphoryl groups via PTP1B culminates in the restoration of fibrils, making PRD703–868Strep a completely reversible amyloid controlled by PTMs (Fig. 2J). In addition to PRD, Src is suggested to phosphorylate the Bro1 domain of ALIX in vivo (8Schmidt M.H.H. Dikic I. Bogler O. Src phosphorylation of Alix/AIP1 modulates its interaction with binding partners and antagonizes its activities.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3414-3425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To characterize the impact of phosphorylation on Bro1, we performed detailed NMR analyses of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated Bro1, described below. ALIX–Src interactions are suggested to proceed in a stepwise fashion in vivo, where Src first binds and phosphorylates the highly conserved region, 312KKDNDFIY319, of the Bro1 domain, followed by hyperphosphorylation of the tyrosine-rich portion of PRD, ultimately resulting in the relocation of ALIX from late endosomal membranes to the cytosol (8Schmidt M.H.H. Dikic I. Bogler O. Src phosphorylation of Alix/AIP1 modulates its interaction with binding partners and antagonizes its activities.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3414-3425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Src-mediated phosphorylation of Bro1 was confirmed using Western blotting (Fig. S6A). LC–ESI–TOFMS and LC–MS/MS analyses established the formation of phosphorylated Bro1 and confirmed the phosphorylation of Y319 (Fig. S6, B and C, respectively). To explore the impact of tyrosine phosphorylation on Bro1 at atomic resolution, we conducted a detailed NMR investigation (Fig. 3). Although the overall size of Bro1 is relatively large for solution NMR studies (∼40 kDa), excellent spectral quality was obtained by perdeuteration coupled with TROSY (Fig. 3A), which allowed us to carry out nearly complete backbone resonance assignments of Bro1. Based on an excellent agreement between the secondary structure derived from the assigned backbone chemical shifts (13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C′, 15N, and 1HN) using TALOS-N (22Shen Y. Bax A. Protein backbone and sidechain torsion angles predicted from NMR chemical shifts using artificial neural networks.J. Biomol. NMR. 2013; 56: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) with that obtained from the three-dimensional crystal structure of Bro1 (Protein Data Bank entry: 5WA1 (23Sadler J.B.A. Wenzel D.M. Williams L.K. Guindo-Martínez M. Alam S.L. Mercader J.M. Torrents D. Ullman K.S. Sundquist W.I. Martin-Serrano J.

A. 2018; 115: E8900-E8908Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); Fig. S7), we conclude that recombinant Bro1 is well folded in solution. To probe structural and conformational changes that take place in Bro1 upon Src-mediated phosphorylation of Y319, 1HN/15N chemical shift perturbation mapping was utilized. NMR analyses of phosphorylated Bro1 revealed large 1HN/15N chemical shift perturbations that arise from the introduction of a negatively charged phosphoryl group (Fig. 3B). Mapping of these perturbations onto the crystal structure of Bro1 allowed identification of regions affected by tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). All perturbations were localized in the regions surrounding Y319, which further confirmed specific phosphorylation of Bro1 by Src. The heteronuclear 15N-{1H} NOE data (Fig. 4) of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated Bro1 indicated that the introduction of phosphoryl group did not affect the local internal mobility of Bro1. Collectively, the aforementioned data established that Src-mediated phosphorylation of Bro1 at Y319 induces local changes.Figure 415N–{1H} heteronuclear NOE data for nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated Bro1. Regions with high local mobility on the nanosecond time scale, 15N–{1H} NOE <0.5, are labeled and marked with semitransparent gray rectangles. The location of Y319 is indicated by a vertical dashed line. All data were acquired with 500 μM 2H/15N labeled proteins at a spectrometer 1H frequency of 800 MHz at 30 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A prior study suggested that the N-terminal portion of PRD, specifically the 717PSAP720 motif that interacts with the ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain of tumor-susceptibility gene 101, directly associates with the Src-binding region of Bro1 (13Zhou X. Si J. Corvera J. Gallick G.E. Kuang J. Decoding the intrinsic mechanism that prohibits ALIX interaction with ESCRT and viral proteins.Biochem. J. 2010; 432: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PRD was also suggested to prevent the binding between the V domain and the YPXnL consensus motifs (X = any residue and n = 1–3) found in viral proteins, although molecular details of this inhibition were not determined (14Zhai Q. Landesman M.B. Chung H.-Y. Dierkers A. Jeffries C.M. Trewhella J. Hill C.P. Sundquist W.I. Activation of the retroviral budding factor ALIX.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 9222-9226Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate interdomain interactions of ALIX, we carried out 1HN/15N chemical shift perturbation mapping using PRD703–800Strep and nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated Bro1 (Fig. 5). Negligible 1HN/15N chemical shift perturbations were observed for both nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated NMR-visible Bro1, one at a time, upon the addition of three-molar equivalents of PRD703–800Strep (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively), indicating that Bro1 did not bind to PRD703–800Strep. The corresponding titration experiments carried out using NMR-visible PRD703–800Strep and unlabeled nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated Bro1 yielded negligible chemical shift changes (Fig. 5C), confirming the lack of Bro1–PRD703–800Strep interactions. To determine the involvement of the V domain, titration experiments were carried out using NMR-visible PRD703–800Strep, in the absence and presence of three-molar equivalents of V and Bro1-V constructs (one at a time). Minimal chemical shift changes indicated that V and Bro1-V constructs did not bind to PRD703–800Strep (Fig. 5C). Experiments using NMR-visible V and Bro1-V constructs were not viable since both produced poor-quality NMR spectra, likely because of the open–close transitions of the V domain in solution (14Zhai Q. Landesman M.B. Chung H.-Y. Dierkers A. Jeffries C.M. Trewhella J. Hill C.P. Sundquist W.I. Activation of the retroviral budding factor ALIX.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 9222-9226Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations indicated that Bro1 and V domains did not interact with PRD703–800Strep. These findings are consistent with the fact that unlike proline-recognition domains such as UEV (24Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. The importance of being proline: The interaction of proline-rich motifs in signaling proteins with their cognate domains.FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 25Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. The structure and function of proline recognition domains.Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003RE8Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), Bro1 domains have not been known to bind to proline-rich motifs, and that ALIX-PRD carries no YPXnL consensus motif recognized by the V domain. Finally, nothing definitive can be said about the interactions of intact PRD703–868Strep with Bro1 and V domains in solution because of its propensity to form fibrils. We, however, uncovered novel interactions between Bro1 and hyperphosphorylated PRD703–868Strep, which are described below. Src-mediated hyperphosphorylation of PRD relocates ALIX from late endosomal membranes to the cytosol (8Schmidt M.H.H. Dikic I. Bogler O. Src phosphorylation of Alix/AIP1 modulates its interaction with binding partners and antagonizes its activities.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3414-3425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), indicating a likely competition between hyperphosphorylated PRD and membranes for association with the phospholipids-binding region(s) of Bro1. To test this hypothesis and identify contacts between Bro1 and hyperphosphorylated PRD703–868Strep, we made use of intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) (26Clore G.M. Iwahara J. Theory, practice, and applications of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement for the characterization of transient low-population states of biological macromolecules and their complexes.Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 4108-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the PRE effect is very large owing to the large magnetic moment of the unpaired electron of the paramagnetic label and is proportional to the <r−6> paramagnetic label—proton distance, which enables the detection of sparsely populated (as low as 0.5–1% in favorable cases) encounter complexes between binding partners (27Deshmukh L.

Antimony failures in leishmaniasis is a challenge both at regional and global level, threatening the ongoing disease control efforts. There is a dearth of information on treatment failures to routine therapy in Sri Lanka, which hinders policy changes in therapeutics. Laboratory-confirmed CL patients (n = 201) who attended the District General Hospital Hambantota and Base Hospital Tangalle in southern Sri Lanka between 2016 and 2018 were included in a descriptive cohort study and followed up for three months to assess the treatment response of their lesions to IL-SSG. Treatment failure (TF) of total study population was 75.1% and the majority of them were >20 years (127/151,84%). Highest TF was seen in lesions on the trunk (16/18, 89%) while those on head and neck showed the least (31/44, 70%). Nodules were least responsive to therapy (27/31, 87.1%) unlike papules (28/44, 63.6%). Susceptibility to antimony therapy seemed age-dependant with treatment failure associated with factors such as time elapsed since onset to seeking treatment, number and site of the lesions. This is the first detailed study on characteristics of CL treatment failures in Sri Lanka. The findings highlight the need for in depth investigations on pathogenesis of TF and importance of reviewing existing treatment protocols to introduce more effective strategies. Such interventions would enable containment of the rapid spread of L.donovani infections in Sri Lanka that threatens the ongoing regional elimination drive."
https://openalex.org/W3207485515,"The giant honey bee Apis dorsata is unusual in being able to forage during both the day and the night. To date, the extent of this unique nocturnal foraging behavior and the environmental factors correlating with it have not been deeply investigated. We conducted the first systematic investigation into the nocturnal behavior of A. dorsata in Southern India by tracking the daily and nightly foraging activity of A. dorsata colonies in an urban environment for 8 months, over multiple seasons and lunar cycles. We found strong evidence that A. dorsata can behave in a manner that is ""cathemeral"" (active over the entire diel cycle) when environmental illumination is sufficient for nocturnal flight. However, workers were not always active even when the environment should have been bright enough for them to forage, suggesting that their nocturnal foraging behavior was also affected by seasonal changes in resource availability. The foraging activity observed during the day versus twilight versus night differed between seasons; notably, nocturnal activity rates were higher than diurnal activity rates during the winter. We found that at our study site A. dorsata routinely exhibits both diurnal and crepuscular activity, foraging just as intensely during the short twilight hours as during the day. The high foraging activity observed during the twilight and nighttime hours shows that A. dorsata colonies can extend their foraging beyond the daylight hours and reveals that foraging during these dimly lit hours is an integral part of their foraging ecology. This evidence of the importance of nocturnal and crepuscular foraging by A. dorsata paves the way for future studies examining the role of this species in nocturnal pollination networks, the contribution of nocturnal foraging to colony-level nutrition and energy budget, and the evolution of this unusual behavior. Future work comparing nocturnal activity in light polluted urban environments versus unpolluted natural environments is particularly encouraged to determine the generalizability of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3205508509,"An impaired blood-retinal barrier (BRB) leads to diabetic macular edema (DME), which is a major complication of Diabetic retinopathy (DR). Mediators such as inflammation cause BRB breakdown. However, the explicit mechanism of its disruption is largely unknown. In this study, we identified tumor necrosis factor ligand-related molecule 1A (TL1A) as a crucial factor which protect retinal endothelial cells integrity in DR. By providing both human and mouse data, we show that TL1A is significantly decreased in the retinas of DME patients and diabetic rodents. We further demonstrate that the loss of TL1A accelerated diabetes-induced retinal barrier breakdown. TL1A supplementation protects the diabetic retina against BRB breakdown. Mechanistically, TL1A stabilize intracellular junctions and protect vascular integrity by blocking SHP1-Src-regulated VE-cadherin phosphorylation. Collectively, our findings reveal that loss of TL1A in the retina leads to increased vascular permeability in DR, and that TL1A treatment is of potential therapeutic interest for the treatment of DME."

Prep1 is a homeodomain transcription factor which stimulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in aortic endothelial cell models and plays a primary role in the regulation of apoptosis. In this study, we have investigated the role of Prep1 in aorta of Prep1 hypomorphic heterozygous mice (Prep1i/+ ) and in VSMCs, and its correlation with aging. Histological analysis from Prep1i/+ aortas revealed a 25% reduction in medial smooth muscle cell density compared to WT animals. This result paralleled higher apoptosis, caspase 3, caspase 9 and p53 levels in Prep1i/+ mice and lower Bcl-xL. Prep1 overexpression in VSMCs decreased apoptosis by 25% and caspase 3 and caspase 9 expression by 40% and 37%. In parallel, Bcl-xL inhibition by BH3I-1 and p53 induction by etoposide reverted the antiapoptotic effect of Prep1. Experiments performed in aorta from 18 months old WT mice showed a significant increase in Prep1, p16INK4 , p21Waf1 and interleukin 6 (IL-6) compared to youngest animals. Similar results have been observed in H2 O2 -induced senescent VSMCs. Interestingly, the synthetic Prep1 inhibitory peptide Prep1 (54-72) reduced the antiapoptotic effects mediated by IL-6, particularly in senescent VSMCs. These results indicate that IL-6-Prep1 signaling reduces apoptosis, by modulating Bcl-xL and p53 both in murine aorta and in VSMCs. In addition, age-dependent increase in IL-6 and Prep1 in senescent VSMCs and in old mice may be involved in the aging-related vascular dysfunction."

Improving cell culture conditions to maintain the pluripotency of ESCs <i>in vitro</i> is an urgent problem in the field of regenerative medicine.

Functional studies reveal that only knockdown of USP13, but not USP10, is capable of mimicking the function of Spautin-1. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that USP13 physically interacts with, deubiquitinates, and stabilizes serine/threonine kinase Raf1 and thereby sustains Raf1 protein at the posttranslational level to activate the FGF/MEK/ERK prodifferentiation signaling pathway in naïve mouse ESCs. In contrast, in primed mouse epiblast stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells, the addition of Spautin-1 had an inhibitory effect on Raf1 levels, but USP13 overexpression promoted self-renewal. The addition of an MEK inhibitor impaired the effect of USP13 upregulation in these cells. These findings provide new insights into the regulatory network of naïve and primed pluripotency."

https://openalex.org/W3205784668,"Violence against medical staff has been prevalent in China over the past two decades. Although Chinese authorities have released many laws and regulations to protect medical staff from violence since 2011, the legal approach alone is unlikely to resolve this complex issue. In particular, several cases of violence against medical staff in China have caused great media sensation.This paper proposes an integrated model that combines the environmental stimuli theory, broken windows theory, and rational choice theory. It adopts the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to untangle the causal relationship between violence against medical staff, media sensation, and judicial judgment. We examined reports of medical violence on media and news websites from January 1, 2010, to January 31, 2020, and selected 50 cases with detailed information for this study.The results show that each condition is not sufficient for the absence of judicial judgment, but when combined, they are conducive to the outcome. The conditions of hospital level, medical cost, and media sensation play important roles. The providers, patients, and environmental factors are indicators of inadequate or lack of judicial judgment, which corresponds to previous expectations.The integrated model greatly enriches the extant theories and literature, and also yields implications for preventing violence against medical staff in China. We suggest that sustainable and innovative healthcare reform should be initiated. For example, public hospitals should remain the cornerstone of national public health security. Medical staff in public hospitals must be regarded as ""civil servants"". Therefore, the current legal system should be improved. The media should objectively report events concerning medical staff and improve public healthcare knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W3207705790,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased substantially since the industrial revolution began, and physiological responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations reportedly alter the biometry and wood structure of trees. Additionally, soil nutrient availability may play an important role in regulating these responses. Therefore, in this study, we grew 288 two-year-old saplings of sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) in lamellar glass domes for three years to evaluate the effects of CO2 concentrations and nutrient supply on above- and belowground biomass, wood density, and wood structure. Elevated CO2 increased above- and belowground biomass by 44.3% and 46.9%, respectively. However, under elevated CO2 treatment, sapling wood density was markedly lower (approximately 1.7%), and notably wider growth rings-and larger, more efficient conduits leading to increased hydraulic conductance-were observed. Moreover, despite the vessels being larger in saplings under elevated CO2, the vessels were significantly fewer (p = 0.023). No direct effects of nutrient supply were observed on biomass growth, wood density, or wood structure, except for a notable decrease in specific leaf area. These results suggest that, although fewer and larger conduits may render the xylem more vulnerable to embolism formation under drought conditions, the high growth rate in sessile oak saplings under elevated CO2 is supported by an efficient vascular system and may increase biomass production in this tree species. Nevertheless, the decreased mechanical strength, indicated by low density and xylem vulnerability to drought, may lead to earlier mortality, offsetting the positive effects of elevated CO2 levels in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3207952601,"Extant research has shown that grandiose narcissism predicts a wide range of work-related outcomes. However, despite differentiating in the social-personality literature besides grandiose narcissism also its vulnerable form, there is little organizational research that would include both expressions of narcissism, in particular with regard to positive organizational behaviors, including strengths use and deficit correction in the workplace. In addition, the role of dark-side personality traits, such as narcissism, in predicting strengths use and deficit correction in the workplace, in particular in regard to motivational factors, seems understudied. Accordingly, this study adds to the literature on narcissism in the organizational context by investigating the direct effects of grandiose and vulnerable narcissism and motivational orientation in the form of regulatory focus at work on strengths use and deficit correction in the workplace. Based on a sample of 446 working adults from the Polish population, it was found that grandiose narcissism positively predicted both strengths use and deficit correction. In turn, vulnerable narcissism was unrelated to strengths use and deficit correction. Furthermore, drawing on the distal-proximal model of work-specific regulatory focus, it also tested whether regulatory focus at work has the incremental validity over grandiose and vulnerable narcissism in predicting strengths use and deficit correction. The hierarchical regression analyses indicated that both promotion and prevention focus were positively associated with strengths use and deficit correction, predicting them beyond grandiose and vulnerable narcissism. The theoretical and practical implications of this study in the context of narcissism in the workplace and positive organizational scholarship are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3205194334,"The effects of saturated fat intake on obesity and cardiovascular health remain inconclusive, likely due in part to their varied nature and interactions with other nutrients. Investigating the synergistic effects of different saturated fat sources with other dietary lipid components will help establish more accurate nutritional guidelines for dietary fat intake. Over the past two decades, zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) have been established as an attractive model system to address questions regarding contributions of dietary lipid intake to diet-induced obesity in humans. The goal of the present study was to assess interactions of three different saturated fat sources (milk fat, palm oil, and coconut oil) with sex and total dietary lipid intake on weight gain and body composition in adult zebrafish. Larvae were raised on live feeds until 28 days post fertilization, and then fed a formulated maintenance diet until three months of age. An eight-week feeding trial was then initiated, in which zebrafish were fed nine experimental low- and high-fat diets varying in saturated fatty acid and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid content, in addition to a low-fat and high-fat control diet. At termination of the feeding trial, each treatment was evaluated according to body mass, moisture content, and adiposity. Sex and diet significantly interacted in their effects on body mass ( P = 0.026), moisture content ( P = 0.044), and adiposity ( P = 0.035). The influence of saturated fat source on body mass was observed to be dependent on intake of total dietary lipid. In females, all three saturated fat sources had similar effects on adiposity. From these observations, we hypothesize that impacts of saturated fat intake on energy allocation and obesity-related phenotypes are influenced by both sex and intake of other dietary lipid components. Our results suggest that current nutritional guidelines for saturated fat intake may need to be re-evaluated and take sex-specific recommendations into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W3205482096,"Night shift workers might not eat due to their busy schedules during the night shift. However, food may not only satisfy hunger, but also affect performance and errors. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of a snack on performance and errors during 2-day, 16-h, simulated night shifts.A randomized, repeated-measure, crossover study was performed to investigate subjective and cognitive performance in 15 healthy female adults (mean age, 21.7 years) after they consumed a snack (352 kcal) during a simulated night shift (16:00 to 09:00) from October to November 2018. The participants were kept awake from waking up in the morning to the next day at 09:00. Subjects were tested for performance on the Uchida-Kraepelin test, as well as for subjective feeling, body temperature, psychomotor vigilance test, and heart rate variability, before and after they consumed the snack. One day before the experiment, all participants wore an actigraphy monitoring device to determine their sleep state.There was no difference between having (Snack condition) and not having (Skipping condition) the snack in sleep states the day before the experiment. On the day of the experiment, between 16:00 and 09:00, subjective sleepiness, fatigue, and body temperature were not different between the two conditions. Subjects maintained performance on the Uchida-Kraepelin test and showed a significant improvement in false starts on the psychomotor vigilance test, the primary outcome measure, in the Snack condition compared with the Skipping condition. The Snack condition was also associated with decreased high-frequency power, a decreased low-frequency power/high-frequency power ratio, and increased heart rate in the vagally mediated heart rate variability indices, which may reflect a higher ability to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes.These results suggest that providing a snack to shift workers during night shifts might improve work safety and efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3207359245,"The extracellular domain (ED) of the membrane-spanning sialoglycoprotein, mucin-1 (MUC1), is an in vivo substrate for the lysosomal sialidase, neuraminidase-1 (NEU1). Engagement of the MUC1-ED by its cognate ligand, Pseudomonas aeruginosa-expressed flagellin, increases NEU1-MUC1 association and NEU1-mediated MUC1-ED desialylation to unmask cryptic binding sites for its ligand. However, the mechanism(s) through which intracellular NEU1 might physically interact with its surface-expressed MUC1-ED substrate are unclear. Using reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays in a human airway epithelial cell system, we show here that NEU1 associates with the MUC1-cytoplasmic domain (CD) but not with the MUC1-ED. Prior pharmacologic inhibition of the NEU1 catalytic activity using the NEU1-selective sialidase inhibitor, C9-butyl amide-2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid, did not diminish NEU1-MUC1-CD association. In addition, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays using the deletion mutants of the MUC1-CD mapped the NEU1-binding site to the membrane-proximal 36 aa of the MUC1-CD. In a cell-free system, we found that the purified NEU1 interacted with the immobilized GST-MUC1-CD and the purified MUC1-CD associated with the immobilized 6XHis-NEU1, indicating that the NEU1-MUC1-CD interaction was direct and independent of its chaperone protein, protective protein/cathepsin A. However, the NEU1-MUC1-CD interaction was not required for the NEU1-mediated MUC1-ED desialylation. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpression of either WT NEU1 or a catalytically dead NEU1 G68V mutant diminished the association of the established MUC1-CD binding partner, PI3K, to MUC1-CD and reduced downstream Akt kinase phosphorylation. These results indicate that NEU1 associates with the juxtamembranous region of the MUC1-CD to inhibit PI3K-Akt signaling independent of NEU1 catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W3205675672,"The relationship between migration and fertility has vexed demographers for years. One issue missing in the literature is the lack of careful temporal consideration of when women migrate and specifically, the extent to which they do either before or after live births.Here, we opt for a more appropriate methodological approach to help remedy the complexity of the temporal aspect of migration and childbirth processes: regression models using the episode-splitting method.This paper applies a rarely used methodological approach (episode-splitting) in the literature of migration-fertility relationship to investigate how internal in-migration is associated with inter-birth intervals among women in Cotonou, the largest city of Benin. Data comes from the 2017-2018 Benin Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of women aged 15-49. Estimates from exponential regression models with episode-splitting were compared to estimates from exponential regression models without episode-splitting approach. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to determine the robustness of the comparison between the two methods. Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) were used to identify the method that provides models with best fit.The results from (standard) exponential regression models without episode-splitting show that there is no significant association between migration and interbirth transition rate. However, significant associations between migration and interbirth transition rate emerge after applying the episode splitting method. The hazard ratios (HR) of the transition to the next live birth are higher among migrant women than among nonmigrant women. This trend is persistent even after 10 years spent in Cotonou by migrant women.Exponential regression models with episode-splitting were of better fit than exponential regression models without episode-splitting. Sensitivity analysis conducted seems to confirm that models with episode-splitting produce estimates that are accurate, reliable and superior to models without episode-splitting. The results suggest a long-run process adaptation of migrants to lower fertility behaviours in Cotonou and are therefore consistent with the socialization hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W3205849629,"Global changes in precipitation and atmospheric N deposition affect the geochemical cycle of the element and its hydrological cycle in the ecosystem. It may also affect the relationship between plant water use efficiency (WUE) and nutrients, as well as the relationship between plant nutrients. Desert ecosystems are vulnerable to global changes. Haloxylon ammodendron is the dominant species in the Asian desert. Revealing the variations in these relationships in H. ammodendron with precipitation and N deposition will enhance our understanding of the responses of plants to global change in terms of trade-off strategies of nutrient absorption, water and element geochemical cycles in desert ecosystems. Thus, we conducted field experiments with different amounts of water and N. This study showed that WUE of H. ammodendron was not correlated with nitrogen content (N), phosphorus content (P), and potassium content (K) when water and N supply were varied (p > 0.05 for WUE vs. N, P, and K), suggesting lack of coupling between water use and nutrient economics. This result was associated with the lack of correlation between plant nutrients and gas exchang in H. ammodendron. However, water addition, N addition and the interaction between both of them all played a role in the correlation between plant N, P and K owing to their different responses to water and N supplies. This indicates that global changes in precipitation and N deposition will affect N, P and K geochemical cycles in the Asian deserts dominated by H. ammodendron, and drive changes in the relationships between plant nutrients, resulting in changes in the trade-off strategy of plant absorption of N, P, and K."
https://openalex.org/W3205957035,"In this study, we hypothesized that the humoral response to trivalent seasonal influenza virus vaccines was influenced by rapid antigenic switching of H1 HA. We tested archived sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected at prior to vaccination at day 0, as well as days 30 and 90 after vaccination during the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 influenza virus seasons. During the 2009/2010 season, vaccination successfully induced antibodies with hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) activity against both H1N1 and H3N2 vaccine components. For the 2010/2011 season, the A/California/04/2009 (CA/09) H1N1 elicited seroconversion (HAI titer = 1:40) and novel memory B cell (Bmem) responses from most individuals. However, the H3N2 influenza virus component of the vaccine, A/Perth/16/2009 (Perth/09), back-boosted and elicited antibodies with HAI activity and Bmem response to historical H3N2 influenza virus strains. Following stratification of the pre-existing antibody with HAI against the CA/09 H1N1, there was a negative correlation with HAI seroconversion to other vaccine strains. Overall, strong immune responses against CA/09 H1N1 influenza virus negatively influenced the induction of novel humoral responses."
https://openalex.org/W3206001024,"Abnormalities of left ventricular (LV) structure, filling and long-axis function have all been reported in subjects with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and a normal LV ejection fraction (EF), but previous study findings have not been consistent. The aim of this study was to identify factors which could have confounded the analyses in previous studies of SSc, and in particular to consider the variables of body surface area (BSA), sex, age, heart rate, blood pressure (BP), disease duration (DD), disease type (limited versus diffuse) and interstitial lung disease (ILD).Echocardiography was performed on 100 subjects with SSc (79 women; age 56±15 years) with a LVEF ≥50% and free of pulmonary arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, more than mild valvular heart disease and atrial fibrillation. Measurements were performed of the LV end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) and septal wall thickness (SWT), the transmitral Doppler E, A and deceleration time (DT), and the peak systolic (s') and early diastolic (e') LV long-axis velocities. Multivariate analyses were performed to investigate correlations of the above LV variables with BSA, sex, age, heart rate, BP, DD, disease type, and the presence of ILD.DD varied between 0.1 and 41.2 years, 25% had diffuse and 75% had limited disease, and 37% had ILD. SWT and LVEDD were positively correlated with BSA, SWT was also positively correlated with age and larger in males, and LVEDD was larger in diffuse disease. Age was positively correlated with A and DT, and inversely correlated with E and E/A, and heart rate was inversely correlated with E and E/A. None of E, A, E/A, or DT were independently associated with DD or disease type. Septal and lateral LV wall s' and e' were all inversely correlated with age, and there was a small independent contribution to the prediction of lateral s' from DD, but no association of either s' or e' with disease type. The presence of ILD was not a predictor of any of the LV variables.In SSc there are associations of sex, body size, age and disease type with LV structural variables, of age and heart rate with E/A, and of age with both systolic and early diastolic LV long-axis velocities. Appropriate adjustment for these variables could help to resolve current uncertainties regarding SSc effects on the left ventricle."
