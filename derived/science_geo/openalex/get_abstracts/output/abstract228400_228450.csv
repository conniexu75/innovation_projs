https://openalex.org/W2124662474,"Over 30 mutations of the B-RAF gene associated with human cancers have been identified, the majority of which are located within the kinase domain. Here we show that of 22 B-RAF mutants analyzed, 18 have elevated kinase activity and signal to ERK in vivo. Surprisingly, three mutants have reduced kinase activity towards MEK in vitro but, by activating C-RAF in vivo, signal to ERK in cells. The structures of wild type and oncogenic V599EB-RAF kinase domains in complex with the RAF inhibitor BAY43-9006 show that the activation segment is held in an inactive conformation by association with the P loop. The clustering of most mutations to these two regions suggests that disruption of this interaction converts B-RAF into its active conformation. The high activity mutants signal to ERK by directly phosphorylating MEK, whereas the impaired activity mutants stimulate MEK by activating endogenous C-RAF, possibly via an allosteric or transphosphorylation mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2031522329,"Incomplete retinal vascularization occurs in both Norrie disease and familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR). Norrin, the protein product of the Norrie disease gene, is a secreted protein of unknown biochemical function. One form of FEVR is caused by defects in Frizzled-4 (Fz4), a presumptive Wnt receptor. We show here that Norrin and Fz4 function as a ligand-receptor pair based on (1) the similarity in vascular phenotypes caused by Norrin and Fz4 mutations in humans and mice, (2) the specificity and high affinity of Norrin-Fz4 binding, (3) the high efficiency with which Norrin induces Fz4- and Lrp-dependent activation of the classical Wnt pathway, and (4) the signaling defects displayed by disease-associated variants of Norrin and Fz4. These data define a Norrin-Fz4 signaling system that plays a central role in vascular development in the eye and ear, and they indicate that ligands unrelated to Wnts can act through Fz receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2144071128,"Discovering the molecular mechanisms that regulate neuron-specific gene expression remains a central challenge for CNS research. Here, we report that small, noncoding double-stranded (ds) RNAs play a critical role in mediating neuronal differentiation. The sequence defined by this dsRNA is NRSE/RE1, which is recognized by NRSF/REST, known primarily as a negative transcriptional regulator that restricts neuronal gene expression to neurons. The NRSE dsRNA can trigger gene expression of neuron-specific genes through interaction with NRSF/REST transcriptional machinery, resulting in the transition from neural stem cells with neuron-specific genes silenced by NRSF/REST into cells with neuronal identity that can express neuronal genes. The mechanism of action appears to be mediated through a dsRNA/protein interaction, rather than through siRNA or miRNA. The discovery of small modulatory dsRNAs (smRNAs) extends the important contribution of noncoding RNAs as key regulators of cell behavior at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels."
https://openalex.org/W2024725357,"The putative RNA helicase, Armitage (Armi), is required to repress oskar translation in Drosophila oocytes; armi mutant females are sterile and armi mutations disrupt anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning. Here, we show that armi is required for RNAi. armi mutant male germ cells fail to silence Stellate, a gene regulated endogenously by RNAi, and lysates from armi mutant ovaries are defective for RNAi in vitro. Native gel analysis of protein-siRNA complexes in wild-type and armi mutant ovary lysates suggests that armi mutants support early steps in the RNAi pathway but are defective in the production of active RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates target RNA destruction in RNAi. Our results suggest that armi is required for RISC maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1981789729,"The Arabidopsis seedpod opens through a spring-loaded mechanism known as pod shatter, which is essential for dispersal of the seeds. Here, we identify INDEHISCENT (IND), an atypical bHLH protein, that is necessary for fruit opening and is involved in patterning each of the three fruit cell types required for seed dispersal. Previous studies suggested that FRUITFULL (FUL), a member of the MADS-domain transcription factor family, is required for fruit growth since ful mutant fruit fail to undergo the dramatic enlargement that normally occurs after fertilization. Here we show, however, that FUL is not directly required for fruit elongation and instead is required to prevent ectopic activity of IND. Our molecular and genetic studies suggest a model for the regulatory interactions among the genes that control fruit development and the mechanism that results in the expression of IND in a narrow stripe of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2128625570,"Synaptic connections in the nervous system are directed onto specific cellular and subcellular targets. Synaptic guidepost cells in the C. elegans vulval epithelium drive synapses from the HSNL motor neuron onto adjacent target neurons and muscles. Here, we show that the transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily protein SYG-2 is a central component of the synaptic guidepost signal. SYG-2 is expressed transiently by primary vulval epithelial cells during synapse formation. SYG-2 binds SYG-1, the receptor on HSNL, and directs SYG-1 accumulation and synapse formation to adjacent regions of HSNL. syg-1 and syg-2 mutants have defects in synaptic specificity; the HSNL neuron forms fewer synapses onto its normal targets and forms ectopic synapses onto inappropriate targets. Misexpression of SYG-2 in secondary epithelial cells causes aberrant accumulation of SYG-1 and synaptic markers in HSNL adjacent to the SYG-2-expressing cells. Our results indicate that local interactions between immunoglobulin superfamily proteins can determine specificity during synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W1973488583,"Accurate DNA replication is essential for genomic stability. One mechanism by which high-fidelity DNA polymerases maintain replication accuracy involves stalling of the polymerase in response to covalent incorporation of mismatched base pairs, thereby favoring subsequent mismatch excision. Some polymerases retain a “short-term memory” of replication errors, responding to mismatches up to four base pairs in from the primer terminus. Here we a present a structural characterization of all 12 possible mismatches captured at the growing primer terminus in the active site of a polymerase. Our observations suggest four mechanisms that lead to mismatch-induced stalling of the polymerase. Furthermore, we have observed the effects of extending a mismatch up to six base pairs from the primer terminus and find that long-range distortions in the DNA transmit the presence of the mismatch back to the enzyme active site, suggesting the structural basis for the short-term memory of replication errors."

https://openalex.org/W1964740749,"Polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton during early oogenesis is required to specify the posterior of the Drosophila oocyte, which is essential for asymmetric mRNA localization during mid-oogenesis and for embryonic axis specification. The posterior determinant oskar mRNA is translationally silent until mid-oogenesis. We show that mutations in armitage and three components of the RNAi pathway disrupt oskar mRNA translational silencing, polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, and posterior localization of oskar mRNA. armitage encodes a homolog of SDE3, a presumptive RNA helicase involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing (RNAi) in Arabidopsis, and is required for RNAi in Drosophila ovaries. Armitage forms an asymmetric network associated with the polarized microtubule cytoskeleton and is concentrated with translationally silent oskar mRNA in the oocyte. We conclude that RNA silencing is essential for establishment of the cytoskeletal polarity that initiates embryonic axis specification and for translational control of oskar mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2024951366,"Meiotic crossovers (COs) are nonrandomly distributed along chromosomes such that two COs seldom occur close together, a phenomenon known as CO interference. We have used genetic and cytological methods to investigate interference mechanisms in budding yeast. Assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC) initiates at a few sites along each chromosome, triggered by a complex of proteins (including Zip2 and Zip3) called the synapsis initiation complex (SIC). We found that SICs, like COs, display interference, supporting the hypothesis that COs occur at synapsis initiation sites. Unexpectedly, we found that SICs show interference in mutants in which CO interference is abolished; one explanation is that these same mutations eliminate the subset of COs that normally occur at SICs. Since SICs are assembled in advance of SC and they are properly positioned even in the absence of SC formation, these data clearly demonstrate an aspect of interference that is independent of synapsis."
https://openalex.org/W2036572208,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 3C-like protease consists of two distinct folds, namely the N-terminal chymotrypsin fold containing the domains I and II hosting the complete catalytic machinery and the C-terminal extra helical domain III unique for the coronavirus 3CL proteases. Previously the functional role of this extra domain has been completely unknown, and it was believed that the coronavirus 3CL proteases share the same enzymatic mechanism with picornavirus 3C proteases, which contain the chymotrypsin fold but have no extra domain. To understand the functional role of the extra domain and to characterize the enzyme-substrate interactions by use of the dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy, we 1) dissected the full-length SARS 3CL protease into two distinct folds and subsequently investigated their structural and dimerization properties and 2) studied the structural and binding interactions of three substrate peptides with the entire enzyme and its two dissected folds. The results lead to several findings; 1) although two dissected parts folded into the native-like structures, the chymotrypsin fold only had weak activity as compared with the entire enzyme, and 2) although the chymotrypsin fold remained a monomer within a wide range of protein concentrations, the extra domain existed as a stable dimer even at a very low concentration. This observation strongly indicates that the extra domain contributes to the dimerization of the SARS 3CL protease, thus, switching the enzyme from the inactive form (monomer) to the active form (dimer). This discovery not only separates the coronavirus 3CL protease from the picornavirus 3C protease in terms of the enzymatic mechanism but also defines the dimerization interface on the extra helical domain as a new target for design of the specific protease inhibitors. Furthermore, the determination of the preferred solution conformation of the substrate peptide S1 together with the NMR differential line-broadening and transferred nuclear Overhauser enhancement study allows us to pinpoint the bound structure of the S1 peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2107270966,"We isolated a cDNA encoding an orphan G protein-coupled receptor, TGR7, which has been recently reported to correspond to MrgD. To search for ligands for TGR7, we screened a series of small molecule compounds by detecting the Ca2+ influx in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing TGR7. Through this screening, we found that β-alanine at micromolar doses specifically evoked Ca2+ influx in cells expressing human, rat, or mouse TGR7. A structural analogue, γ-aminobutyric acid, weakly stimulated cells expressing human or rat TGR7, but another analogue, glycine, did not. In addition, β-alanine decreased forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in cells expressing TGR7, suggesting that TGR7 couples with G proteins Gq and Gi. In guanosine 5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate binding assays conducted using a membrane fraction of cells expressing TGR7, β-alanine specifically increased the binding of guanosine 5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate. When a fusion protein composed of TGR7 and green fluorescent protein was expressed in cells, it localized at the plasma membrane but internalized into the cytoplasm after treatment with β-alanine. In addition, we found that β-[3H]alanine more efficiently bound to TGR7-expressing cells than to control cells. From these results, we concluded that TGR7 functioned as a specific membrane receptor for β-alanine. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that TGR7 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the dorsal root ganglia in rats. By in situ hybridization and immunostaining, we confirmed that TGR7 mRNA was co-expressed in the small diameter neurons with P2X3 and VR1, both in rat and monkey dorsal root ganglia. Our results suggest that TGR7 participates in the modulation of neuropathic pain.

TGR7 has been classified as a member of the GPCR subfamily referred to as Mas-related genes (Mrgs), also known as sensory neuron-specific GPCRs. These GPCRs are known to be expressed in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). To date, the following ligands have been identified for Mrgs: several neuropeptides, with an RFamide structure at their C termini, act as ligands for mouse MrgA1, MrgA4, MrgC11, and MAS1 (11Dong X.

Because TGR7 is co-expressed with major nociceptors, a purinergic receptor (P2X3) and a vanilloid receptor (VR1), in the sensory neurons of the DRG in rats, it has been thought to play some role in pain sensation or modulation (11Dong X.

Various studies (17DeFeudis F.V. Martin del Rio R. Gen. Pharmacol. 1977; 8: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Usherwood P.N.R. Adv. Comp. Physiol. Biochem. 1978; 7: 227-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that β-alanine acts as a depressant in the central nervous system. It has been reported that β-alanine pharmacologically activates the glycine and GABA receptors with less efficacy than their native ligands (19Wu F.S. Gibbs T.T. Farb D.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 246: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Schofield P.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 121-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that β-alanine decreases glutamatergic excitation by binding to the glycine co-agonist site on the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (21Ogita K. Suzuki T. Yoneda Y. Neuropharmacology. 1989; 11: 1263-1270Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar 22Pullan L. M. Powel R. J. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 148: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These dual effects of β-alanine to both decrease excitation and increase inhibition are very unique. The high affinity uptake of β-alanine has been detected in various types of the neurons (23Schon F. Kelly J.S. Brain Res. 1975; 86: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 24Kontro P.

In addition, a sodium-dependent transporter for β-alanine has been identified in the mouse brain (27Hosli E. Hosli L. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Liu Q.R. Lopez-Corcuera B. Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12145-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). There is therefore the possibility that β-alanine acts as a neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator. However, no receptor specific for β-alanine has yet been identified.Here we report that an orphan GPCR, TGR7, which is highly expressed in the DRG, acts as a specific receptor for β-alanine. Our findings raise the possibility that β-alanine modulates pain sensation through TGR7.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of TGR7 cDNAs—We designed primers (5′-GTCGACATGAACTACACTCCTTATAGCAGCCCAGCC-3′ and 5′-ACTAGTTCAGACCCCATCATTAGTACATGTGGATG-3′) to isolate an entire rat TGR7 cDNA by reverse transcriptase PCR. PCR was performed in a reaction mixture (25 μl in total) containing a 0.2 μm concentration of each primer, a template cDNA synthesized from rat cerebellum cDNA, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.25 units of Advantage 2 polymerase mix (Clontech), and 2.5 μl of a buffer provided by the manufacturer. The mixture was heated once at 95 °C for 30 s, 5 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and at 70 °C for 5 min, 5 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and at 68 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 5 s and at 65 °C for 5 min, and finally at 65 °C for 5 min for an extension reaction. By this means, we obtained an ∼1-kb product containing a full coding region and then determined its nucleotide sequence. In a similar manner, we isolated human, mouse, and cynomolgus monkey TGR7 DNA fragments by PCR from human liver cDNA, mouse genomic DNA, and cynomolgus monkey genomic DNA, respectively. To obtain these DNA fragments, we designed the following primer sets: 5′-GTCGACATGAACCAGACTTTGAATAGCAGT-3′and 5′-ACTAGTTCAAGCCCCCATCTCATTGGTGCC-3′ for human TGR7; 5′-GGAACACTCGAGCCACCATGAACTCCACTCTTGACAGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GGATCAGCTAGCTCAGACCCCATCATTAGTACACGTG-3′for mouse TGR7; and 5′-GCCTCCCGGTCATGGTCTGTTACAT-3′ and 5′-CGATGGCGACACCGTTTACTTGC-3′ for cynomolgus monkey TGR7.Preparation of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Cells Expressing TGR7—The entire coding region of human, rat, or mouse TGR7 cDNA was inserted downstream of the SRα promoter in the expression vector pAKKO-111H (29Hinuma S.

The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in HEPES-buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mm probenecid and 4 μm fluo-3AM (Dojindo). Next, the cells were washed four times with the solution without fluo-3AM. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) were measured with a fluorometric imaging plate reader system (Molecular Devices) both before and after samples were added.Guanosine 5′-O-3-Thiotriphosphate (GTPγS) Binding Assays—Membrane fractions prepared from CHO-hTGR7 and mock-transfected CHO cells as described elsewhere (29Hinuma S.

The membrane fractions (196 μl) were mixed with β-alanine (2 μl) and 200 nm [35S]GTPγS (Amersham Biosciences) (2 μl). After incubation at 25 °C for 60 min, the reaction mixtures were diluted with 2 ml of a chilled washing buffer, which was a modified binding buffer without GDP, and then filtered through GF/F filters (Whatman). The filters were washed with 2 ml of the washing buffer, dried, and subjected to a liquid scintillation counter to measure [35S]GTPγS bound to the membrane fractions.cAMP Production-inhibitory Assays—The inhibitory activities of β-alanine on cAMP production in CHO-hTGR7 cells in the presence of forskolin were examined according to our method described previously (30Fukusumi S. Habata Y. Yoshida H. Iijima N. Kawamata Y. Hosoya M. Fujii R. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Shintani Y. Suenaga M. Onda H. Nishimura O. Tanaka M. Ibata Y. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX), the cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml of PTX (Sigma) overnight before performing the cAMP production-inhibitory assays.Internalization of TGR7—An expression vector (pAKKO-hTGR7-GFP) with a fusion protein composed of human TGR7 and green fluorescent protein (hTGR7-GFP) was constructed by the insertion of a fused DNA (human TGR7- and GFP-coding regions were connected in tandem) into pAKKO-111H. CHO cells stably expressing hTGR7-GFP were seeded onto chambered coverglasses (Nalgene) and cultured overnight. After treatment with 0.3 mm β-alanine for 30 min, the fusion protein in the cells was observed under a confocal fluorescence microscope.Tritiated β-Alanine Binding Assay—β-[3H]Alanine (60 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Muromachi (ART-205, Tokyo, Japan). CHO cells expressing TGR7 and mock-transfected CHO cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline(-)-EDTA and suspended in a HEPES buffer. β-[3H]Alanine binding was performed in a final volume of 200 μl/tube consisting of 100 μl of cell suspension (0.6-10 × 105 cells/tube), 50 μl of β-[3H]alanine (1.5-150 nm), and 50 μl of a Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer with or without β-alanine (a final concentration of 1 mm). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 3 ml of the HEPES buffer chilled in ice. The cells were then suspended in a lysis buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1% SDS), and radioactivity retained in the cells was quantified with a liquid scintillation counter.Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR Analyses for TGR7 mRNA—Poly(A)+ RNA fractions were prepared from the tissues of 8-12-week-old Wistar rats, and cDNAs were synthesized from them as described previously (31Fujii R. Fukusumi S. Hosoya M. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Hinuma S. Sekiguchi M. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Nishimura O. Onda H. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Regul. Pept. 1999; 31: 1-10Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Total RNA fractions were prepared from the DRG and spinal cord of a 3-year-old female cynomolgus monkey, and cDNAs were synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Rat and monkey TGR7 mRNA expressions were determined with a Prism 7700 sequence detector (PE Biosystems) with primers and probes (5′-CTGTCGAGTTTCCACAGGTTCC-3′, 5′-TTGCGCAGAGGTACGGTTCC-3′, and 5′-5-carboxyfluorescein-ATCCACGCGACGTTCCGAGTCTCCA-5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-3′ for rat TGR7; 5′-TGGCTGCCATGCTCAGC-3′, 5′-CTCGTGGACCTTGTCAGTGGT-3′, and 5′-5-carboxyfluorescein-TGGAAACCCAGCCCCTGGTCAG-5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-3′ for monkey TGR7).In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry—We isolated DRG from 10-week-old male Wistar rats and an adult female cynomolgus monkey. The DRG were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fresh frozen sections (6 μm) were attached to silanized slides and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. In situ hybridization was carried out using digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes prepared from full-length rat and monkey TGR7 cDNAs. To be visualized as purple, TGR7 mRNA was treated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxygenin antibody, using 4-nitrotetrazolium blue chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (which changes to red under a confocal laser microscope). For double staining in immunohistochemistry, we used anti-neurofilament 200 kDa (Chemicon), anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (Affiniti Research Products), anti-substance P (American Research Products), anti-somatostatin (Biogenesis), anti-P2X3 (Chemicon), and anti-VRl (Chemicon) primary antibodies, and Alexa 488-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). For the labeling of Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 (IB4), the sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IB4 (Sigma). After processing, the sections were mounted and then examined by light and confocal laser microscopy.RESULTSDemonstration of β-Alanine as a Ligand for TGR7—We isolated TGR7 cDNAs from human, rat, mouse, and monkey. The proteins from these cDNAs encoded had amino acid lengths of 321, 319, 321, and 320, respectively, and showed 80% (human versus monkey), 58% (human versus rat), and 84% (rat versus mouse) amino acid identity. Although the TGR7 amino acid sequences were not highly conserved among the species, a phylogenetic analysis of all known GPCRs showed that they were the closest counterparts (data not shown). To search for ligands of TGR7, we transiently expressed human TGR7 cDNA in CHO cells and then examined changes in [Ca2+]i by adding various test samples. Through our screening of over 1500 compounds, we discovered that β-alanine induced the rapid mobilization of [Ca2+]i in CHO cells expressing human TGR7 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas β-alanine did not induce an increase of [Ca2+]i in mock-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 1A). To confirm this receptor-ligand relationship in other animal species, we prepared CHO cells stably expressing human, rat, or mouse TGR7 (i.e. CHO-hTGR7, CHO-rTGR7, and CHO-mTGR7 cells, respectively) and examined changes in [Ca2+]i in response to β-alanine. The EC50 values of β-alanine in CHO-hTGR7, CHO-rTGR7, and CHO-mTGR7 cells were 15, 14, and 44 μm, respectively (Table I). Slight stimulatory activity was detected for GABA in CHO-hTGR7 and CHO-rTGR7 cells. l-Carnosine was found to be active only in CHO-rTGR7 cells. Other compounds structurally related to β-alanine, that is l-glycine, l-alanine, taurine, and anserine, did not induce an evident increase of [Ca2+]i when examined in CHO-hTGR7 cells. We subsequently examined the effect of β-alanine on cAMP production in CHO cells expressing TGR7. As shown in Fig. 1B, β-alanine suppressed forskolin-induced cAMP production in CHO-hTGR7 cells; however, this decrease did not occur after pretreatment with PTX. Similar suppressive effects of β-alanine on cAMP production in CHO-rTGR7 and CHO-mTGR7 cells were also observed (data not shown). These results suggest that human TGR7 couples to Gq and Gi in CHO cells. To confirm further that the interaction of β-alanine and TGR7 occurred at the plasma membrane, we prepared membrane fractions from CHO-hTGR7 cells and examined [35S]GTPγS binding to these fractions (Fig. 1C). Significant levels of binding were detected with 3 μm of β-alanine, the EC50 value was at 25 μm, and maximum levels were reached with 100-300 μm. Such increases in [35S]GTPγS binding were not detected in the membrane fractions of mock-transfected CHO cells.Table IAgonistic potency to induce intracellular Ca2+ rise in CHO cells expressing TGR7LigandEC50 (μm)HumanRatMousel-GlycineInactiveInactiveInactiveβ-Alanine15 ± 114 ± 244 ± 6l-AlanineInactiveInactiveInactiveGABA191 ± 12165 ± 2>300l-CarnosineInactive34 ± 1>300AnserineInactive>300InactiveTaurineInactiveNDND Open table in a new tab To confirm that TGR7 functions as a cell surface receptor, we stably expressed a fusion protein (hTGR7-GFP) in CHO cells and then examined its subcellular localization. In the absence of a ligand, hTGR7-GFP was localized typically at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1D, left panel). However, in the presence of β-alanine, hTGR7-GFP was internalized into the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D, right panel). Treatment with l-alanine or l-glycine had no effect on hTGR7-GFP localization (data not shown). We examined the binding of β-[3H]alanine to intact CHO-hTGR7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 (E and F), β-[3H]alanine more effectively bound to CHO-hTGR7 cells than to mock-transfected CHO cells in a manner dependent on the cell number and β-[3H]alanine concentration, indicating that β-alanine specifically binds to CHO-hTGR7 cells.Tissue Distribution of TGR7 mRNA in Rat and Monkey—We first analyzed the tissue distribution of TGR7 mRNA in rats. TGR7 mRNA was primarily expressed in the DRG (Fig. 2A). Moderate levels of expression were detected in the testes, urinary bladder, arteries, and uterus (Fig. 2A). To examine whether TGR7 mRNA was highly expressed not only in rodents but also in primates, we analyzed the expression of TGR7 and GABAB1a mRNAs in monkey DRG and the spinal cord. A high level of TGR7 mRNA was detected in the DRG, whereas only a low amount was found in the spinal cord (Fig. 2B, left panel). In contrast, a high level of GABAB1a mRNA was detected in both the DRG and spinal cord. These results suggest that the high level of TGR7 mRNA expression in the DRG is conserved between rodents and primates.Fig. 2Tissue distribution of TGR7 mRNA in the rat and monkey.

TGR7 mRNA signals were detected in small diameter DRG neurons in both the rat and monkey (Fig. 3), suggesting that TGR7 is expressed in C-fibers mediating pain or nociceptive responses in both rodents and primates.Fig. 3Expression of TGR7 in DRG neurons in the rat and monkey. In situ hybridization for TGR7 using digoxygenin-labeled cRNA probe showed that TGR7 was expressed in DRG small diameter neurons in a rodent and primate.

Scale bar = 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether TGR7 co-localized with neuronal markers, we conducted double-staining in situ hybridization and immunostaining for various markers in rat and monkey DRG neurons. We employed seven kinds of neuronal markers (i.e. neurofilament 200 kDa, calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P, IB4, somatostatin, P2X3, and VR1) to distinguish the subgroups of rat DRG neurons. Anti-neurofilament 200 kDa antibody recognizes high molecular weight neurofilaments and therefore is one of the markers for myelinated large diameter neurons. TGR7 mRNA was not detected in neurofilament 200 kDa immunoreactive neurons in the rat DRG (Fig. 4, A-C). TGR7 mRNA was also not expressed in calcitonin gene-related peptide-, somatostatin-, and substance P-immunoreactive neurons (images not shown). Most of the TGR7 mRNA-positive neurons were labeled with IB4, a marker of non-myelinated small diameter neurons in rat DRG (Fig. 4, D-F). These results suggest that TGR7 mRNA expresses in non-peptidergic nociceptive neurons. Likewise, most of the TGR7 mRNA-positive neurons were co-localized P2X3-immunoreactive and VR1-immunoreactive neurons in the rat DRG (Fig. 4, G-L). These results are highly consistent with those reported by other groups (11Dong X. Han S. Zylka M.J. Simon M.I. Anderson D.J.

Expression patterns of TGR7 mRNA were examined by double labeling of in situ hybridization with several neuronal makers. Co-localization between TGR7 and nociceptive neuronal makers was examined in the rat and monkey. The left column shows TGR7 mRNA in situ hybridization, the middle column shows immunostaining for neural markers or lectin staining with fluorescent IB4, and the right column shows merged images. A-C, rat TGR7 mRNA is not present in neurofilament 200 kDa-immunoreactive neurons. D-F, rat TGR7 and IB4 are co-labeled in small diameter neurons. G-I, rat TGR7 and P2X3 are co-expressed. J-L, rat TGR7 and VR1 are co-expressed. M-O, monkey TGR7 and IB4 are co-labeled. P-R, monkey TGR7 and P2X3 are co-expressed. S-U, monkey TGR7 and VR1 are co-expressed. Scale bar = 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To compare with the localization of TGR7 mRNA in rat DRG neurons, we also performed the double-staining hybridization of TGR7 and neuronal markers with monkey DRG neurons. We found that most TGR7 mRNA-positive neurons were also positive for IB4 (Fig. 4, M-O), P2X3 (Fig. 4, P-R), and VR1 (Fig. 4, S-U) indicating that the expression pattern of TGR7 is similar between rats and monkeys. Because P2X3 and VR1 are important molecules for mediating pain (32Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 33Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6943) Google Scholar), these data suggest that TGR7 plays a role in pain modulation both in rodents and primates.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have demonstrated that an orphan GPCR, TGR7, is specifically responsive to β-alanine. We found that β-alanine induced intracellular Ca2+ influx and suppressed cAMP production in CHO cells expressing TGR7. The responsiveness of TGR7 to β-alanine was detected in all species examined (i.e. human, rat, and mouse) even though the amino acid sequence of TGR7 among these species was not always highly conserved. We showed through [35"

However, the control of adiponectin gene expression in adipocytes is poorly understood. We show here that levels of adiponectin mRNA and protein are reduced in the white adipose tissue of ob/ob and db/db mice and that there is a concomitant reduction of the adipocyte determination- and differentiation-dependent factor 1 (ADD1)/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) transcription factor. To determine whether ADD1/SREBP1c regulates adiponectin gene expression, we isolated and characterized the mouse adiponectin promoter. Analysis of the adiponectin promoter revealed putative binding sites for the adipogenic transcription factors ADD1/SREBP1c, peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor γ and CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins. DNase I footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that ADD1/SREBP1c binds in vitro and in vivo to the proximal promoter containing sterol regulatory element (SRE) motifs. A luciferase reporter containing the promoter was transactivated by ADD1/SREBP1c, and introduction of SRE mutations into the construct abolished transactivation. Adenoviral overexpression of ADD1/SREBP1c also elevated adiponectin mRNA and protein levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, insulin stimulated adiponectin mRNA expression in adipocytes and augmented transactivation of the adiponectin promoter by ADD1/SREBP1c.

It has traditionally been considered a mere energy depot, synthesizing and storing triglycerides during periods of caloric excess and releasing free fatty acids and glycerol during periods of nutritional deprivation. However, it is now recognized to play a more active role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism as an endocrine organ secreting biologically active molecules, so called adipocytokines, that act on the central nervous system and peripheral tissues (1Saltiel A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 887-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Adiponectin (also known as Acrp30, AdipoQ, apM1, and GBP28) is a member of the adipocytokine family that is exclusively expressed in adipocytes (2Scherer P.E. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G.

The mouse adiponectin gene encodes 247 amino acids with two structurally distinct domains: an N-terminal collagen-like fibrous domain and a complement C1q-like globular domain at the C terminus (3Hu E.

Adiponectin forms oligomers and seems to circulate in the plasma as a homotrimer or as larger complexes of 12 to 15 subunits. One of its most interesting features, observed in rodents, monkeys, and humans, is that its expression in adipose tissue and plasma is reduced in obese and diabetic subjects (3Hu E. Liang P.

A number of factors have been reported to be positive or negative effectors of adiponectin expression. For instance, thiazolidinediones, synthetic ligands of PPARγ, increase both adiponectin gene expression in adipocytes and circulating adiponectin levels (25Maeda N. Takahashi M. Funahashi T. Kihara S. Nishizawa H. Kishida K. Nagaretani H. Matsuda M. Komuro R. Ouchi N. Kuriyama H. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Shimomura I. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2094-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 also increase expression of adiponectin, whereas tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), another adipocytokine, decreases adiponectin gene expression, suggesting a relationship to TNFα-induced insulin resistance (2Scherer P.E.

Res. 2000; 32: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, there is little information about the transcription factors involved in adiponectin gene expression in adipocytes apart from PPARγ and liver receptor homolog-1 (30Iwaki M. Matsuda M. Maeda N. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Makishima M. Shimomura I. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). We report here that the expression of both adiponectin and ADD1/SREBP1c was markedly decreased in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of ob/ob or db/db mouse. To investigate whether ADD1/SREBP1c directly regulates adiponectin expression, we isolated and characterized the mouse adiponectin promoter. Sequence analysis revealed putative binding sites for ADD1/SREBP1c, PPARγ, and C/EBPs, and DNase I footprinting and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that ADD1/SREBP1c binds to the promoter. Moreover, adenoviral overexpression of ADD1/SREBP1c increased adiponectin expression and secretion in differentiated adipocytes, and this effect was augmented by insulin. These observations indicate that ADD1/SREBP1c is involved in insulin-stimulated adiponectin expression in adipocytes. Animal Treatment—Male C57BL/6 (10–12 weeks, 18–22 g), ob/ob, and db/db mice were housed five mice/cage, and water was given ad libitum, with a 12-h light-dark cycle beginning at 7:00 a.m. During experiments, food was withdrawn in daylight hours (12 h). There were four C57BL/6 mice in each feeding and fasting group. In the refeeding experiment, food was reintroduced after 12 h of fasting. Animals were sacrificed to isolate epididymal fat. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 20 μg of RNA was denatured in formamide and formaldehyde and separated by electrophoresis on formaldehyde-containing agarose gels. After the RNA was transferred to Nytran membranes, the membranes were cross-linked, hybridized, and washed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Schleicher and Schüll). Probes were labeled by random priming using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Promega) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). cDNAs used as probes were as follows: ADD1/SREBP1c, adiponectin, PPARγ, C/EBPα, fatty acid synthase (FAS) and adipose fatty acid-binding protein. Western Blot Analysis—Fat tissue was lysed in TGN buffer with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Total cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to remove fat debris. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein dye reagent. Total extracts (50∼80 μg) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Western blot analysis was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Mouse adiponectin antibodies were kindly provided by KOMED Inc. (Seoul, Korea) and Dr. T. L. Huh. Bound antibodies were visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence and exposure to x-ray film. DNase I Footprinting—The adiponectin promoter fragments (containing bp -445 to -116) were isolated by double digestion with ApaI and EcoRI to obtain 5′- and 3′-overhanging ends. They were labeled with Klenow fragment and [α-32P]dATP, then purified by PAGE. Binding experiments were performed with 50,000 cpm (∼1 ng) of probe per reaction in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 7% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly (dI-dC) · poly(dI-dC), and the indicated amounts of recombinant ADD1/SREBP1c protein overexpressed in E. coli as described previously (31Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). After 30 min of incubation on ice, 5 μl of DNase I, freshly diluted in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2 and 7% (v/v) glycerol was added to the reaction, which was then kept at room temperature for 2 min. The dilutions of DNase I ranged from 1:200 to 1:2000 of stock (10 units/μl), depending on the amount of protein in the reaction. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 80 μl of a stop solution containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 4 μg of yeast tRNA, and 10 μg of proteinase K. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 45 °C, extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in formamide dye. They were resolved on 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide/7 M urea sequencing gels, and the protected regions mapped with reference to the migration of Maxam-Gilbert A+G sequencing products. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes was achieved by allowing the cells to reach confluence and adding DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 5 μg/ml insulin at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Every 2 days thereafter, fresh medium (DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml insulin) was added to the cells. Rat1-IR and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (Jeil Biotech. Inc., Daegu, South Korea) and 100 units of antibiotic-antimycotic and were cultured at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 incubator. Cloning of the Mouse Adiponectin Promoter and Construction of a Luciferase Reporter—Mouse genomic DNA was isolated from 3T3-L1 cells with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 2% SDS). Conditions for PCR were as follows 2 mm concentrations of each primer, 0.6 mm concentrations of each dNTP, 1× PCR buffer, 5 units of LA (long amplification) Taq polymerase (TaKaRa), in a 50-μl reaction volume. The PCR cycle was: 30 s at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 12 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, and then 5 min at 72 °C. The primers used were as follows: forward (-984 bp), 5′-GTT GCA GTT GGC TGG TAC CCC AGA GCT AAT AAT AGA TAG-3′; forward (-410 bp), 5′-CCT GAA CCA CAC AGC TTC AC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTT TGG TGT CTC GAG ATC CAC TGA CAA TCG TAC AGA CAG-3′. The primers included KpnI (5′-primer) and XhoI (3′-primer) restriction sites. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and XhoI, and subcloned into pGEM easy vector (Promega) and pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis of the adiponectin promoter (-410 bp)-Luc plasmids was performed with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) using the following mutagenic primers (mutated sites underlined): mSRE1, 5′-GAG TGG GAG TAT CAT GCG CCA ATT AGT GTT GTT GAC TCT CCA GG-3′; mSRE2, 5′-CCA GGA CAA ACT TAT GGG AAA GGG AGG TCT CCG GGC CCC TGA AC-3′. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Human embryonic kidney 293 or Rat1-IR cells were transfected with DNA constructs 1 day before confluence by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (31Kim J.B.

The mammalian expression vector for ADD1, containing amino-terminal ADD1/SREBP1c from amino acids 1 to 403, was derived from pSV-SPORT1 (Invitrogen) as described previously (31Kim J.B. Spotts G.D.

After incubation for 24 h, cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100), and activities of β-galactosidase and luciferase were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The luciferase activity of each sample, expressed in relative light units, was normalized to its β-galactosidase activity. ChIP Assay—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (33Seo J.B. Noh M.J. Yoo E.J. Park S.Y. Park J. Lee I.K. Park S.D. Kim J.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 1522-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In brief, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were incubated with 200 nm insulin for 48 h. The differentiated adipocytes were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and resuspended in 200 μl of Nonidet P-40-containing buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Crude nuclei were precipitated and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and the nuclear lysates were sonicated and diluted 10-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% SDS, and 1.1% Triton X-100). They were then incubated with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) and anti-ADD1 antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. After successive washes, immunocomplexes containing DNA were eluted, and the precipitated DNA was amplified by PCR. Conditions for PCR were as follows: 0.25 μm concentrations of each primer, 0.1 mm concentrations of each dNTP, 1× PCR buffer, 1 unit of Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa), 0.06 mCi/ml [α-32P]dCTP in a 20-μl reaction volume. The products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide/1× Tris-borate/EDTA gels. Primers used were as follows: -572 adiponectin-forward (f), 5′-GGT GCT GGG AAT TGA ACT CA-3′; -213 adiponectin-reverse (r), 5′-CCT GTT TCC AGG CTT TGG CC-3′; -349 PPARγ2-f, 5′-CTG TAC AGT TCA CGC CCC TC-3′; -51 PPARγ2-r, 5′-TCA CAC TGG TGT TTT GTC TAT G-3′; GAPDH-f, 5′-GTG TTC CTA CCC CCA ATG TG-3′; GAPDH-r, 5′-CTT GCT CAG TGT CCT TGC TG-3′. Adenovirus Infection and Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with 1 ml of adenovirus-containing DMEM at a titer of 10 plaque-forming units per cell and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. The culture medium was then adjusted to 2 ml with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After incubation for a total of 48 h, cells were harvested for RNA isolation using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR reactions were performed with the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). ADD1/SREBP1c, adiponectin, FAS, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) cDNAs were amplified for 30, 28, 29, and 29 (non-saturating) cycles, respectively. RT-PCR products were analyzed by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis, and band intensities were compared by imaging ethidium bromide staining (Scion Image; Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). Primers used were as follows: ADD1/SREBP1c-f, 5′-GGG AAT TCA TGG ATT GCA CAT TTG AA-3′; ADD1/SREBP1c-r, 5′-CCG CTC GAG GTT CCC AGG AAG GGT-3′; adiponectin-f, 5′-ATG CTA CTG TTG CAA GCT CTC-3′; adiponectin-r, 5′-GTT GGT ATC ATG GAA GAG AAG-3′; FAS-f, 5′-TGC TCC CAG CTG CAG GC-3′; FAS-r, 5′-GCC CGG TAG CTC TGG GTG TA-3′; SCD-1-f, 5′-TGG GTT GGC TGC TTG TG-3′; SCD-1-r, 5′-GCG TGG GCA GGA TGA AG-3′; GAPDH-f, 5′-TGC ACC ACC AAC TGC TTA G-3′; GAPDH-r, 5′-GGA TGC AGG GAT GAT GTT C-3′. Expression of Adiponectin and ADD1/SREBP1c in Obese and Diabetic Mice—Previous studies have demonstrated that adiponectin expression is significantly reduced in the WAT of several obese and/or diabetic animal models (3Hu E. Liang P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10697-10703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar, 34Zhang Y. Matheny M. Zolotukhin S. Tumer N. Scarpace P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the control of adiponectin gene expression, we investigated the expression of several adipogenic transcription factors in the WAT of ob/ob and db/db mice. As shown in Fig. 1, the expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and aP2 was not altered in the WAT of mice. However, the level of ADD1/SREBP1c mRNA was found to be substantially decreased, as was the level of adiponectin mRNA (Fig. 1A). ADD1/SREBP1c protein levels were also lower (Fig. 1B), indicating that ADD1/SREBP1c may influence adiponectin expression in adipose tissue. Binding of ADD1/SREBP1c to the Mouse Adiponectin Promoter—To investigate the possibility that ADD1/SREBP1c is involved in the regulation of adiponectin gene expression, we cloned ∼0.98 kb of the mouse adiponectin promoter from genomic DNA by PCR. Sequence analysis of the promoter revealed several putative binding motifs for transcription factors ADD1/SREBP1c, PPARγ, C/EBPs, and nuclear factor Y (Fig. 2A). Two putative SREs and a putative peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor regulatory element (PPRE) were present from bp -400 to -330 and at bp -270, respectively. Two C/EBP-binding sites were also located at bp -775 and -264 upstream of the transcription initiation site (Fig. 2A). The promoter also contains several E-box motifs and nuclear factor-Y binding sites, as indicated in Fig. 2A. There is 55.9% sequence identity between the proximal promoter regions of mouse and human adiponectin promoters, and the SREs, PPRE, and C/EBP-binding sites are relatively well conserved (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2103573390,"Arginine vasopressin (AVP) increases the water permeability of renal collecting duct principal cells by inducing the fusion of vesicles containing the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) with the plasma membrane (AQP2 shuttle). This event is initiated by activation of vasopressin V2 receptors, followed by an elevation of cAMP and the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). The tethering of PKA to subcellular compartments by protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs) is a prerequisite for the AQP2 shuttle. During the search for AKAP(s) involved in the shuttle, a new splice variant of AKAP18, AKAP18δ, was identified. AKAP18δ functions as an AKAP <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. In the kidney, it is mainly expressed in principal cells of the inner medullary collecting duct, closely resembling the distribution of AQP2. It is present in both the soluble and particulate fractions derived from renal inner medullary tissue. Within the particulate fraction, AKAP18δ was identified on the same intracellular vesicles as AQP2 and PKA. AVP not only recruited AQP2, but also AKAP18δ to the plasma membrane. The elevation of cAMP caused the dissociation of AKAP18δ and PKA. The data suggest that AKAP18δ is involved in the AQP2 shuttle."
https://openalex.org/W2088322976,"The proteolytic activity of caspases is involved in apoptosis and inflammation. In this regard, caspase-1 is required for pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18 maturation. We report here on a novel function of caspase-1 as an activator of nuclear factor of the κ-enhancer in B-cells (NF-κB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). This function is not shared by the murine caspase-1 homologues caspase-11 and -12. In contrast to pro-IL-1β maturation, caspase-1-induced NF-κB activation is not inhibited by the virus-derived caspase-1 inhibitor cytokine response modifier A and is equally induced by the enzymatically inactive caspase-1 C285A mutant. Although the general NF-κB-inhibiting protein A20 inhibits caspase-1-derived activation of NF-κB, dominant-negative forms of TRAF2 and RIP1 have no effect. We demonstrate that caspase-1 interacts with RIP2 and that dominant-negative forms of RIP2 and IκB kinase complex-β inhibit caspase-1-mediated NF-κB activation.

Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar). NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex bound by an inhibitor known as IκB (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar). In response to a variety of signaling events, the IκB kinase complex (IKK) phosphorylates IκB proteins. This post-translational modification targets IκB for poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (3Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Google Scholar). The degradation of IκB proteins liberates NF-κB, allowing this transcription factor to translocate to the nucleus and activate its target genes. Besides regulation by IκB, NF-κB-dependent gene expression is also negatively regulated by the zinc finger protein A20, although the molecular mechanism remains unclear (4Cooper J.T. Stroka D.M.

NF-κB activation is involved in the transcriptional activation of numerous inflammation-related and antiapoptotic genes in response to cytokines, bacterial products, and cellular stress conditions (1Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar). Pathogen-derived products such as LPS, peptidoglycan, and double-stranded RNA, respectively, lead to NF-κB activation through stimulation of TLR-2, -3, and -4 at the cell surface (7Sabroe I. Read R.C. Whyte M.K. Dockrell D.H. Vogel S.N. Dower S.K. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1630-1635Google Scholar). Besides pathogen-derived products, the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1 also induce NF-κB activation by binding to their respective cell surface receptors (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Google Scholar, 8Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R19-R22Google Scholar). These receptors activate NF-κB through distinct signaling pathways (7Sabroe I. Read R.C.

Caspases are an evolutionarily conserved family of aspartate-specific, cysteine-dependent proteases that are synthesized as pro-enzymes with a p20 and a p10 domain. Upon activation, the latter domains undergo a conformational change to form the active enzyme (10Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A.

Caspase-1 plays a key role in inflammatory responses by cleaving pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines (12Gu Y. Kuida K. Tsutsui H. Ku G. Hsiao K. Fleming M.A. Hayashi N.

It has recently been discovered that the latter cytokines are matured in a large caspase-1 containing protein complex, named the “inflammasome” (15Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 417-426Google Scholar). Caspase-1 contains an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD). This protein module of ∼100 amino acids is a homotypic oligomerization domain shown to be involved in the assembly of protein platforms that promote proteolytic activation of recruited caspases in the context of apoptosis and inflammation. However, because the family of identified CARD-containing proteins has recently expanded, it has become apparent that the majority of these CARDs are not involved in caspase activation. Instead, many participate in NF-κB signaling pathways associated with innate and adaptive immune responses (reviewed in Ref. 16Bouchier-Hayes L. Martin S.J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 616-621Google Scholar). NOD1 and NOD2 are two prototypical examples that have recently been identified as CARD-containing sensors of peptidoglycan derived from intracellular pathogens (17Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H.

After oligomerization, both proteins associate with the CARD-containing kinase RIP2 through CARD-CARD interactions (20Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol.

RIP2 then recruits the IKK complex through a direct interaction of its intermediate domain with IKK-γ, leading to the activation of NF-κB (22Chin A.I. Dempsey P.W. Bruhn K. Miller J.F. Xu Y. Cheng G.

ICEBERG and COP/Pseudo-ICE are human-specific CARD-only proteins that share 93% and 73% sequence homology, respectively, with the prodomain of caspase-1 (25Druilhe A. Srinivasula S.M. Razmara M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 649-657Google Scholar, 26Lee S.H. Stehlik C. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34495-34500Google Scholar, 27Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 99-111Google Scholar). Both ICEBERG and COP/Pseudo-ICE are encoded by caspase-like genes that have acquired premature nonsense mutations that lead to the production of essentially CARD-only molecules. It is interesting that their genes are mapped to chromosome 11q22, adjacent to the caspase-1 gene, and have probably arisen by a recent gene duplication event. Both proteins bind to and prevent caspase-1 activation and the subsequent generation of IL-1β (25Druilhe A. Srinivasula S.M. Razmara M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 649-657Google Scholar, 26Lee S.H. Stehlik C. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34495-34500Google Scholar, 27Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 99-111Google Scholar). However, in contrast to ICEBERG, COP/Pseudo-ICE also interacts with RIP2 in a heterotypic CARD-CARD interaction, and activates the transcription factor NF-κB (25Druilhe A. Srinivasula S.M. Razmara M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 649-657Google Scholar, 27Humke E.W. Shriver S.K. Starovasnik M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 99-111Google Scholar). Herein, we show that caspase-1, but not its closest murine homologues caspase-11 and -12, induces p38 MAPK and NF-κB activation independently of its enzymatic activity. This suggests that caspase-1 is involved in additional pro-inflammatory pathways besides the maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18.

E-epitope tagging was done by cloning the PCR-generated cDNAs of the respective open reading frames into the pCAGGS-E vector. The cDNA encoding full-length human caspase-1 was amplified from a THP-1 cDNA library and cloned in frame with the N-terminal E-tag epitope into a pCAGGS-E vector. The enzymatically inactive human caspase-1 C285A mutant was made by site-directed mutagenesis PCR and cloned in frame with the E-epitope tag of pCAGGS-E vector.

All the PCR products described above were sequenced to ensure that no errors had been introduced by PCR. Transfection, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting Assay—293T is a human embryonal kidney carcinoma cell line. 293T cells were routinely transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (33O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Google Scholar). Cells were seeded the day before transfection at 2 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected for 4 h, washed, and incubated for another 24 h before lysates were prepared and/or supernatants were collected and tested in a biological assay for IL-1β. Lysates were prepared by harvesting the cells and lysing them in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 142.5 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm EGTA), supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates (0.5 ml) were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, including anti-vesicular stomatitis virus (Sigma) and anti-hemagglutinin antibodies (Babco, Richmond, CA) in combination with 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Immune-complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were subsequently incubated with various antibodies, including anti-E antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and anti-vesicular stomatitis virus antibodies (Sigma), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and detection by an enhanced chemiluminescence method. Otherwise, lysates were analyzed directly by immunoblotting after normalization for total protein content. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against recombinant murine caspase-1, -11, and -12 were prepared at the Centre d'Economie Rurale (Laboratoire d'Hormonologie Animale, Marloie, Belgium). Anti-MAPK and anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2, and p38) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-GFP antibody was from BD Biosciences Clontech. Pro-IL-1β Processing Assay—Biologically active IL-1β was determined using growth factor-dependent D10(N4)M cells (34Hopkins S.J. Humphreys M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 120: 271-276Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% supernatant of phorbol ester-stimulated EL-4 cells as a source of IL-2, and 10% supernatant of phorbol ester-stimulated P388D1 cells as a source of IL-1. The day before the assay, D10(N4)M cells were washed and transferred to fresh media containing 10% EL-4 supernatant. The next day, cells were washed again and added to serial dilutions of IL-1β-containing samples (104 cells/well), followed by incubation for 24 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Proliferation was quantified by [3H]thymidine incorporation (0.5 μCi/well) for the last 6 h. Cells were harvested, and incorporated [3H]thymidine was determined in a microplate scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). IL-1β was quantified according to a standard preparation of IL-1β with a specific biological activity of 109 IU/mg (obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, UK). Quantification of NF-κB Activity—293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors in combination with 100 ng of NF-κB-luciferase and pUT651-β-galactosidase reporter plasmids. In some experiments, cells were treated for 6 h with 500 IU/ml of TNF-α before harvesting. Twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in Tris phosphate (25 mm, pH 7.8), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. After addition of 50 μl of substrate buffer (658 μm luciferin, 378 mm co-enzyme A, and 742 μm ATP) to 20 μl of cell lysates, NF-κB activity was assayed in a TopCount NXT microplate scintillation reader (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). To normalize transfection efficiency, cell lysates were also subjected to β-galactosidase colorimetric assay. In brief, 20 μl of cell lysate were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 200 μl of a solution containing 0.9 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, 1 mm MgCl2, 45 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The optical density was read at a wavelength of 595 nm. Results are expressed as relative luciferase units per second/optical density for β-galactosidase activity. The data represent the average ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Inhibition of Caspase-1 Enzymatic Activity Revealed a Caspase-1-dependent NF-κB Pathway—Because CARDs have been implicated in NF-κB modulation and caspase-1 is an important regulator of inflammation, we investigated whether caspase-1 could be involved in NF-κB activation. First, we studied the effect of murine caspase-1 and its enzymatic activity on cell death, pro-IL-1β maturation, and activation of NF-κB. Caspase-1 induced apoptotic cell death upon overexpression in 293T cells (Fig. 1A). Moreover, when co-expressed with pro-IL-1β in these cells, the protease caused maturation of pro-IL-1β into its biologically active form (Fig. 1B). Because cell death can mask the induction of NF-κB activation (35Scheller C. Sopper S. Ehrhardt C. Flory E. Chen P. Koutsilieri E. Ludwig S. ter Meulen V. Jassoy C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2471-2480Google Scholar), we made use of CrmA, a cowpox-derived serpin that covalently binds to the catalytic site and irreversibly inhibits the enzymatic activities of caspase-1 and -8. CrmA overexpression completely abrogated both caspase-1-dependent cell death and pro-IL-1β maturation effects (Fig. 1, A and B). It is interesting that when the cells were protected from caspase-1-induced apoptosis by CrmA, a significant activation of NF-κB was observed (Fig. 1C). This activation of NF-κB occured in a caspase-1-dependent manner and was not caused by CrmA, because even high doses of CrmA did not significantly induce NF-κB activation (Fig. 1C). To further confirm that the activation of NF-κB was independent of the catalytic activity of caspase-1, we generated an enzymatically inactive C284A mutant of the caspase. Indeed, caspase-1 C284A clearly induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that NF-κB activation occurred in a manner independent of the enzymatic activity of caspase-1. The possibility that the observed activation of NF-κB occurred as a result of an endogenous autocrine loop of IL-1β, a potent inducer of NF-κB, can be excluded, because transfection of 293T cells with wild-type caspase-1 or caspase-1 C284A in the absence of proIL-1β did not lead to detectable IL-1β in the supernatant of the transfected cells (Fig. 2B). Moreover, caspase-1 C284A was incapable of maturating pro-IL-1β when co-expressed (Fig. 2B). To analyze the NF-κB-inducing capacity of human caspase-1, its cDNA was cloned from a THP-1 cDNA library, and we generated an enzymatically inactive C285A mutant to exclude interference of cell death with the assay. Dose-dependent induction of NF-κB activation was observed upon transfection of human caspase-1 C285A in 293T cells (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that the NF-κB-inducing ability is conserved in mouse and man. All together, these results showed that NF-κB activation is a novel function of caspase-1 and that, in contrast to the induction of apoptosis and the maturation of pro-IL-1β, the proteolytic activity of caspase-1 is not needed for the activation of NF-κB.Fig. 2Caspase-1-induced NF-κB activation is independent of pro-IL-1β maturation. A, 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter and the indicated amounts of plasmid encoding enzymatically inactive murine caspase-1 C284A. Total DNA was maintained at 0.5 μg by the addition of control plasmid DNA. 24 h after transfection, lysates were analyzed for NF-κB activation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. Supernatant was analyzed for the presence of biologically active IL-1β 24 h after transfection. C, 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter and the indicated amounts of plasmid encoding enzymatically inactive human caspase-1 C285A. Total DNA was maintained at 0.5 μg by the addition of control plasmid DNA. 24 h after transfection, lysates were analyzed for NF-κB activation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” D, 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter, a plasmid encoding pro-IL-1β and the indicated amounts of plasmid encoding murine caspase-1 2D/E. Total DNA was maintained at 0.5 μg by the addition of control plasmid DNA. 24 h after transfection, supernatants were analyzed for the presence of mature IL-1β (top) and cell lysates for NF-κB activation (center), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of the lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting to confirm expression of caspase-1 2D/E (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Caspase-1-induced NF-κB Activation and Pro-IL-1β Maturation Can Occur Simultaneously—Our results indicated that pro-IL-1β maturation was dependent on caspase-1 enzymatic activity, whereas NF-κB activation was independent of it. However, stimulation of macrophages with LPS led to a strong induction of both NF-κB activation and maturation of pro-IL-1β (data not shown). This led us to examine whether or not caspase-1-dependent pro-IL-1β processing and NF-κB activation were mutually exclusive. Assuming that the strong proapoptotic activity of wild-type caspase-1 masked the read-out in our NF-κB reporter system, we used caspase-1 2D/E, a less cytotoxic variant of wild-type caspase-1 in which the cleavage sites between the prodomain and the p20 domain are mutated. Co-expression of caspase-1 2D/E and pro-IL-1β demonstrated that pro-IL-1β maturation and NF-κB activation could occur together (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrated that the induction of NF-κB activity was independent of the enzymatic activity of the caspase and thus of the maturation of pro-IL-1β. Moreover, these results suggest that caspase-1-mediated NF-κB activation and pro-IL-1β maturation can occur simultaneously. Specificity of Caspase-1-induced NF-κB Activation—Murine caspase-1 clusters phylogenetically with caspase-11 and caspase-12 (36Lamkanfi M. Declercq W. Kalai M. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 358-361Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether caspase-11 and -12 were also capable of inducing NF-κB activation. Overexpression of wild-type caspase-1 quickly led to apoptotic cell death of the transfected cells (Fig. 1A). As a result, the protein was hard to detect in cytosolic lysates by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 3) but was present in the supernatant of dying cells (15Martinon F. Burns K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 417-426Google Scholar, 37Denecker G. Vercammen D. Steemans M. Vanden Berghe T. Brouckaert G. Van Loo G. Zhivotovsky B. Fiers W. Grooten J. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 829-840Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death was much less extensive when caspase-11 or -12 was overexpressed (data not shown). This is in accordance with Western blotting analysis showing clear expression of these proteins in cell lysates. In the case of caspase-11, a 27-kDa fragment characteristic of its activation (38Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Google Scholar) was detected. However, neither caspase-11 nor caspase-12 was capable of activating NF-κB (Fig. 3). To exclude the possibility of cell death interfering with the NF-κB assays, we also analyzed the enzymatically inactive C/A mutants of caspase-1, -11, and -12. In contrast to the wild-type caspases, none of the C/A mutants induced apoptosis (data not shown). However, caspase-11 C254A and caspase-12 C298A were still completely unable to activate NF-κB, whereas caspase-1 C284A strongly induced the expression of the NF-κB-dependent reporter (Fig. 3). Caspase-1-induced NF-κB Activation Required IKK-β and Was Independent of TRAF2 and RIP1—We next analyzed the signaling pathway involved in caspase-1-induced NF-κB activation, using several inhibitors and dominant-negative (DN) molecules of key proteins involved in known NF-κB signaling pathways. Because most NF-κB signaling pathways converge at the IKK-complex, we used a kinase-dead mutant (K44A) of IKK-β that functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor (IKK-β DN), to analyze whether caspase-1 signals through this central NF-κB activating complex. Low levels of IKK-β DN completely abolished both TNF- and caspase-1-induced NF-κB activation, suggesting that the IKK-complex is a central downstream mediator of caspase-1-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 4A). A20 is an inhibitor of several NF-κB-activating pathways, including those induced by LPS (39O'Reilly S.M. Moynagh P.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 586-593Google Scholar, 40Lee E.G.

A20 blocked both TNF- and caspase-1-induced activation of NF-κB, suggesting that it is a downstream inhibitor of both pathways (Fig. 4A). However, the exact molecular pathway used by A20 remains poorly characterized. RIP1 and TRAF2 are central mediators of TNF- and CD40-induced NF-κB activation (43Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y.

Expression of PKCβII in the colon of transgenic mice induces hyperproliferation and increased susceptibility to colon cancer. To determine molecular mechanisms by which PKCβII promotes colon cancer, we established rat intestinal epithelial (RIE) cells stably expressing PKCβII. Here we show that RIE/PKCβII cells acquire an invasive phenotype that is blocked by the PKCβ inhibitor LY379196. Invasion is not observed in RIE cells expressing a kinase-deficient PKCβII, indicating that PKCβII activity is required for the invasive phenotype. PKCβII induces activation of K-Ras and the Ras effector, Rac1, in RIE/PKCβII cells. PKCβII-mediated invasion is blocked by the Mek inhibitor, U0126, and by expression of either dominant negative Rac1 or kinase-deficient atypical PKCι. Expression of constitutively active Rac1 induces Mek activation and invasion in RIE cells, indicating that Rac1 is the critical downstream effector of PKCβII-mediated invasion. Taken together, our results define a novel PKCβII → Ras → PKCι /Rac1 → Mek signaling pathway that induces invasion in intestinal epithelial cells. This pathway provides a plausible mechanism by which PKCβII promotes colon carcinogenesis. Protein kinase C βII (PKCβII) promotes colon carcinogenesis.

Invasion is not observed in RIE cells expressing a kinase-deficient PKCβII, indicating that PKCβII activity is required for the invasive phenotype. PKCβII induces activation of K-Ras and the Ras effector, Rac1, in RIE/PKCβII cells. PKCβII-mediated invasion is blocked by the Mek inhibitor, U0126, and by expression of either dominant negative Rac1 or kinase-deficient atypical PKCι. Expression of constitutively active Rac1 induces Mek activation and invasion in RIE cells, indicating that Rac1 is the critical downstream effector of PKCβII-mediated invasion. Taken together, our results define a novel PKCβII → Ras → PKCι /Rac1 → Mek signaling pathway that induces invasion in intestinal epithelial cells. This pathway provides a plausible mechanism by which PKCβII promotes colon carcinogenesis. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States (1Jemal A. Murray T. Samuels A. Ghafoor A. Ward E. Thun M.J. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2003; 53: 5-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (3363) Google Scholar). Colon carcinogenesis is a complex multistep process involving progressive disruption of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival mechanisms (2Calvert P.M. Frucht H.

Colon carcinogenesis is driven by environmental factors that modulate cell signaling pathways, and by genetic mutation of transforming oncogenes, and deletion or mutation of DNA repair enzymes and tumor suppressor genes (2Calvert P.M.

An important challenge is to understand how environmental and genetic factors interact to define colon cancer risk.Protein kinase C (PKC) 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; RIE, rat intestinal epithelial; Mek, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; TGFβRII, TGF-β receptor type II; PAK, p21-activated kinase; DME, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Ras-binding domain; kd, kinase-deficient. 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; RIE, rat intestinal epithelial; Mek, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; TGFβRII, TGF-β receptor type II; PAK, p21-activated kinase; DME, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Ras-binding domain; kd, kinase-deficient. is a family of 12 lipid-dependent serine/threonine kinases involved in proliferation, differentiation, and survival (3Fields A.P.

PKCβII-mediated invasion is dependent upon Ras, PKCι, Rac1, and Mek. Our findings define a novel proinvasive PKCβII → Ras → PKCι /Rac1 → Mek signaling pathway. Our data indicate that PKCβII promotes colon cancer through activation of at least two distinct signaling pathways, one that confers TGF-β resistance, and a second that induces invasion, in intestinal epithelial cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—The PKCβ-selective inhibitor LY379196 was a kind gift of Dr. James R. Gillig, Lilly Pharmaceutical Co. Puromycin dihydrochloride was purchased from Calbiochem. Polybrene and crystal violet were from Sigma. Anti-PKCβII, anti-actin, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Full-length wild type human PKCβII was used as a template, and the mutagenic primer, 5′-GGC ACA GAT GAG CTC TAT GCT GTG TGG ATC CTG AAG AAG GAC G-3′, was used to replace lysine 372, a residue essential for ATP binding and activity, with a tryptophan residue (12Spitaler M.

The kdPKCβII mutant was inserted into the pBABE/FLAG/puro retroviral expression vector, and virus stocks were produced using Phoenix-E cells.Stable Transfection of Cell Lines—RIE cells were maintained in 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DME) medium (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C as described previously (10Murray N.R.

Puromycin-resistant, stable transfectants were generated as described at www.stanford.edu/group/nolan/NL-phnxr.html. Expression of PKCβII or kdPKCβII was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG and anti-PKCβII antibodies.Retrovirus Production and Transient Transfection—Recombinant retroviruses containing Myc-tagged dominant negative Rac1 (RacN17) or constitutively active Rac1 (RacV12) were generated by excising the Myc-tagged Rac1 constructs from pEXV/Rac vectors (13Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) with EcoRI and ligating them into the EcoRI site of the LZRS-GFP retrovirus. Each construct was confirmed by sequence analysis. LZRS-GFP-Rac1 retroviruses were used to infect RIE cells and derivative cell lines as described above.Preparation of Recombinant PAK and Rhotekin GST Fusion Proteins—GST·PAK and GST·Rhotekin were used to assay for Rac1 and RhoA activity, respectively. Escherichia coli transformed with the GST·PAK or GST·Rhotekin constructs were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.6–0.7. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 3 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the bacterial pellet was suspended in 2 ml of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The GST·PAK or GST·Rhotekin beads were washed twice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer.Ras, Rac1, and RhoA Activity Assays—Ras, Rac1, and RhoA activities were assessed by affinity isolation of GTP-bound Ras, Rac1, or RhoA using binding domains of Raf-1, Pak, and Rhotekin, respectively, essentially as described (14Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P.

Briefly, cells were lysed into 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% deoxycholic acid, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 5 min. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and supernatants were transferred to new tubes containing 10 μl of Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 (Raf-1·RBD) coupled to agarose beads (Cytoskeleton, Inc.), GST·Rho-binding domain of PAK (PAK·RBD), or GST·Rhotekin·RBD immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. An aliquot of each supernatant was reserved to determine total Ras, Rac1, RhoA, and actin expression by immunoblot analysis. Following a 45-min incubation at 4 °C, the agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the agarose beads were washed twice in wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bound proteins were solubilized by the addition of 25 μl of SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using Ras, Rac1, or RhoA antibody as appropriate. Cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium and stimulated with 5% fetal bovine serum for the times indicated in the figure legends prior to assay. Ras and Rac1 activity was quantitated by densitometry.Invasion Assay—Cell invasion was assayed using Matrigel-coated Transwell cell culture chambers (6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore size; BD Biosciences). Cells maintained for 24 h in serum-free-medium were trypsinized, resuspended in serum-free DME medium, and placed in the upper chamber of the Transwell insert (5 × 104 cells/well), and DME medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the lower chamber. After 22 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, non-invasive cells in the upper chamber were removed, and invasive cells were fixed in 100% methanol and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 2% ethanol. Five random microscopic fields at ×400 magnification were counted in each filter using a calibrated ocular grid. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. The data are expressed as the average number of cells/field ±S.E. In some cases, the data are presented as -fold change from RIE cells, with the value for RIE cells set as 1. In some cases, cells were treated with LY379196 (50 nm), U0126 (10 μm), or celecoxib (25 μm) for 24 h prior to being subjected to the invasion assay using medium containing the appropriate inhibitor at the concentration indicated above.RESULTSPKCβII Induces an Invasive Phenotype in RIE Cells—We previously characterized transgenic mice expressing elevated levels of PKCβII in the colonic epithelium (7Gokmen-Polar Y.

RIE cells are immortalized but not transformed and, like most cells within the intestinal epithelium, express little or no PKCβII (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we established RIE cells stably expressing human PKCβII by transgenesis (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, RIE/PKCβII cells acquire a highly invasive phenotype (Fig. 1B). Treatment of RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells with the selective PKCβ inhibitor LY379196 (16Jirousek M.R. Gillig J.R. Gonzalez C.M. Heath W.F. McDonald 3rd, J.H. Neel D.A. Rito C.J. Singh U. Stramm L.E.

Unlike RIE/PKCβII cells, RIE cells expressing a kinase-deficient PKCβII mutant (RIE/kdPKCβII) do not exhibit enhanced invasion (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that PKCβII induces an invasive phenotype that is dependent upon PKCβII activity.PKCβII Activates K-Ras in RIE Cells—There is evidence for reciprocal cross-talk between PKC and Ras (17Marshall C.J.

Many cellular effects of the PKC activator phorbol myristate acetate are dependent upon Ras, and PKC activates cellular Ras in response to many extracellular stimuli (19Burgering B.M. Bos J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured Ras expression and activity in RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells (Fig. 2). RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells express abundant K-Ras but very little H-Ras (Fig. 2A), consistent with the epithelial nature of RIE cells. Expression of PKCβII in RIE cells has no demonstrable effect on the level of K-Ras expression and does not induce H-Ras expression. We next assessed the level of K-Ras activity in RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells in the presence and absence of serum (Fig. 2B). Although RIE cells exhibit little or no detectable active Ras in the absence of serum, RIE/PKCβII cells show a significant amount of active Ras under serum-free conditions. Treatment of cells with 5% serum leads to transient activation of Ras in both RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells. However, both the duration and the magnitude of serum-stimulated Ras activation are higher in RIE/PKCβII cells than in RIE cells.Fig. 2PKCβII-mediated invasion requires Mek activity but not Cox-2.A, RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis for K-Ras, H-Ras, and actin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells were incubated in the absence of serum for 24 h to induce quiescence and then stimulated with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for the indicated times. Cells were lysed and assayed for Ras activity using the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 as an affinity ligand. Ras-GTP and total Ras were detected by immunoblot analysis. Data are representative of three independent experiments. C, RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells were incubated in the absence of serum for 24 h as described in A or maintained in serum-containing medium. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis for phospho-Mek, total Mek, and actin.

To assess whether PKCβII-mediated invasion is Ras-dependent, we initially measured, and then inhibited, the activity of the Ras effector, Mek. RIE/PKCβII cells exhibit an elevated level of phosphorylated, active Mek when compared with RIE cells (Fig. 2C). The increase in phospho-Mek in RIE/PKCβII cells reflects increased Mek activity since it is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in total Mek levels.

However, treatment of RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells with the selective Cox-2 inhibitor celecoxib had no effect on the invasive behavior of either RIE or RIE/PKCβII cells, demonstrating that PKCβII-mediated invasion does not require Cox-2 activity (Fig. 2D).PKC βII Activates Rac1, but Not RhoA, in RIE Cells—Oncogenic Ras-mediated invasion requires the GTPase activity of Rac1 (13Qiu R.G.

Densitometric analysis of multiple experiments demonstrated that RIE/PKCβII cells contain 5-fold higher Rac1 activity than RIE cells without an increase in the total levels of Rac1 (Fig. 3B). RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells exhibit a similar, low level of RhoA activity in the absence of serum (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, treatment with serum leads to activation of RhoA to a similar extent in RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells. Therefore, PKCβII induces activation of Rac1 but not of the related GTPase RhoA in RIE/PKCβII cells. LY379196 reduces Rac1 activity in RIE/PKCβII cells to levels comparable with those observed in RIE cells while having no effect on Rac1 activity in RIE cells (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, although RIE/PKCβII cells exhibit elevated Rac1 activity, RIE/kdPKCβII cells exhibit Rac1 activity indistinguishable from RIE cells (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that PKCβII-mediated Rac1 activation, like cell invasion, requires PKCβII activity.Fig. 3PKCβII activates Rac1 in RIE cells.A, RIE and RIE/PKCβII cells were grown in DME medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 2 days to a confluence of ∼70%.

However, the intracellular mechanism(s) by which nicotine promotes survival of lung cancer cells remains enigmatic. Bad is a proapoptotic BH3-only member of the Bcl2 family and is expressed in both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer cells. Here we report that nicotine potently induces Bad phosphorylation at Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155 in a mechanism involving activation of MAPKs ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT, and PKA in human lung cancer cells. Nicotine-induced multi-site phosphorylation of Bad results in sequestering Bad from mitochondria and subsequently interacting with 14-3-3 in the cytosol. Treatment of cells with PKC inhibitor (staurosporine), MEK-specific inhibitor (PD98059), PI3 kinase inhibitor (LY294002), or PKA inhibitor (H89) blocks the nicotine-induced Bad phosphorylation that is associated with enhanced apoptotic cell death. The fact that β-adrenergic receptor inhibitor (propranolol) blocks nicotine-induced activation of ERK1/2, AKT, PKA, Bad phosphorylation, and cell survival suggests that nicotine-induced Bad phosphorylation may occur through the upstream β-adrenergic receptors. The fact that specific knockdown of Bad expression by RNA interference using short interfering RNA enhances cell survival and that nicotine has no additional survival effect on these cells suggests that Bad may act as a required target of nicotine.

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death, with a 5-year relative survival rate of 15% in both men and women worldwide (1Hecht S.S. J. Natl.

Cigarette smoking is by far the most important risk factor in the development of lung cancer (3Schuller H.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). About 90% of male lung cancer deaths and 75-80% female lung cancer deaths in the United States are caused by smoking (1Hecht S.S. J. Natl.

Recent observations suggest that responsiveness to therapy and prognosis of lung cancer may be associated with the Bcl-2 family proteins (14Sartorius U.A. Krammer P.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 family has at least 20 members in mammals, all of which share at least one Bcl-2 homology (BH) domain (13Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar). Among these domains, the BH3 domain is responsible for interaction with other Bcl2 family proteins and promotes cells undergoing apoptosis (15Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Bcl2 family members control cell survival or cell death by regulating the outer mitochondria membrane permeabilization (16Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). The BH3-only proapoptotic proteins (i.e. Bad, Bid, Bim, Bik, Nix, and Noxa, etc.) can couple death signals to mitochondria and promote apoptosis by quelling the protective action of Bcl-XL (17Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Bad is one of the BH3-only proapoptotic members, and phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155 has been demonstrated to inactivate its proapoptotic function (18Hirai I. Wang H.G. Biochem.

The active Bad is a dephosphorylated form that localizes at mitochondria and interacts with Bcl-XL to neutralize their anti-apoptotic function. We have recently discovered that nicotine induces Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70 through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and protein kinase c (PKC)α that may contribute to nicotine-induced survival and chemoresistance of lung cancer cells (23Mai H. May Jr., W.S. Gao F. Jin Z. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1886-1891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because some lung cancer cells express low or undetectable levels of endogenous Bcl2 (24Ikegaki N. Katsumata M. Minna J. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that other Bcl2 family member(s), for example, Bad, may be involved in nicotine-induced survival signal pathway(s). Recent studies indicate that nicotine potently activates both MAPKs ERK1/2 and AKT in association with increased survival of normal lung airway epithelial cells (25West K.A. Brognard J. Clark A.S. Linnoila I.R. Yang X. Swain S.M. Harris C. Belinsky S. Dennis P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that because AKT and the MAPKs ERK1/2 are reported to function as physiologic Bad kinases (26Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol.

Materials—Bad, ERK1, ERK2, AKT1/2, phospho-specific ERK, phospho-specific Bad (Ser112 and Ser136), 14-3-3β (K-19) antibodies, as well as PKA inhibitor H89 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-specific Bad (Ser155) and phospho-specific AKT antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Nicotine, propranolol, etoposide (VP16) and cisplatin were purchased from Sigma. Puromycin, PD98059, staurosporine, LY294002, and α-bungarotoxin were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). A549 and NCI-H23 cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). SignaTECT cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) assay kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). All reagents used were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—A549 cells were maintained in F-12K medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm l-glutamine. NCI-H69, NCI-H82, NCI-H157, NCI-H23, NCI-H358, and NCI-H460 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Protein Isolation—Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline and resuspended in ice-cold EBC buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem) and lysed by sonication. The lysates were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with phosphate-free RPMI medium 1640 and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 90 min. After treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in detergent buffer. Bad was immunoprecipitated using Bad antibody, as described previously (29Deng X. Ruvolo P.

The samples were subjected to SDS-12% PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at -80 °C. Bad phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. The same filter was then probed by Western blot analysis with a Bad antibody and developed by using an ECL Kit (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (30Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Assay of PKA Activity in Vitro—PKA activity was measured using a PKA assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (31Goueli B.S. Hsiao K. Tereba A. Goueli S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A549 cells were treated with nicotine in the absence or presence of inhibitor(s). Cells were then lysed using PKA extraction buffer. Enzyme sample (5 μl) was added and incubated at 30 °C for 5 mins. Reaction buffer (10 μl) for termination was placed onto a pre-numbered membrane square. After washing and rinsing, the membrane was dried, placed into a scintillation vial, and analyzed by scintillation counting. Cell Viability Assay—The apoptotic and viable cells were detected using an ApoAlert Annexin-V kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The percentages of Annexin-Vlow cells (percentage of viable cells) or Annexin-Vhigh cells (percentage of apoptotic cells) were determined by using the data obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described (32Deng X.

Cell viability was also confirmed by using the trypan blue dye exclusion method (29Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B. May Jr., W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Subcellular Fractionation—Cells (2 × 107) were washed with cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture set I, homogenized with a polytron homogenizer operating for four bursts of 10 s each at a setting of 5, then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria as described (33Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The second supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g to pellet light membranes. The resulting supernatant is the cytosolic fraction. Mitochondria were washed with mitochondrial buffer twice, resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, rocked for 60 min, and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant containing mitochondrial proteins was collected. Protein (100 μg) from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bad or phosphorylated Bad was analyzed by Western blot using Bad or phosphospecific Bad antibody, respectively. The purity of fractions was confirmed by assessing localization of mitochondria-specific protein, prohibitin (34Ikonen E. Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). RNA Interference—A549 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bad were transfected with Bad siRNA according to the siPORT lipid siRNA transfection protocol from the manufacturer (Ambion Inc). The Bad DNA target sequence for siRNA design was AAGAAGGGACTTCCTCGCCCG. A control siRNA (non-homologous to any known gene sequence) was used as a negative control. The levels of Bad expression were analyzed by Western blotting using Bad antibody. Specific silencing of targeted Bad gene was confirmed by at least three independent experiments. Nicotine Induces Bad Phosphorylation in Association with Increased Survival of Human Lung Cancer Cells—The apoptotic process can be divided into three interdependent phases: induction, decision, and execution. The decision phase is mainly regulated by the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators (35Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that nicotine induces Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser70 and potently promotes survival of human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) H69 cells (23Mai H. May Jr., W.S. Gao F. Jin Z. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1886-1891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Bad is one of the BH3-only Bcl2 family members, and phosphorylation negatively regulates its proapoptotic activity (22Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Bad is more widely expressed in human lung cancer cells, including SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer cells, than Bcl2 (Fig. 1A). This finding suggests that Bad may play a more important role in nicotine-induced survival and chemoresistance of human lung cancer cells, especially in those cells that express low or undetectable levels of endogenous Bcl2. To test whether nicotine can induce Bad phosphorylation and promote cell survival, A549 cells (i.e. human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line) expressing high levels of endogenous Bad but no detectable levels of Bcl-2 were tested (Fig. 1A). A549 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine (1 μm) for various times as indicated. Results indicate that nicotine potently stimulates Bad phosphorylation, which could abolish the proapoptotic function of Bad (Fig. 1B; Ref. 20Bergmann A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 607-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Similar experiments were also performed by using other lung cancer cell lines (i.e. H157 and H358 cells), and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Because nicotine prolongs cell survival after treatment with cisplatin or VP-16 by 30-40% (Fig. 1C), this increased survival may result, at least in part, from phosphorylation of Bad. Nicotine Induces Bad Phosphorylation at Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155—Bad phosphorylation at Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155 abrogates the proapoptotic function of Bad (20Bergmann A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 607-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 36Datta S.R. Ranger A.M. Lin M.Z. Sturgill J.F. Ma Y.C. Cowan C.W. Dikkes P. Korsmeyer S.J. Greenberg M.E. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 631-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Results from metabolic labeling experiments show that nicotine can induce Bad phosphorylation (Fig. 1B), but which are the phosphorylation sites remains unclear. To identify nicotine-induced Bad phosphorylation sites, A549 cells were treated with nicotine (1 ìM), and Bad phosphorylation was assessed using site-phosphospecific Bad antibodies. Results reveal that nicotine induces multi-site Bad phosphorylation at Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155 in both a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Interestingly, there is a hierarchical relationship between these three phosphorylation sites, because the peak of nicotine-induced phosphorylation at Ser112 is observed earlier than phosphorylation at Ser136 and Ser155 (i.e. 30 versus 60 min; Fig. 2A). Various lung cancer cell lines, including NCI-H157 and H358 cells that express exogenous Bad, were also tested, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). These results suggest that nicotine-induced survival of human lung cancer cells may occur or be enhanced by a novel mechanism involving multi-site phosphorylation of Bad. Nicotine Induces Activation of MAPKs ERK1/2, AKT, and PKA in Human Lung Cancer Cells—Nicotine potently stimulates phosphorylation of Bad at multiple sites (i.e. Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155; Fig. 2) but the upstream protein kinase(s) involved remains unclear. Phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112 has been reported to depend upon activation of MAPKs ERK1/2, whereas AKT (a downstream serine/threonine kinase of PI3K) or c-AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is responsible for phosphorylation of Bad at Ser136 or Ser155, respectively (19Tan Y.

Our results indicate that nicotine simultaneously induces phosphorylation and activation of MAPKs ERK1/2, AKT, and PKA, with a peak observed between 30 and 60 min in a dose-response manner (Fig. 3). These results suggest that nicotine-induced multi-site Bad phosphorylation may occur through activation of multiple physiological Bad kinases including MAPKs ERK1/2, AKT, and PKA. Staurosporine, PD98059, LY294002, and H89 Inhibit Nicotine-induced Bad Phosphorylation and Promote Apoptosis—Because phosphorylation inactivates the proapoptotic function of Bad (20Bergmann A. Dev.

To test this possibility, specific inhibitors for Bad kinases were used. A549 cells were incubated with nicotine (1 μm) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of staurosporine (a PKC inhibitor; Ref. 37Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25046-25051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Results indicate that staurosporine or PD98059 potently blocks nicotine-induced MAPKs ERK1/2 activation as well as Ser112 site phosphorylation of Bad (Fig. 4, A and B). This suggests that nicotine may trigger a PKC/ERK1/2 protein kinase cascade to phosphorylate and inactivate Bad. In addition, LY294002 or H89 also inhibits nicotine-induced Bad phosphorylation at Ser136 or Ser155, respectively (Fig. 4, C and D). These findings provide the pharmacological evidence that AKT and PKA are also involved in nicotine/Bad signaling. Importantly, staurosporine, PD98059, LY294002, and H89 potently block nicotine-induced cell survival after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents (i.e. cisplatin, VP16; Fig. 4E). These results indicate that inhibition of nicotine-induced Bad phosphorylation by blocking these three upstream pathways (i.e. PKC/ERKs, PI3 K/AKT, and PKA) restores the proapoptotic activity of Bad that triggers apoptotic cell death. The β-Adrenergic Receptor-specific Inhibitor Propranolol Potently Inhibits Nicotine-induced Bad Phosphorylation and Enhances Apoptosis—It has been reported that nAChRs, especially α7nAChR and β-adrenergic receptor, play important roles in nicotine signaling in lung cancer cells (6Minna J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 31-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Itier V. Bertrand D. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Park P.G. Merryman J.

Rapozzi V. Zorzet S. Giraldi T. Anticancer Res. 1996; 16: 3409-3413PubMed Google Scholar), were selected to test which type of receptor may be involved in nicotine/Bad signaling. A549 cells were treated with nicotine in the presence or absence of various concentrations of propranolol or α-BTX. Interestingly, propranolol but not α-BTX can completely block nicotine-induced MAPKs ERK1/2, AKT, and PKA activation and Bad phosphorylation at Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155 sites (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Functionally, propranolol blocks nicotine-induced cell survival and promotes apoptosis after treatment with cisplatin or VP-16. These results implicate nicotine-induced Bad phosphorylation in a mechanism involving the upstream β-adrenergic receptor in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells. Nicotine Induces Bad Translocation from Mitochondria into Cytosol, Which Facilitates Association with 14-3-3—Our results indicate that nicotine induces multi-site phosphorylation of Bad in association with increased cell survival. Phosphorylation has been reported to promote Bad translocation from mitochondria into cytosol and interaction with the scaffold protein 14-3-3 (18Hirai I. Wang H.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 345-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). To assess whether nicotine affects Bad translocation, A549 cells were treated with nicotine for 30 min. Subcellular fractionation experiments were performed to isolate mitochondria and cytosol, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results reveal that nicotine potently stimulates translocation of Bad from mitochondria into cytosol (Fig. 6A). Phosphorylated Bad is observed only in cytosol, and its accumulation is increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A), indicating that nicotine-induced Bad phosphorylation may function to translocate the mitochondrial Bad into cytosol. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that nicotine enhances the association between Bad and 14-3-3. These results reveal that nicotine-induced multi-site Bad phosphorylation results in sequestering Bad from mitochondria and functionally blocking its proapoptotic function. Bad May Be a Required Target for Nicotine-induced Survival of Human Lung Cancer Cells—Bad is ubiquitously expressed in human lung cancer cell lines, whereas Bcl2 is not (Fig. 1A), suggesting that Bad may be a more important potential death target for treatment of patients with lung cancer. To test whether Bad is a necessary target for nicotine-induced survival and chemoresistance of human lung cancer cells, an RNA interference approach was employed. It has recently been demonstrated that 21 base pair double-strand RNA (siRNA) is a potent mediator of the RNA interference effect in mammalian cells (44Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). We used this strategy to target Bad in A549 cells by transfecting cells with Bad siRNA, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results show that the Bad siRNA can potently and specifically reduce Bad expression by more than 90%, whereas the control siRNA has no effect (Fig. 7A). Depletion of Bad expression was found to prolong cell survival after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents (i.e. cisplatin or VP-16) in the absence or presence of nicotine (Fig. 7B). Nicotine has no additional survival effect in cells expressing Bad siRNA (Fig. 7), indicating that Bad may be a required target for nicotine/survival signaling in human lung cancer cells. Bcl-2 and related family proteins are major regulators of apoptosis that are critical for development and tumorigenesis in autoimmune and degenerative diseases (13Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar). Bad belongs to the BH3-only Bcl-2 subfamily and shares the conserved BH3 domain (i.e. death domain) with other Bcl2 family members (13Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar, 45Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). All members of this BH3-only subfamily are proapoptotic and have been shown to interact with one or more of the death suppressor family members, such as Bcl-XL (46Lutz R.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation, a post-translational modification, plays a pivotal role in regulating the proapoptotic activity of Bad. Recent studies indicate that the ability of Bad to heterodimerize with Bcl-XL and to promote apoptosis depends upon the phosphorylation status of this proapoptotic protein (27Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 47Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T. Franke T.F. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Growth factor (i.e. IL-3 or epidermal growth factor)-induced phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155 has been reported to disrupt its proapoptotic function (18Hirai I. Wang H.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 345-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tan Y. Demeter M.R. Ruan H. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25865-25869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 40Zhou X. Liu Y. Payne G. Lutz R.J. Thomas Chittenden T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25046-25051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that nicotine mimics growth factors to potently stimulate Bad phosphorylation at these three sites and enhances survival of pulmonary adenocarcinoma A549 cells (Fig. 1). Other lung cancer cell lines (i.e. H157 and H358) were also tested, and similar results were obtained (data not shown), indicating that nicotine can induce Bad phosphorylation and survival in various lung cancer cells. We discovered previously that nicotine induces Bcl2 phosphorylation in association with increased survival of H69 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bcl2 (23Mai H. May Jr., W.S. Gao F. Jin Z. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1886-1891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, most lung cancer cell lines, including A549 cells, do not express detectable levels of Bcl2, but do express high levels of endogenous Bad (Fig. 1A). Therefore, nicotine-induced survival of A549 cells may occur, at least in part, through phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155. Phosphorylation at Ser112 of Bad occurs earlier than Ser136 or Ser155 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that nicotine-induced multi-site Bad phosphorylation may occur in a hierarchical manner. Phosphorylation of Ser112 may facilitate further phosphorylation of Bad at Ser136 and Ser155 sites. However, the signal mechanism and functional significance for this hierarchical phosphorylation remain elusive. Our results reveal that nicotine-induced multi-site Bad phosphorylation occurs through three signal pathways, including ERKs→ Bad at Ser112, PI3K/AKT→ Bad at Ser136, and PKA→ Bad at Ser155 (Fig. 3 and 4). These results support previous findings that ERKs, AKT, or PKA can function as a Bad Ser112, Ser136, or Ser155 kinase, respectively (26Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 27Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It is known that phosphorylation of Bad on either a single Ser112, Ser136, or Ser155 or at multi-site can inactivate the proapoptotic function of Bad (18Hirai I. Wang H.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 345-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tan Y. Demeter M.R. Ruan H. Comb M.J. J. Biol.

PD98059, LY294002, or H89 can potently inhibit nicotine-induced Bad phosphorylation at Ser112, Ser136, or Ser155 in association with decreased cell survival, providing further pharmacological evidence that nicotine-induced multi-site Bad phosphorylation and cell survival may occur through multiple signal pathways involving ERK1/2/Bad, PI3K/AKT/Bad, and PKA/Bad (Fig. 8). It has been found that high levels of β-adrenergic receptor are expressed in pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells (10Park P.G. Merryman J. Orloff M. Schuller H.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3504-3508PubMed Google Scholar). Mounting evidence now indicates that nicotine can function as a β-adrenergic receptor agonist, and its effect is abrogated by propranolol (a β-adrenergic receptor inhibitor; Refs. 11Suemaru K.

Propranolol was found to block nicotine-induced Bad phosphorylation in A549 cells (Fig. 5), but α-BTX (α7 nAChR specific inhibitor) has no effect (data not shown), suggesting that the β-adrenergic receptor may be the major upstream receptor for nicotine-stimulated Bad phosphorylation in human lung cancer cells. Importantly, inhibition of nicotine-induced Bad phosphorylation by propranolol restores the proapoptotic function of Bad and results in apoptosis (Fig. 5). Thus, propranolol may have the potential to be developed as a clinically useful drug that specifically targets β-adrenergic receptor to block nicotine-stimulated survival signal pathway in patients with lung cancer expressing high levels of β-adrenergic receptor and Bad. Phosphorylation on either Ser112 or Ser136 facilitates formation of a complex between Bad and 14-3-3 in the cytosol, blocking its interaction with Bcl-XL at the mitochondrial level (26Scheid M.P. Schubert K.M. Duronio V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31108-31113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 27Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Further studies indicate that phosphorylation of Ser112, which is located within the center of the Bad BH3 domain, can also directly suppress its proapoptotic function (40Zhou X. Liu Y. Payne G. Lutz R.J. Thomas Chittenden T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25046-25051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Our findings reveal that nicotine, as a survival agonist, is able to mimic growth factors to functionally inactivate Bad through phosphorylation at these three sites (Figs. 1 and 2). Nicotine-induced multi-site phosphorylation also leads to sequestering Bad from mitochondria in an identical mechanism (Fig. 6). Thus, nicotine may promote survival of human lung cancer cells in a novel mechanism involving multi-site phosphorylation of Bad. Because Bad is a potent proapoptotic protein that is ubiquitously expressed in both SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer cells (Fig. 1A), targeting Bad phosphorylation may represent a novel therapeutic approach. Our results indicate that specific knockdown of Bad expression by RNA interference enhances both the survival and chemoresistance of A549 cells (Fig. 7). Importantly, this is a specific effect because nicotine has no additional survival effect on cells in which Bad expression is depleted. In summary, our studies identify a novel nicotine survival signal transduction pathway that depends on phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155 through activation of MAPKs ERK1/2, AKT, and PKA (Fig. 8). Nicotine-induced multi-site phosphorylation sequesters Bad from mitochondria, where it then interacts with 14-3-3 in the cytosol, which leads to loss of the apoptotic function of Bad and, hence, enhanced cell survival (Fig. 8). Because Bad can function as a target of nicotine in human lung cancer cells, it's use may help to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of patients with lung cancer by blocking the nicotine-activated multiple Bad upstream signal pathways."

Actin and PLCβ1 and -β3 co-localize with NHERF-1 and the PTH1R in OKH-N1 cell apical patches.

PTH1R actions in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of the kidney, for example, illustrate that its signaling depends not only on the cell type but also on the presence of the receptor on a specific membrane surface.The PTH1R is abundantly expressed in the PCT, where it mediates PTH signaling primarily via activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and phospholipase C and by increasing intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). PTH-mediated inhibition of phosphate uptake, which is caused by internalization and degradation of the type IIa sodium-phosphate co-transporter (Npt2), is an often-studied response in opossum kidney (OK) cells (3Pfister M.F.

It has recently become appreciated that in polarized epithelia, such as the PCT, discrete microdomains are formed in the apical and basolateral compartments, a process that arises from targeted expression of specialized proteins (8Fanning A.S.

The actin cytoskeleton and associated proteins maintain cell polarity by blocking lateral movement and mixing of apical- and basolateral-membrane constituents. Several lines of evidence suggest that the PTH1R, although expressed in both apical and basolateral compartments of the PCT (11Amizuka N. Lee H.S. Kwan M.Y. Arazani A. Warshawsky H. Hendy G.N.

Physiol. 2003; 285: F1233-F1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is differentially coupled to signaling pathways. First, the PTH1R in isolated basolateral membranes activates AC in vitro, whereas receptors expressed in apical membranes do not (13Kaufmann M. Muff R. Stieger B. Biber J. Murer H. Fischer J.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Second, PTH administered to the apical side of OK cells, grown on membrane filters, displays an EC50 (5 pm) for the inhibition of phosphate uptake that is 100-fold more sensitive than when PTH is administered to the basolateral surface (500 pm) (14Reshkin S.J.

Third, PTH mediates Npt2 internalization and degradation via cAMP/protein kinase A when applied to the basolateral surface and via PLC/protein kinase C when applied to the luminal surface of isolated PCT segments (7Traebert M.

Last, sequential perfusion of PCT cells in primary culture with PTH at 20-min intervals transiently increases [Ca2+]i to the same amplitude but results in a progressive decrease in the activation of AC (16Goligorsky M.S. Loftus D.J. Hruska K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: F938-F944PubMed Google Scholar). Although these results might be compatible with a model involving two PTH receptors, publication of several mammalian genomes have not revealed relevant PTH1R isoforms, suggesting that cell-specific factors are responsible for diverse signaling by this receptor. Cell-specific signaling by the PTH1R is obviously dependent on the repertoire of effector molecules expressed in a given cell.We have recently shown that signaling properties of the PTH1R are profoundly affected by its direct binding of a “scaffolding” protein; the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF-2) (17Mahon M.J. Donowitz M. Yun C.C. Segre G.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). NHERF-2 switches PTH1R signaling from AC to PLC through a direct psd95, discs large, ZO1 (PDZ)-domain-specific interaction between the more C-terminal of two PDZ domains and the C terminus of the receptor (17Mahon M.J. Donowitz M. Yun C.C. Segre G.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). NHERF-2 and the closely related protein, NHERF-1 (also called EBP50), are PDZ domain-containing proteins that also indirectly bind actin via interactions with MERM (merlin, ezrin, radixin, moesin) proteins (18Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 19Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Like NHERF-2, NHERF-1 also interacts with the PTH1R in vitro and in mouse kidney extracts, but this seems to involve the more N-terminal of the two PDZ domains (data shown herein).NHERF-1-null mice display a complex phenotype, which includes renal phosphate wasting, hypocalcemia, and osteopenia (20Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Minkoff C.M. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11470-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Npt2 localizes to intracellular sites in PCT lacking NHERF-1, demonstrating that NHERF-1 targets and/or anchors the transporter to apical domains (20Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Minkoff C.M. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11470-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We recently reported that OKH cells, a sub-clone of wild-type OK cells that do not display PTH-mediated inhibition of Npt2, markedly lack NHERF-1 expression compared with wild-type cells (21Mahon M.J. Cole J.A. Lederer E.D. Segre G.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that stable expression of NHERF-1 in OKH cells (OKH-N1) restored the PTH-mediated inhibition of phosphate uptake (21Mahon M.J. Cole J.A. Lederer E.D. Segre G.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Together with data that show binding of NHERF-1 to Npt2 (21Mahon M.J. Cole J.A. Lederer E.D. Segre G.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Hernando N. Deliot N. Gisler S.M. Lederer E. Weinman E.J. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11957-11962Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that NHERF-1 assembles a regulatory complex for Npt2.Herein, we demonstrate that expression of NHERF-1 in the OK cell model is essential for numerous cellular functions. OKH cells also do not respond to PTH with an increase of phosphoinositide hydrolysis or [Ca2+]i and do not manifest apical patches, which are typical of the parental OK cell. When they stably express exogenous NHERF-1, however, OKH-N1 cells now have apical patches and respond to PTH with an increase in [Ca2+]i, which is caused by extracellular influx, rather than a release from internal stores. This influx is both PLC-dependent and pertussis toxin-sensitive and requires the assembly by NHERF-1 of PLCβ, actin, and the PTH1R.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The OK cell lines were a kind gift from Dr. Judith Cole. Plasmids containing cDNAs for PLCβ1 were from Dr. Sue Goo Rhee, for PLCβ2 from Dr. Eva Neer, and for PLCβ3 from Dr. Barbara Sanborn. NHERF-1 polyclonal antibodies were from Dr. Chris Yun. GST-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences. Fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester, Alexa Fluor 546 phalloidin, and secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and 546 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). U73122, SKF96365, cytochalasin D, and thrombin were from Calbiochem. S-protein-HRP and rapid S-tag assay kit were from Novagen (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to Na+-K+ATPase were from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Pertussis toxin, Flag antibodies, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system and general chemicals were from Sigma.Overlay and Plate-binding Assay—The full-length C-terminal tail of the PTH1R (amino acids 463-591), the N-terminal deletions of the C-terminal tail (amino acids: NΔ60, 523-591; NΔ80, 543-591; NΔ100, 563-591; NΔ110, 573-591; and NΔ120, 583-591) and C-terminal tail point mutations (P581A, L582K, Q584A, E585A, EE585/586AA, and EE585/586KK) were cloned into pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences) using PCR with PfuTurbo polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which generates an N-terminal GST fusion protein. The various GST-PTH1RC-tail constructs were expressed in Bl-21 Escherichia coli and purified using GST-Sepharose. Full-length NHERF-1 (amino acids 1-358), N1-PDZ1short (amino acids 1-127), N1-PDZ2short (amino acids 128-358), N1-PDZ1long (amino acids 1-162), and N1-PDZ2long (amino acids 65-358) were cloned into pET-30b (Novagen), using PCR with Pfu polymerase, which generates an N-terminal S-tag and His6 tag. All clones were verified using automated sequencing. These NHERF-1 constructs were expressed in Bl21(DE3)pLysS E. coli and partially purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following the manufacturer's procedures. Protein concentrations were determined using the S-tag Rapid Assay Kit from Novagen.For overlay assays, 2 μg of purified GST and the various GST PTH1R-C-tails were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBSTw) for 45 min. Full-length NHERF-1 and the various fragments were overlaid on the membrane in 5% milk in PBSTw at a concentration of 200 nm for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed thoroughly and blotted with S-protein-HRP (1:5000) in 5% milk for 20 min and washed a second time; interactions were detected using the Western Lighting Chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA). For the plate-binding assay, 0.5 μg of either GST or the various GST-PTH1R-C-tail proteins were adhered to wells of 96-well plates overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed with PBST and blocked with 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature. The S-tagged NHERF-1 proteins were incubated in the wells at concentrations ranging from 0.01 nm to 1 μm in 5% milk/PBSTw. The wells were thoroughly washed, incubated with S-protein-HRP (1:5000 in 5% milk), and washed a second time; interactions were detected using the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system (Sigma). After 20 min at room temperature, reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.5 m H2SO4 and the reaction was quantified by spectroscopy at 450 nm. Binding to GST alone was subtracted from each value at a given concentration, and the data were reported as a percentage of the maximum binding.Determination of [Ca2+]i—OKH cells were stably transfected with NHERF-1 (OKH-N1), as described previously (21Mahon M.J. Cole J.A. Lederer E.D. Segre G.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i was monitored using the fura-2 method. In brief, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and plated into Lab-Tek II chambered cover glasses (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). Cells were serum-starved for 4-5 h before the assay. Cells were cooled to room temperature and washed with a balanced salt solution (127 mm NaCl, 3.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were then loaded with 5 μm fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester with 0.05% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min at room temperature, washed in balanced salt solution, and unloaded for 30 min. Fura-2 fluorescence was diffuse without a punctate distribution pattern. Fluorescence was measured in single cells excited at 340 and 380 nm using a PTI Deltascan dual-wavelength fluorimeter (Photon Technologies Incorporated, Lawrenceville, NJ) directed through the stage of an inverted Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope (Melville, NY) with a cut-off filter at 400 nm. Emissions were monitored in real time with a Sensys charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Ltd., Tucson, AZ) and analyzed using the Poenie-Tsien ratio with Imagemaster 2 software (Photon Technologies Incorporated). At the end of each experiment, fura-2 fluorescence was calibrated to [Ca2+]i by treating the cells with 5 μm ionomycin to achieve the Ca2+-bound dye ratio at 340/380 nm and fluorescence at 480 (Rmax and Sb2), followed by treatment with 5 mm EGTA to determine Ca2+-free dye ratio at 340/380 and fluorescence at 480 (Rmin and Sf2). These parameters were used to estimate [Ca2+]i using the equation of Grynkiewicz et al. (23Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which is provided as a function in the Imagemaster 2 software. Calcium transients monitored in the absence of extracellular calcium are reported as a ratio of fura-2 fluorescence of 340 over 380 nm.Transient Transfection and Immunohistochemistry—Cells were cultured in chambered microscope slides (Nalge Nunc International). The cDNA for the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; BD Biosciences Clontech) was cloned in-frame with 30 amino acids from the C terminus of the PTH1R using PCR. This region of the C-terminal tail has a low degree of homology among species, and placing YFP in this location does not interfere with NHERF-1 interactions in vitro (data not shown). The Flag epitope (DYKDDDDK) was cloned in-frame on the N terminus of PLCβ1 and -β3 in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). PLCβ2 was already Flag-tagged in pcDNA3.1. Forty-eight hours before analysis, cells were transfected with FuGene 6 (Roche Applied Science) at 0.25 μg of plasmid/well at a FuGene6/DNA ratio of 5:1. Cells then were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% non-fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBSTx) for 30-45 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% milk/PBSTx (NHERF-1 polyclonal, 1:2000; Flag monoclonal, 1:1000; Na+/K+-ATPase monoclonal, 1:500) and incubated with the cells for 1 h. Cells then were washed in PBSTx and incubated with species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated with either Alexa Fluor 488 (green) or Alexa Fluor 546 (red). Actin was stained with Alexa Fluor 546 conjugated to phalloidin. Immunostained cells were analyzed using a Radiance 2100 confocal microscope and the associated LaserSharp 2000 operating software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Basolateral membranes were identified using the Na+/K+-ATPase antibody (data not shown).Analysis of the NHERF-1 Dominant Negative—Amino acids of NHERF-1 corresponding to the PDZ1long (see “Overlay and Plate-binding Assay”) and β-galactosidase were cloned in-frame with the Flag epitope (DYKDDDDK) into pcDNA3.1 using PCR. Flag-PDZ1long of NHERF-1 and Flag-β-galactosidase were transiently expressed in OKH-N1 cells using FuGene6 (Roche Applied Science) in cover glass chamber slides, and PTH-elicited increases of [Ca2+]i were determined using the fura-2 method. Efficiency of the transient transfection was estimated to be ∼50% of the cells. Calcium measurements were taken from all cells in the microscopic field and data combined from three independent experiments (n = 10 ± S.E.).Determination of cAMP—PTH-mediated accumulation of cAMP in OKH-N1 cells was determined using a cAMP radioimmunoassay kit (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).RESULTSThe PTH1R and NHERF-1 Interactions in Vitro—NHERF-1 interacts with the PTH1R through an atypical PDZ interaction motif consisting of the four C-terminal amino acids of the receptor (17Mahon M.J. Donowitz M. Yun C.C. Segre G.V. Nature. 2002; 417: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Using overlay assays, full-length NHERF-1 binds the PTH1R tail with high affinity (Fig. 1A). NHERF-1 contains two PDZ domains; one is N-terminal (PDZ1) and the other is centrally located (PDZ2) in the molecule (Fig. 1B). PDZ1 was separated from PDZ2 by dividing the interdomain region in half, yielding PDZ1short and PDZ2short (Fig. 1B). The individual PDZ domains (PDZ1short and PDZ2short) unexpectedly failed to interact with the PTH1R C-tail to any significant degree (Fig. 1A), suggesting that disruption of the interdomain region severely affects interactions of NHERF-1 with target proteins. Additional PDZ domain constructs then were synthesized that included the entire interdomain region (PDZ1long and PDZ2long) (Fig. 1B). Relative binding affinities, determined with a plate-binding assay, show that full-length NHERF-1 and PDZ1long display indistinguishable apparent (Kd) affinities for the PTH1R C-tail of ∼110 to 120 nm (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, PDZ2long does not interact with the PTH1R C-tail to any significant degree (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that PDZ1 of NHERF-1 is the primary binding site for the PTH1R.We next sought to determine whether residues N-terminal to the four C-terminal amino acids that comprise the canonical PDZ interaction motif contribute to the NHERF-1 interaction. As demonstrated by an overlay assay, GST fusions containing N-terminal deletions of the C-tail up to 110 amino acids in length did not affect the NHERF-1-receptor interaction (Fig. 2A). However, deletion of 120 amino acids from the N terminus completely disrupts the NHERF-1-receptor interaction (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the PDZ interaction motif on the PTH1R extends N-terminal to the four terminal residues to include some or all of the C-terminal 18 amino acids. Because the C-tail fused to the large GST moiety (27 kDa) might sterically impair the NHERF-1-receptor interaction, point mutations N-terminal to the PDZ interaction motif were incorporated in the full-length PTH1R C-tail, and its interactions with NHERF-1 were assessed by the plate-binding assay. Incorporation of P581A, L582K, or Q584A point mutations does not affect the NHERF-1-receptor interaction, whereas single and double point mutations of the glutamic acid residues at 585 and 586 markedly disrupt this interaction, suggesting that the acidic side chains in the C-tail stabilize the NHERF-1-receptor interaction (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Amino acid residues N-terminal to the PDZ interaction motif are required for the PTH1R-NHERF-1 interaction. A, GST or GST fused to N-terminal deletions of the PTH1R C-tail (amino acids: NΔ60, 523-591; NΔ80, 543-591; NΔ100, 563-591; NΔ110, 573-591; NΔ120, 583-591) were blotted to a membrane and overlaid with NHERF-1 (200 nm). Interactions were detected with S-protein-HRP and ECL. Data are representative of three independent experiments. B, PTH1R C-tail containing the following point mutations: P581A (closed squares), L582K (triangles), Q584A (inverted triangles), E585A (diamonds), EE585/586AA (circles) and EE585/586KK (open squares), were interacted with NHERF-1 at the concentrations indicated in the plate-binding assay. Relative binding affinities were determined and data are indicative of two independent experiments (n = 8 ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)NHERF-1 Restores PTH-mediated Increases of Intracellular Calcium in OKH Cells—OKH cells, a sub-clone of the wild-type OK cell line, do not display PTH-mediated inhibition of phosphate uptake or increases of [Ca2+]i (24Miyauchi A. Dobre V. Rickmeyer M. Cole J. Forte L. Hruska K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F485-F493PubMed Google Scholar), although they do display a robust PTH-mediated activation of AC (25Cole J.A. Forte L.R. Krause W.J. Thorne P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F672-F679PubMed Google Scholar). We showed previously that OKH cells were deficient in expression of NHERF-1, and stable expression of NHERF-1 in OKH cells restored PTH-mediated inhibition of phosphate uptake (21Mahon M.J. Cole J.A. Lederer E.D. Segre G.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that stable expression of NHERF-1 in OKH cells (OKH-N1) also restores the PTH-elicited increase of [Ca2+]i, which is rapid, robust, and transient in nature. OKH-N1 cells in nominally calcium-free buffer plus 0.5 mm EGTA do not display PTH-mediated increases of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the increase in cytoplasmic free calcium is caused by an influx from the extracellular space and not by release from intracellular stores. The receptor-mediated calcium channel blocker SKF96365 (26Fasolato C. Pizzo P. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20351-20355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) inhibits the PTH-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C), which supports this conclusion, and is consistent with published data that PTH predominantly mediates an influx of calcium ions in wild-type OK cells (24Miyauchi A. Dobre V. Rickmeyer M. Cole J. Forte L. Hruska K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F485-F493PubMed Google Scholar) and PCT cultures (16Goligorsky M.S. Loftus D.J. Hruska K.A. Am. J.

Smogorzewski M. Koss M. Massry S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F330-F337PubMed Google Scholar). The phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 and pertussis toxin also block the PTH-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3C), indicating that this effect depends on activation of PLC by a member of the Gi/o family of G proteins. The inactive analog of U73122, U73343, did not inhibit the PTH-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i (data not shown). OKE cells, another sub-clone of the OK cell line, express abundant amounts of NHERF-1, display responses to PTH similar to those of the parental OK cells, and display PTH-mediated calcium responses that are indistinguishable from that displayed by OKH-N1 cells (data not shown).Fig. 3NHERF-1 rescues the PTH-mediated, PLC-dependent influx of calcium ions into OKH cells. A, OKH and OKH-N1 cells, loaded with fura-2, were treated with 10 nm PTH (1-34) and single cells monitored for changes in [Ca2+]i, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, OKH-N1 cells, loaded with fura-2, in the absence of added extracellular calcium and the presence of 0.5 mm EGTA were treated with 10 nm PTH (1-34), and changes in the fura-2 340/380 nm ratio were monitored. C, OKH-N1 cells, loaded with fura-2, in the presence of either vehicle, 25 μm, or 50 μm SKF96365 (SKF), were treated with 10 nm PTH (1-34). and [Ca2+]i was monitored. D, OKH-N1 cells, incubated with either U73122 (1 μm) for 15 min or pertussis toxin (PTX; 100 ng/ml) for 16 h, were treated with 10 nm PTH (1-34) and [Ca2+]i monitored. Traces are representative of individual cellular responses in a given microscopic field from at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)OK cells respond to thrombin with an increase in [Ca2+]i, a response that has been attributed to an increase of inositol trisphosphates (29Malmstrom K. Stange G. Murer H. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To control for potential depletion of intracellular calcium in OKH-N1 cells when incubated in calcium-free media or an unexpected block of calcium release from intracellular stores by SKF96365, we assessed the response of these treatments to thrombin. Depletion of extracellular calcium (Fig. 4A) or inclusion of SKF96365 (Fig. 4B) does not inhibit the thrombin-mediated increase of [Ca2+]i in OKH-N1 cells, demonstrating that thrombin induces a release of calcium from intracellular stores. These data demonstrate that depletion of extracellular calcium or SKF96365 treatment do not introduce confounding artifacts and thus supports the assertion that PTH increases cytoplasmic-free calcium by increasing influx from outside the OKH-N1 cell.Fig. 4Thrombin stimulates a release of [Ca2+]i in OKH-N1 cells. A, OKH-N1 cells, loaded with fura-2, in the presence of calcium or the absence of added extracellular calcium and the presence of 0.5 mm EGTA, were treated with thrombin (THR; 2 units/ml), and changes in [Ca2+]i were monitor"
https://openalex.org/W2029850727,"The plant glutathione S-transferase BI-GST has been identified as a potent inhibitor of Bax lethality in yeast, a phenotype associated with oxidative stress and disruption of mitochondrial functions. Screening of a tomato two-hybrid library for BI-GST interacting proteins identified five homologous Tau class GSTs, which readily form heterodimers between them and BI-GST. All six LeGSTUs were found to be able to protect yeast cells from prooxidant-induced cell death. The efficiency of each LeGSTU was prooxidant-specific, indicating a different role for each LeGSTU in the oxidative stress-response mechanism. The prooxidant protective effect of all six proteins was suppressed in the absence of YAP1, a transcription factor that regulates hydroperoxide homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting a role for the LeGSTUs in the context of the YAP1-dependent stress-responsive machinery. The different LeGSTUs exhibited varied substrate specificity and showed activity against oxidative stress by-products, indicating that their prooxidant protective function is likely related to the minimization of oxidative damage. Taken together, these results indicate that Tau class GSTs participate in a broad network of catalytic and regulatory functions involved in the oxidative stress response.

IntroductionGSTs are soluble proteins composed of two subunits with molecular masses of 22–27 kDa each and until recently have been considered to be mainly homodimeric (for reviews on GSTs 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; FDNB, 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; CHP, cumene hydroperoxide; GSH, reduced glutathione; 4NBC, 4-nitrobenzyl chloride; NDB-Cl, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzofurazan; t-BOOH, tert-butyl hydroperoxide; HA, hemagglutinin. see Refs. 1Dixon D.P. Lapthorn A. Edwards R. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (reviews3004.1-3004.10 (ISSN 1465-6914))Google Scholar, 2Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Walbot V. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 193-198Google Scholar, 3Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Google Scholar). However, a number of reports have established that these proteins can also exist in the heterodimeric form (4Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 997-1008Google Scholar, 5Gronwald J.W. Plaisance K.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 877-892Google Scholar). The classic definition of GSTs is based on their ability to catalyze the transfer of the tripeptide glutathione (γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine (GSH)) to a co-substrate with a reactive electrophilic center, thus forming a polar S-glutathionylated conjugate. This is considered to be a crucial step in the detoxification process, because the produced S-glutathionylated metabolites are either further catabolized and excreted (in animals) or tagged for vacuolar import because of the lack of effective excretion pathways (in plants) (6Boyland E. Chasseaud L.F. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 985-991Google Scholar, 7Sandermann Jr., H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 82-84Google Scholar).Mechanistically, the binding of GSH to the one active site present per GST subunit results in the ionization of the sulfhydryl group of the tripeptide to yield a highly reactive thiolate anion that is stabilized through hydrogen bonding with an adjacent hydroxyl group. In the mammalian Alpha, Pi, and Mu GSTs, this hydroxyl group is provided by a tyrosine, whereas in most plant enzymes this is provided by a serine (3Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Google Scholar). This hydrogen-bonding activation results in the lowering of the dissociation constant (pKa) of the thiol from 8.7 to 6.0–6.5. GSTs also catalyze GSH-dependent peroxidase reactions by supporting the nucleophilic attack of GSH on hydroperoxides, thus reducing the organic hydroperoxides to the less toxic monohydroxy alcohols. Moreover, GSTs are involved in the isomerization of certain metabolites through the transient formation of a GSH adduct, followed by the spontaneous isomerization of the compound and the release of the isomer and GSH (2Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Walbot V. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 193-198Google Scholar). Other cellular roles attributed to GSTs are as follows: the conjugation of natural products (2Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Walbot V. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 193-198Google Scholar, 8Alfenito M.R. Souer E. Goodman C.D. Buell R. Mol J. Koes R. Walbot V. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1135-1149Google Scholar, 9Dixon D.P. Cummins L. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 258-266Google Scholar), the binding and storage of various small molecules (8Alfenito M.R. Souer E. Goodman C.D. Buell R. Mol J. Koes R.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12749-12755Google Scholar).Recently, a role of GSTs in stress tolerance has been demonstrated. Expression of GSTs in plants is highly responsive to biotic and abiotic stress and to a wide variety of stress-associated chemicals, including 2,3-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and other synthetic and natural auxins, salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid, and H2O2 (16Ulmasov T. Ohmiya A. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 919-927Google Scholar). Tobacco seedlings overexpressing a tobacco Tau class GST are more tolerant to chilling and osmotic stress than wild-type plants (17Roxas V.P. Smith Jr., R.K. Allen E.R. Allen R.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 988-991Google Scholar), whereas a GST participating in oxidative stress tolerance was discovered in black grass (18Cummins I. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant J. 1999; 18: 285-292Google Scholar). Furthermore, a tomato Tau class enzyme, termed BI-GST, was found to confer resistance to oxidative stress when expressed in yeast cells (19Kampranis S.C. Damianova R. Atallah M. Toby G. Kondi G. Tsichlis P.N. Makris A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29207-29216Google Scholar).BI-GST was isolated by means of a yeast genetic screen intended to identify plant proteins involved in programmed cell death responses (19Kampranis S.C. Damianova R. Atallah M. Toby G. Kondi G. Tsichlis P.N. Makris A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29207-29216Google Scholar). Bax, a mammalian proapoptotic protein, was used as the elicitor of cell death in this yeast screen. The lethal phenotype of Bax is characterized by the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane, the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and the release of reactive oxygen species into the cytosol. Co-expression of BI-GST in yeast was able to suppress the lethal effect of Bax. To address the function of BI-GST in a plant context, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify other plant proteins that interact with BI-GST. Most of the isolated interacting clones encoded for genes directly implicated in catalytic or regulatory aspects of stress response. Included in these interactors were five other Tau class GSTs (LeGSTUs), which interact by forming heterodimers with BI-GST. BI-GST and the five novel LeGSTUs are found to confer resistance to prooxidant-induced cell death when expressed in yeast. Investigation of the functional and structural characteristics of these enzymes indicates the participation of these enzymes in a complex network of catalytic and regulatory functions involved in oxidative stress response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Screen—The pEG202/LexA-BI-GST construct was generated as described previously (19Kampranis S.C. Damianova R. Atallah M. Toby G. Kondi G. Tsichlis P.N. Makris A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29207-29216Google Scholar). To identify interacting proteins, the yeast reporter strain EGY48 (Matα, ura3 trp1 his3 6LexA-operator-LEU2), in which the upstream regulatory elements of the chromosomal LEU2 gene have been replaced by six copies of the LexA operator, was co-transformed with the “bait” pEG202/LexA-BI-GST plasmid and a tomato cDNA library cloned into the pJG4-5 vector. Library cDNAs are expressed as fusions to a nuclear localization sequence, a portable transcriptional activation domain (the acid blob B42AD), and a hemag-glutinin (HA) epitope under the control of the GAL1 promoter (20Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar). Approximately 1 million transformed cells were plated on gal-raff/CM-his, trp, leu semisolid medium. Isolated library plasmids from a set of 25 growing colonies were reintroduced into the LexA-BI-GST carrying EGY48 cells and examined for their ability to grow in the absence of leucine in the medium, to confirm the interaction.Dimerization of the LeGSTUs—The highly conserved N-terminal region of BI-GST, spanning amino acids 31–114, was PCR-amplified by using primers 5′-G(↓EcoRI)AA TTC TAT GAG TAC AGA GAC GAG-3′ and 5′-C(↓XhoI)TC GAG CTA CTT CCT CCC AGA ATC ATA-3′ and directionally inserted into EcoRI/XhoI pre-digested pEG202 and pJG4-5 vectors. The C-terminal part of BI-GST, spanning the region from amino acid 103 to the end of the protein, was PCR-amplified by using primers 5′-G(↓EcoRI)AA TTC ATT GAT AAG AAG TTG TAT GAT-3′ and 5′-C(↓XhoI)TC GAG TTA TTC AAT TCC AAA CTT TTG CCT-3′ and inserted into the pEG202 and pJG4-5 vectors as above. The ability of the domains to bind to self and to each other was tested by using the two-hybrid assay.Immunoprecipitation of LeGSTU Heterodimers from Yeast Cell Extracts—The PCR-amplified full-length open reading frame of BI-GST was cloned into the pYES2.1/V5–6xHis TOPO vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The pYES2.1/BI-GST-V5–6xHis construct expresses BI-GST C-terminally fused to a V5–6xHis tag. The construct was introduced into EGY48 yeast cells together with each of the pJG4-6/LeGSTU constructs, which express the corresponding plant GST N-terminally fused to an HA tag. 5 ml of overnight cultures growing in glucose-containing media were switched into 20 ml of gal-raff/CM-his, trp and allowed to express the proteins for 4 h. At the end of the incubation, the cells were harvested, washed twice with H2O, and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and an equal volume of glass beads. The cells were disrupted by vortexing, and the cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was transferred into 5-ml polypropylene tubes and brought to 2 ml with buffer A. The lysate was supplemented with 40 μl of Ni2+-agarose and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were pelleted, washed five times with buffer A, and resuspended in 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Duplicate gels were analyzed by Western blotting. The BI-GST-V5–6xHis fusion was detected by using an antibody to the V5 epitope (Invitrogen). Co-precipitating LeGSTUs were detected by using an antibody to the HA epitope.Expression of BI-GST and LeGSTU5 in Bacteria and Purification— The pBAD/BI-GST construct has been described previously (19Kampranis S.C. Damianova R. Atallah M. Toby G. Kondi G. Tsichlis P.N. Makris A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29207-29216Google Scholar). The full-length open reading frame of BI-GST and the five novel LeGSTUs were PCR-amplified and inserted into the pCRT7/NT TOPO TA vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The pCRT7/NT constructs express an N-terminal fusion of the inserted protein to a His6 and an Xpress epitope. LeGSTU5 was also cloned into the pBAD TOPO TA vector to produce C-terminally His6- and V5-tagged proteins. Escherichia coli (BL21)-expressed proteins were purified by using the purification protocol for His6-tagged native soluble proteins by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography, described previously (58Qiagen QIAExpressionist Handbook. Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA1999Google Scholar).In Vitro Binding Assay—Purified BI-GST protein fused in the N terminus to a His6-Xpress epitope tag and LeGSTU5 protein fused in the C terminus to a V5 epitope-His6 tag were added to a 1-ml solution of urea and dithiothreitol, in order to provide a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml of each protein and 8 m urea and 2 mm dithiothreitol, respectively. The solution was incubated for 1 h to allow complete unfolding of the proteins and subsequently dialyzed into IP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). The Xpress-BI-GST fusion was immunoprecipitated, using a 1:5000 dilution of anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) and 40 μl of protein A-agarose, for 2 h at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, the beads were pelleted, washed five times with IP buffer, and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by Western blotting. The presence of LeGSTU5 in the BI-GST immunoprecipitate was detected using an antibody to the fused V5 epitope (Invitrogen).Measurement of Sensitivity to Prooxidants—Initially, survival assays were carried out to establish the minimum concentration of prooxidants required to kill ∼90% of wild-type EGY48 yeast cells. Fresh overnight cultures of EGY48 cells in gal-raff/CM were diluted to A600 = 0.5 and 100-μl aliquots were used to inoculate 20 ml of fresh gal-raff/CM medium. An aliquot was removed and diluted serially, and the dilutions were plated on nutrient-rich YPD medium. The remaining culture was supplemented with increasing concentrations of prooxidants and incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 6 h. At the end of the incubation, another aliquot was removed, and after serial dilution the cells were plated on nutrient-rich YPD medium. After 2 days, the number of colonies on the plates was enumerated, and the percentage of cell survival was determined by comparing the number of colonies before and after prooxidant treatment. The concentrations of prooxidants killing 90% of EGY48 cells were 4.5 mm H2O2, 1.25 mm tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), and 0.1 mm cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). To assess the protective effect of BI-GST and the other five LeGSTUs, cells stably expressing each of the six proteins from the corresponding pJG4-5 construct were grown in gal-raff/CM-trp medium, which selects for the stable presence of the plasmids and drives expression from the GAL1 promoter. The cells were treated with the above-mentioned concentrations of prooxidants for 6 h, and the number of surviving cells was enumerated as above. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Expression of the GSTs from the pJG4-5 vector was confirmed by Western blotting of yeast cell extracts by using an antibody against the fused HA tag.To assess the ability of the other five LeGSTUs to cooperatively enhance prooxidant survival by BI-GST, plasmid pYES2.1/BI-GST-(V5–6xHis), stably expressing the C-terminal fusion of BI-GST to a V5 epitope, was introduced together with the LeGSTU constructs described above or with pJG4-5/Tvl-1 as a negative control. Cells were grown on gal-raff/CM-ura, trp, which selects for the presence of both plasmids. For these experiments, the concentrations of prooxidants were adjusted upwards (5 mm H2O2, 1.5 mm t-BOOH, and 0.175 mm CHP), in order to kill ∼90% of the cells expressing BI-GST and the negative control protein Tvl-1. Expression of BI-GST was assessed by Western blotting of cell extracts using an antibody against the fused V5 epitope, whereas expression of the other five LeGSTUs and Tvl-1 was assessed using an antibody against the fused HA tag.Determination of Total Glutathione and Glutathione Disulfide— Wild-type EGY48 and ΔYAP1 yeast cells were grown in 100 ml of galactose-containing medium until they reached the late log phase. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in fresh medium, and treated with 4 mm H2O2 or 0.1 mm CHP for 3 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with distilled H2O, and re-pelleted. Total glutathione and glutathione disulfide were measured in equal amounts of cellular material according to the method described previously (19Kampranis S.C. Damianova R. Atallah M. Toby G. Kondi G. Tsichlis P.N. Makris A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29207-29216Google Scholar). Each determination was performed in triplicate.Enzyme Assays—1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), (2,3-dichloro-4-[2-methylene-butyryl]phenoxy)acetic acid (ethacrynic acid), 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (FDNB), CHP, reduced glutathione, glutathione reductase, and NADPH were obtained from Sigma. 4-Nitrobenzyl chloride (4NBC), 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NDB-Cl), trans-2-nonenal, and trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one were obtained from Aldrich. t-BOOH was obtained from Merck. Enzymatic activities with all substrates were determined spectrophotometrically by using a diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard 84528). For CDNB, 4NBC, ethacrynic acid, and trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one, the method described by Habig and Jakoby (21Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Google Scholar) was followed. Assays with NDB-Cl were performed according to Ricci et al. (22Ricci G. Caccuri A.M. Lo Bello M. Pastore A. Piemonte F. Federici G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 463-465Google Scholar), whereas for trans-nonenal the method of Brophy and Barrett (23Brophy P.M. Barrett J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1288-1291Google Scholar) was followed. Glutathione peroxidase assays were performed as described previously (19Kampranis S.C. Damianova R. Atallah M. Toby G. Kondi G. Tsichlis P.N. Makris A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29207-29216Google Scholar). Fluoride/chloride leaving group substitution experiments were performed at 1 mm GSH and 0.5 mm CDNB or FDNB. All assays were performed in duplicate at 25 °C.Kinetic Analysis—Initial reaction rates were determined using the spectrophotometric assay conditions described above. Reaction rates were measured at 0.1-s intervals for a total period of 15–30 s. The non-enzymatic reaction rates were subtracted from the total recorded reaction rate, and the results were expressed in s-1. For NDB-Cl and CDNB, the equilibrium constants (KGSH, KNDB-Cl, and KCDNB), the rate constant kcat, and the coupling factor α were determined by fitting the reaction rates to the bi-reactant rapid equilibrium random sequential Bi-Bi kinetic model as shown in Equation 1. ν[E]0=kcat[GSH][S]aKGSHKS+aKGSH[S]+aKS[GSH]+[GSH][S](Eq. 1) Curve fitting was performed using the programs WinCurveFit (Kevin Raner Software, Inc.), Datafit (Oakdale Engineering), and Sigma Plot (SPSS Science).pKa Determination—Assays were conducted by varying CDNB concentrations at pH values ranging from 5.0 to 8.5. The experimental data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten model, and the apparent values of kcat/Km (kcat/S0.5 in the case of LeGSTU3-3) were plotted against pH. The pKa of the enzyme-bound GSH was determined by curve fitting to Equation 2, kcatKm=(kcatKm)lim1+10(pKa−pH)(Eq. 2) Molecular Modeling—Molecular modeling was performed with the program Swiss-Model (24Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar, 25Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Google Scholar). Peptide sequences of the monomers were submitted to the Swiss-Model server in order to identify structures with sufficient similarity to perform homology modeling. BI-GST showed significant homology to TaGST4-4 and HsGSTO1-1 (39.5 and 20.0% structural identity, respectively); LeGSTU1-1 showed homology to TaGSTU4-4, HsGSTO1-1, and HsGSTZ1-1 (34.8, 19.6, and 16.7% structural identity, respectively); LeGSTU2-2 showed homology to TaG-STU4-4, HsGSTO1-1, and ZmGSTZ3-3 (42.7, 20.2, and 17.6% structural identity, respectively); LeGSTU3-3 showed homology to TaGSTU4-4, HsGSTO1-1, and AtGSTZ1-1 (36.4, 19.6, and 20.8% structural identity, respectively); LeGSTU4-4 showed homology to TaGSTU4-4, HsGSTO1-1, and AtGSTZ1-1 (36.7, 20.8, and 18.1% structural identity, respectively); and LeGSTU5-5 showed homology to TaGSTU4-4, HsGSTO1-1, and HsGSTZ1-1 (38.2, 20.9, and 19.4% structural identity, respectively). The wheat Tau class GST (Protein Data Bank code 1GWC) was selected as the template for the construction of the models. The six LeGSTU dimers were fitted to the TaGSTU4-4 dimer, in the DeepView program, using the amino acid alignment produced by Swiss-Model and depicted in Fig. 6. The fitted molecules were re-submitted to the Swiss-Model server for optimization. In this step Swiss-Model carried out an energy minimization procedure based on the GROMOS96 routine that consists of 200 rounds of steepest descent and 300 rounds of conjugate gradients. This procedure produced models with root mean square values to TaGSTU4-4 ranging from 0.65 to 1.39 Å (backbone atoms only, 424–428 amino acids).RESULTSScreening for Plant Proteins That Interact with BI-GST—To identify plant proteins that interact with BI-GST, we utilized the interaction trap version of the two-hybrid system to screen a tomato library (26Toby G.G. Golemis E.A. Methods. 2001; 24: 201-217Google Scholar). A set of 23 interacting library clones was isolated, and the cDNAs were sequenced. Nine cDNAs were found to represent independent isolates of five proteins homologous to BI-GST. These five novel GSTs, which, like BI-GST, belong to the Tau class, were termed LeGSTU1, LeGSTU2, LeGSTU3, LeGSTU4, and LeGSTU5 according to the nomenclature proposed by Edwards et al. (2Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Walbot V. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 193-198Google Scholar). An additional isolate was BI-GST itself, confirming the validity of the approach. The cDNA encoding LeGSTU2 has also been isolated as a partial clone named CTU1, which is overexpressed during plant programmed cell death (27Hoeberichts F.A. Orzaez D. van der Plas L.H. Woltering E.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 641-654Google Scholar). Most of the remaining interacting library clones represented genes that have been directly implicated in response to stress either as catalytic or regulatory molecules (LeTPx1, LeEREBP, RING-H2 finger protein, ACC oxidase, dehydration-induced ERD15), suggesting the existence of an extensive cross-talking protein network responsive to stress.The Isolated LeGSTUs Form Heterodimers between Them and with BI-GST—Glutathione S-transferases have mostly been considered to be homodimeric enzymes. However, for plant GSTs, there has been evidence for heterodimer formation in proteins purified from sorghum plants or maize proteins expressed in bacteria (4Dixon D.P. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 997-1008Google Scholar, 5Gronwald J.W. Plaisance K.L. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 877-892Google Scholar). To confirm the observed interactions, the LexA-BI-GST construct was reintroduced into yeast together with the B42AD fusions of the full-length cDNAs of the five new LeGSTUs. As shown in Fig. 1A, BI-GST strongly interacts with all five LeGSTU proteins. The two-hybrid assay was subsequently repeated in the “reverse” orientation. The full-length cDNAs of all five LeGSTU proteins were subcloned into the pEG202 vector, expressed as LexA fusion proteins, and tested against the B42AD fusion of BI-GST. Identical results were observed. Moreover, all five LeGSTUs interacted with each other when tested in all permutations using the interaction mating approach (data not shown).Fig. 1The isolated LeGSTU proteins form heterodimers with each other and with BI-GST. A, EGY48 cells carrying the LexA-BI-GST fusion with B42AD-LeGSTU1 (1), B42AD-LeGSTU2 (2), B42AD-LeGSTU3 (3), B42AD-LeGSTU4 (4), B42ADLeGST-T5 (5), and B42AD-BI-GST (6) were plated on glu/CM-his, trp, leu (left) and gal-raff/CM-his, trp, leu (right). Expression of the B42AD fusions under the GAL1 promoter enables the cells to grow in the absence of leucine, indicating specific interaction between BI-GST and the five isolated LeGSTUs. B, EGY48 cells expressing the BI-GST-(V5–6xHis) fusion protein and the HA-LeGSTU1, HA-LeGSTU2, HA-LeGSTU3, HA-LeGSTU4, HA-LeG-STU5, and HA-Tvl1 (negative control) proteins, respectively, were precipitated using Ni2+-agarose beads that have affinity for the His6 tag of the BI-GST protein. The precipitating proteins were loaded on two replicate SDS-PAGE gels, blotted, and probed with anti-HA antibody (upper gel) and with anti-V5 antibody (lower gel). BI-GST forms heterodimers in yeast cells with all homologous LeGSTUs. C, bacterially purified proteins (6xHis-Xpress)-BI-GST and LeGSTU5-(V5–6xHis) were mixed, unfolded with urea, and allowed refold to promote heterodimer formation. LeGSTU5-(V5–6xHis) was immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the V5 epitope. Western blots were probed with anti-Xpress antibody to detect (6xHis-Xpress)-BI-GST. As a positive control, BI-GST was directly loaded on the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To verify further the interactions detected, we assessed the direct binding of BI-GST to the LeGSTUs in yeast cells by co-precipitation. The full-length cDNA of BI-GST was expressed in yeast cells as a fusion to the V5 antigenic tag and a His6 sequence. EGY48 cells co-expressing BI-GST-(V5–6xHis) and the different LeGSTU molecules as HA fusions were lysed in mild detergent buffer, and His-tagged BI-GST was precipitated using Ni2+-agarose beads, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted. The presence of BI-GST was detected in replicate blots using an antibody against the V5 epitope. Co-precipitating LeGSTUs were detected using an antibody against the HA epitope. Binding of the LeGSTU proteins to BI-GST is specific, because the unrelated mammalian ankyrin protein Tvl-1 is not precipitated (Fig. 1B).To assess whether recombinant purified proteins form heterodimers in vitro, bacterially purified BI-GST fused in the N terminus to an Xpress epitope-His6 tag and LeGSTU5 fused in the C terminus to a V5 epitope-His6 tag were mixed, denatured in urea, and allowed to refold. LeGSTU5 was immunoprecipitated by using an anti-V5 antibody, and the presence of BI-GST was detected with an antibody against the Xpress epitope. BI-GST co-precipitated specifically with LeGSTU5 (Fig. 1C). To confirm that the interaction of BI-GST with the five LeGSTUs is due to heterodimerization, the dimerization domain of BI-GST (residues 31–106, as judged by the structure of a wheat Tau class enzyme by Thom et al. (28Thom R. Cummins I. Dixon D.P. Edwards R. Cole D.J. Lapthorn A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7008-7020Google Scholar), and the molecular model described below) was assessed for interaction with all five LeGSTUs by the yeast two-hybrid system. The dimerization domain of BI-GST was capable of binding all other LeGSTUs, although the strength of the interaction was weaker than that observed between two full-length proteins (data not shown).Expression of the LeGSTU Proteins in Yeast Enhances Survival Under Oxidative Stress—The model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae is ideal for investigating the properties of antioxidant enzymes, because it is a genetically well defined system and its defense responses against reactive oxygen species are well characterized (29Gasch A.P.

J. 1993; 290: 1-13Google Scholar). Screens for plant proteins conferring increased resistance to oxidative stress have identified several antioxidant proteins (31Kushnir S. Babiychuk E. Kampfenkel K.

https://openalex.org/W2095044970,"The fungus Gibberella fujikuroi is used for the commercial production of gibberellins (GAs), which it produces in very large quantities. Four of the seven GA biosynthetic genes in this species encode cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, which function in association with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases (CPRs) that mediate the transfer of electrons from NADPH to the P450 monooxygenases. Only one cpr gene (cpr-Gf) was found in G. fujikuroi and cloned by a PCR approach. The encoded protein contains the conserved CPR functional domains, including the FAD, FMN, and NADPH binding motifs. cpr-Gf disruption mutants were viable but showed a reduced growth rate. Furthermore, disruption resulted in total loss of GA3, GA4, and GA7 production, but low levels of non-hydroxylated C20-GAs (GA15 and GA24) were still detected. In addition, the knock-out mutants were much more sensitive to benzoate than the wild type due to loss of activity of another P450 monooxygenase, the detoxifying enzyme, benzoate p-hydroxylase. The UV-induced mutant of G. fujikuroi, SG138, which was shown to be blocked at most of the GA biosynthetic steps catalyzed by P450 monooxygenases, displayed the same phenotype. Sequence analysis of the mutant cpr allele in SG138 revealed a nonsense mutation at amino acid position 627. The mutant was complemented with the cpr-Gf and the Aspergillus niger cprA genes, both genes fully restoring the ability to produce GAs. Northern blot analysis revealed co-regulated expression of the cpr-Gf gene and the GA biosynthetic genes P450-1, P450-2, P450-4 under GA production conditions (nitrogen starvation). In addition, expression of cpr-Gf is induced by benzoate. These results indicate that CPR-Gf is the main but not the only electron donor for several P450 monooxygenases from primary and secondary metabolism. The fungus Gibberella fujikuroi is used for the commercial production of gibberellins (GAs), which it produces in very large quantities. Four of the seven GA biosynthetic genes in this species encode cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, which function in association with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases (CPRs) that mediate the transfer of electrons from NADPH to the P450 monooxygenases. Only one cpr gene (cpr-Gf) was found in G. fujikuroi and cloned by a PCR approach. The encoded protein contains the conserved CPR functional domains, including the FAD, FMN, and NADPH binding motifs. cpr-Gf disruption mutants were viable but showed a reduced growth rate. Furthermore, disruption resulted in total loss of GA3, GA4, and GA7 production, but low levels of non-hydroxylated C20-GAs (GA15 and GA24) were still detected. In addition, the knock-out mutants were much more sensitive to benzoate than the wild type due to loss of activity of another P450 monooxygenase, the detoxifying enzyme, benzoate p-hydroxylase. The UV-induced mutant of G. fujikuroi, SG138, which was shown to be blocked at most of the GA biosynthetic steps catalyzed by P450 monooxygenases, displayed the same phenotype. Sequence analysis of the mutant cpr allele in SG138 revealed a nonsense mutation at amino acid position 627. The mutant was complemented with the cpr-Gf and the Aspergillus niger cprA genes, both genes fully restoring the ability to produce GAs. Northern blot analysis revealed co-regulated expression of the cpr-Gf gene and the GA biosynthetic genes P450-1, P450-2, P450-4 under GA production conditions (nitrogen starvation). In addition, expression of cpr-Gf is induced by benzoate. These results indicate that CPR-Gf is the main but not the only electron donor for several P450 monooxygenases from primary and secondary metabolism."

Here, the influence of substrates on the conformation of purified complex I from Escherichia coli was studied by cross-linking and electron microscopy. When a zero-length cross-linking reagent was used, the presence of NAD(P)H, in contrast to that of NAD+, prevented the formation of cross-links between the hydrophilic subunits of the complex, including NuoB, NuoI, and NuoCD. Comparisons using different cross-linkers suggested that NuoB, which is likely to coordinate the key iron-sulfur cluster N2, is the most mobile subunit. The presence of NAD(P)H led also to enhanced proteolysis of subunit NuoG. These data indicate that upon NAD(P)H binding, the peripheral arm of the complex adopts a more open conformation, with increased distances between subunits. Single particle analysis showed the nature of this conformational change. The enzyme retains its L-shape in the presence of NADH, but exhibits a significantly more open or expanded structure both in the peripheral arm and, unexpectedly, in the membrane domain also.

NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I, EC 1.6.5.3) is the first enzyme of the mitochondrial and bacterial respiratory chains. It catalyzes the transfer of two electrons from NADH to quinone, coupled to the translocation of about four protons across the membrane (for reviews, see Refs. 1Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg.

Complex I is one of the largest known membrane protein complexes. In terms of protein content, the simplest version is the prokaryotic enzyme, which has 13-14 subunits with a combined molecular mass of about 550 kDa (5Yagi T. Yano T. DiBernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).

Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Therefore, NDH-1 represents a useful “minimal” model for the study of the structure and function of complex I. In contrast to other enzymes of the respiratory chain, the atomic structure of complex I is not known, and the mechanisms of electron transfer and proton pumping are not established.Electron microscopy has shown that both the mitochondrial and the bacterial enzymes have a characteristic L-shaped structure. One arm is embedded in the membrane and the other, the peripheral arm, protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix or bacterial cytoplasm (6Leonard K. Haiker H. Weiss H. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3032-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An alternative conformation of complex I from Escherichia coli has been proposed recently (12Bottcher B. Scheide D. Hesterberg M. Nagel-Steger L. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17970-17977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but the existence of this conformation was not confirmed in our laboratory (13Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The membrane and peripheral arms contain mainly hydrophobic and hydrophilic subunits, respectively. Dissociation of complex I by chaotropes and detergents indicates that all of the redox centers of the enzyme (FMN and up to 8-9 iron-sulfur clusters) are located in the peripheral arm (2Walker J.E. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 14Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 15Finel M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7229-7235Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). With the E. coli enzyme, the resolution of the peripheral arm into a dehydrogenase fragment containing subunits NuoE, NuoF, and NuoG, and a connecting fragment containing subunits NuoCD, NuoB, and NuoI, has been described (17Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). On the basis of further fragmentation studies, we have proposed recently a more detailed model of subunit arrangement in bacterial complex I, in particular in the membrane domain. In this model, the large hydrophobic subunits NuoL and NuoM are located in a distal part of the membrane arm, spatially separated from the redox centers of the peripheral arm (18Holt P.J. Morgan D.J. Sazanov L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43114-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Two different models for the mechanism coupling electron transfer and proton pumping in complex I are currently being discussed: direct (redox-driven) and indirect (conformation-driven) (1Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The first model employs modifications of the Q cycle and assumes that some electron carriers are located in the membrane and are directly involved in proton translocation (19Dutton P.L. Moser C.C. Sled V.D. Daldal F. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In this case, quinone-binding sites and proton-translocation machinery need to be located close to the peripheral arm with its redox centers to allow direct interaction. In the second model, the catalytic module with electron carriers is distinct from the proton-pumping module. The two modules can be spatially separated; energy transduction takes place through long range conformational changes (4Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21Brandt U. Kerscher S. Drose S. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Sazanov L.A. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Belogrudov G. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4571-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons have suggested that subunits NuoL, -M, and -N have evolved from a common ancestor related to K+ or Na+/H+ antiporters and, thus, are likely to be involved in proton translocation (1Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 105-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 25Kikuno R. Miyata T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 189: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, the distal locations for subunits NuoL and -M (18Holt P.J. Morgan D.J. Sazanov L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43114-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) would be consistent with an indirect coupling mechanism. A combination of direct and indirect mechanisms, to account for a high H+/e- ratio in complex I, has also been discussed (1Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22Sazanov L.A. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Evidence indicating conformational changes in complex I came from studies with the bovine enzyme, where the patterns of cross-linking between subunits (23Belogrudov G. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4571-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and the extent of proteolysis (26Yamaguchi M. Belogrudov G.I. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8094-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) changed significantly in the presence of NAD(P)H, but not NAD+. These data indicate that NAD(P)H binding induced significant conformational change in bovine complex I. Both NADH and NADPH bind to the FMN-containing 51-kDa subunit (NuoF homologue) (27Yamaguchi M. Belogrudov G.I. Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). They both can reduce iron-sulfur clusters of the enzyme (28Hatefi Y. Bearden A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1976; 69: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but NADPH is about 20 times less effective as a substrate (29Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Should substrate-induced conformational changes be observed in other forms of the complex, it would suggest that they are a fundamental part of the mechanism of the enzyme. However, this has not yet been demonstrated for complex I from any other organism. Furthermore, the extent and nature of any conformational changes in the context of the L-shaped structure of the enzyme are not known.Here, by using bi-functional cross-linkers with different spacer arm lengths, we have shown that upon treatment with NAD(P)H, but not with NAD+, purified complex I from E. coli adopts a more open conformation with increased distances between hydrophilic subunits. Single particle analysis of electron micrographs of complex I treated with either NAD+ or NADH has allowed us to visualize this conformational change for the first time. The enzyme retained its overall L-shape but exhibited significantly expanded structure in the presence of NADH, compared with NAD+. This difference was observed for both the peripheral domain, which was suggested by our cross-linking data, and, unexpectedly, for the membrane domain also.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dodecyl-maltoside (DDM) was purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH), Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science, Bio-scale DEAE column came from Bio-Rad, other chromatography columns were from Amersham Biosciences, piericidin A was obtained from Fluka (Gillingham, UK), and cross-linkers were from Pierce Perbio Science (Tattenhall, UK). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.Protein Purification—Complex I was purified from E. coli BL21 cells grown under limited oxygen, as described previously (13Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Purified complex I was stored in small aliquots under liquid nitrogen and used as required. Activity assays using freshly obtained piericidin A stock (Fluka) indicated that the preparation is fully sensitive to this specific inhibitor, confirming the native state of the enzyme. The IC50 for piericidin A was 10 μm in detergent solution (20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.03% DDM, 100 μm NADH, and 100 μm decyl-ubiquinone) and 4 μm in the presence of added E. coli lipids (0.25 mg/ml).Cross-linking—To establish conditions for the formation of specific cross-links between complex I subunits, a wide range of cross-linkers with different functional groups and various spacer arm lengths were surveyed. The products of cross-linking reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed either by staining with Coomassie Blue dye or by immunodetection. The concentrations of complex I and cross-linkers, as well as the times of incubation, were optimized to avoid formation of protein aggregates. The optimal concentrations of cross-linkers were in the range 0.1-0.25 mm, with a 2-h incubation at 4 °C. The protein was diluted to 0.5 mg/ml (for immunodetection) or to 1.5 mg/ml (for Coomassie Blue staining) in a buffer containing 50 mm MES and 0.2% DDM. EDTA at 2 mm was also included to avoid NuoG degradation in the presence of NAD(P)H. Control experiments have shown that patterns of cross-links did not change if, instead of EDTA, reaction mixtures contained 5 mm CaCl2 (as in buffers for single particle analysis). For reactions with EEDQ, the buffer pH was 6.0; for sulfo-SMCC, sulfo-SMPB, and BS3, the pH was 6.5, so that the pH was as close to optimal as possible for each reagent, but within the range needed for complex I to be stable (stable range, pH 5.5-6.5). Control incubations (Fig. 1) were performed in the same buffer as for EEDQ. Stocks of sulfo-SMCC, sulfo-SMPB, and BS3 were prepared in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5. Stock of EEDQ was prepared in methanol and diluted 10-fold in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, immediately prior to use. The final concentration of organic solvent in the reaction mixture was less than 2%. Cross-linkers were added last to the reaction mixtures. After incubation with cross-linkers, the reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, which contained 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.15, 40% sucrose, 4% SDS, and 50 mm dithiothreitol. Solubilized samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using pre-prepared Novex Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels containing a 10-20% acrylamide gradient (Invitrogen).Immunoblotting—For SDS-PAGE, biotin-labeled markers (Amersham Biosciences) were used as molecular mass standards. After SDS-PAGE, polypeptides were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) in a buffer containing 10 mm NaHCO3, 3 mm Na2CO3, and 0.01% SDS, in a Bio-Rad Mini-cell at 30 V for 220 min. Polyclonal antibodies against E. coli complex I subunits NuoI and NuoB were kindly provided by Prof. T. Friedrich (Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat, Freiburg, Germany) and those against Paracoccus denitrificans complex I subunits Nqo1 (NuoF analogue), Nqo2 (NuoE analogue), and Nqo5 (an analogue of the C part of NuoCD) were kindly provided by Prof. T. Yagi (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Antibodies were used at 1:20,000-1:100,000 dilution. Immunodetection was performed using anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, and the ECL kit according to its instructions (Amersham Biosciences).Electron Microscopy and Single Particle Analysis—Protein was diluted to about 20 μg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm MES 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% DDM, and either 2 mm NAD+ or 2 mm NADH. This buffer composition was shown previously to be optimal for protein stability and activity (13Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After incubation on ice for 5 min, the samples were applied to carbon-coated copper grids freshly glow-discharged in air. After a 2-min incubation, excess buffer was removed by blotting and the grid was washed twice with the same buffer containing no protein or detergent and then stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 10 s. Images were recorded with a Philips Tecnai 12 microscope operating at 120 kV and a magnification of 42,000×, on Kodak SO163 film. Electron micrographs were checked for astigmatism using an optical diffractometer. Films were digitized on a Zeiss-SCAI scanner at a 7-μm step size (corresponding to 1.67 Å at the specimen level) and demagnified by linear interpolation on the computer to obtain a pixel size corresponding to 5 Å.Single particle analysis was performed with the IMAGIC 5 software package (30van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). About 1100 particles were picked for each dataset (NAD+ and NADH) and boxed off (480 Å × 480 Å) from the micrographs. The particle images were normalized and band-pass filtered using a low frequency cut-off of (1/500) Å-1 and a high frequency cut-off of (1/15) Å-1 and centered by translational alignment to a rotationally averaged total sum. The centered particle images were grouped into 24 classes using multivariate statistical analysis. All 24 class-sum images were used as references for a multi-reference alignment, and the process was iterated until stable class-sum images were obtained. After the final iteration, aligned particle images were grouped into 24, 12, or 6 classes using multivariate statistical analysis, and class-sum images were calculated and compared.Analytical Methods—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The positions of all individual subunits of complex I on our SDS-PAGE system were determined previously by mass-spectrometry (13Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For the identification of the 120-kDa cross-linked product by mass-spectrometry, complex I was treated by sulfo-SMPB at 0.5 mm concentration and sulfo-SMCC at 2 mm. Peptide mass mapping was performed using a TofSpec 2E instrument (Micromass, Altrincham, UK) essentially as described previously (13Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Peptide mass fingerprint data were calibrated using trypsin autolysis peptides and a matrix-derived mass (13Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or with added peptide standards (renin substrate, angiotensin I, and ACTH clip 18-39, with monoisotopic molecular masses of 1296.685, 1758.933, and 2465.199 kDa, respectively) used to obtain sample masses for calibrating non-spiked data. Monoisotopic peak mass lists were screened against protein sequence databases (compiled from SwissProt), against “in-house” databases containing only E. coli complex I sequences using the ProteinProbe program (Micromass), as well as against protein sequence databases using MASCOT via a web interface (available on the World Wide Web at www.matrixscience.com).RESULTSNAD(P)H-induced Proteolysis of Subunit NuoG—Before proceeding with the study of near-neighbor relationships between subunits of E. coli complex I using cross-linking reagents, control experiments were performed in which the enzyme was incubated at 4 °C with different substrates and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Surprisingly, we found that treatment of complex I with NADH induced limited proteolysis: three major additional protein bands with apparent molecular masses of about 90, 75, and 55 kDa, as well as a minor band at about 60 kDa, appeared on SDS gels after more than 30-min incubation of complex I with NADH (Fig. 1, lane 2). The degree of proteolysis was close to maximal after 2-h incubation with NADH and was only slightly greater after 24-48 h. This proteolysis was not prevented by the addition of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Fig. 1, lane 3). It could be prevented by the addition of EDTA (Fig. 1, lane 4), but was not stimulated by the addition of CaCl2 (Fig. 1, lane 5). The addition of NAD+, adenine nucleotides ADP or ATP, or the SH-reducing agent dithiothreitol, did not lead to proteolysis (Fig. 1, lanes 6-9). Only trace amounts of possibly similar high molecular mass degradation products or impurities could be observed without the addition of NADH (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 6-9). Addition of complex I inhibitors rotenone and piericidin A, quinone analogue decyl-ubiquinone (all at 100 μm), or the reducing agent sodium dithionite at 10 mm did not lead to proteolysis either (data not shown). However, the addition of NADPH led to effects similar to those of NADH (Fig. 1, lane 10). If NADH was added together with an excess amount of artificial electron acceptor K3Fe(CN)6 sufficient to oxidize all NADH through complex I, proteolysis was not observed (data not shown). These data indicate that proteolysis is likely to be catalyzed by an unidentified metalloprotease, present presumably at a very low level in the preparation, and that proteolysis is induced only when complex I is reduced by NAD(P)H. The reason why only a fraction of NuoG is degraded is not clear, but this may be due to product inhibition of the protease. Interestingly, in the presence of calcium, the mobility on SDS gels of subunits NuoF, -L, -M, and -N clearly changed (Fig. 1, lane 5), indicating that these subunits might bind calcium. Such gel mobility shifts for calcium-binding proteins have been observed previously (31Hammarberg T. Radmark O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).The 90- and 75-kDa proteolytic bands can originate only from the higher molecular mass subunit NuoG. Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies against E. coli complex I subunits NuoB and NuoI, as well as P. denitrificans complex I subunits Nqo1 (NuoF analogue), Nqo2 (NuoE analogue), and Nqo5 (an analogue of the C part of NuoCD subunit) did not reveal any degradation products of these subunits after incubation of complex I with NADH (data not shown). This indicated that the 60- and 55-kDa bands are not likely to have originated from NuoCD, but rather from NuoG. This was supported by mass spectrometry analysis using peptide mass mapping after in-gel tryptic digestion. For the weaker 60-kDa band, 13 peptides were matched to NuoG (22% coverage), and for the stronger 55-kDa band, 20 peptides were matched to NuoG (33% coverage). Interestingly, the peptide matches for the 55-kDa band all came from the C-terminal half of the sequence (covering residues 410-827), indicating that the N-terminal part of NuoG may be more susceptible to proteolysis. In accordance with these identifications, the observed amount of intact subunit NuoG decreased in the presence of NADH, as judged from its relative density on Coomassie-stained gels (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3 as compared with lanes 1 and 4). Thus, binding of NAD(P)H to subunit NuoF, followed by reduction of complex I and its iron-sulfur clusters, likely led to a more open conformation of subunit NuoG or its surroundings, making it more susceptible to proteolysis than in the presence of NAD+ or without any added substrates.Cross-linking of Complex I Subunits in the Presence of Substrates—Two water-soluble hetero-bifunctional reagents, which link amines to sulfhydryls, were found to be effective in producing specific cross-links. They are sulfo-SMCC (N-sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, a 11.6 Å linker) and sulfo-SMPB (N-sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(p-maleimidophenyl)butyrate, a 14.5 Å linker). The homo-bifunctional reagent BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate, a 11.4 Å linker), which links amines together, proved effective also, as did EEDQ (N-(ethoxycarbonyl)-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline, no spacer arm). This “zero-length” reagent links carboxyl groups to nucleophilic side chains of polypeptides that are in direct contact with each other.The effects of sulfo-SMCC and sulfo-SMPB were broadly similar, with data obtained for sulfo-SMCC shown in Fig. 2A. As can be seen from the Coomassie-stained gel, a major additional protein band of about 120 kDa was observed in the presence of cross-linker, and the pattern did not change significantly upon addition of NAD+ or NAD(P)H. Immunoblotting of identical gels with antibodies against NuoI and Nqo5 (NuoCD) indicated that the 120-kDa band contains these subunits (Fig. 2A). This conclusion was confirmed by mass-spectrometry analysis using peptide mass mapping after in-gel tryptic digestion of the 120-kDa band. We obtained 19 peptides with matching masses (44% coverage) for subunit NuoCD and 4 matching peptides for subunit NuoI (21% coverage). When sulfo-SMPB was used, analysis of the similar 120-kDa band showed 28 matching peptides (59% coverage) for subunit NuoCD and the same 4 peptides for NuoI. As the total molecular mass of NuoCD+NuoI is about 89 kDa, it is likely that an additional subunit was cross-linked to NuoCD and NuoI. Immunoblotting of identical gels with antibodies against Nqo1 (NuoF) and Nqo2 (NuoE) did not reveal any cross-linked products (data not shown), whereas the NuoB antibody recognized different cross-linked products (see below). The molecular mass of NuoG is too high for it to be a component of the 120-kDa (NuoCD+NuoI) band. Therefore, it is likely that the additional subunit in this cross-linked product, not detected by mass-spectrometry, is hydrophobic. Hydrophobic Nuo subunits are not readily identified by peptide mass mapping (13Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The additional subunit may be NuoH (36 kDa), judging from its molecular mass and likely proximity to the peripheral arm (18Holt P.J. Morgan D.J. Sazanov L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43114-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The apparent small shift in molecular mass of NuoI in the presence of cross-linkers might indicate a modification of this subunit, such as an internal cross-link.Fig. 2Cross-linking of complex I subunits with sulfo-SMCC and BS3. Purified complex I was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C either with 0.25 mm sulfo-SMCC (A) or with 0.2 mm BS3 (B). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed either by Coomassie Blue staining or by immunodetection with antibodies against subunits NuoB, NuoI, and Nqo5 (NuoCD), as indicated.

The identity of the subunit(s) cross-linked to NuoB in this high molecular mass band remains to be established, but it is likely to be a subunit to which antibodies were not available (namely NuoG and all the hydrophobic subunits). A cross-linked product of NuoB and NuoI was detected weakly at ∼45 kDa, but this was more obvious with other cross-linkers (see below). Another weak band was observed at about 150 kDa with both NuoB and NuoI antibodies and may correspond to a cross-linked product of NuoB, NuoI, and another unidentified subunit(s).These data confirmed the spatial proxim"

Here, we show the involvement of two exoribonucleases, AtmtPNPase and AtmtRNaseII, in the 3′ processing of atp9 mRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana mitochondria. Down-regulation of AtmtPNPase results in the accumulation of pretranscripts of several times the size of mature atp9 mRNAs, indicating that 3′ processing of these transcripts is performed mainly exonucleolytically by AtmtPNPase. This enzyme is however not sufficient to completely process atp9 mRNAs, because with down-regulation of another mitochondrial exoribonuclease, AtmtRNaseII, about half of atp9 transcripts exhibit short 3′ nucleotide extensions compared with mature mRNAs. These short extensions can be efficiently removed by AtmtRNaseII in vitro. Taken together, these results show that 3′ processing of atp9 mRNAs in Arabidopsis mitochondria is, at least, a two-step phenomenon.

Of these, ORF1 encodes the viral nonstructural polyprotein; ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein and ORF3 codes for a phosphoprotein of undefined function. Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human cDNA liver library we have isolated, an N-terminal deleted protein, α1 -microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP) that specifically interacts with the ORF3 protein of HEV. Independently cloned, full-length AMBP was obtained and tested positive for interaction with ORF3 using a variety of in vivo and in vitro techniques. AMBP, a liver-specific precursor protein codes for two different unrelated proteins α1-microglobulin (α1m) and bikunin. α1 m individually interacted with ORF3. The above findings were validated by COS-1 cell immunoprecipitation, His6 pull-down experiments, and co-localization experiments followed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. Human liver cells showing co-localization of ORF3 with endogenously expressing α1 m showed a distinct disappearance of the protein from the Golgi compartment, suggesting that ORF3 enhances the secretion of α1m out of the hepatocyte. Using drugs to block the secretory pathway, we showed that α m was not degraded in the presence of ORF3. Finally, 1pulse labeling of α1m showed that its secretion was expedited out of the liver cell at faster rates in the presence of the ORF3 protein.

ORF2, a 88-kDa glycoprotein, is expressed intracellularly as well as on the cell surface and is the major capsid protein for HEV. It is synthesized as a precursor that is processed through signal sequence cleavage into the mature protein, which is capable of self-association (15Khudyakov Y.E. Khudyakova N.S. Fields H.A. Jue D.

These properties of ORF3 clearly indicate that this protein may have multiple roles in HEV pathogenesis. To delineate the functions of this viral protein, studies were conducted to screen and characterize ORF3-interacting host proteins from a human liver cDNA library. Since a few years of its introduction, the yeast two-hybrid system has proven invaluable for studying physical interactions between genetically defined partners, for identifying contacts among the subunits of multiprotein complexes (22Chien C.T.

In this system, two plasmid-borne gene fusions are co-transformed into yeast cells, and the interaction between these two fusion proteins is measured by the reconstitution of a functional transcriptional activator that triggers the expression of reporter genes lacZ and HIS3. Using this system we have isolated an interacting partner from the human liver cDNA library, for the ORF3 protein of HEV. This interaction partner is α1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP), a liver-specific precursor protein. This interaction was verified using an independently cloned full-length AMBP gene, obtained from another laboratory and tested for positive interaction with ORF3, using yeast two-hybrid techniques and in vitro binding experiments. AMBP gets processed in the trans-Golgi region to give α1-microglobulin (α1m) and bikunin, which are then secreted by the liver cells in free and bound forms. The processed protein, α1m, was individually tested for interaction with ORF3 using the yeast two-hybrid approach, in vitro binding, immunoprecipitation, and FRET. Dual-labeling immunofluorescent staining followed by fluorescence microscopy in human liver cells showed co-localization of the ORF3 protein with α1m; however, at 46–48 h post-transfection, the perinuclear localization of α1m disappeared from the cells. Experiments on subcellular localization of α1m and using drugs that block the secretion pathway of α1m, we showed in transfected hepatocytes, an ORF3-dependent increase in the export of α1m from the Golgi compartment. Finally, using pulse-labeled α1m, we have conclusively proved this observation. The biological significance of this interaction and the possible role for the accelerated export of α1m in HEV-infected hepatocytes is discussed.

The host strain containing pGBT9-ORF3 and pGAD424-ORF3 was used as a positive control (20Tyagi S. Jameel S. Lal S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The GAL4 activation domain fusion, human liver cDNA library was purchased from Clontech. The number of independent clones, as mentioned by the manufacturer, was 1 × 106. The average size of the cDNA insert ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 kb. The cDNA library was repeatedly transformed with the BD-ORF3 construct and transformants thus obtained were screened for Leu+Trp+ phenotype. The Y190 host contains integrated copies of both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under the control of GAL4 binding sites. This yeast strain, was co-transformed with the appropriate plasmids, using the lithium acetate procedure and grown on SD plates lacking Trp and Leu (SDTrp–Leu–). Protein interaction was tested on SD plates lacking Leu, Trp, and His (SDLeu–Trp–His–). After 3 days at 30 °C, individual colonies were streaked out and tested for liquid and filter-lift β-galactosidase activity, 50 mm 3-amino-1,2,3-trizole assay and for diploids showing His+ phenotype, using standard yeast two-hybrid procedures. The filter β-galactosidase assay was performed by streaking doubly transformed yeast colonies onto filter paper and allowing them to grow for 2 days on selection medium. Yeast was permeabilized by freezing yeast-impregnated filters in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature. This filter was placed over a second filter that was pre-soaked in a 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 300 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and 0.27% β-mercaptoethanol. Filters were left for 48 h to develop a blue color, which indicated a positive protein-protein interaction. The liquid β-galactosidase activity, a parameter directly reflecting the strength of protein-protein interactions, was determined using the substrate CPRG assay as described previously (16Tyagi S.

Relative β-galactosidase activity for quantitative assays were corrected for yeast cell number and are the mean ± S.E. of triplicate assays. Appropriate positive/negative controls and buffer blanks were used. The specificity of the in vivo protein-protein interaction was confirmed using a yeast genetic assay for reconfirming positive two-hybrid interactions (28Tyagi S. Lal S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs were extracted from the positive Y190 co-transformants, separated, and verified using E. coli HB101 cells on M9 synthetic media lacking Leu. Subsequently, these plasmids were singly transformed into the PJ69-4a and PJ69-4α haploid yeast strains (29James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After genetic crossing, the His3 prototrophy of the diploid strains was tested by plating for growth on SDHis– media. All possible control transformations were conducted and were verified to be negative for His3 prototrophy. In Vitro Transcription/Translation Assay—The full-length ORF3 protein (pSG-HisORF3, encoding 123 amino acids and ORF3 with an N-terminal His6 tag) and radiolabeled 35[S]methionine proteins (AMBP, R352, and α1m; described in Table I) were expressed in separate reactions using a coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system; Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The unlabeled ORF3 protein was bound to Ni-NTA beads (Amersham Biosciences) and washed thrice with PBS (pH 7.4). The [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were then added to the same tube and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The beads were washed three times with PBS, resuspended in 25 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) and boiled for 4 min to dissociate the bound proteins. Aliquots (10 μl) of the supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the 35[S]methionine-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Transfection and Labeling of Cultured Cells—Human hepatoma (Huh7) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 μg of gentamicin per ml. Cells were transfected at about 50% confluency with plasmid DNA by using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. For each 60-mm diameter culture dish, 2.5 μg of DNA and 10 μl of Lipofectin were used in 1.2 ml of DMEM without serum or antibiotics, and DNA uptake allowed to proceed for 6 h at 37 °CinaCO2 incubator. Forty hours post-transfection, cells were washed with 3 ml of methionine-deficient DMEM (Invitrogen) and metabolically labeled with 35[S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences), with each 60-mm diameter plate receiving 100 μCi of label in 1 ml of methionine-deficient DMEM. After 4 h of labeling, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested for further analysis. Immunoprecipitation—Transfected, PBS-washed Huh7 cells were harvested directly in 0.5 ml of GST binding buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 180 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) after incubation on ice for 15 min. Lysates were clarified at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated on ice for 1 h with 5 μl of rabbit antiserum. To this 100 μl of a 10% suspension of binding buffer-washed protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the mixture was incubated with constant shaking at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed five times, each time with 0.5 ml of GST buffer, after being centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 s. Washed beads were resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 100 °C for 4 min, centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or fluorography. For detection of α1m, human hepatoma (Huh7) cells were mock transfected with vector only or with a ORF3-expressing plasmid and allowed to grow for 39 h following which they were starved in cysteine methionine-deficient medium for 1 h. These cells were labeled with 100 μCi of 35S Promix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 1 ml of cysteine– methionine– medium for 1 h. The secreted α1m was detected by direct immunoprecipitation of the growth medium, and the intracellular α1m level was detected by lysing the cells as described above. Pulse-chase Analysis—Forty-four hours post-transfection, Huh7 cells were starved in cysteine– methionine– medium for 1 h. These cells were subsequently supplemented with 200 μCi of 35S Promix in 1 ml of cysteine– methionine– medium for 5 min. The cells were washed in PBS and chased in complete medium for respective time periods. Immunoprecipitation was conducted as described above. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Huh7 cells were plated at a confluency of about 50% on coverslips a day before the transfection and grown for 18 h. 40 h post-transfection (or as specified), the PBS-washed cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, permeabilized with 100% methanol at –20 °C for 3 min and then rehydrated with PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with appropriately diluted primary antibodies in PBS/0.5% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 1% normal goat serum for 2 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies used were: monoclonal anti-ORF3 at 1:200 dilution, polyclonal anti-α1m at 1:1000 dilution, or anti-bikunin at 1:500 dilution. Cells were washed thrice with PBS for 5 min each and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:1000 dilution of conjugated secondary antibodies. For co-localization experiments, the secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to either Alexa594 (red) or Alexa488 (green) dyes (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The secondary antibodies used for labeling ORF3, α1m or bikunin, are specified in individual experiments. For localization studies using different organelle markers, fluorescent protein-expressing constructs were transfected alone or with pSGORF3, Ds-Red that was targeted to ER (ER Ds-Red), Ds-Red that was targeted to mitochondria (Mito Ds-Red), yellow fluorescent fusion protein targeted to the Golgi apparatus (YFP-Golgi) were obtained from Clontech. For experiments using Brefeldin A and monensin, these drugs were added 1 h before fixing the cells. The final concentration used was 10 μg/ml for Brefeldin A and 5 μm for monensin. Cells were processed as earlier and mounted in 90% glycerol in PBS. Fluorescence images were collected using a 60× planapo objective in a Bio-Rad 1024 LSM attached to a Nikon inverted microscope. To prevent cross-talk in dual labeling experiments, only one dye was excited at a time, keeping the other channel completely closed. The images were processed using Confocal Assistant followed by Adobe Photoshop version 5.0. FRET Analysis—COS-1 cells were plated on coverslips and transfected with Lipofectin as described above with expression vectors for the ECFP-ORF3 and EYFP-α1m fusion proteins. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, the coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and washed once again in PBS. These were then mounted using Antifade (Bio-Rad) and sealed with silicon sealant. A planapo 60× numerical aperture/1.4 oil immersion objective (Nikon, Japan) with a 2100 Radiance Unit confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) was used for all experiments. Confocal images were acquired sequentially using the 457-nm (ECFP) and the 514-nm (EYFP) laser lines of the argon laser. Images of the ECFP emission were collected using a 500 DCLPXR dichroic mirror with an HQ 485/30 emission filter. The EYFP emission images were collected using a 560 DCLPXR dichroic mirror with an HQ 545/40 emission filter. FRET was detected using the acceptor photobleaching approach as follows. Cells expressing the ECFP and EYFP fusion proteins were first imaged sequentially, followed by specific photobleaching of the acceptor fluorophore (EYFP) by 10–15 min of continuous illumination with the 514-nm laser line at 500 lines per second speed with a 80% laser intensity to ensure complete photobleaching of EYFP. At the end of 15 min, cells were imaged once again. Laser Pix 2000 software (Bio-Rad) was used for quantitating the mean fluorescence intensity of ECFP emission in areas of co-localization before and after photobleaching of EYFP. Change in mean fluorescence intensity before and after photobleaching of areas where the two proteins did not co-localize served as an internal control. The increase in ECFP emission, which is a direct measure of FRET efficiency, was calculated as E% = [1–(ECFP emission before EYFP photobleach/ECFP emission after EYFP photobleach)] × 100. For presentation, the original images were processed using Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Screening of the Human Liver cDNA Library for Cellular Proteins That Interact with ORF3—Although the function of the ORF3 protein of HEV is yet unknown, preliminary indications clearly point to its involvement in various cellular pathways and functions (16Tyagi S.

To identify the cellular proteins that might interact with the ORF3 protein, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human liver cDNA library. Full-length ORF3, fused in-frame to the GAL4 binding domain in pAS2 vector, was used as “bait” to screen the cDNA library, which contained in-frame fusions with the GAL4 activation domain cloned into the pACT2 vector. The plasmids, containing the BD-ORF3 fusion (pAS2-ORF3) and the liver library activation domain fusion (pACT2-LL) DNA, were co-transformed into the yeast host strain (Y190) and selected for growth on SDLeu–Trp– plates for co-transformants. Colonies, thus obtained, were then tested for His+ prototrophy. Out of 6 × 104 Leu+Trp+ transformants, 1 × 102 transformants showed His+ β-gal+ phenotype. These interacting clones (His+ and β-gal+) were divided into four groups depending on their restriction analysis (data not shown). For this study, two clones from the group showing the strongest His+ and β-gal+ phenotype were selected. Activation domain plasmids from these two clones showed identical restriction digestion patterns (data not shown). Results of yeast two-hybrid studies on these two identical interacting clones are shown in Fig. 1A. All appropriate positive and negative controls were used as shown. Cells transformed with the vector alone did not activate the HIS3 gene. Similarly AD alone transformed with BD-ORF3 did not show growth on SDLeu–Trp–His– plates. This showed that the His+ phenotype and β-galactosidase+ phenotype was specific to the interacting proteins. Liquid β-galactosidase activity was determined for the positive clones along with all appropriate negative and positive controls using the substrate chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside, as shown in Fig. 1B. The AD-LL interacting plasmid was isolated using standard yeast two-hybrid techniques. The interaction was verified using the genetic yeast two-hybrid approach (28Tyagi S. Lal S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our genetic crosses of the haploid strains, containing singly transformed putative interacting fusion partners BD-ORF3 and AD-LL, resulted in diploids containing both interacting plasmids and showed positive His3 reporter gene activity (Fig. 1C). The interacting plasmid AD-LL was digested using restriction enzymes, and the insert size was estimated at 1.1 kb. This 1.1-kb insert was sequenced from one end, and the sequence obtained was subjected to the NCBI-BLAST search. This revealed a 100% homology with a gene encoding α1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMB"

We previously reported that the formation of this APP-X11L-Alc tripartite complex suppresses the metabolic cleavages of APP. We show here that the metabolism of the Alcs markedly resembles that of APP. The Alcs are subjected to a primary cleavage event that releases their extracellular domain. Alcs then undergo a secondary presenilin-dependent γ-cleavage that leads to the secretion of the amyloid β-protein-like peptide and the liberation of an intracellular domain fragment (AlcICD). However, when Alc is in the tripartite complex, it escapes from these cleavages, as does APP. We also found that AlcICD suppressed the FE65-dependent gene transactivation activity of the APP intracellular domain fragment, probably because AlcICD competes with the APP intracellular domain fragment for binding to FE65. We propose that the Alcs and APP are coordinately metabolized in neurons and that their cleaved cytoplasmic fragments are reciprocally involved in the regulation of FE65-dependent gene transactivation. Any imbalance in the metabolism of Alcs and APP may influence the FE65-dependent gene transactivation, which together with increased secretion of amyloid β-protein may contribute to neural disorders.

Nature. 2003; 426: 900-904Google Scholar). Amyloid β-protein precursor (APP) is the precursor of Aβ. It has a receptor-like transmembrane protein structure that consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain (2Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of APP controls its metabolism and various physiological functions by interacting with cytoplasmic adaptor proteins (3Borg J.-P. Yang Y. De Taddeo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Google Scholar, 4Russo T. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Zambrano N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 1-7Google Scholar, 5Tomita S. Ozaki T.

Iijima K. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40353-40361Google Scholar). One of these adaptor proteins is X11L (the X11-like protein), which associates with the cytoplasmic domain of APP and stabilizes APP metabolism (5Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Google Scholar, 9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar). During our previous research that aimed to reveal the molecular mechanism by which X11L regulates APP metabolism, we found that the Alcadeins, which form cadherin-related membrane protein family, are X11- and X11L-binding proteins (9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar). These proteins are also known as calsyntenins, which were originally isolated as postsynaptic Ca2+-binding membrane proteins, but whose functions were not identified (10Vogt L. Schrimpf S.P. Meskenaite V. Frischknecht R. Kinter J. Leone D.P. Ziegler U. Sonderegger P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 151-166Google Scholar, 11Hintsch G. Zurlinden A. Meskenaite V. Steuble M. Fink-Widmer K. Kinter J. Sonderegger P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 393-409Google Scholar). The Alcadeins (Alcs) consist of two Alcα isoforms (Alcα1 and Alcα2) and Alcβ and Alcγ, all of which are type I transmembrane proteins and contain a conserved X11L-binding motif in their single cytoplasmic domains, similar to APP (9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar).Alc does not directly interact with the cytoplasmic domain of APP. Rather, the association between the two molecules is bridged by the phosphotyrosine interaction domain of X11L. This results in the formation of a tripartite complex in the brain (9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar). The formation of this complex enhances the X11L-mediated stabilization of APP metabolism and suppresses the generation of Aβ. Through its interaction with X11L, Alc also forms another tripartite complex with a carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP (CTF) that resulted from its cleavage at the α- and/or β-sites. The Alc-X11L-CTFβ complex promotes the X11L-dependent inhibition of the γ-secretase cleavage of the CTFβ because the complexing of CTFβ interferes with its interaction with presenilin (PS) (9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that APP and Alc co-localize in neurons (9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar) and that calsyntenin-1 is extracellularly cleaved (10Vogt L. Schrimpf S.P. Meskenaite V. Frischknecht R. Kinter J. Leone D.P. Ziegler U. Sonderegger P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 151-166Google Scholar). This suggests that APP and Alc may be metabolized in a coordinated fashion by a secretase(s).In the present study, we found that, like APP, the Alcs are cleaved by the PS-dependent γ-secretase after a primary cleavage in their extracellular juxtamembrane region. These cleavages lead to the secretion of an Aβ-like short peptide (β-Alc) and liberate the intracellular domain of Alc (AlcICD). AlcICD down-regulates the gene transactivation ability of the APP intracellular domain (AICD). These observations suggest that APP and Alc are coordinately metabolized to regulate the gene transactivation ability of APP. This indicates that these two proteins play an important role in neural functions. Impairment of the coordinated metabolic regulation of APP and Alc and the consequent loss of the reciprocal regulation by APP and Alc in the gene transactivation may lead to neural disorders and disease progression in AD.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Construction—Human Alcadein cDNAs were inserted into pcDNA3 vector to construct pcDNA3-hAlcα1, pcDNA3-hAlcβ, and pcDNA3-hAlcγ as previously described (9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar). The FLAG sequence was inserted between Leu38 and Glu39 of hAlcα1cDNA (pcDNA3-FLAG-hAlcα1) and between Ile41 and Glu42 of hAlcβcDNA (pcDNA3-FLAG-hAlcβ), whereas the HA sequence was inserted between Ile44 and Glu45 of hAlcγcDNA (pcDNA3-HA-hAlcγ). The amino acids between Glu39 and Ala815 of pcDNA3-FLAG-hAlcα1 was deleted to produce pcDNA3-AlcαΔE. The pcDNA3-PS1 and pcDNA3-PS1D385A (12De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Google Scholar), pcDNA3APP695 (13Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19304-19310Google Scholar), and pcDNA3-hX11L (5Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Google Scholar) plasmids have been described previously. cDNAs encoding human AICD (residues 652–695 of human APP695) and human AlcαICD (residues 871–971 of human Alcα1) were produced by PCR, and the products bearing the linker sequence encoding EFPGIPPG at their 5′-end were cloned into the pBIND vector (Promega) at the KpnI/BamHI sites. This generated pBIND-Gal4BD-AICD and pBIND-Gal4BD-AlcαICD, which encode fusion protein composed of Gal4BD linked to AICD or AlcαICD. The same procedure was used to generate the pBIND-Gal4BD-AlcαICD/NPAA plasmid, which expresses a mutant hAlcαICD molecule in which Asn903 and Pro904 were substituted by Ala. The AlcαICD and AlcαICD/NPAA cDNAs followed by the signal peptide sequence composed of 28 amino acid residues were also inserted into pcDNA3 to produce pcDNA3-hAlcαICD and pcDNA3-hAlcαICD/NPAA. FE65 cDNA (8Ando K. Iijima K. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40353-40361Google Scholar) was inserted into pcDNA3.1 at the NheI/NotI sites to generate pcDNA3.1NFLAG-FE65. This construct produces FE65 bearing a FLAG tag at its amino terminus.Antibodies—The anti-Alcα polyclonal rabbit antibody UT83 has been described (9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar). The anti-Alcβ polyclonal rabbit antibody UT99 was raised against a peptide composed of Cys plus the sequence between positions 951 and 968 of human Alcβ (C+DSPSSDERRIIETPPHRY). The anti-Alcγ polyclonal rabbit antibody UT105 was raised against a peptide composed of Cys plus the sequence between positions 938 and 955 of human Alcγ (C+QNGARQAQLEWDDSTLPY). These Alc-specific antibodies all recognize the cytoplasmic domain of the Alc proteins to which they had been raised. As a result, they recognized the full-length Alc protein, the CTF1 derived from Alc, and AlcICD. These antibodies did not react with other Alc proteins apart from the one to which they had been raised. The anti-APP cytoplasmic G369 antibody has been described (14Oishi M. Nairn A.C. Czernik A.J. Lim G.S. Isohara T. Gandy S.M. Greengard P. Suzuki T. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 111-123Google Scholar), and another anti-APP antibody was purchased from Sigma (catalog number A8717). The anti-X11L (mint2; BD Biosciences), anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Applied Science), anti-PS1 amino-terminal fragment (PS-NTF; Chemicon International), and anti-PS1 carboxyl-terminal fragment (PS-CTF; Chemicon International) antibodies were purchased.In Vitro Generation of AlcICD—The cells were homogenized in 8 volumes of buffer A (10 mm triethanolamine-acetic acid buffer, pH 7.8, 0.25 m sucrose) containing 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain the membrane fraction (15Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Google Scholar). The membrane fraction was resuspended in buffer A containing 5 μg/ml chymostatin and 5 μg/ml leupeptin and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated periods in the presence or absence of 1 μm L-685,458, an aspartic protease inhibitor (Calbiochem). These samples were separated by electrophoresis through a Tris-Tricine gel (15% (w/v) polyacrylamide) and subjected to Western blotting.Western Blot Assays—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (∼1 × 107 cells) were transfected as described previously (9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar) with the indicated amounts of various combination of plasmids. The cells were harvested and lysed in Hepes-buffered saline with Triton X-100 (HBST; 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin). The cell lysate or immunoprecipitates were separated on Tris-glycine or Tris-Tricine gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with specific antibodies. PS1-deficient, PS1- and PS2-deficient, and wild type fibroblast cells (16Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Google Scholar) were also transfected by the same procedure.Protein Sequence Analysis—Alcα1 and its CTF1 fragment were separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The proteins corresponding Alcα1 and CTF1 on the membrane were cut off and then subjected to the gas phase protein sequencer Procise 492HT (Applied Biosystems).Immunostaining of Cells—HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-FE65 and AlcαICD were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 4% (w/v) sucrose, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and incubated with the anti-FLAG monoclonal M2 antibody (1:500 dilution) and the anti-Alcα polyclonal antibody UT83 (0.8 μg/ml IgG). After washing, the cells were further incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 or goat anti-mouse IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 546 antibody. The cells were viewed using the confocal laser scanning microscope LSM510 (Carl Zeiss).Gene Transactivation Assay—The indicated cells (∼3 × 104 cells) plated in 96-multiwell plate were transiently transfected with various combinations of the following plasmids in LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen): pBIND-Gal4BD-AICD or pBIND-Gal4BD-AlcαICD (20 ng), pG5luc (600 ng) (Promega), and pcDNA3.1NFLAG-FE65 or pcDNA3.1NFLAG vector (40 ng) in the presence or absence of pcDNA3-hAlcαICD or pcDNA3-hAlcαICD/NPAA. To standardize the plasmid amount, pcDNA3 or pBIND-Gal4 vector (-) was added (to yield 0.7 μg of plasmid in total). In a separate study, pBIND-APP695-Gal4BD was used instead of pBIND-Gal4BD-AICD. The cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, and the transcriptional activity of the reporter gene was analyzed by using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega). All of the combinations were tested in triplicate, and the luciferase activity was normalized according to the manufacturer's protocol to eliminate the effect of transfection efficiency differences.RESULTSAlcs Are Metabolized in a Similar Manner to APP and Are Novel Substrates for PS-dependent γ-Secretase—We previously reported that Alc and APP form a tripartite complex by cytoplasmic interactions with X11L, that the three proteins colocalize in neurons, and that tripartite complex formation stabilizes APP metabolism (9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar). Alcs are type I membrane proteins, as is APP, and a previous report has suggested that the Alc/calsyntenin proteins are cleaved extracellularly (10Vogt L. Schrimpf S.P. Meskenaite V. Frischknecht R. Kinter J. Leone D.P. Ziegler U. Sonderegger P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 151-166Google Scholar). These observations led us to speculate that the Alcs are metabolized in a similar manner to APP.It is now well understood that APP is first cleaved at major α- and minor β-sites in its extracellular juxtamembrane region and that this releases the large extracellular amino-terminal domain (sAPPα/β) and generates the intracellular carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFα/β) (17Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Google Scholar). We first examined whether the Alcs also undergo cleavage at a primary site that generates a large extracellular amino-terminal domain (sAlc) and a short cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF1). Thus, FLAG-Alcα1, FLAG-Alcβ, and HA-Alcγ were overexpressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, B–D, middle lanes), as was APP (Fig. 1A, middle lane). The cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies (Cell). The sAlcs and sAPP were also recovered from the medium by immunoprecipitation with tag-specific antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting with the same antibody (Medium). The ∼30-kDa CTF1 for Alcα and Alcγ and the ∼21-kDa CTF1 for Alcβ were detected in the cell lysates along with the intact Alc proteins. At the same time, the sAlc fragments were detected in the medium. Thus, the Alcs are cleaved by a primary cleavage event, similar to APP.The APP CTFs are secondarily cleaved at γ- and/or ϵ-sites by the γ-secretase complex, which results in the secretion of p3 or Aβ and releases the AICD (18Sato T. Dohmae N. Qi Y. Kakuda N. Misonou H. Mitsumori R. Maruyama H. Koo E.H. Hass C. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Ishiura S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24294-24301Google Scholar). It is now well documented that the APP CTFs accumulate in the cell in the presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 (Fig. 1A) (19Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Google Scholar). This suggests that use of L-685,458 may help to determine whether other type I membrane proteins can be cleaved by γ-secretase. Thus, we assessed whether the Alcs proteins are γ-secretase substrates by using L-685,458. In the cells expressing Alcα1 or Alcγ, the intracellular levels of CTF1 increased dramatically in the presence of L-685,458 (Fig. 1, B and D, compare right and middle lanes). This suggests that Alcα and Alcγ are potential substrates of γ-secretase, as is APP (in Fig. 1A, compare right and middle lanes). In contrast, the intracellular levels of the CTF1 of Alcβ did not change in the presence of L-685,458 (Fig. 1C, compare right and middle lanes). This may indicate that Alcβ is not a substrate of the L-685,458-sensitive protease. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the CTF1 of Alcβ may be further cleaved by an L-685,458-insensitive protease (as suggested by the data in Fig. 3). The production of the sAlcs was not largely altered by L-685,458 treatment (Fig. 1, B–D, bottom panels). This indicates that the inhibitor does not affect the primary cleavage event of Alcs. These observations support the notion that γ-cleavage of Alcs follows their primary cleavage, which is very similar to how APP is metabolized.Fig. 3Generation of AlcICD by γ-secretase in vitro and characterization of Alcα metabolites in the brain. A, generation of AlcICD. HEK293 cells (∼3 × 106 cells) were transfected with pcDNA3-hAlcα1 (top panel, +), pcDNA3-hAlcβ (middle panel, +), pcDNA3-hAlcγ (bottom panel, +) or pcDNA3 (-) (3 μg), and their membrane fractions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 or 3 h in the presence (+) or absence (-) of L-685,458 (1 μm). The cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-Alcα UT83 (top panel), the anti-Alcβ UT99 (middle panel), or the anti-Alcγ UT105 (bottom panel) antibodies. B, presence of endogenous AlcαCTF1 and ICD fragments in the mouse brain. Mouse brain tissue was homogenized in HBST, and the lysate (25 μg of protein) was analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-Alcα antibody UT83. The lower panel indicates a longer exposure (Long exp) of the film. The asterisks may indicate a glycosylated form of CTF1 (see text). The numbers refer to the molecular masses (kDa) of the protein standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We also showed that Alc is cleaved by a PS-dependent γ-secretase. The γ-secretase complex is composed of at least PS, Nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2, and PS is an essential component for γ-secretase activity (20Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L.

Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Google Scholar). We examined the generation of the CTF1 molecules from endogenous Alcα1 protein by PS1-deficient, PS1- and PS2-deficient, and wild type fibroblasts (16Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). The PS1-deficient cells showed an increase in intracellular CTF1 levels, because the ratio of CTF1 levels to holo Alcα1 levels in these cells was 5-fold higher than the ratio in wild type fibroblasts. Moreover, the fibroblasts that lacking both PS1 and PS2 showed a remarkable accumulation of intracellular CTF1 (14-fold). An identical observation was also obtained when the γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 was applied to wild type fibroblasts (data not shown). In a separate study, we expressed either wild type PS1 or the dominant negative mutant PS1D385A (wherein Asp385 is substituted with Ala) (12De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Google Scholar) in HEK293 cells along with FLAG-Alcα1 and then examined the generation of CTF1 (Fig. 1F). The cells expressing the mutant PS1 accumulated CTF1. These results show clearly that Alcα is cleaved by PS-dependent γ-secretase. Identical analyses with Alcβ and Alcγ are currently underway.Secretion of Aβ-like Peptide and Release of the Intracellular Domain Fragment by the γ-Cleavage of Alc CTF1—The above observations indicate that Alc is subjected to a primary cleavage event that generates CTF1 and that CTF1 is then cut by a secondary PS-dependent γ-cleavage. It is likely that the later event results in the secretion of a short peptide (β-Alc) and the release of AlcICD into the cytoplasm. We first determined the primary cleavage site of Alcα by subjecting the CTF1 of Alcα1 to automated sequence analysis. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence was XXXPXFVX. Based on the protein sequence that was deduced from the Alcα1 cDNA sequence, it appears that the amino-terminal sequence of the Alcα1 CTF1 is 816AAQPQFVH823. Thus, the most likely primary cleavage site of Alcα1 is the peptide bond between Met815 and Ala816 (for the Alcα2 isoform, which is identical to Alcα1 apart from an additional 10 amino acids between the Alcα1 residues at position 71 and 72 (9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar), the cleavage site that would generate the Alcα2 CTF1 would be between Met825 and Ala826). We designated this cleavage site, which is in the extracellular domain, ζ (Fig. 2A). We also determined the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of holo Alcα1. The determined sequence was ARVNK, which is identical to the Ala29-Arg-Val-Asn-Lys33 sequence. This indicates that the signal peptidase cleaves the peptide bond between Ala28 and Ala29 of Alcα, which means that the amino-terminal 28 residues constitute the signal peptide.Fig. 2Secretion of an Aβ-like peptide by the γ-secretase cleavage of Alcα CTF1. A, schematic structure of the Alcα1 constructs used in this study. Alcα1 is cleaved between Ala28 and Ala29 by the signal peptidase, between Met815 and Ala816 by the primary cleaving enzyme (indicated as ζ), and within the membrane by the PS/γ-secretase complex (indicated as γ). A FLAG sequence was inserted between Leu38 and Glu39 to generate FLAG-Alcα1. To mimic the primary cleaved product of Alcα1, the sequence between Gln39 and Met815 was deleted. This generated AlcαΔE. The overlines indicate the region recognized by the UT83 antibody (9Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Google Scholar). TM, transmembrane domain. B, expression of FLAG-tagged Alcα1 and AlcαΔE proteins in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells (∼1 × 106 cells) were transiently transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-hAlcα1 (FLAG-Alcα1), pcDNA3-FLAG-hAlcαΔE (AlcαΔE), or pcDNA3 (Vector) (1.5 μg plasmid). The cell lysates (∼20 μg of protein) were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-FLAG antibody M2 (left panel) or the anti-Alcα antibody UT83 (right panel). C, secretion of β-Alcα from AlcαΔE. HEK293 cells (∼1 × 107 cells) were transfected with (+) or without (-) pcDNA3-FLAG-hAlcαΔE (6 μg) and cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence (-) of the γ-secretase inhibitors, compound E (Cpd.E; 50 nm), DAPT (1 μm), or L-685,458 (1 μm). The medium (6 ml) and cell lysate (Cell, 200 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation and then analyzed by Western blotting with the M2 antibody. The arrows labeled β-Alcα indicate the peptides that were generated by the γ-secretase cleavage of AlcαΔE. D, β-Alcα is not generated in PS-deficient cells. Wild type (PS1 +/+, PS2 +/+), PS1-deficient (PS1 -/-, PS2 +/+), and PS1- and PS2-deficient (PS1 -/-, PS2 -/-) fibroblasts (2 × 107 cells) were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-AlcαΔE(+,6 μg). The medium (6 ml) and cell lysates (Cell, 200 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation and analyzed by Western blotting with the M2 antibody (left panel). The levels of β-Alcα (a relative ratio) were normalized by the amount of intracellular AlcαΔE, and these values were then converted so that they were relative to the level in wild type fibroblasts, which was assigned a reference value of 1.0 (right panel). The results shown are the average of duplicate assays, and the error bars are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To demonstrate that Alc secretes an Aβ-like peptide by the secondary cleavage of CTF1 by γ-secretase, we designed the AlcαΔE construct, which lacks the sequence between Pro40 and Met815 in FLAG-Alcα1 and mimics CTF1 (Fig. 2A). The FLAG-tagged Alcα1orAlcαΔE protein was then expressed in HEK293 cells, and the cell lysates were probed with the anti-FLAG antibody M2 or the UT83 antibody that recognizes the carboxyl-terminal region of Alcα (Fig. 2B). M2 (left panel) and UT83 (right panel) recognized both the FLAG-Alcα1 and AlcαΔE proteins. UT83 also recognized the CTF1 that was generated from FLAG-Alcα1 by ζ-cleavage (right panel, middle lane). AlcαΔE migrated to almost the same position as CTF1 (∼30 kDa) on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B, right panel, compare the middle and right lanes).We then examined whether the Aβ-like peptide (we termed it β-Alcα) is generated from AlcαΔE by γ-cleavage. HEK293 cells expressing AlcαΔE were cultured with or without various γ-secretase inhibitors, namely compound E (23Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H. Yang F. Meredith Jr., J.E.

We describe the cloning and characterization of the human and mouse NDR2, a second mammalian isoform of NDR protein kinase. NDR1 and NDR2 share 86% amino acid identity and are highly conserved between human and mouse. However, they differ in expression pattern; mouse Ndr1 is expressed mainly in spleen, lung and thymus, whereas mouse Ndr2 shows highest expression in the gastrointestinal tract. NDR2 is potently activated in cells following treatment with the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor okadaic acid, which also results in phosphorylation on the activation segment residue Ser-282 and the hydrophobic motif residue Thr-442. We show that Ser-282 becomes autophosphorylated in vivo, whereas Thr-442 is targeted by an upstream kinase. This phosphorylation can be mimicked by replacing the hydrophobic motif of NDR2 with a PRK2-derived sequence, resulting in a constitutively active kinase. Similar to NDR1, the autophosphorylation of NDR2 protein kinase was stimulated in vitro by S100B, an EF-hand Ca2+-binding protein of the S100 family, suggesting that the two isoforms are regulated by the same mechanisms.

Cron P. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5022-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The closest members of the mammalian NDR protein kinase from lower organisms, TRC, SAX-1, Cbk1p, and Orb6p, are all involved in the control of cell morphology. The Drosophila NDR kinase TRC regulates the integrity of epidermal cell extensions such as sensory bristles, arista, and wing hairs by affecting the actin cytoskeleton and is proposed to form a part of a putative morphogenetic checkpoint (3Geng W. He B. Wang M. Adler P.N. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1817-1828PubMed Google Scholar). SAX-1 is the Caenorhabditis elegans NDR protein kinase and is reported to play an important role in the regulation of neuronal cell shape and neurite initiation (4Zallen J.A. Peckol E.L. Tobin D.M. Bargmann C.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3177-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The relatives of NDR protein kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cbk1 and Orb6, are also essential for normal morphogenesis, cell polarity, and coordination of cell morphology with the cell cycle (5Colman-Lerner A.

The human NDR1 protein has been shown to become autophosphorylated on Ser-281 and activated upon S100B binding in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The C-terminal regulatory phosphorylation site Thr-444 is phosphorylated in vivo by a so far unidentified upstream kinase (11Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J. Rogniaux H. Stegert M.R. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

This phosphorylation within the hydrophobic motif, which is an event typical of the regulation of many AGC group kinases, promotes kinase activation and protein stability (12Lang F. Cohen P.

Some kinases, such as PRK2, have an Asp residue instead of a Ser or Thr residue, and a mutation of the hydrophobic phosphorylation site of to an Asp was shown to result in a constitutively active hydrophobic motif for several kinases (14Alessi D.R.

Here we describe the characterization of a second isoform of NDR protein kinase, termed NDR2, and show that mNdr1 is widely expressed, whereas mNdr2 is expressed mainly in the gastrointestinal tract of mice. NDR2 becomes activated in vivo following phosphorylation on three conserved sites, Thr-75, Ser-282, and Thr-442. Further, a NDR2-PIFtide chimera, which contains the PRK2 hydrophobic motif (PIFtide), is constitutively active. In vitro, the Ca2+-binding protein S100B stimulates activation of NDR2 and autophosphorylation on Thr-75, Ser-282, and Thr-444. PCR and Molecular Cloning—BLAST searches of the NCBI data base were performed to identify NDR-related sequences. The Ndr2 cDNA was assembled by PCR screening using a Marathon-Ready™ human brain cDNA library (Clontech) following standard protocols (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989: 810-896Google Scholar). The mouse Ndr1 cDNA was cloned from a mouse λZAPII (Stratagene) cDNA library; the mouse Ndr2 cDNA was cloned using a 3′ mEST (GenBank™ accession number AA277870) and subcloning the 5′ end from a mouse brain cDNA library (Clontech) using PCR. Sequences of all clones were obtained using an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using custom-synthesized primers and compared with the appropriate genomic databases (Ensembl and Celera). Sequence analysis was performed using Seqweb 1.2 (Genetics Computer Group, Inc.).

GFP-Ndr2 was constructed by amplifying the Ndr2 cDNA with primers 5′-CGGGATCCGGTACCATGGCAATGACGG-CAGGGACTAC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCTTCATTCATAACTTCCCAGC-3′ using Pfu polymerase (Promega). The PCR product was then digested with BamHI and cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech).

The PCR product was then digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into pCMV5. All plasmids were confirmed by sequence analysis. RNA Extraction and Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Tissues of three 129SvPas mice were isolated and subjected to RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy 96 kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription reactions were performed using the GeneAmpRNA PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis was performed using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector. Specific primers and probes for each gene were designed using Primer Express 2.0 software. Amplicon sizes were 67 bp for mNdr1 and 98 bp for mNdr2. TaqMan PCR reactions were performed for mNdr1, mNdr2, and 18 S rRNA according to the user's manual. Details of primers and probes are available on request.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Exponentially growing cells were plated on coverslips and transfected the next day with indicated constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche) as described by the manufacturer. After 24 h of transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in PBS at pH 7.4 for 10 min at 37 °C. They were then permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min at room temperature. All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. Coverslips were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h with anti-HA Y11 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA, 1% goat serum. After three 1-min washes in PBS, goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) was used as secondary antibody. DNA was counterstained with 4 μg/ml Hoechst (Sigma). Coverslips were then inverted into 5 μl of Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were obtained with an Eclipse E800 microscope using a CoolPix950 digital camera (Nikon) and processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.). Only cells with intact nuclei were included in the statistical evaluation. Cells expressing GFP-NDR2 were fixed and then stained for DNA without permeabilization and antibody incubation steps. Conservation of NDR Kinases—BLAST searches of the NCBI data base identified the human KIAA0965 clone (GenBank™ accession number AB023182/hj06174s1) as a partial cDNA with significant homology to human NDR1 protein kinase. We determined the sequences of hNdr2, mNdr1, and mNdr2 cDNAs and the corresponding mouse genes. The deduced amino acids sequences were compared and aligned to the known sequences of hNDR1, Drosophila melanogaster NDR TRC, C. elegans NDR SAX-1, and S. cerevisiae Cbk1 (Fig. 1A). The human and mouse NDR1 sequences show 99% identity, the NDR2 sequences show 97% identity, and NDR1 and NDR2 show an identity of 86%, indicating an extremely high sequence conservation during evolution ranging to flies (68%), worms (67% identity), and yeast (47% identity). Human and mouse NDR2 are 464 amino acids long with a predicted mass of 54 kDa. Gene mapping indicates that hNdr1 and mNdr1 as well as hNdr2 and mNdr2 are located on orthologous regions; hNdr1 maps to 6p21 (17Tripodis N. Palmer S. Phillips S. Milne S. Beck S. Ragoussis J. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 454-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and hNdr2 to 12p12.3. The corresponding mouse genes map to 17B1 and 6G2-G3. In addition, pseudogenes of Ndr2 were found on chromosomes 1D and 8A1.2 of the mouse genome. The human and mouse genes consist of 14 exons with conserved intron-exon boundaries. Exon 1 is a noncoding exon containing 5′-untranslated region, exon 2 contains the start codon, and the stop codon is located in exon 14 (data not shown). Tissue-specific Expression of Ndr1 and -2—TaqMan real-time PCR analysis was used to examine the differential expression of mNdr1 and mNdr2 in mouse tissues obtained from three different mice (Fig. 2). The expression of 18 S rRNA was used as a reference gene to correct for reverse transcription-PCR efficiency of each sample. The highest expression levels of mNdr1 were observed in spleen, lung, thymus, brain, and fat tissue, whereas mNdr2 expression was found mainly in the large and small intestine, as well as in the stomach and testis. Assuming similar PCR efficiency for both reactions, mNdr2 appears to be the predominantly expressed isoform in mice. These data suggest tissue-specific functions of NDR1 and NDR2 in mammals. Regulation of NDR2 Kinase Activity—A comparison of the NDR2 and NDR1 sequences showed that NDR2 contains three conserved phosphorylation sites corresponding to the described NDR1 phosphorylation sites Thr-75, Ser-281, and Thr-444 (10Millward T.A. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33847-33850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). NDR2 mutants were created in which Thr-75, Ser-282, or Thr-442 was replaced by an alanine, and a kinase-dead mutant, K119A, was also made. The protein kinase activity of each of these mutants was measured following treatment of transfected COS-1 cells with 1 μm okadaic acid (OA) or with solvent alone for 1 h. HA-NDR2-WT was potently stimulated (∼10-fold) by OA (Fig. 3). All three phosphorylation site mutants (T75A, S282A, and T442A) displayed reduced basal activity and could not be stimulated by treatment with OA. The K119A mutation reduced basal activity to almost undetectable levels and, as expected, abolished the activation by OA. Western blot analysis of the regulatory phosphorylation site mutants T75A, S282A, T442A, and wild type with phospho-specific antibodies, which recognize the phospho-epitopes Ser-282P and Thr-442P, showed that NDR2 became phosphorylated on Ser-282 in wild type, T442A, and T75A and that this phosphorylation increased after OA treatment with the wild type and T442A but not with the mutant T75A. The kinase-dead K119A mutant was not phosphorylated on Ser-282, indicating that Ser-282 is an autophosphorylation site. Thr-442 became phosphorylated upon OA treatment in NDR2 wild type, as well as in the S282A, T75A, and K119A mutants, suggesting that Thr-442 is phosphorylated independently of NDR2 activity and is therefore targeted by an upstream kinase (Fig. 3). These results confirmed that phosphorylation on both the activation segment phosphorylation site Ser-282 and the regulatory hydrophobic motif phosphorylation site Thr-442 is required for NDR2 activation. In addition, NDR2 activity also depends on the presence of Thr-75 in the N-terminal regulatory domain. Constitutively Active NDR2—The phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues can be mimicked by substitution of Asp or Glu for several kinases (14Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). However, we have recently shown that T444D or T444E mutations have only a very moderate effect (1.5-2-fold activation) on NDR1 kinase activity (10Millward T.A. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33847-33850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Previous studies with protein kinase B showed that activation of the kinase and engagement of the N-terminal lobe hydrophobic groove, which is dependent on an ordered α-C helix, could also be achieved by substituting the hydrophobic motif of protein kinase B with the constitutive active hydrophobic motif of PRK2 (PIFtide) (15Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Based on the similarities of AGC group kinases, we created an NDR2-PIFtide chimera, aiming to generate an active kinase. Indeed, the NDR2-PIFtide had a more than 20-fold elevated basal kinase activity and even showed an increase in activity compared with OA-stimulated NDR2 (Fig. 4A). Phosphorylation site analysis showed increased Ser-282 phosphorylation in the NDR2-PIFtide chimera, suggesting an increased autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we have shown that substitution of the hydrophobic motif of NDR2 with the PIFtide sequence results in a constitutively active NDR2 kinase, thus describing for the first time a constitutively active variant of the NDR protein kinase. Activation of NDR2 by S100B—The sequence conservation between NDR1 and NDR2 also encompasses the previously defined S100B-binding domain of NDR1 (see Fig. 1). Therefore, the in vitro effect of Ca2+/S100B on NDR2 activity was investigated. Ca2+/S100B increased the rate of NDR2 autophosphorylation ∼2-fold after a 4-h incubation (Fig. 5A) and stimulated specific NDR activity in a concentration-dependent manner ∼4-fold (Fig. 5B). This suggests that NDR2 activation by Ca2+/S100B also occurs by the mechanism reported for NDR1 (9Millward T.A. Heizmann C.W. Schafer B.W. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J. Rogniaux H. Stegert M.R. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 6710-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After in vitro incubation of GST-NDR2 in the presence and absence of Ca2+/S100B, the proteins were digested with trypsin and the resultant mixture analyzed by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry in a -79 precursor scan (18Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This technique measures the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of all peptide species liberating a single phosphate group after fragmentation. Five (NDR2-derived) phospho-peptides were identified in both samples (the GST-NDR2 and the GST-NDR2/Ca2+/S100B), corresponding to the phosphorylation sites Thr-75, Ser-282, and Thr-442 (Fig. 5C). These results demonstrate that S100B proteins regulate NDR2 by a mechanism similar to that reported for NDR1 (11Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J. Rogniaux H. Stegert M.R. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 6710-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Localization of NDR2—To examine the subcellular localization of NDR2, COS-7 and HeLa cells were transfected with either N-terminally GFP-tagged NDR2 (GFP-NDR2) or HANDR2 and processed for indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 6A; data not shown). A statistical analysis showed that both proteins were detected mainly in the cytoplasm of both COS-7 cells and HeLa cells under these experimental settings (Fig. 6B). Similar results were also obtained when U2-OS cells were studied (data not shown). Thus, in marked contrast to the localization pattern described for NDR1 (2Millward T. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5022-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), NDR2 was not localized predominantly to nuclear structures. For unknown reasons, NDR2 was found to be mainly cytoplasmic even though it contains the same NLS as NDR1 (see Fig. 1). In this study, we have described the cloning and characterization of the NDR2 protein kinase, a second isoform of mammalian NDR protein kinase. The extremely high level of conservation of NDR protein kinases throughout the eukaryotic world indicates that this kinase is subject to a very high evolutionary pressure. Mouse and human NDR kinases also show an absolutely conserved gene organization of 14 exons. It is likely that the kinases are components of a conserved signaling pathway (1Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J. Hemmings B.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This has been shown genetically already for one component of the pathway, the Furry/Mor2/Pag1 protein, mutation of which results in similar phenotypes in D. melanogaster, S. pombe, and S. cerevisiae as reported for NDR kinase mutations (19Cong J. Geng W. He B. Liu J. Charlton J. Adler P.N. Development. 2001; 128: 2793-2802PubMed Google Scholar, 20Du L.L. Novick P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Hirata D. Kishimoto N. Suda M. Sogabe Y. Nakagawa S. Yoshida Y. Sakai K. Mizunuma M. Miyakawa T. Ishiguro J. Toda T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4863-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). There is no information on the function of the human Furry protein. Our results show that NDR2 is regulated by multi-site phosphorylation similar to many of the AGC family of protein kinases. Mutation of one or both phosphorylation site residues, Ser-282 and Thr-442, of NDR2 led to an almost total loss of kinase activity, suggesting that both residues are essential for kinase activity. This is not surprising as similar observations have been made for other AGC group kinases. Recent structural studies of protein kinase B have delineated a mechanism by which multi-site phosphorylation brings about structural changes involving both disorder-to-order transitions of the alpha B and C helices and the ordering of the activation segment, concomitant with converting the kinase to a fully 1000-fold activated enzyme (13Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 15Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Significantly, NDR2 becomes phosphorylated on three residues in vitro. The major site, Ser-282, which is conserved among all AGC group kinases, is an essential part of the activation segment of the kinase. The second site, Thr-75, is located within the S100B-binding domain, and the third site, Thr-442, which is also conserved in the AGC group superfamily, is located outside of the kinase domain in a region enriched with hydrophobic amino acid residues (“hydrophobic motif”). In vivo mutation of the phosphorylation site residues Ser-282 and Thr-442 of NDR2 ablated kinase activity and blocked activation. In wild-type NDR2, both residues were phosphorylated upon OA stimulation, whereas in the kinase-dead mutant K119A, only the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation site, Thr-442, was phosphorylated, suggesting that the kinase activity of NDR2 is required only for phosphorylation of Ser-282. Therefore, NDR2 is phosphorylated by an upstream kinase at the C-terminal hydrophobic site in OA-stimulated COS-1 cells. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Thr-442 autophosphorylation observed in vitro also contributes to the overall phosphorylation at this residue in vivo. Autophosphorylation on the activation segment residue has also been reported for other members of the AGC kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase Cδ (22Yonemoto W. McGlone M.L. Grant B. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). This suggests that autophosphorylation is an alternative mechanism of activation of the few AGC kinases that are not targeted by PDK1 (for review, see Ref. 24Leslie N.R. Biondi R.M. Alessi D.R. Chem Rev. 2001; 101: 2365-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The specificity of activation of AGC group kinases is likely to be mediated by the phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif residue. For the NDR kinases, some significant clues suggest that upstream kinases are members of the Ste20 family. For example, the upstream kinase of Dbf2 was identified as Cdc15, one of the budding yeast Ste20-like kinases (25Mah A.S. Jang J. Deshaies R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 7325-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and the fission yeast Ste20-like kinase Pak1/Shk1 was reported to interact genetically with Orb6 (8Verde F. Wiley D.J. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7526-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The identification of this so far unknown upstream kinase for NDR will provide important information about the physiological regulation of the NDR protein kinase, which in turn could provide hints about the conditions under which this tightly controlled kinase is activated in vivo. As demonstrated for protein kinase B, the PIFtide sequence leads to an ordered structure and therefore fully active hydrophobic motif, concomitant with an activation of the kinase (15Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The similarities within the AGC group kinases in sequence similarity and mode of activation enabled us to create a constitutive active NDR2 by substituting the C terminus of NDR2 with the PIFtide sequence. The NDR2-PIFtide showed an even higher activity than the OA-stimulated kinase. This is probably because of an intrinsic stimulation of the autophosphorylation activity by keeping the kinase in the active state, which is also reflected by the increased Ser-282 phosphorylation in the NDR2-PIFtide. The constitutive active kinase will likely prove a valuable tool for the identification of downstream targets of NDR2 protein kinase. The in vivo significance of the phosphorylation at Thr-74 in NDR1 and Thr-75 in NDR2 is unclear thus far. This threonine is within the identified S100B-binding domain of NDR protein kinase, and its mutation is critical for NDR protein kinase activity. This might be because of a missing phosphorylation event or because this residue may be structurally important for the NDR-S100B interaction. Nevertheless, recent data show that Thr-75 is not directly involved in the binding of S100B, suggesting that the phosphorylation modulates the affinity between the two proteins (26Bhattacharya S. Large E. Heizmann C.W. Hemmings B. Chazin W.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14416-14426Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Conservation of the kinase also encompasses the S100B-binding domain, and the mechanism of in vitro activation by S100B appears to be identical for NDR1 and NDR2. The homology between the mammalian, fly, worm, and yeast NDR kinases suggests that this mode of activation will be similar in all organisms. The subcellular localization of NDR2 was rather surprising considering the high sequence similarity between NDR1 and NDR2. Whereas NDR1 was reported to be mainly nuclear (2Millward T. Cron P. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5022-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we detected NDR2 predominantly localized to cytoplasmic structures in our experimental settings. This might reflect different functions and/or substrate specificities of NDR1 and NDR2 within subcellular compartments. Most importantly, the two mammalian isoforms differ mainly in their tissue- and cell type-specific expression patterns. It is striking that mNdr2 is expressed mainly in highly proliferative tissues with high cellular turnover, such as the stomach and the large and small intestines. Interestingly, hNdr1 was recently found to be up-regulated in highly necrotic and progressive ductal carcinoma in situ, as well as in some melanoma cell lines (9Millward T.A. Heizmann C.W. Schafer B.W. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Adeyinka A. Emberley E. Niu Y. Snell L. Murphy L.C. Sowter H. Wykoff C.C. Harris A.L. Watson P.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3788-3795PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly hNdr2 is up-regulated in the highly metastatic non-small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H460 (28Ross D.T. Scherf U. Eisen M.B. Perou C.M. Rees C. Spellman P. Iyer V. Jeffrey S.S. Van de Rijn M. Waltham M. Pergamenschikov A. Lee J.C. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Myers T.G. Weinstein J.N. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role of NDR protein kinase in the regulation of cancer cell morphology and migration. The major outstanding task for the future will be the full delineation of the novel highly conserved NDR signaling pathway. Of considerable importance is the question of the identification of the predicted agonist and receptor that initiate kinase activation. The answer may then help us understand how NDR contributes to the regulation of cell morphogenesis and proliferation and how these signals are disrupted in transformed cells. Mouse knockout studies may reveal whether the observed differences in tissue-specific expression and subcellular localization of NDR1 and NDR2 reflect differences in their functions.

In the present study, we evaluated T cell death-associated gene 51 (TDAG51), which we previously identified by cDNA microarray analysis as a gene specifically induced by IGF-I. We characterized the signaling pathways by which IGF-I induces TDAG51 gene expression and the functional role of TDAG51 in IGF-I signaling in NIH-3T3 (NWTb3) cells, which overexpress the human IGF-I receptor. Treatment with IGF-I increased TDAG51 mRNA and protein levels in NWTb3 cells. This effect of IGF-I was specifically mediated by the IGF-IR, because IGF-I did not induce TDAG51 expression in NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing a dominant-negative IGF-I receptor. Through the use of specific inhibitors of various protein kinases, we found that IGF-I induced TDAG51 expression via the p38 MAPK pathway. The ERK, JNK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways were not involved in IGF-I-induced regulation of TDAG51. To assess the role of TDAG51 in IGF-I signaling, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vectors directed at two different target sites to reduce the level of TDAG51 protein. In cells expressing these siRNA vectors, TDAG51 protein levels were decreased by 75-80%. Furthermore, TDAG51 siRNA expression abolished the ability of IGF-I to rescue cells from serum starvation-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that TDAG51 plays an important role in the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-I.

The pleiotrophic effects of IGF-I and insulin on cell proliferation, cell survival, and metabolism are mediated by a complex network of intracellular signaling pathways. The biological and physiological functions of IGF-I and insulin are initiated when these ligands bind to their receptors. The structures of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and insulin receptor (IR) are similar, each consisting of two extracellular α-subunits and two transmembrane β-subunits. Although both ligands interact with each receptor, the receptors bind their own ligands with 100-1000-fold higher affinity than that of the heterologous peptides. After ligand binding, each receptor becomes autophosphorylated and the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of these receptors becomes activated. Various substrate proteins, including Shc, Gab-1, and the insulin receptor substrate proteins, are then phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by the activated receptors. Tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate and Shc molecules interact with specific downstream signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 domains, including the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Grb2, which lead to activation of the PI3K pathway and Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathways, respectively (1LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 2Adamo M. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D.

Although the IGF-IR and IR signaling pathways generally overlap, IGF-I and insulin exhibit distinct physiological functions. Whereas insulin generally regulates metabolism, IGF-I controls cell growth, differentiation, and protects cells against apoptosis (4Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F105-F126Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 5Vincent A.M. Feldman E.L. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2002; 12: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The differences between IGF-I and insulin receptor signaling that mediate these distinct biological effects remain to be elucidated.In a previous study, we stimulated NIH-3T3 fibroblasts either with IGF-I or with insulin and then evaluated changes in gene expression patterns by cDNA microarray analysis to identify genes that are differentially regulated by IGF-I and insulin (6Dupont J. Khan J. Qu B.H. Metzler P. Helman L. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4969-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We found 30 genes that were specifically responsive to IGF-I. Most of these were related to mitogenesis and differentiation. We characterized Twist, which is one of the genes that are specifically responsive to IGF-I, and showed that Twist is positively involved in the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-I (7Dupont J. Fernandez A.M. Glackin C.A. Helman L. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26699-26707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here, we have evaluated TDAG51 (T cell death-associated gene 51), another gene that is specifically regulated by IGF-I.Mouse TDAG51 was originally isolated and shown to regulate the expression of Fas and T cell receptor activation-induced apoptosis in mouse T cell hybridomas (8Park C.G. Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Choi Y. Immunity. 1996; 4: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). TDAG51 is ubiquitously expressed in mice, and strong expression is found in brain, lung, liver, and thymus (8Park C.G. Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Choi Y. Immunity. 1996; 4: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the rat and human homologues were readily identified. The rat homologue was isolated as an immediate early gene induced by fibroblast growth factor in neuronal cells and was shown to promote cell death (9Gomes I. Xiong W. Miki T. Rosner M.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 612-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The human homologue was shown to be down-regulated in metastatic melanoma cells, as compared with primary melanoma cells (10Neef R. Kuske M.A. Prols E. Johnson J.P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5920-5929PubMed Google Scholar). The TDAG51 protein has highly repeated sequences in its carboxyl-terminal region, including prolineglutamine (PQ) repeats and proline-histidine (PH) repeats. It has been shown that proteins containing PQ-rich domains may function as transcriptional activators and mediate apoptosis in various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease (11Li J.Y. Plomann M. Brundin P. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 414-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Taken together, several lines of evidence suggest that TDAG51 may be associated with enhanced apoptosis.It has been well established that IGF-I can protect cells from apoptosis under a variety of circumstances. For example, IGF-I prevents apoptosis induced by overexpression of c-myc in fibroblasts (12Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I.

While the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-I has been clearly demonstrated, the molecular mechanisms by which IGF-I inhibits apoptosis induced by these various stimuli remain unknown.In this study, we set out to determine the signaling pathways involved in IGF-I-induced expression of TDAG51 in NIH-3T3 cells and to determine the role of TDAG51 in the functions of IGF-I in these cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human recombinant IGF-I was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). LY294002, which is a PI3K-specific inhibitor, was purchased from Sigma. U0126, a MEK1/2-specific inhibitor and SB202190, a p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor were obtained from Calbiochem. SP600215, a JNK-specific inhibitor, was from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, MA). The stock solutions of these inhibitors were prepared in Me2SO at a 1000-fold concentration, such that the concentration of Me2SO was below 0.1% when the compounds were added to the culture medium. Polyclonal antibodies to TDAG51 (M-20) and to the IGF-IR β-subunit (C-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A monoclonal antibody to actin was obtained from Sigma. Anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), anti-Akt, anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK, and anti-cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). A monoclonal antibody to the human IGF-IR (αIR-3) was obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Mouse IgG was from Pierce. The pTRI-GAPDH-mouse antisense control template was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The radionuclide [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Construction of Expression Plasmids—The pSilencer™ 1.0-U6 siRNA expression vector was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). As the inserts for expressing short hairpin RNA, two inserts were selected: 21-sense (5′-GCAGCTACAACAGCAGCAGTTCAAGAGACTGCTGCTGTTGTAGCTGCTTTTTT-3′) and 21-antisense (5′-AATTAAAAAAGCAGCTACAACAGCAGCAGTCTCTTGAACTGCTGCTGTTGTAGCTGCGGCC-3′) and 37-sense (5′-GTCTACCAGGCAGAAGCAGTTCAAGAGACTGCTTCTGCCTGGTAGACTTTTTT-3′) and 37-antisense (5′-AATTAAAAAAGTCTACCAGGCAGAAGCAGTCTCTTGAACTGCTTCTGCCTGGTAGACGGCC-3′). Each insert was annealed and subcloned with pSilencer, which was linearized with ApaI and EcoRI. The construct containing siRNA insert 21 or 37 was designated psi21 or psi37. We determined whether the transfected clones contained the siRNA expression vectors by PCR analysis. The forward and reverse primers were 5′-GATCTTGTGGGAGAAGCTCGGCT-3′ and 5′-ACAAAAGCTGGAGCTCCACCGC-3′, respectively. Genomic DNA was isolated from each cell line using DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).Cell Culture and Stable Transfection—The NWTb3 cell line expresses the human IGF-IR at a level of ∼4 × 105 receptors per cell (19Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Two cell lines expressing dominant-negative forms of the human IGF-IR (∼3-7 × 105 receptors/cell) were also used. These include the NKA8 cell line, in which the Lys-1003 residue at the ATP-binding site was substituted with Ala (NKA8 mutant), and the NKR1 cell line, in which Lys-1003 was substituted with Arg (NKR1 mutant) (20Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IR cell line, a gift from Dr. S. Taylor (National Institues of Health, Bethesda, MD), expresses the human IR at a level of about 2 × 106 receptor/cell (21Levy-Toledano R. Accili D. Taylor S.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1220: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). NWTb3, NKR1, NKA8, and IR cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 300 mg/ml l-glutamine, and Geneticin (0.5 g/liter, Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C.For stable transfections, NWTb3 cells were grown to 70-80% confluence in complete culture medium. The cells were harvested by trypsinization and suspended in complete culture medium at 1 × 107 cells/ml. In a 0.4-cm cuvette, 0.4 ml of the cell suspension was mixed with the TDGA51 siRNA expression vector (psi21 and psi37) or pSilencer (30 μg) and pcDNA3.1-hygro (+) (10 μg, Invitrogen). The samples were then electroporated in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulsar (Bio-Rad) at 950 microfarads and 0.22 kV/cm (t = 20-30 ms). After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the electroporated cells were diluted (1:100) in complete culture medium and plated into 100-mm dishes (22Worley B.S. van den Broeke L.T. Goletz T.J. Pendleton C.D. Daschbach E.M. Thomas E.K. Marincola F.M. Helman L.J. Berzofsky J.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6868-6875PubMed Google Scholar). Beginning 48 h after transfection, 0.2 g/liter of hygromycin (Clontech) was added to the cultures to select for clones expressing siRNA. Two weeks later, independent colonies were picked using coloning disks (Scienceware). The resulting stable clones (siHygro1, si21-3, and si37-57) were cultured in complete culture medium with Hygromycin (0.2 g/liter).Northern Blot Analysis—The template for the TDAG51 cDNA probe was obtained by RT-PCR. The position of the amplified cDNA was as follows: mouse TDAG51 (GenBank™ accession number NM_009344) 552-851. The amplified cDNA was subcloned into the pCR®II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the resulting plasmid was subjected to DNA sequencing analysis to confirm the sequence. The TDAG51 cDNA template was labeled using the Rediprime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences).Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended instructions. Total RNA (20 μg) was resolved on 1.25% denaturing agarose gels. The integrity and amount of RNA were confirmed by visualization of ribosomal RNA. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred to Nytran nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schüll) by capillary action overnight and immobilized by UV exposure. Blots were prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's, 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 100 μl/ml salmon sperm. Blots were then hybridized overnight at the same temperature with 5× 106 cpm/ml [32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probe in a buffer containing 50% formamide, 2.5× Denhardt's, 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 100 μl/ml salmon sperm. The blots were washed at high stringency and the hybridized radioactivity was measured using Fuji BAS1800II instrument (FujiFilm, Stamford, CT). TDAG51 mRNA levels were quantified and normalized to GAPDH levels, using the Image Reader software and Image Gauge software together with a Fuji BAS1800II instrument.Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton-X, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate) to which a protease inhibitor mixture was added (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble materials. The protein concentration in the supernatants was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The extracted protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with various antibodies overnight, as indicated in the figure legends. After washing with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h and washed again. Immunoreactivity was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and quantified by densitometry, using Mac Bas V2.52 software (FujiFilm, Stamford, CT).Analysis of Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—Cells were plated on 100-mm dishes in the culture medium. After 18 h of incubation, the medium was changed to serum-free medium with or without IGF-I (50 nm), and the cells were incubated for another 48 h. For the treatment with mouse IgG or αIR3 antibody, the cells were preincubated in serum-free medium with mouse IgG or αIR-3 antibody (1.0 μg/ml) for 2 h and then FBS (10%) and IGF-I (10 nm) was added or not to the medium for another 48 h. The cells were then collected and washed twice with HEPES Buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) at room temperature as described previously (23Karas M. Zaks T.Z. Liu J.L. LeRoith D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 0.2 ml of HEPES Buffer that included 3 μl of Annexin V-FITC (Pharmingen) and 5 μl of 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) (Pharmingen) and were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Finally, the stained cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur using CellQuest Software (BD Biosciences).Analysis of the Cleaved Caspase-3 and PARP—Cells were plated on 100-mm dishes in the culture medium. After 18 h, the medium was changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without IGF-I (50 nm), and the cells were incubated for another 48 h. The cells were then collected and subjected to lysis as described above. The cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP was analyzed by subjecting cell lysates to immunoblotting with anti-cleaved caspase-3 and PARP antibodies.Statistical Analyses—All values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test using Statview 5.0 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSTDAG51 Expression Is Induced by IGF-I in NWTb3 Cells—In a previous cDNA microarray analysis study, we showed that TDAG51 gene expression was specifically induced by IGF-I (6Dupont J. Khan J. Qu B.H. Metzler P. Helman L. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4969-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To confirm this finding, we tested the effects of various durations of IGF-I treatment (50 nm) on TDAG51 mRNA levels in NWTb3 cells. The effect of IGF-I on TDAG51 mRNA was maximal after 1.5 h of stimulation, which increased TDAG51 levels by 10-fold. After longer incubation times (3-24 h), TDAG51 gene expression progressively decreased (Fig. 1A). We also analyzed TDAG51 protein levels and showed TDAG51 protein was increased ∼6-fold by IGF-I after 3-6 h of stimulation. This high level of protein expression persisted through 12 h of IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 1B). TDAG51 protein level gradually decreased after 12 h of IGF-I stimulation, and the IGF-I effect was abolished after 36 h of IGF-I treatment. Thus, IGF-I strongly stimulates the expression of both TDAG51 mRNA and protein in NWTb3 cells. On the other hand, in NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing human insulin receptors (IR cells), insulin's effect (50 nm) on TDAG51 gene expression was only 2-fold after 1.5 h of stimulation (data not shown).To confirm that IGF-I induced TDAG51 expression was mediated through the IGF-IR, we used NKR1 and NKA8 cells, which overexpress dominant-negative versions of the human IGF-IR in NIH-3T3 cells. NKR1 and NKA8 cells were stimulated with IGF-I (50 nm) for 1.5 h, and TDAG51 gene expression was determined by Northern blot analysis. Fig. 2 shows that the increase in TDAG51 induced by IGF-I was only observed in NWTb3 cells (which overexpress the wild-type human IGF-IR) and not in either the NKR1 or NKA cell lines. These results suggest that activation of the IGF-IR is essential for IGF-I-induced TDAG51 expression.Fig. 2The effect of IGF-IR activation on TDAG51 expression in mouse fibroblasts. NWTb3, NKR1, and NKA8 cells (70-80% confluent) were serum-starved overnight and then incubated with or without IGF-I (50 nm) for 1.5 h, as indicated. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot analysis to measure TDAG51 mRNA levels (upper panel). After autoradiography and quantification, membranes were stripped and reprobed with a mouse GAPDH probe, as an internal control. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. for three separate experiments (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The p38 MAPK Pathway Is Involved in IGF-I-induced TDAG51 Expression in NWTb3 Cells—To delineate the signaling pathways involved in IGF-I-induced expression of TDAG51, we used specific inhibitors for various protein kinases known to be activated by IGF-I, including PI3K, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2. We first evaluated the activity of these inhibitors in our system. NWTb3 cells were treated with the following inhibitors: 50 μm LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, 50 μm SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, 2 μm U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK, or 20 μm SP600125, a specific inhibitor of JNK1/2, for 1 h prior to stimulation with IGF-I (50 nm, 10 min). Western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against the phospho- and total forms of Akt, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK, as described previously (7Dupont J. Fernandez A.M. Glackin C.A. Helman L. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26699-26707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Heron-Milhavet L. Karas M. Goldsmith C.M. Baum B.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18185-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each inhibitor effectively prevented the IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of each of these protein kinases (data not shown). We next analyzed the effects of these inhibitors on IGF-I-induced expression of TDAG51. NWTb3 cells were pretreated with these protein kinase inhibitors for 1 h and prior to stimulation with IGF-I (50 nm for 1.5 h). Total RNA was then isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3, pretreatment with LY294002, U0126, and SP600125 did not significantly alter the effects of IGF-I on TDAG51 expression. However, pretreatment with SB202190 blocked IGF-I-induced TDAG51 expression by 80%. These results suggest that the effects of IGF-I on TDAG51 gene expression are mediated primarily by the p38 MAPK pathway.Fig. 3The effect of several protein kinase inhibitors on IGF-I-induced TDAG51 expression in NWTb3 cells. Serum-starved NWTb3 cells were preincubated for 1 h with the following inhibitors: 50 μm LY294002, 50 μm SB202190, 2 μm U0126, or 20 μm SP600125. Cells were then stimulated with or without IGF-I (50 nm) for 1.5 h, as indicated. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot analysis to measure TDAG51 mRNA levels (upper panel).

The two different TDAG51 siRNA expression vectors, psi21 and psi37, were transfected into NWTb3 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures”. Two clones were selected and designated as si21-3 and si37-57. In addition, one of the control clones was cotransfected with pSilencer vector and the hygromycin-resistant plasmid (pcDNA3.1-hygro), which was designated as siHygro1. These hygromicin-resistant clones were analyzed by PCR to confirm that the siRNA expression vectors were expressed in these clones. As shown in Fig. 4A, the selected clones expressed the siRNA construct. We then performed Western blot analysis using an anti-TDAG51 antibody to evaluate protein expression levels in these clones. Because TDAG51 protein is expressed at very low levels in the basal state (in complete culture medium), the cells were stimulated with 50 nm IGF-I for 6 h to induce TDAG51 expression. It can be seen in Fig. 4B that IGF-I robustly induced TDAG51 expression in the parental NWTb3 cells and siHygro1 cells. However, TDAG51 expression was 75-80% lower in si21-3 and si37-57 cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that the siRNA constructs effectively reduced TDAG51 levels. Expression of si21-3 and si37-57 had no effect on actin or IGF-IR expression levels (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Knock down of TDAG51 expression by siRNA in NWTb3 cells. NWTb3 cells were stably cotransfected with TDAG51 siRNA expression vectors (psi21 or psi37), pSilencer, or pcDNA3.1-hygro, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, PCR analysis to confirm the expression of siRNA-expressing vectors. Genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed by PCR, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” psi21, psi37, and pSilencer served as positive controls. As a negative control, we used genomic DNA derived from NWTb3 cells. B, TDAG51 expression in parental NWTb3 cells and cells expressing siHydro1 or TDAG51 siRNA. Each cell line was subjected to serum starvation and then incubated in the presence or absence of IGF-I (50 nm) for 6 h and homogenized in lysis buffer. The resulting cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-TDAG51 antibody or an antibody directed against the IGF-IR β-subunit. After autoradiography and quantification, membranes were stripped and reprobed with an antibody to actin as the internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TDAG51 Regulates the Inhibitory Effects of IGF-I on Apoptosis Induced by Serum Starvation in NWTb3 Cells—Previous studies have shown that TDAG51 is associated with enhanced apoptosis in several cell lines (8Park C.G.

However, in NWTb3 cells, IGF-I (which has an anti-apoptotic function) induced TDAG51 expression. To determine how TDAG51 affects IGF-I function, control cell lines (parental NWTb3 and siHygro1) and clones expressing TDAG51 siRNA (si21-3 and si37-57) were incubated in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 50 nm IGF-I for 48 h. The cells were then evaluated for apoptosis by Annexin V and 7-AAD staining (Fig. 5A). In control cell lines, the number of apoptotic cells (Annexin V-positive and 7-AAD-negative) represented less than 3% of the population in the basal state (in complete culture medium containing 10% FBS). Apoptotic cells made up about 40% of the population in cells that were subjected to serum starvation for 48 h. In the presence of IGF-I, the population of apoptotic cells was about 15% in control cell lines, reflecting a 60% reduction as compared with cells subjected to serum starvation in the absence of IGF-I.

https://openalex.org/W2084276349,"The broad spectrum antiviral nucleoside ribavirin displays activity against a variety of RNA and DNA viruses. A number of possible mechanisms have been proposed during the past 30 years to account for the antiviral activity of ribavirin, including the possibility that ribavirin might have a negative effect on the synthesis of the RNA cap structure of viral RNA transcripts. In the present study, we investigated the possibility that ribavirin can directly serve as a substrate for the vaccinia virus RNA capping enzyme. We demonstrate that ribavirin triphosphate can be used as a substrate by the capping enzyme and can form a covalent ribavirin monophosphate-enzyme intermediate reminiscent of the classical GMP-enzyme intermediate. Furthermore, our data indicate that ribavirin monophosphate can be transferred to the diphosphate end of an RNA transcript to form the unusual RpppN structure. Finally, we provide evidence that RNA transcripts that possess ribavirin as the blocking nucleoside are more stable than unblocked transcripts. However, in vitro translation assays indicate that RNA transcripts blocked with ribavirin are not translated efficiently. Our study provides the first biochemical evidences that ribavirin can directly interact with a viral capping enzyme. The ability of a purified RNA capping enzyme to utilize ribavirin as a substrate has not been previously documented and has implications for our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of RNA capping enzymes.

Ribavirin is a broad spectrum antiviral nucleoside that displays activity against a variety of RNA and DNA viruses (1Sidwell R.W. Huffman J.H. Khare G.P. Allen L.B. Witkowski J.T. Robins R.K.

Ribavirin is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue with a structure closely related to guanosine (3Prusiner P. Sundaralingam M. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 244: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Once inside the cells, ribavirin is phosphorylated by cellular kinases, with ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) 1The abbreviations used are: RTP, ribavirin triphosphate; RMP, ribavirin monophosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293. 1The abbreviations used are: RTP, ribavirin triphosphate; RMP, ribavirin monophosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293. as the major intracellular metabolite (4Miller J.P.

Biochem. 1990; 22: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A number of possible mechanisms have been proposed during the past 30 years to account for the antiviral activity of ribavirin. For instance, ribavirin monophosphate (RMP) has been shown to inhibit the host cell inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of GTP (6Streeter D.G. Witkowski J.T. Khare G.P. Sidwell R.W. Bauer R.J. Robins R.K. Simon L.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 7Muller W.E. Maidhof A. Taschner H. Zahn R.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1977; 26: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because GTP is required for the transcription of viral genomes and replication of RNA viruses, it has been assumed that the decrease in the cytosolic concentration of GTP could affect the multiplication of viruses. Ribavirin also modulates the host immune system by engendering a bias toward helper T-cell type 1 cytokine response (8Fang S.H. Hwang L.H. Chen D.S. Chiang B.L. J. Hepatol. 2000; 33: 791-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Zuckerman E. Zuckerman T. Sahar D. Streichman S. Attias D. Sabo E. Yeshurun D. Rowe J.M. Blood. 2001; 97: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This would ultimately lead to an enhanced immune response against viral infections. Ribavirin has also been shown to have an inhibitory effect on viral polymerases by competitively inhibiting the binding of the nucleotides (10Eriksson B. Helgstrand E. Johansson N.G. Larsson A.

More recently, elegant studies demonstrated that ribavirin can actually be used by viral polymerases and incorporated into viral RNA with the potential to base pair with UMP and CMP, leading to ribavirin-mediated mutagenesis of viral genomes (13Crotty S.

This would ultimately drive the viruses beyond a critical mutation rate and lead to an overall reduced fitness of the viral populations. Other mechanisms of action have been proposed for ribavirin but have not been fully explored, including the possibility that ribavirin may have a negative effect on the capping of viral RNA transcripts (12Cameron C.E.

The 5′-end of most eukaryotic mRNAs and many viral mRNAs harbors a m7GpppN cap structure that plays a critical role in the translation and stability of mRNAs (16Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1976; 9: 645-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 17Furuichi Y. LaFiandra A. Shatkin A.J. Nature. 1977; 265: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The first step in the synthesis of the cap structure involves the hydrolysis of the RNA 5′-triphosphate end of the nascent RNA by an RNA triphosphatase to form a diphosphate end. An RNA guanylyltransferase enzyme then catalyzes a two-step reaction in which it initially utilizes GTP as a substrate to form a covalent GMP-enzyme intermediate. The GMP moiety is then transferred to the diphosphate end of the RNA transcript in the second step of the reaction to form the GpppN structure (18Shuman S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The guanosine residue is finally methylated by an RNA methyltransferase to form the typical m7GpppN cap structure. Support for the possibility that ribavirin might inhibit the capping of viral RNA transcripts comes from the finding that mutations in the Sindbis virus genome that confer resistance to ribavirin map to the RNA guanylyltransferase coding region of the genome (19Scheidel L.M. Stollar V. Virology. 1991; 181: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Scheidel L.M. Durbin R.K. Stollar V. Virology. 1987; 158: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inhibition of vaccinia virus RNA cap synthesis by ribavirin has been noted previously, although the mechanism of action has not been explored (21Goswami B.B. Borek E. Sharma O.K. Fujitaki J. Smith R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1979; 89: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the possibility that ribavirin can directly serve as a substrate for the vaccinia virus RNA capping enzyme. We demonstrate that RTP can be used as a substrate by the capping enzyme and can form a covalent RMP-enzyme intermediate reminiscent of the classical GMP-enzyme intermediate. Furthermore, our data indicate that RMP can be transferred to the diphosphate end of an RNA transcript to form the unusual RpppN structure. Finally, we provide evidence that RNA transcripts, which possess ribavirin as the blocking nucleoside, are more stable than unblocked transcripts. The biological implications of these findings for the proposed ribavirin-mediated inhibition of RNA capping are discussed. Expression and Purification of the Vaccinia Virus D1 Protein (1-545)—A plasmid for the expression of the N-terminal segment of the vaccinia virus D1 protein was generated by PCR amplification of the sequence corresponding to residues 1-545 of the D1 coding region. The 5′- and 3′-primers harbored restriction sites for NheI and XhoI, respectively. Note that the 3′-primer was designed to introduce a translation stop at codon 546. The digested PCR product was inserted between the NheI and XhoI sites of the pET28a expression plasmid (Novagen). In this context, the resulting D1-(1-545) protein is fused in-frame with an N-terminal peptide containing six tandem histidine residues, and expression of the His-tagged protein is driven by a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The resulting recombinant plasmid, pET-D1-(1-545), was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). A 1-liter culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-D1-(1-545) was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin until the A600 reached 0.5. The culture was adjusted to 2% ethanol, and the incubation continued at 18 °C for 48 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at -80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% sucrose), and cell lysis was achieved by the addition of lysozyme and Triton X-100 to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 45 min. The soluble extract was applied to a 5-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol) containing 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mm imidazole. The polypeptide composition of the column fractions was monitored by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant D1-(1-545) protein was retained on the column and recovered in the 100 mm imidazole eluate. This fraction was applied to a 5-ml column of phosphocellulose that had been equilibrated in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Triton X-100). The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with buffer C containing 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 1 m NaCl. The recombinant protein was retained on the column and recovered predominantly in the 0.2 m NaCl fraction. The fraction was then dialyzed against buffer C that was supplemented with potassium pyrophosphate (1 mm) to ensure a homogenous nonguanylylated enzyme. The fraction was finally stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad dye binding method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Assay for Enzyme-GMP Complex Formation—The assay was performed by incubating the enzyme with 10 μm [α-32P]GTP in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2 for 5 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 10 mm and SDS to 1%. The reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. The radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography of the gel. The extent of covalent complex formation was quantitated by scanning the gel with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Assay for Enzyme-RMP Complex Formation—An assay similar to the one performed for the evaluation of the enzyme-GMP formation was used, except that [3H]RTP was utilized instead of [α-32P]GTP. Following electrophoresis through a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS, the proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue dye. The corresponding bands were then excised from the gels and crushed, and the amount of radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. Preparation of RNA Substrates—An RNA substrate of 84 nucleotides was synthesized with the MAXIscript kit (Ambion) using T7 RNA polymerase. The RNA transcript was synthesized from the pBS-KSII+ plasmid (Stratagene) that had been linearized with HindIII. The RNA substrate was purified on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by ultraviolet shadowing. The corresponding band was excised and then eluted from the gel by an overnight incubation in 0.1% SDS and 0.5 M ammonium acetate. The RNA was then precipitated with ethanol and quantitated by spectrophotometry. Alternatively, a radiolabeled RNA substrate was also synthesized by adding [α-32P]UTP to the transcription reaction. Transfer of RMP to RNA—Transfer of RMP to RNA was assayed by monitoring the transfer of [3H]RMP to an RNA transcript of 84 nucleotides (see above paragraph) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 2 μg of purified D1-(1-545) protein, and 1 mm [3H]RTP. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and unincorporated [3H]RTP was removed by multiple rounds of ethanol precipitation. The RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and recovered by ethanol precipitation. Alternatively, a radiolabeled RNA substrate of 84 nucleotides was used (see above paragraph) and incubated with unlabeled RTP (1 mm) in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 2 μg of purified D1-(1-545) protein. The RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, recovered by ethanol precipitation, and analyzed on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then scanned with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Stability of RNAs—The cellular protein extracts were prepared from a single 100-mm Petri dish culture of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. The cells were grown at 37 °C to 80% confluence prior to harvesting, and were then washed with PBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4,and 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). The cells were treated with trypsin, centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 1 min, resuspended in 4 ml of PBS buffer, and subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles. The protein extract was recovered after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min to remove the cellular debris. The protein concentration of the extract was determined by the Bio-Rad dye binding method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein extracts were added to an internally radiolabeled RNA species harboring an unblocked 5′-end or to RNAs possessing a 5′-end blocked with either guanosine, ribavirin, or the classical methylated guanosine cap. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were recovered at various time points, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. The amount of radioactivity present in the ethanol-insoluble material was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. In Vitro Translation Assays—In vitro translation assays were performed in wheat germ cell-free extracts (Promega). The incubation (50 μl) was performed in the presence of 50 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mCi of [35S]-methionine, and 10 μg of RNA species harboring an unblocked 5′-end, or to RNAs possessing a 5′-end blocked with either guanosine, ribavirin, or the classical methylated guanosine cap. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h, and aliquots (5 μl) were recovered at various time points and incubated in 1 m NaOH and 2% H2O2 at 37 °C for 10 min. The radiolabeled proteins were precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid and 2% casamino acids, and the acid-precipitable radioactivity was collected on glass fiber filters. The amount of incorporated radioactivity was evaluated with a liquid scintillation counter Formation of an RMP-Enzyme Covalent Intermediate—A His-tagged version of the vaccinia virus D1-(1-545) protein was expressed in bacteria and purified by sequential nickel-agarose and phosphocellulose chromatography steps (Fig. 1A). This N-terminal fragment of the D1 protein has been shown previously to be functionally equivalent to the full-sized capping enzyme with respect to triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities (22Higman M.A. Bourgeois N. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16430-16437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Myette J. Niles E.G. J. Biol.

The first step of the RNA guanylyltransferase reaction entails the nucleophilic attack of the α-phosphate of GTP by the enzyme and the subsequent formation of a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. The ability of the purified D1-(1-545) protein to form a covalent GMP-enzyme intermediate was detected by label transfer from [α-32P]GTP to the enzyme. A single SDS-stable GMP-enzyme complex that migrated as a 61-kDa species was detected following SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Labeling of the enzyme was not detected in the absence of divalent cations (data not shown). We conclude that the D1-(1-545) protein is active in the formation of a protein-GMP covalent complex. Because the nucleoside analogue ribavirin is structurally related to guanosine (Fig. 2A), we intended to monitor the ability of RTP to serve as a substrate for the D1-(1-545) protein by measuring the covalent binding of [3H]RTP to the enzyme. Note that the tritium label is located on the triazole ring of RTP. The D1-(1-545) protein was incubated in the presence of magnesium and increasing concentrations of radiolabeled RTP, and the reaction products were submitted to SDS-PAGE. The ability of the D1-(1-545) protein to catalyze the formation of a covalent protein-RMP complex was demonstrated by label transfer from [3H]RTP. The proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue dye, and the corresponding bands were excised from the gel and crushed, and the radioactivity was evaluated by liquid scintillation counting. The yield of protein-RMP formation by the D1-(1-545) protein increased with RTP concentrations up to 300 μm and leveled off thereafter (Fig. 2B). Note that the amount of the protein-RMP complex formed during a 10-min incubation at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm [3H]RTP was proportional to the amount of the added D1-(1-545) protein and that formation of the enzyme-RMP complex was dependent on the presence of a divalent ion (data not shown). These data demonstrate that RTP can serve as a substrate for the D1-(1-545) protein and form a stable covalent RMP-enzyme complex. A second assay was used to demonstrate the covalent transfer of RMP to the D1-(1-545) protein. In this assay, the enzyme was incubated in the presence of RTP and magnesium, and the polypeptide was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. The appearance of a slower migrating protein species was observed repeatedly when the protein was incubated with RTP (Fig. 2C). We hypothesized that the slower migrating protein species corresponds to the enzyme with covalently bound ribavirin (RMP-enzyme). The addition of pyrophosphate to the typical RNA guanylyltransferase reaction has been shown to reverse the reaction, i.e. promote the release of GTP by reversal of the reaction (18Shuman S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7237-7245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Venkatesan S. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore added pyrophosphate to the reaction to evaluate if the formation of the RMP-D1-(1-545) complex was reversible. Our results demonstrate that the slower migrating protein species was converted into the faster migrating species following incubation with pyrophosphate. These data clearly demonstrate that the D1-(1-545) protein can form a covalent RMP-enzyme complex and that the reaction is reversible. In the typical RNA guanylyltransferase reaction, the nucleophilic attack on the α-phosphate of GTP by the enzyme results in the formation of a covalent intermediate in which GMP is linked via a phosphoamide bond to a lysine residue of the enzyme (18Shuman S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Niles E.G. Christen L. Virology. 1993; 193: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Cong P. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7256-7260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the nature of the enzyme-RMP linkage, the RMP-D1-(1-545) labeled complex was isolated by gel filtration and submitted to chemical treatment, and the products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 3B). The RMP-D1-(1-545) intermediate was resistant to NaOH treatment, but treatments with HCl or NH2OH resulted in the release of RMP, which is indicative of a phosphoamide linkage. As a control, the D1-(1-545) protein was labeled with GMP and analyzed in parallel to confirm the nature of the phosphoamide bond (Fig. 3A). Transfer of RMP to RNA—The D1-(1-545) protein clearly has the ability to form a covalent RMP-enzyme intermediate, but can it transfer RMP to an RNA substrate containing a 5′-diphosphate end? Because the D1-(1-545) protein harbors both the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase active sites, the enzyme can hydrolyze the 5′-triphosphate end of RNAs to generate a 5′-diphosphate end that can subsequently serve as a substrate for capping. The ability of the enzyme to transfer RMP to an acceptor RNA molecule was tested by incubating the D1-(1-545) protein with [3H]RTP, an RNA substrate (84 nucleotides) containing a triphosphate 5′-end and magnesium. The products of the reaction were extracted with phenol/chloroform to remove the radiolabeled protein, and the RNA acceptor molecules were recovered by ethanol precipitation. Aliquots of the RNA samples were then digested with nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase and analyzed by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography (Fig. 4B). The transfer of radiolabeled RMP to RNA was confirmed by demonstrating the release of a RpppG structure following digestion of the RNA samples with nuclease P1, with a simultaneous resistance to alkaline phosphatase treatment. Similar patterns were obtained when radiolabeled GTP was used in these experiments (Fig. 4A). We conclude that the D1-(1-545) protein can transfer the RMP moiety to an RNA acceptor molecule. A second assay was used to demonstrate the transfer of ribavirin to RNA. A 32P-radiolabeled RNA transcript (84 nucleotides) was synthesized by in vitro transcription and gel-purified after electrophoresis on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. The radiolabeled RNA was then incubated in the presence of the D1-(1-545) protein, ribavirin, and magnesium, and the reaction products were analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As can be seen in Fig. 4B, the addition of ribavirin, magnesium, and the D1-(1-545) protein to the radiolabeled RNA resulted in a slower migrating RNA species. We hypothesized that the slower migrating RNA species results from the addition of the ribavirin moiety to the RNA transcript. As observed in the typical RNA capping reaction, incubation of the reaction product with pyrophosphate drove the reaction in the opposite direction (18Shuman S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7237-7245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Venkatesan S. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that the second step of the reaction, i.e. the D1-(1-545)-mediated transfer of RMP to RNA, is readily reversible. Stability of RNAs Blocked with Ribavirin—The presence of the cap structure found at the 5′-end of eukaryotic mRNAs has been shown to be involved in the stabilization of mRNAs by protecting the 5′-ends from exonucleolytic degradation (17Furuichi Y. LaFiandra A. Shatkin A.J. Nature. 1977; 265: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The presence of a blocking, unmethylated capping guanosine residue at the 5′-end is sufficient for protection against degradation (31Furuichi Y. LaFiandra A. Shatkin A.J. Nature. 1977; 266: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In an effort to evaluate the stability of RNAs capped with ribavirin, in vitro kinetic analyses were performed in the presence of total protein extracts isolated from human HEK293 cells. A radiolabeled RNA transcript (84 nucleotides) was synthesized by in vitro transcription and gel-purified after electrophoresis on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. The radiolabeled RNA was then blocked with either guanosine, ribavirin, or the classical methylated guanosine by incubating the transcript with the D1-(1-545) protein and magnesium. The various RNA species were then recovered by multiple rounds of ethanol precipitation. Note that the presence of a blocking nucleoside (guanosine or ribavirin) was confirmed by thin layer chromatography (data not shown). Radiolabeled RNAs were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of HEK293 total protein extracts, and aliquots were removed at various time points. As observed previously, our data indicate that RNA transcripts with an unblocked 5′-end are degraded more rapidly than RNAs blocked with GTP. The informative finding is that RNAs blocked with ribavirin are significantly more stable than unblocked RNAs (Fig. 5). In fact, 65% of the unblocked RNAs are degraded after 30 min in comparison to 20% for RNAs blocked with ribavirin. As shown in Fig. 5, the stability of RNAs harboring a RpppN 5′-end is similar to the stability of RNAs possessing a GpppN 5′-end. We conclude that the presence of a blocking ribavirin residue at the 5′-end of RNAs can protect them from exonucleolytic degradation. Translation of RNAs Blocked with Ribavirin—The presence of the 7-methyl group of the classical methylated guanosine 5′ cap has been shown previously to be critical for cap-dependent translation (32Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996Google Scholar). Various studies have demonstrated that the 7-methylguanosine interacts with the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a phylogenetically conserved subunit of the heterotrimeric eIF4F initiation complex, and establishes the foundation for the assembly of a functional translational initiation complex (33Niedzwiecka A.

In an effort to investigate the relation between translation and stability of RNA transcripts blocked with ribavirin, in vitro translation studies were performed using wheat germ cell-free extracts (Fig. 5B). It is worth emphasizing that all attempts to methylate RNAs blocked with ribavirin by the vaccinia virus capping machinery were unsuccessful (data not shown). Our in vitro translation data indicate that only the RNA transcripts blocked with the classical m7GpppG cap structure were efficiently translated (Fig. 5B). Unblocked RNA transcripts, or RNAs blocked with either guanosine or ribavirin, were not efficiently translated. Overall, these results indicate that RNAs blocked with ribavirin are not efficie"

Our previous work demonstrated the inhibitory activity of the p38 pathway in Ras proliferative signaling in experimental NIH 3T3 cells (Chen, G., Hitomi, M., Han, J., and Stacey, D. W. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 38973-38980). Here we explore the therapeutic potential of p38 kinase activation in human colon cancer cells with and without endogenous K-ras activation. p38 activation by both adenovirus-mediated gene delivery of constitutively active p38 activator MKK6 and by arsenite selectively induces cell death in K-ras-activated human colon cancer HCT116 cells but not in the K-ras-disrupted HCT116-derived sublines. The cell death-inducing effect of MKK6 is not because of its selective activation of p38 kinase or its downstream transcription factor substrates, ATF-2 or c-Jun, in K-ras-activated cells. Rather, cell death in K-ras-activated cells is linked to the down-regulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) by an AP-1-dependent mechanism. Forced VDR expression in K-ras-activated cells inhibits p38 activation-induced cell death, and inhibition of endogenous VDR protein expression in K-ras-disrupted cells increased the arsenite-induced toxicity. Analysis of an additional two human colon cancer cell lines with and without K-ras mutation also showed a K-ras- and VDR-dependent toxicity of MKK6. Hence, p38 pathway activation selectively induces cell death in K-ras-mutated human colon cancer cells by mechanisms involving the suppression of VDR activity. ras is the most characterized oncogene in human cancer, and yet there are no effective therapeutics to selectively target this oncogene.

Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Of these MAPKs, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is most critical in Ras-induced proliferation and transformation (13Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Activation of this cascade has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for Ras transformation (14Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J.

Accordingly, efforts have been made to inhibit this key pathway with specific MEK inhibitors to explore the therapeutic potential (18Sebolt-Leopold J. Dudley D.T. Herrera R. Van Becelaere K.

The MEK/ERK pathway, however, is also required for normal cellular proliferation in response to growth factors. Consequently, the usefulness of the inhibition of MEK/ERK activity to suppress the ras oncogene-induced cancers remains to be further verified. In addition to the mitogenic ERK pathway, Ras also signals to the JNK and p38 stress MAP kinases (13Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Oncogene ras is known to activate JNK and its physiological substrate c-Jun (20Westwick J.K. Cox A.D.

Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway was also shown to be required for Ras transformation in many cell types because JNK inhibition suppresses Ras-induced transformation (22Clark G.J. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1677-1681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and Ras-transforming activity is compromised in c-Jun knock-out cells (23Johnson R. Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cooperative role of the JNK pathway, our previous work demonstrated that the p38 MAPK pathway is inhibitory in Ras mitogenic signaling (24Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This was shown by the fact that oncogene Ras activates p38 and its downstream kinases PRAK and MK2 in NIH 3T3 cells, and each of these kinases in turn suppresses Ras-induced proliferation (24Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of p38 kinase on Ras activity was further confirmed in rat intestine epithelial cells in which the p38 inhibition by SB drugs leads to an increased growth of Rastransformed cells in soft agar (25Pruitt K. Pruitt W.M. Bilter G.K. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31808-31817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, the p38 activation in human mammary epithelial cells appeared to be specific to H-Ras but not to N-Ras (26Kim M.S. Lee E.J. Kim H.R.C. Moon A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5454-5461PubMed Google Scholar), and higher levels of phosphorylated p38 proteins were even shown to be able to predict an in vivo growth inhibitory response in several human breast and prostate tumor cell lines (27Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Estrada Y. Liu D. Ossowski L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1684-1695PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, human colon cancer cells with and without activated K-ras were used to address whether activation of p38 kinase is selectively toxic to K-ras-activated human colon cancer cells. Our results demonstrate that p38 activation by genetic as well as pharmacological means selectively induces cell death in K-ras-activated human colon cancers. This effect was further shown to occur through down-regulation of the AP-1 target gene vitamin D receptor (VDR). cDNA Constructs and Cell Lines—The construct of the recombinant adenovirus vector containing HA-tagged constitutively active MKK6 (ad-MKK6) was prepared as previously described (28Wang X.

A FLAG-tagged constitutively active p38 activator MKK6 in a pcDNA3 vector was previously described (32Han J. Lee J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Luciferase Promoter Assay—Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, and 5% CO2. To establish stable VDR expression clones, HCT116 cells were transfected with a V5-tagged VDR construct or a corresponding vector using calcium phosphate (a kit from Promega) and selected with G418 for drug-resistant clones (29Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25884-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For AP-1 and VDR luciferase promoter assay, cells were transiently transfected with AP-1 Luc or VDR-Luc, with or without cotransfection with MKK6, and luciferase activity was determined 48 h later after transfection using a dual luciferase kit from Promega as previously described (29Qi X.

In the case of ARS treatment, the reporter assay was carried out 24 h after the pulse treatment. Experiments with Small Interference RNA to Inhibit Endogenous VDR Expression—To silence endogenous VDR protein expression, a pSUPER (pSR) RNAi kit (catalogue number VEC-pRT-0002; Oligo-Engine) was used. This retrovirus pSR vector is designed to direct transcription from a pair of 64-nt oligonucleotides, which are processed into functional small interference RNA to specifically inactivate selected target genes (40Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). We have selected four target sequences downstream of the start codon of the human VDR gene (coding region) and designed four corresponding 64-mer oligonucleotides (synthesized by IDT Company). These oligonucleotides were cloned into the pSR vector according to the manufacturer's protocol. For infection, the pSR constructs were transfected into the Phoenix-Ampo retrovirus packing cells (ATCC) as previously described (41Tang J. Gordon G.M. Muller M.G. Dahiya M. Foreman K.E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5975-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Two days after the transfection, supernatants were used to infect Hke3 colon cancer cells. One of these sequences (5′-GATGATCCAGAAGCTAGCC-′3 at -1259) in pSR was shown to consistently suppress endogenous VDR protein expression in 293 as well as Hke3 colon cancer cells and was used for the toxicity assay. Cell Death Assay—For cell death, cells were plated at the same density and treated with 20 μm ARS or 40 μm amsacrine (provided by NCI, National Institutes of Health) for 24 h. Infection with adenovirus vector and adenovirus containing MKK6 was carried out as previously reported (29Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25884-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and cell death was analyzed 48 h following infection. Cell death was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay and analyzed by Student's t test for statistical significant difference. Results from the viability assay were confirmed either by morphological observations under light microscope and/or fluorescence-activated cell sorter for a sub-G1 population (30Qi X. Borowicz S.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Western Blotting Analyses—Cells were pulsed-treated with ARS for 30 min and collected in 1× loading buffer to examine for protein expression and protein phosphorylations. In the case of adenovirus infection, cells were collected 24 h postinfection for Western analyses. Protein was separated on an SDS-PAGE, which was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a liquid-transfer system (Bio-Rad). The resultant membrane was typically blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody in 5% milk TBST at 4 °C overnight. Rabbit and goat polyclonal antibodies against VDR (C-20), c-Jun, and ATF-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against phosphorylated p38, JNK, ERK, c-Jun (Ser-63), and ATF-2 and their corresponding forms for total proteins were from Cell Signaling. The membrane was then washed four times with 1× TBST and incubated with the proper peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. The ECL reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the resultant bands were visualized in a PhosphorImager (Amersham Bioscience). Each membrane was typically stripped off and reprobed with additional antibodies for comparison and normalization as described previously (29Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25884-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained from at least one additional experiment. p38 Activation Selectively Induces Cell Death in Human Colon Cancer Cells with K-ras Activation—To examine effects of p38 activation on cell survival of human colon cancer cells with and without endogenous Ras activation, the K-ras-activated HCT116 human colon cancer cell line and its two K-ras-disrupted subclones (Hke3 and HK2-8) were treated with p38 activators. Previous work has demonstrated that disruption of the activated K-ras gene in HCT116 cells by homologous recombination leads to a loss of malignant growth in soft agar and nude mice (35Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). To activate p38 kinase, cells were infected with an adenovirus vector containing a constitutively active MKK6 (ad-MKK6), a specific p38 activator (28Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 32Han J. Lee J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), or a control empty vector (Vect). Moreover, a group of cells was also treated with a typical physiological chemical p38 stimulus, ARS (24Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 44Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar), to confirm results with MKK6 without cDNA overexpression. As shown in Fig. 1A, both ARS and MKK6 selectively induced cell death in HCT116 cells that harbor an activated K-ras (p <0.05 versus control), but the same treatment had no substantial effects on cell viability in K-ras-disrupted HK2-8 and Hke3 subclones (p >0.05 versus Vect control in both lines). Although infection with ad-MKK6 led to a moderate increase in sub-G1 population as well as some morphological alterations in Hke3 and HK2-8 cells (Fig. 1, B and C), these effects are much less than those in K-ras-activated HCT116 cells. Hence, MKK6 and ARS are specifically toxic to K-ras-activated human colon cancer cells. To analyze effects of MKK6 and ARS on p38 activity, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot for p38 phosphorylation using a specific p38 phospho-antibody and compared with levels of phosphorylated ERK and phosphorylated JNK proteins. Also, the effects on c-Jun and ATF-2, transcription factors downstream of the JNK and p38 kinases that are most frequently activated by stress signaling (45van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 46Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar, 47Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 5: E131-E136Crossref Scopus (2145) Google Scholar), were examined. Infection with ad-MKK6 selectively induced p38 phosphorylation without substantial effects on the JNK and ERK activity. These effects occurred similarly in all three cell lines regardless of the Ras status (Fig. 2). Moreover, MKK6 had no effect on c-Jun activity but activated ATF2 in all three cell lines. ATF2 activation was shown as an increased band density as well as a decreased mobility as a result of phosphorylations (48Hayakawa J. Depatie C. Ohmichi M. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20582-20592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The similar effects of MKK6 on p38 and p38 substrates ATF-2 and c-Jun (49Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) in all three cell lines suggest that the cell death-inducing effect of MKK6 is not due to its selective activation of the p38 pathway in HCT116 cells. Although ARS treatment similarly stimulates p38 phosphorylation in three cell lines, this chemical, as opposed to MKK6, also activates JNK and ERK, which are more predominant in HCT116 cells in comparison with the K-ras-disrupted lines (Fig. 2). Moreover, ARS appears to specifically phosphorylate c-Jun in K-ras-activated HCT116 cells, an effect that is opposite to that induced by mitogenic stimuli such as serum and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which more strongly activate c-Jun in the K-ras-disrupted Hke3 cells (50Okumura K. Shirasawa S. Nishioka M. Sasazuki T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2445-2450PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in ATF2 protein level and decreased mobility by ARS, on the other hand, were observed in all three cell lines, although these were stronger in HCT116 cells. Activation of three MAPKs (p38, ERK, and JNK) by ARS has been previously described (51Ludwig S. Hoffmeyer A. Goebeler M. Kilian K. Hafner H. Neufeld B. Han J.H. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1917-1922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and some of these multiple effects may be caused by its inhibitory activity on phosphatases (52Cavigelli M. Li W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6269-6289Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Despite the selective stimulation of cellular targets JNK/ERK/c-Jun in HCT116 cells, it is clear that ARS activates the p38 pathway (p38/ATF2) in all three cell lines, regardless of K-ras activation, a similar scenario as with ad-MKK6 infection. These results, again, suggest that p38 activation is apoptotic only in human colon cancer cells that harbor an activated K-ras, possibly as a result of inactivation of anti-apoptotic genes and/or activation of proapoptotic genes through a combined effect of K-ras mutation and p38 activation. p38 Activation Induces an AP-1-dependent Trans-suppression of VDR Gene Expression in K-ras-activated but Not in K-ras-disrupted Colon Cancer Cells—VDR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, which is believed to mediate most, if not all, biological effects of vitamin D3 (53Jones G. Strugnell S.A. Deluca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Although VDR is traditionally considered only to be expressed in vitamin D3 target tissues such as skin, intestine, and kidney (54Stumpf W.E. Sar M. Reid F. Tanaka Y. Science. 1979; 206: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), the VDR transcript and/or its protein product is actually detectable in most of the tissues/cell types examined (53Jones G. Strugnell S.A. Deluca H.F. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 1193-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Our recent work established that VDR in breast cancer cells is trans-activated by a combined AP-1 signal induced by the p38 and JNK stress MAP kinases in a manner independent of ligand vitamin D3 (29Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25884-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that VDR may perform previously unappreciated functions in stress response. To explore whether MKK6- and ARS-induced cell death in HCT116 cells is through the regulation of VDR, p38 activation-regulated VDR protein expressions were determined by Western blot analysis. Of interest, both ad-MKK6 infection and ARS treatment led to a significant reduction of VDR protein expression in the activated Ras-containing HCT116 cells (Fig. 3A). The reduction of VDR protein levels is in contrast to MKK6 and ARS stimulation of VDR in human breast cancer cells (29Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25884-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the colon cancer HCT116 cells, infection with ad-MKK6 resulted in an ∼50% decrease in VDR protein expression (49.4% ± 6.9% of the vector control from three separate experiments). More interestingly, the same treatments had no observable effects on VDR protein levels in K-ras knock-out Hke3 cells (Fig. 3B). The different effects of ad-MKK6 on VDR in HCT116 and Hke3 cell lines are not due to different MKK6 protein expression after adenovirus infection (Fig. 3C). These results thus demonstrated that MKK6 and ARS are specifically inhibitory to VDR protein expression in K-ras-mutated human colon cancer cells. Because MKK6 activates VDR through an AP-1 site in the VDR promoter in human breast cancer cells (29Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25884-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we were then interested to explore whether the difference in VDR regulation is because of different signals from the AP-1 transcription activity. To this end, AP-1-dependent transcription was determined by transient transfection of an AP-1 luciferase reporter (AP-1 Luc) with and without MKK6, and the luciferase activity was determined 48 h after transfection. Results in Fig. 4A showed that MKK6 reduces AP-1 activity in HCT116 cells (p <0.05), but not in Hke3 cells. The AP-1 inhibitory effect in HCT116 cells is specific to p38 activation by MKK6 because a JNK activator, MEKK1, stimulated AP-1 in both cell lines (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that the AP-1 inhibitory effect of MKK6 in K-ras-activated cells represents differences in p38 pathway signal integration at AP-1 that is specifically associated with K-ras activation. It is thus critical to explore further whether this different AP-1 transcriptional activity in cells with and without K-ras activation can lead to a changed regulation of the AP-1 target gene VDR. To examine whether the VDR down-regulation occurs through AP-1-dependent transcription, a 0.5-kb mouse VDR luciferase promoter (Wt-AP1-VDR) (33Jehan F. Deluca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10138-10143Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and its AP-1 site-mutated counterpart (Mt-AP1-VDR) we"
https://openalex.org/W1980891899,"Control of heart rate is a complex process that integrates the function of multiple G protein-coupled receptors and ion channels. Among them, the G protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK or KACh) channels of sinoatrial node and atria play a major role in beat-to-beat regulation of the heart rate. The atrial KACh channels are heterotetrameric proteins that consist of two pore-forming subunits, GIRK1 and GIRK4. Following m2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R) stimulation, KACh channel activation is conferred by the direct binding of G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) to the channel. Here we show that atrial KACh channels are assembled in a signaling complex with Gβγ, G protein-coupled receptor kinase, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase, two protein phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, receptor for activated C kinase 1, and actin. This complex would enable the KACh channels to rapidly integrate β-adrenergic and M2R signaling in the membrane, and it provides insight into general principles governing spatial integration of different transduction pathways. Furthermore, the same complex might recruit protein kinase C (PKC) to the KACh channel following α-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Our electro-physiological recordings from single atrial KACh channels revealed a potent inhibition of Gβγ-induced channel activity by PKC, thus validating the physiological significance of the observed complex as interconnecting site where signaling molecules congregate to execute a coordinated control of membrane excitability. Control of heart rate is a complex process that integrates the function of multiple G protein-coupled receptors and ion channels. Among them, the G protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK or KACh) channels of sinoatrial node and atria play a major role in beat-to-beat regulation of the heart rate. The atrial KACh channels are heterotetrameric proteins that consist of two pore-forming subunits, GIRK1 and GIRK4. Following m2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R) stimulation, KACh channel activation is conferred by the direct binding of G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) to the channel. Here we show that atrial KACh channels are assembled in a signaling complex with Gβγ, G protein-coupled receptor kinase, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase, two protein phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, receptor for activated C kinase 1, and actin. This complex would enable the KACh channels to rapidly integrate β-adrenergic and M2R signaling in the membrane, and it provides insight into general principles governing spatial integration of different transduction pathways. Furthermore, the same complex might recruit protein kinase C (PKC) to the KACh channel following α-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Our electro-physiological recordings from single atrial KACh channels revealed a potent inhibition of Gβγ-induced channel activity by PKC, thus validating the physiological significance of the observed complex as interconnecting site where signaling molecules congregate to execute a coordinated control of membrane excitability. The response of the heart to parasympathetic stimulation relies on activation of cardiac KACh channels by acetylcholine, via stimulation of m2-muscarinic receptors and consequent activation of the heterotrimeric G proteins coupled to these receptors. The atrial KACh channels are tetrameric proteins composed of two homologous subunits, GIRK1 1The abbreviations used are: GIRK channel, G protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (KACh channel); M2R, m2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; PKA, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase; PP, protein phosphatase; RACK, receptor for activated C kinase; Cav1.2, L-type Ca2+ channel; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A.1The abbreviations used are: GIRK channel, G protein-regulated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (KACh channel); M2R, m2-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; PKA, cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase; PP, protein phosphatase; RACK, receptor for activated C kinase; Cav1.2, L-type Ca2+ channel; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A.

Each GIRK subunit consists of two transmembrane helixes (TM1 and TM2), a P region, and cytoplasmic NH2- and COOH-terminal domains. The transmembrane helixes and the P regions of the GIRK subunits are thought to form the canonical transmembrane pore of the channel (4Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J.H. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M.

Following M2R stimulation, KACh channel activation is conferred by direct binding of G protein βγ subunits probably to multiple cytoplasmic regions of the GIRK subunits (for review see Ref. 6Yamada M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 723-757PubMed Google Scholar). While the KACh channels are activated by Gβγ, their function is modulated by a large number of signaling molecules, including cytoplasmic ATP (7Kim D. J.

Nature. 1989; 337: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) are also involved in the modulation of KACh channel activity. Furthermore, Gα and GTPase-activating proteins such as regulators of G protein signaling can quench KACh channel activation by Gβγ (14Peleg S. Varon D. Ivanina T. Dessauer C.W. Dascal N.

Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29709-29716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The large number of signaling proteins involved in the modulation of KACh channel function raises the possibility that some or all of these molecules might be organized in a macromolecular complex. The molecular size of native channels determined by size exclusion chromatography further supports this hypothesis and is consistent with two KACh channel configurations, single GIRK12/GIRK42 heterotetramers, and large protein complexes containing KACh channels (21Corey S. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27499-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The composition of such complexes would have important ramifications for the control of membrane excitability and heart rate. We therefore set out to investigate the macromolecular KACh channel complexes and their components. We immunopurified KACh channels from rat atrial membranes and found that these channels are associated with Gβγ, G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK), PKA, two protein phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), and actin. To identify the functional role of RACK 1 association with KACh channels we investigated the effect of PKC on Gβγ-activated KACh channel currents. PKC induced a potent inhibition of these currents, thus confirming the physiological significance of the observed signaling complex. Antibodies and Reagents—Unless otherwise noted, the antibodies were mouse monoclonal and were used at 1:1000 dilution for immunoblotting. Most of the antibodies were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and include the anti-Gβ, anti-PP1, anti-PP2A catalytic α, anti-PKAc (1:500), anti-PKCα, anti-PKCβ (1:250), anti-RACK1, anti-Ras (1:200), anti-Rho (1:60), anti-Rac1, anti-Caveolin 1, anti-Caveolin 3 (1:5000), and anti-Cdc42 (1:250) antibodies. Other antibodies used in this study are the anti-muscarinic m2 acetylcholine receptor, rabbit anti-K+ channel GIRK1 (polyclonal, 1:60), normal mouse IgG (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA); rabbit anti-m2 muscarinic receptor (polyclonal, 1:200), rabbit anti-Cav1.2a (polyclonal, 1:100) (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel); rabbit anti-GIRK1, NT (polyclonal), anti-GRK 2/3 (βARK1/2) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); rabbit anti-Gα (polyclonal), phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine detection kits (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA); and rabbit anti-actin (polyclonal, 1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-linked mouse and rabbit whole antibodies, ECL Plus reagents, and Rainbow Molecular Weight Markers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG and M-450 rat anti-mouse IgM were from Dynal Biotech Inc. (Lake Success, NY). Purified PKC (mixture of α, β, and γ isoforms) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Immobilon-PSQ transfer membrane was purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). All electrophoretic and Western blotting reagents were provided by Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). All other chemicals used in this study were of molecular biology grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Atrial tissue, obtained in accordance with institutional guidelines from adult Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.), was homogenized in five volumes of ice-cold HME buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA), containing 0.32 m sucrose and protease inhibitor (PI)mix (20 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a Polytron homogenizer at half speed for 10 s, followed by 10 strokes in a glass Potter-Elvehjem type homogenizer. The homogenate was filtered and centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. The pellet was washed once with HME-PI buffer, and the combined supernatants were centrifuged further at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The resulting crude membrane pellet was washed twice with HME-PI buffer, resuspended in buffer HME-PI containing 0.32 m sucrose in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (tight pestle), quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in aliquots at -70 °C until use. For the PKC translocation experiments, excised atria were equilibrated in oxygenated solution containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1.6 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 5 glucose, pH 7.4, stimulated with 10 μm phenylephrine for 10 min at room temperature and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Unstimulated tissue processed in parallel was used as a control. Membrane-associated proteins were solubilized according to a protocol previously used by us for purification of heterotrimeric G proteins (22Ivanova-Nikolova T.T. Nikolov E.N. Hansen C. Robishaw J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated for 3 h in MEB buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% sodium cholate, and 0.45% IGEPAL CA-630) with PI. The cholate-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitations. Protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad Dc protein assay against a standard curve of BSA. For the experiments, labeled “GDP” in Fig. 7, all buffers in the procedures described above contained 100 μm GDP. Immunoprecipitations were performed with Dynal magnetic beads according to the manufacturer's protocol using a magnetic particle concentrator (Dynal, Lake Success, NY). The use of magnetic beads eliminates the centrifugation steps in the immunoprecipitation process. Consequently, a possible contamination of the immunoprecipitation product by large protein complexes that might be trapped within antibody-protein A/G beads latticework during centrifugation is avoided. Briefly, beads were washed thoroughly with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA (PBS/BSA) and incubated for 1 h with rotation at 4 °C with the anti-phosphoserine (4A9 clone) or anti-Gβ antibodies at a concentration of 3 μg per 1.2 × 107 M-450 rat anti-mouse IgM beads, or anti-M2R (Oncogene) antibody, or normal mouse IgG at a concentration of 3 μg per 1.8 × 107 M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG beads. All antibodies used for immunoprecipitation recognized only the protein of interest in the atrial membranes. Coated beads were washed twice with PBS/BSA and once with PBS. 400 μg of solubilized membrane proteins (at 5 mg/ml) was diluted 6.7-fold with appropriate buffer to a final concentration of 0.15% sodium cholate, 0.3%, IGEPAL, 25 HEPES, pH 8.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated with the coated beads for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The complexed beads were collected by magnetic precipitation, washed four times with PBS/0.1% IGEPAL, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% v/v glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% bromphenol blue), and heated for 5 min at 95 °C (70 °C for M2R detection). The eluted proteins were separated by Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE using an 11% gel and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-Psq membranes. Following blocking in LTB (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, containing 5% dry milk) for 1 h at room temperature, sections of the membrane containing the molecular mass range of proteins of interest were incubated with the appropriate antibodies at 4 °C for 14 h. After three washes in LTB, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and antibody complexes were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. Single-channel Recordings and G Protein Purification—Unitary currents through KACh channels were recorded from inside-out patches of neonatal rat atrial myocytes using a standard high resolution patch-clamp method (23Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar) as previously described (22Ivanova-Nikolova T.T. Nikolov E.N. Hansen C. Robishaw J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The composition of the bath solution was (in mm): 150 KCl, 5 EGTA, 5 glucose, 1.6 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4); the composition of the pipette solution was (in mm): 150 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1.6 MgCl2, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). The modal behavior of Gβ1γ7-activated KACh channels was analyzed in the context of a model that assumes four functional modes of a single KACh channel arising from different occupancy of four equivalent and independent Gβγ sensors in the channel, as previously described (22Ivanova-Nikolova T.T. Nikolov E.N. Hansen C. Robishaw J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The continuous records were divided into 400-ms consecutive segments, and the frequency of apparent openings, f, was calculated for each data segment. The results from all active data segments recorded under identical experimental conditions were then combined to generate a frequency distribution. The f histograms were subsequently fitted by a sum of gamma components,Γ(f)=∑Nk(f/fk2)exp(−f/fk)(Eq. 1) to determine the characteristic fk values and the relative occupancy of different gating modes, Fk (Fk = Nk/ΣNk). For each f histogram, the probability of Gβγ binding, P, was computed from the relative occupancy of mode 1, F1, according to the Equation 2.F1=4P(1−P)3/[1−(1−P)4](Eq. 2) The relative occupancy of the remaining modes, Fk, was then examined as a function of the parameter P to verify that experimental Fk estimates were consistent with the theoretically derived probability of observing mode k,FkT=[N!/k!(N−k)!]Pk(1−P)N−k(Eq. 3) where P is the probability of Gβγ binding to one of four G protein sensors in KACh channel structure, and N = 4. For each experimental condition, the fraction of blank data segments due to KACh channel desensitization, FD, was calculated as the difference, (F0E - F0T), where F0E is the experimentally determined fraction of blank data segments, and F0T is the predicted fraction of time the channel spends with no Gβγ bound to it. The F0T fraction, F0T = (1 - P)4, was calculated from the probability of Gβγ binding, P, according to Equation 3. G protein Gβ1γ7 dimers were expressed and purified from Sf9 cells in the Laboratory of Dr. Janet Robishaw as described previously (22Ivanova-Nikolova T.T. Nikolov E.N. Hansen C. Robishaw J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunopurification of a Macromolecular Complex Containing GIRK 1—Previous immunopurifications using antibodies against N- and C-terminal domains of GIRK1 yielded only the single GIRK12/GIRK42 heterotetramers but not large KACh channel protein complexes (3Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 24Corey S. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5271-5278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In such multimeric complexes, N- and C-terminal domains of GIRK1 might be bound to other proteins and, thus, rendered unavailable for antibody binding. Therefore, initially we sought to identify an antibody suitable for immunoprecipitation of the macromolecular KACh channel complexes. In rat atrial membranes, GIRK1 protein exists in two isoforms, migrating at 54 and 64-65 kDa (Fig. 1A), which correspond to the core and the glycosylated form of GIRK1 (3Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The native GIRK1 is also constitutively phosphorylated on serine/threonine residue(s) (20Medina I. Krapivinsky G. Arnold S. Kovoor P. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29709-29716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We therefore screened a panel of monoclonal antibodies, specific for different serine and threonine phosphorylated sites, for their ability to recognize GIRK1. Six of the phospho-specific antibodies either did not recognize any proteins in the atrial membrane extracts or identified multiple protein bands. In contrast, the phosphoserine-specific 4A9 clone consistently recognized a single protein band of ∼54 kDa in the atrial membranes (Fig. 1B). According to the supplier (Calbiochem), the 4A9 clone was generated against a phosphoserine conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, using a proprietary technology, and preferentially recognizes phosphoserine residues directly neighbored to positively charged amino acids. To determine whether the 54-kDa polypeptide is the core form of GIRK1, we immunoprecipitated KACh channels from atrial membrane lysate with antibodies against the N terminus of GIRK1 (25Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7137-7150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent immunoblotting confirmed that the 4A9 antibody detected the core form of the immunoprecipitated GIRK1 (Fig. 1C); interestingly, this antibody did not recognize the glycosylated form of GIRK1. In a reciprocal experiment we investigated the ability of 4A9 antibodies to immunoprecipitate the cardiac GIRK1. Atrial membrane lysates were incubated with 4A9 antibodies, and the resulting immunocomplexes were analyzed by silver staining (Fig. 1D). The 4A9 immunocomplexes contained four prominent bands with molecular masses of 80 kDa (labeled P80), 65 kDa (labeled Gly-GIRK1), 54 kDa (labeled GIRK1), 44 kDa (labeled P44), and four additional bands migrating between 37 and 32 kDa (Fig. 1D, lane 2). The 54- and 65-kDa bands corresponded in size to the two forms of GIRK1, and their identity was confirmed by immunoblotting of a gel run in parallel with antibodies to GIRK1 (Fig. 1E). The 44-kDa protein migrated at the predicted size of GIRK4, which is known to co-immunoprecipitate with GIRK1 (3Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). None of the protein bands observed in the 4A9 immunoprecipitate were detected in the product from a parallel immunoprecipitation using normal mouse IgG (Fig. 1D, lane 1). Because the phosphoserine-specific 4A9 antibody recognized only the GIRK1 protein in atrial membranes as shown in Fig. 1B, the additional proteins in the 4A9-immunoprecipitate should be components of a native multimeric complex containing GIRK1. We further sought to establish the identity of the proteins associated with the KACh channels. Composition of GIRK1 Signaling Complex—The spatial organization of GPCR, G protein, and GIRK channel within a pre-coupled complex in the membrane was suggested as a potential mechanism for achieving specificity of the signal transduction from a particular receptor to the channel (26Huang C.-L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1133-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To determine whether the KACh channels pre-assemble with the M2R and Gβγ, solubilized atrial membranes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against M2R, phosphoserine (clone 4A9), or Gβ, followed by immunoblotting for M2R, GIRK1, and Gβ. We found that GIRK1 co-precipitated with Gβγ and, conversely, Gβ immunoprecipitates contained GIRK1 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, parallel analysis of Gβ- and 4A9-immunocomplexes by silver staining revealed that Gβ antibodies immunoprecipitated the same set of proteins found in the 4A9 product (data not shown). The M2R, however, was not detected in both 4A9 and Gβ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A). In a reciprocal immunoprecipitation of the endogenous M2Rs, we did not detect an association between M2R and GIRK1 or Gβ (Fig. 2A). Thus, in atrial membranes we demonstrated the presence of an endogenous GIRK1-Gβγ complex that, under the described experimental conditions, did not contain M2R. Recruiting of G protein-coupled receptor kinases to specific membrane domains of active GPCR signaling is a ubiquitous function of Gβγ that leads to termination of G protein activation (27Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether GRK2, which regulates the desensitization of both β-adrenergic and m2-muscarinic receptors in the heart (28Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), is also associated with the GIRK1-Gβγ complex. GRK2/3 was detected as a single band of 80 kDa in the atrial membrane lysate (Fig. 2B). Immunoblotting of GIRK1 and Gβ immunocomplexes for GRK2/3 revealed the association of these proteins with the oligomeric complex (Fig. 2B) and identified the P80 as GRK2/3. Binding of GRK2 and Gα to Gβγ is mutually exclusive due to their overlapping binding sites on the surface of Gβγ (29Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G.

Tesmer J.J.G. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). To determine whether a fraction of the Gβ in the GIRK1 complex is in the form of a G protein heterotrimer, we immunoblotted the 4A9 and Gβ immunoprecipitates for Gα (Fig. 2B). Gα was not detected in these experiments, indicating the absence of heterotrimeric G proteins in the GIRK1-Gβγ complexes described here. However, the possibility that KACh channel-heterotrimeric G protein complexes exist in atrial cells but are disrupted during detergent solubilization of membrane proteins cannot be excluded.

We therefore investigated whether PKA and PP2A are also associated with GIRK1-Gβγ complexes. PKA, PP1, and PP2A were present in relatively small amounts in both 4A9 and Gβ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B), indicating that these proteins are not only involved in the regulation of KACh channel function but are also components of the channel complex. PP2A was also found in the M2R immunoprecipitation product (Fig. 2B). The purified GIRK1 protein is also a substrate for PKC phosphorylation (20Medina I. Krapivinsky G. Arnold S. Kovoor P.

Stimulation of atrial α-adrenergic receptors by phenylephrine is associated with translocation of PKCβ to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3). Because RACK1 has been identified as the specific anchoring protein for PKCβ (32Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we investigated whether RACK1 is associated with the oligomeric KACh channel complex by probing the M2R, 4A9, and Gβ immunoprecipitates with antibodies against RACK1. Endogenous atrial RACK1, migrating at 33 kDa, was found present in both 4A9 and Gβ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B). Suppression of KACh Channel Activity by PKC—Several studies have implicated PKC in the regulation of heterologously expressed GIRK channels (reviewed in Ref. 33Leaney J.L. Dekker L.V. Tinker A. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because RACK1 might provide the structural link between PKC and the native atrial KACh channels, we evaluated the effect of PKC phosphorylation on channel activation by Gβγ. Single KACh channels residing in membrane patches excised from rat atrial myocytes were activated by purified recombinant Gβγ, and then purified PKC was applied to the cytoplasmic side of the patch in the presence of Mg-ATP. Application of a mixture of purified PKC isotypes (40 pg/μl) caused a potent suppression of Gβγ-activated KACh channel currents (Fig. 4). The suppression of the KACh channel activity developed within 2 min following PKC application and was sustained during the continued presence of PKC. In control experiments, heat-inactivated PKC had no effect on the Gβγ-induced KACh channel activity (Fig. 5A). Recently, mutagenesis analysis of heter"
https://openalex.org/W2121918573,"Physical association between the transcription factor GATA-1 and the cofactor, Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1), is essential for the differentiation of two blood cell types, erythroid cells and megakaryocytes. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms that modulate their interaction within cells. In the present study, we have identified TACC3 as a FOG-1-interacting protein. Transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3), a protein that is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, has been reported to have a critical role in the expansion of immature hematopoietic progenitors. We show that TACC3 affects FOG-1 nuclear localization, altering the interaction between GATA-1 and FOG-1. However, GATA-1 competes with TACC3 in the interaction with FOG-1. We observe that high levels of TACC3 inhibit the function of FOG-1 as a transcriptional cofactor of GATA-1. Furthermore, forced expression of TACC3 to levels similar to those found in progenitor cells delays terminal maturation of MEL and G1ER cells, two cell models of erythroid cell development. We suggest a role for TACC3 in regulating the cellular distribution of FOG-1 and thus the direct interaction of GATA-1 and FOG-1 as a mechanism to control the transition between expansion of multipotential progenitor cell populations and final stages of erythroid maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2136867879,"The biosynthesis of 4-thiouridine (s4U) in Escherichia coli tRNA requires the action of both the thiamin pathway enzyme ThiI and the cysteine desulfurase IscS. IscS catalyzes sulfur transfer from l-cysteine to ThiI, which utilizes Mg-ATP to activate uridine 8 in tRNA and transfers sulfur to give s4U. In this work, we show through deletion analysis of unmodified E. coli tRNAPhe that the minimum substrate for s4U modification is a mini-helix comprising the stacked acceptor and T stems containing an internal bulged region. The size of the bulged loop must be at least 4 nucleotides and contain the target uridine as the first nucleotide. Replacement of the T loop sequence with a tetraloop in the deletion substrate increases activity and shows that the TψC primary sequence is not a recognition element. An unmodified tRNAPhe transcript in which the 3′-terminal ACCA sequence is removed to give a blunt terminus has <0.1% activity, although the addition of a single overhanging base essentially restores activity. In addition, reducing the distance of the 3′ terminus relative to U8 by as little as 1 bp severely impairs activity. By dissecting a minimal RNA substrate in the T loop region, a two-piece system consisting of a substrate RNA and a “guide” RNA is efficiently modified. Our results indicate that outside of the modified U8, there is no primary sequence requirement for substrate recognition. However, the secondary and tertiary structure restrictions appear sufficient to explain why s4U modification is limited in the cell to tRNA.

However, the secondary and tertiary structure restrictions appear sufficient to explain why s4U modification is limited in the cell to tRNA. All organisms chemically modify the bases of their tRNA (1Bjork G.R. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 165-205Google Scholar, 2Limbach P.A. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2183-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The purpose of these modified nucleosides is varied. Many modifications stabilize codon-anticodon interactions and affect codon specificity while maintaining the correct reading frame (3Urbonavicius J. Qian Q. Durand J.M. Hagervall T.G. Bjork G.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4863-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Others are required for tRNA recognition by their cognate aminoacyl synthetase (4Sylvers L.A. Rogers K.C. Shimizu M. Ohtsuka E. Soll D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 5Madore E. Florentz C. Giege R. Sekine S. Yokoyama S. Lapointe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1128-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and for ribosome binding (6Ashraf S.S. Sochacka E. Cain R. Guenther R. Malkiewicz A. Agris P.F. RNA. 1999; 5: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that some modifications are involved in metabolic responses to the environment of the cell (7Persson B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because each modification is enzymatically introduced at the post-transcriptional level, the modification enzymes must recognize a specific base within a highly structured tRNA molecule. These systems thus provide another context for the study of protein-RNA interactions. The thionucleoside 4-thiouridine (s4U) 1The abbreviations used are: s4U, 4-thiouridine; APM, acryloylaminophenylmercury(II) chloride; nt, nucleotide; WT, wild type. is found at position 8 in the tRNA of bacteria and archea. Its biological role appears to be the result of its photochemical reactivity. Irradiation of bacteria can cause a photocross-link in specific tRNAs between s4U at position 8 and cytidine at position 13 (8Favre A. Yaniv M. Michelson M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Some of the cross-linked tRNAs are poor substrates for aminoacylation (9Blondel M.O. Favre A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The physiological result of near UV exposure in Escherichia coli (10Thomas G. Favre A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 66: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and Salmonella enterica Serovar typhimurium (11Kramer G.F. Baker J.C. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2344-2351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is an s4U-dependent growth delay and induction of the stringent response to amino acid starvation. Thus, s4U in tRNA appears to be important in vivo as a physiological sensor for near UV radiation exposure. In vitro, s4U has found use as an effectively zero-length photocross-linking agent (12Chavatte L. Seit-Nebi A. Dubovaya V. Favre A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5302-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13Yu Y.-T. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4691-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as well as a chemoselective site for the attachment of biophysical probes (15Hara H. Horiuchi T. Saneyoshi M. Nishimura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Qin P.Z. Hideg K. Feigon J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6772-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Initial work on s4U biosynthesis in E. coli found a requirement for two enzymes (Fig. 1) (17Lipsett M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1458-1461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thiI gene was shown to be required for s4U synthesis in E. coli by Mueller et al. (18Mueller E.G. Buck C.J. Palenchar P.M. Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and for thiazole biosynthesis in Salmonella typhimurium by Webb et al. (19Webb E. Class K. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4399-4402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We later found that the cysteine desulfurase IscS was required for s4U synthesis both in vitro (20Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and in vivo (21Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-20103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and demonstrated in vitro s4U synthesis with an unmodified tRNA substrate. We have shown through gel mobility shift assays that ThiI and not IscS binds to tRNA and that ThiI binds ATP, most probably for activation of the uridine via adenylation (22Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2424-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mechanism involves mobilization of sulfur from cysteine by IscS in the form of an enzyme-bound persulfide (23Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 24Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which is then transferred to a cysteine residue on ThiI before final insertion into U8 of tRNA (25Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. Cheng H. Larson T.J. Mueller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8283-8286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10727-10730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Wright C.M. Palenchar P.M. Mueller E.G. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2003; : 2708-2709PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the final sulfur transfer step is unclear, but it has been recently shown that ThiI is oxidized to a disulfide under single turnover conditions (28Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Buck C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33588-33595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, ThiI has the multiple roles of binding tRNA, activating O4 of uridine 8 using Mg-ATP while accepting a sulfur atom from IscS and transferring it to the 4-position to give the final product, s4U. The targeted uridine 8 for s4U biosynthesis is essentially invariant in cytosolic tRNAs. Fig. 2 shows the position of U8 in different representations of the canonical l-shaped tRNA structure. In E. coli, all of the tRNAs contain s4U to some extent, although the levels of s4U in particular tRNAs are found to vary with growth rate (29Emilsson V. Naslund A.K. Kurland C.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4499-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because of the prevalence of the modification, it is reasonable to propose that the tertiary structure and not primary sequence is the major structural determinant for substrate activity. In the structure of most cytosolic tRNAs, U8 is involved in a reverse Hoogsteen base pair with A14, whereas the 2′-hydroxyl of U8 is hydrogen-bonded to A21 (30Dirheimer G. Keith G. Dumas P. Westhof E. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure Biosynthesis and Function. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 93-126Google Scholar). The U8-A14 interaction is particularly important for the formation of the core of the tRNA structure by bringing the D loop in closer proximity for base pairing with residues in the T loop (see Fig. 2). An examination of a space-filling model of yeast tRNAPhe suggests that although O4 of U8 is not involved in direct tertiary interactions, access to O4 is restricted in the folded structure. Thus, ThiI to some extent must invade the tRNA structure or trap a transient partially unfolded intermediate to catalyze the chemistry at O4. To gain insight on how ThiI recognizes its tRNA substrate, we report on the substrate specificity for s4U modification using variants of unmodified E. coli tRNAs. General—ThiI and IscS were overproduced from expression plasmids in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (20Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). T7 RNA polymerase was purified from strain BL21(pAR219), which was a generous gift of F. Studier. Acryloyl aminophenylmercury(II) chloride (APM) for affinity electrophoresis was prepared as described previously (31Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and used as a stock solution of 1 mg/ml in formamide. l-[35S]Cysteine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DE81 DEAE filter discs were from Whatman. Oligodeoxynucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies and were purified by denaturing PAGE before use. Dideoxysequencing of cloned DNA templates was performed by the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. Preparation of RNA Substrates—RNA substrates were obtained by runoff transcription using T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (32Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Templates for the preparation of short RNAs (<50 nt) were single-stranded DNA oligomers comprising the antisense of the desired RNA sequence and a 5′-17-nt region that is the antisense of the T7 promoter. For example, the template for TPHE39A is 5′-TGG TGC CCG GAC TTG GTT TCC CAA GGA CAC TAT CCG GGC TAT AGT GAG TCG TAT TA-3′ where the underlined region is complementary to the T7 promoter. This single-stranded oligonucleotide is annealed to an 18-bp DNA oligonucleotide containing the sense strand of the T7 promoter and initial G, having the sequence 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG-3′. For longer RNA substrates, double-stranded templates containing the RNA sequence preceded by the T7 promoter sequence were prepared by the method of Peterson et al. (33Peterson E.T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10380-10389Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using two overlapping oligode-oxynucleotides with a 12-bp region of complementarity. For tRNAs, the sense strand was 57 nt and contained the T7 promoter followed by the first 40 nt of the RNA, whereas the antisense strand was 48 nt and contained the last 48 nt of the tRNA, including the 12-nt overlap. The annealed oligonucleotides were extended with reverse transcriptase as described previously (33Peterson E.T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10380-10389Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and used as templates for the in vitro transcription. Double-stranded DNA templates were checked for accuracy by incubation with Taq polymerase for the addition of terminal nucleotide followed by cloning into vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) for sequencing. Transcription reactions contained 1 μm template DNA in a mixture of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 35 mm MgCl2, 5mm each of NTPs, 1 mm spermidine, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100, 8 units of RNasin, and 4 μg of T7 RNA polymerase in a total volume of 1 ml. Reactions were typically run overnight at 37 °C. RNA was purified by denaturing PAGE (8 m urea, 1× Tris borate EDTA), visualized by UV shadowing, and then excised and eluted in 0.5 m NaCl using the crush and soak method. RNAs prepared for 3′-terminal analysis were further purified on 1.5-mm-thick sequencing gels to achieve single nucleotide resolution. Transcription reactions typically resulted in 50–70% RNA of the desired length (N), 20–30% N + 1, and lesser amounts of longer products. Gel-purified RNA was passed through a 0.2 μm syringe filter, ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in Milli Q-purified water, and stored at 20 °C. RNA concentrations were measured by UV absorbance at 260 nm. Yields for RNAs >50 nt in length were consistently ≥0.5 mg/ml transcription reaction. Yields for smaller RNAs varied from 0.2 to 0.4 mg/ml depending on sequence and length. For activity and binding studies, RNAs were folded by heating at 65 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm Na2EDTA, and 5.5 mm MgCl2 or 5.5 mm Mg(OAc)2 for 5 min and slow cooling to room temperature over 30 min. s4U Assays—Assays for s4U synthesis were conducted using DEAE filter discs using a modification of a method described previously (20Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34Harris C.L. Kolanko C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This assay measures the incorporation of 35S from l-[35S]cysteine into tRNA retained on the discs after a series of washing steps. The assay mixture included 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 20 μm l-cysteine, 0.17 μg (50 nm) of ThiI, 1.17 μg (250 nm) of IscS, and 20 μm RNA substrate. For all of the substrates tested, rates of s4U formation at 10 and 20 μm were the same within error. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 6 min at 37 °C. Under these assay conditions, ThiI was rate-limiting and the reaction rate was linear with <10% formation of s4U. The reactions were initiated by adding ThiI immediately followed by IscS. The activity for each RNA substrate (20 μm) was reported as the observed initial rate constant (kobs) calculated as the rate of s4U formation divided by the ThiI concentration. APM Affinity Gel Assays with Sulfide as Substrate—For reactions with sulfide as sulfur source, a gel shift assay using APM polyacrylamide gels was used based on the work of Igloi (31Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This technique incorporates APM into the polyacrylamide gel. The mercury binds to thiouridine groups on the RNA with a Kd = 0.2 μm (35Scheit K.-H. Faerber P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 33: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and acts to retard selectively the mobility of RNAs modified with s4U (31Igloi G.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3842-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of sodium sulfide were prepared shortly before performing the assays by dissolving solid Na2S nonahydrate in water and adjusting the pH to 8 with aqueous 6 n HCl. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) were prepared as described above with the exception of sulfide substituted for IscS and [35S]cysteine. Timed aliquots (25 μl) of each reaction mixture were removed and quenched by the addition of 25 μl of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). After vortexing and centrifugation for 3 min in a microcentrifuge, the top aqueous layer was passed through a 0.5-ml G-50 spin column. To the eluate was added 25 μlof8 m urea with 0.05% bromphenol blue and 0.05% xylene cyanol. An aliquot (25 μl) of this mixture was loaded per gel lane. For tRNAPhe and minor variants, 8% polyacrylamide gels (0.75 mm) containing 100 μm APM in Tris borate EDTA buffer were run on a MiniProtean II (Bio-Rad) apparatus at 170 V for 1 h at room temperature. The bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining in Tris acetate EDTA buffer (10 min) and quantitated using a densitometer. Alternatively, 32P-labeled RNA was utilized and quantitation achieved by PhosphorImager analysis of the dried gel using ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences. Measurements of ThiI Binding to RNA Substrates—For binding studies, mixtures of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm KCl, 1 μm RNA, and variable concentrations of ThiI were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Aliquots of 20 μl were then applied via an 8-channel pipette to a modified 96-well dot-blot filtration apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). The apparatus contained both nitrocellulose (Protran BA85, Schleicher & Schuell) and DEAE filters (DE81, Whatman) essentially as described by Wong and Lohman (36Wong L. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Wells were washed with 100 μl of assay buffer both before and after application of binding mixtures. Filters were then blotted to remove excess liquid and wrapped in plastic wrap prior to phosphorimaging analysis. The fraction bound to protein was measured directly by comparing the amount of 32P-labeled RNA bound to nitrocellulose relative to the amount bound to DE81 anion-exchange filter paper. Measurements were performed in triplicate, and data were corrected for background-nonspecific RNA binding to the nitrocellulose filter. The corrected data were plotted as the fraction of total RNA bound to nitrocellulose versus ThiI concentration, and the resulting plot was fitted to a sigmoidal binding curve using Kaleidograph (Synergy). Assay for Two-piece Trans-s4U Reaction with 45cut.A and 45cut.B RNAs—Reaction mixtures (50 μl of total volume) contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm ATP, 20 μm l-cysteine, 5 μm each of 45cutA and 45cutB RNAs, and 2 μg each of ThiI and IscS. A positive control substrate used was the one-piece substrate TPHE45A at 5 μm, whereas negative control was a reaction with 45cutB RNA omitted. The RNAs were first heated to 85 °C for 2 min and slow-cooled for 1 h in the presence of Tris, MgCl2, and KCl before the remaining ingredients were added to initiate reaction. After 30 min at 37 °C, an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (50:48:2) was added and the mixture was vortexed for 20 s. The layers were separated by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 4 min, and 25 μl of the top aqueous layer was passed through a G-50 spin column and added to 25 ml of 8 m urea containing 0.1% bromphenol blue and 0.1% xylene cyanol FF. This mixture was mixed by vortexing and heated to 90 °C for 3 min and loaded onto two duplicate 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. One of the gels contained 100 μm APM, whereas the other had APM omitted. The gels were run for 45 min at 170 watts in 1× Tris borate EDTA buffer. The gels were then soaked in a solution of ethidium bromide in 1× TAE buffer for 10 min, and RNA was visualized on a UV transilluminator (Fotodyne). Deletion Analysis of tRNAPhe Transcripts—We used a DEAE filter disc assay described previously (34Harris C.L. Kolanko C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) to obtain the specific activity for s4U modification of RNA variants. The assay was measured for the incorporation of 35S from l-[35S]cysteine into tRNA that was specifically bound on the discs, and the rates were assessed in the linear range of the progress curve at <10% of the product formation. Under these conditions, unmodified tRNAPhe gave an initial rate constant (kobs) of 1.0 min–1 at 20 μm (Table I). We found that 20 μm RNA concentration is saturating for all of the RNA variants tested thus far that are substrates. We were not able to obtain accurate Km values because of the limitations of the assay and the apparent low values for Km (<0.1 μm). Using a filter binding assay (36Wong L. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), we were able to measure a Kd value for tRNAPhe of 1.9 μm (Fig. 3), which is considerably higher than the Km estimate. Values for Kd were measured in the absence of other substrates, and this may explain the discrepancy with the Km. In addition, Km may reflect rate constants that indicate a large commitment for catalysis.Table ISpecific activity for s4U modification of tRNA derivatives by IscS and ThiISubstratekobsKdmin-1μmtRNAPhe1.01 ± 0.131.9 ± 0.17tRNAPhe U8CND2.5 ± 0.11tRNAPhe A14U1.03 ± 0.09—tRNAGlu0.44 ± 0.041.7 ± 0.42tRNALys0.89 ± 0.224.2 ± 1.7tRNAArg0.77 ± 0.16—tRNASer-20.67 ± 0.08— Open table in a new tab As shown in Table I, all of the full-length E. coli tRNA transcripts we have studied are good substrates at 20 μm. This is consistent with the study of Emilsson et al. (29Emilsson V. Naslund A.K. Kurland C.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4499-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) who found that all tRNAs contain s4U in vivo, although some are modified more efficiently than others at high growth rates. They reported that tRNAGlu2, now known as the active form of the single tRNAGlu in E. coli (37Tremblay T.L. Lapointe J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), was poorly modified at all of the growth rates studied. We measured the in vitro activity of unmodified tRNAGlu as a substrate and found that it has a lower kobs by over 2-fold. Thus, although the magnitude of the reduced activity is small, it is consistent with their results. Modifications normally present in this tRNA in vivo may modify the activity further. The unmodified transcripts of tRNALys, tRNASer-2, and tRNAArg were also found to be good substrates, consistent with in vivo results (26Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. J. Biol.

Initial efforts to study the structure activity relationship of the tRNA were to introduce subtle disruptions of the tertiary fold in the vicinity of U8. We first mutated the target uridine 8 to make sure our in vitro system was specific for this base alone. An unmodified tRNAPhe transcript containing either a U8C or U8A mutation was inactive as a substrate. Binding studies of WT tRNAPhe and the U8C mutant surprisingly showed no difference in the value of Kd within experimental error (Table I). This finding suggests that the U8C mutant can adopt a structure that is bound by ThiI, but because this structure lacks the target, uridine it is not modified. Because U8 is involved in tertiary interactions with A14, we proceeded to make an analogous change in A14. An A14U mutation would be expected to disrupt the interaction and loosen the tertiary fold and reduce the effective concentration of properly folded tRNA. We found that this mutant had the same activity as the WT tRNA. Thus, relaxation of the tertiary fold has no effect on s4U modification, which may be expected if a nonnative structure is bound by the enzyme. Defining the Minimal RNA Substrate—We subsequently introduced more drastic alterations of the tRNA structure. We sequentially replaced the D, anticodon (AC), and T stem loops with a two-nucleotide spacer and found that these RNAs were good substrates (data not shown). A tRNA mutant lacking both the D and AC stem loops was still processed at 50% of the rate of the full-length tRNA under saturating conditions. Replacement of the TψC loop of this RNA with a GAAA tetraloop resulted in a 39-nt RNA (Fig. 4, TPHE39A) that was an efficient substrate at saturation with activity nearly two-thirds that of the full-length tRNAPhe transcript (Table II). Binding measurements give a Kd of 6 μm, indicating that some binding interactions are lost in the ground state but have little effect during catalysis. This was confirmed by our estimate of the Km for TPHE39A to also be <0.1 μm. A UUCG tetraloop gave similar results. Thus, the conserved T[GRAPHIC]ψC sequence of the T loop is not a recognition element for s4U synthesis in vitro.Table IIKinetic data for small RNA substrates (relative to tRNAPhe) shown in Fig. 5Substratekobsmin-1TPHE39A0.61 ± 0.06Kd = 8.2 ± 1.7TPHE39C(U8A)NDTPHE35A(Blunt)NDTPHE39D(3′-GUUG)0.09 ± 0.01TPHE45A(5′ ext)0.39 ± 0.02TPHE37A (-1BP)NDTPHE47AND Open table in a new tab Other deletion constructs that retained the larger T loop of tRNAPhe had lower specific activity as substrates (data not shown). The tetraloop sequence may act to stabilize TPHE39A and prevent alternative folded structures. Mutation of the target uridine 8 in the minimal substrates abolished s4U activity (for example, see TPHE39C in Table II). This shows that the small substrates are still binding in broadly the same orientation in the active site as the full-length tRNA. Reduction in the length of either stem in TPHE39A led to a significant decrease in activity. Analysis of Internal Loop Containing the Target Uridine— Fig. 5 shows the relationship between internal loop size and activity with TPHE39A (7-nt loop) as reference substrate. The data show that a 6-nt loop with a base deleted from two different points in the loop (TPHE38B and TPHE38C) gives a slightly better substrate. The specific activity drops significantly with a 5-nt loop and diminishes rapidly as the loop is further contracted. The extreme case where a single uridine is bulged out of a long stem loop is inactive (not shown). Alternative structures predicted by MFOLD (38Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar) were probed by substituting different bases in the 6- and 7-nt loops. Substitutions that decreased the possibility of base pairing within the internal loop gave modest increases in activity (data not shown). Because the structure of tRNA is complex in this region, these small substrates do not provide direct insight to the contouring of the active site but do show that multiple bases are required and that primary sequence is probably of little importance. Effects of Changes at the 5′ and 3′ Termini—Because the modified U8 is relatively close to the acceptor terminus of the tRNA, this may be a site for recognition by ThiI. Extension of the small substrates in the 5′ direction as shown in substrate TPHE45A (Fig. 4) leads to little reduction in activity (Table II). Extension of the full-length tRNA in the 3′ direction is also well tolerated. 2C. T. Lauhon, unpublished data. However, when the acceptor stem in either full-length tRNAPhe or the small substrates are extended significantly as a duplex (TPHE-ZIP or TPHE47A), activity is drastically reduced. The 3′ Extension Is a Positive Determinant for s4U Activity— The only invariant primary structural element that remains in common between TPHE39A and natural tRNAPhe is the 3′-terminal NCCA. We first prepared a blunt-ended derivative of TPHE39A. This RNA was not a substrate for s4U synthesis at concentrations as high as 40 μm. This indicated that in the context of a minimal substrate, the 3′ overhang was absolutely required for activity. We then deleted the 3′-ACCA from the full-length tRNAPhe transcript (Fig. 6, TPHEBLUNT). The initially purified transcript contained mostly N+1-length RNA and was a good substrate for the enzyme. However, when we purify the T7 transcript to single nucleotide homogeneity, we find that the blunt-ended tRNA is also no longer an observable substrate (<0.1%). Fig. 7 shows APM affinity gel analysis of s4U reactions with full-length tRNAPhe compared with the truncated substrate TPHEBLUNT. In both initial rate studies (Fig. 7, panel A) and during extended incubations (panel B), we see no s4U formation in the purified blunt tRNA.Fig. 7A, APM gel shift analysis of initial rate of s4U formation in WT and blunt tRNAPhe.

Despite the obligate heterodimeric nature of sGC, the sequence segments mediating subunit association have remained elusive. Our initial screening for relevant interaction site(s) in the most common sGC isoenzyme, α1 β1, identified two regions in each subunit, i.e. the regulatory domains and the central regions, contributing to heterodimer formation.

Both sites are crucial for sGC function because deletion of either site rendered sGC dimerization-deficient and thus functionally inactive. We conclude that the dimerization region of β1 extends over 205 residues of its regulatory and central domains and that two discontinuous sites of 41 and 30 residues, respectively, facilitate binding of β1 to the α1 subunit of sGC.

IntroductionThe second messenger cGMP plays a critical role in the regulation of smooth muscle tone, platelet aggregation, retinal phototransduction, and neurotransmission (1Moncada S. Palmer R. Higgs E. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414PubMed Google Scholar). It is produced from GTP in a reaction catalyzed by guanylyl cyclase, of which two types exist. The first guanylyl cyclase type includes a family of membrane-bound isoenzymes that are receptors for natriuretic factors and intestinal peptides, and therefore has been dubbed particulate GC (pGC) 1The abbreviations used are: pGC, particulate guanylyl cyclase; CBS, C-terminal binding site; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NBS, N-terminal binding site; NO, nitric oxide; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus. (3Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The second type of guanylyl cyclase was originally thought to be entirely cytosolic and was therefore named soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) (4Humbert P. Niroomand F. Fischer G. Mayer B. Koesling D.

Sci. 1997; 18: 484-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Indeed, the vast majority of sGC is found in the cytosolic fraction of vascular smooth muscle cells; however, recent evidence suggests that sGC may also associate with synaptosomal membranes of neurons as well as with plasma membranes of endothelial cells and platelets (6Venema R.C. Venema V.J. Ju H. Harris M.B. Snead C. Jilling T. Dimitropoulou C. Maragoudakis M.E. Catravas J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H669-H678Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Russwurm M.

Regardless of its subcellular localization, sGC functions as a receptor for nitric oxide (NO), i.e. the major endogenous activator of sGC which induces an activity increase of 200–500-fold (5Hobbs A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 484-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 9Stone J. Marletta M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Carbon monoxide can also stimulate sGC activity though to a lesser extent, up to 5-fold (5Hobbs A.J. Trends Pharmacol.

The best studied exogenous sGC activators are organic nitrates, which mimic the action of endogenous NO, e.g. in the treatment of angina pectoris. Other activators of sGC have been reported to work independently of NO (YC-1) or heme (BAY 58-2667) (11Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 12Martin E. Lee Y.C. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).Originally sGC was purified as a heterodimeric protein from bovine lung (14Kamisaki Y. Saheki S. Nakane M. Palmieri J.A. Kuno T. Chang B.Y. Waldman S.A. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7236-7241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early evidence indicated that both the large (α) and the small (β) subunits are essential for enzymatic activity because transient expression of either α or β cDNA alone failed to produce NO-inducible cGMP accumulation, whereas cotransfection of both subunits yielded a NO-sensitive enzyme (15Buechler W.A. Nakane M. Murad F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Harteneck C. Koesling D. Soling A. Schultz G. Böhme E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Inhibition of either α or β gene expression using antisense oligonucleotides significantly attenuated sGC activity (15Buechler W.A. Nakane M. Murad F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus heterodimerization appears to be an absolute requirement for the expression of sGC activity. To date, two isoforms for each sGC subunit have been identified, i.e. α1 and α2 as well as β1 and β2 (17Harteneck C. Wedel B. Koesling D. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Nakane M. Arai K. Saheki S. Kuno T. Buechler W. Murad F. J. Biol.

The most common sGC isoform α1β1 is ubiquitously present in the human body, with the nervous system, lung, and liver exhibiting the highest levels of expression (20Mergia E. Russwurm M. Zoidl G. Koesling D. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The α2β1 dimer is most abundant in brain, uterus, and placenta (20Mergia E. Russwurm M. Zoidl G. Koesling D. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The mRNA for human β2 is expressed in kidney and liver (19Yuen P.S. Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); however, the corresponding dimers such as α1β2 or α2β2 have not been identified in vivo. Recently, α1/α1 and β1/β1 homodimers lacking cyclase activity were reported to coexist with α1β1 in transfected cells overexpressing both sGC subunits (22Zabel U. Häusler C. Weeger M. Schmidt H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18149-18152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).To date the three-dimensional structure of sGC is still unknown. Based on structural comparisons with pGC and adenylyl cyclases, each sGC subunit has been divided arbitrarily into three major domains: an N-terminal region containing the regulatory domain, a central region, and a C-terminal region comprising the catalytic domain (23Andreopoulos S. Papapetropoulos A. Gen. Pharmacol. 2000; 34: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Koesling D. Friebe A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 41-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domains of α1 and β1 consist of ∼250 residues, and they are the best conserved regions between the various subunits and among sGCs from various species. The regulatory domain of β1 contains a heme binding region where His105 links to Fe2+ of the prosthetic group (25Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Malkewitz J. Böhme E. Schultz G. Koesling D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2592-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The corresponding domain of α1 does not participate in heme binding but carries a regulatory site at positions 259–364 which is necessary for the activation by NO (26Koglin M. Behrends S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12590-12597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The central region of the sGC subunits is often referred to as the putative “dimerization domain” based on circumstantial evidence and extrapolation of information available from the sequence mediating homodimerization of pGC (27Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In silico analyses have predicted that sGC dimerization site(s) are exposed by sequence segments spanning positions 312–377 (28Nighorn A. Byrnes K.A. Morton D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2525-2531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or 340–384 (29Zhao Y. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15959-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); however, experimental data confirming or refuting these predictions are still lacking.Here we have set out to map the sequence segments mediating heterodimerization of mammalian sGC subunits. Our main findings are that the dimerization region of the β1 subunit contacting the α1 subunit extends over more than 200 residues (positions 204–408), covering the C-terminal half of the regulatory domain and the entire central region. Within this dimerization region we have identified two separate sites, an N-terminal binding site spanning residues 204–244 and a C-terminal binding site at 379–408, each contributing to heterodimerization and thus functional expression of mammalian sGCs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Cell culture plasticware was from Greiner (Frickenhausen, Germany). The BL21-codon plus strain of Escherichia coli was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Monoclonal anti-V5 antibody, platinum Pfx DNA polymerase, and the pcDNA3.1 Directional TOPO Expression kit were from Invitrogen. The cGMP enzyme immunoassay kits were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis). SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate was from Pierce. The DC protein assay kit, Tween 20, and other immunoblotting reagents were from Bio-Rad. jetPEI transfection reagent was from Polyplus-transfection (Illkirch, France). Protein G-agarose beads and nitrocellulose membrane Hybond ECL were from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents including agarose beads coupled to glutathione, antibodies to β1 and VSV (P5D4), penicillin, streptomycin, isobutylmethylxanthine, sodium nitroprusside, bovine serum albumin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, EGTA, EDTA, and pepstatin were from Sigma.Antibodies to sGC Subunits—The sequence corresponding to amino acids 1–470 of the α1 subunit was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pGEX-Kg vector. The fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and α1 (GST-α1) was isolated from BL21-codon plus E. coli by standard techniques and used to immunize rabbits. The resulting antibody specifically recognized the α1 subunit, i.e. it did not cross-react with the β1 sGC subunit. For affinity purification GST-α1 was cross-linked to glutathione-Sepharose. Alternatively subunit-specific antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides derived from human α1 (residues 94–121) or β1 (residues 593–614). For affinity purification of the antibodies, the respective peptides were covalently coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad).Yeast Interaction Trap Assay—Vectors pEG202 and pJG4-5 and yeast strains EGY48 and RFY206 for the interaction trap assay were generously provided by Roger Brent (Boston). Plasmids expressing human β1[1–348], β1[349–403], or β1[404–619] fused to the LexA DNA binding domain were introduced in yeast strain EGY48 (MATα trp1 his3 ura3 leu2::6LexAop-LEU2) containing the reporter plasmid pSH18-34. Plasmids expressing β1[1–348], β1[349–403], or β1[404–619] fused to the B42 activation domain were introduced in RFY206 (MATa trp1::hisG his3Δ200 ura3–52 lys2Δ201 leu2–3). For mating, cell suspensions of both strains (50 μl each) were mixed and incubated in rich medium (YPD) at 30 °C for 14–16 h. Interactions were validated by growth and blue coloring on minimal agar plates lacking uracil, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine, supplemented with 2% galactose, 1% raffinose, and 80 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal).Construction of Expression Plasmids for sGC Subunit Mutants—The cDNAs for human sGC α1 and β1 fused to an N-terminal VSV epitope were subcloned into a modified pSG5 vector, pSG8VSV(EcX). The cDNAs for rat α1 with an N-terminal myc-tag, rat β1 with a C-terminal V5 tag, and deletion mutants thereof were generated by PCR and cloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector using standard methodology. All cDNA constructs used in this study were sequenced prior to use.Transfection of COS Cells—African green monkey kidney COSm6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well were grown overnight. Cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids using jetPEI transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions, applying a total of 3 μgof DNA and 6 μl of jetPEI/well. For cotransfection experiments, equal amounts of DNA were used for each plasmid. Alternatively, we used transient transfections of COS1 cells applying the DEAE-dextran method. For a 10-cm dish 5.4 × 105 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and expression plasmids were applied in 5.7 ml of serum-free medium mixed with 300 μl of DEAE-dextran (1 mg/ml) and 12 μl of chloroquine (50 mg/ml). After incubation for 2.5 h, cells were treated with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum for 30–48 h prior to use.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were harvested 30–48 h after transfection and lysed in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cellular debris was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were collected, and their protein concentrations determined. Cell lysates containing 200–250 μg of protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-myc or anti-VSV followed by protein G-coupled agarose beads; alternatively, anti-myc conjugated to agarose beads was used. Using 250 μg of total lysate protein and anti-myc for immunoprecipitation, 25–40% of myc-tagged α1 was recovered from total sGC input. Immunoprecipitated proteins or cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in 3% milk, TBS-T. Subsequently, the blots were incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit.cGMP Enzyme Immunoassay—48 h after transfection the cells were washed with Earle's balanced salt solution and incubated in it in the presence of 1 mm phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine for 15 min with or without 100 μm sodium nitroprusside. Media were aspirated, and 0.1 n HCl was added to extract cGMP. After 30 min, HCl extracts were collected, and cGMP was quantified.Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Cells (2.4 × 105) were harvested into 500 μl of TriZol (Molecular Research, Cincinnati, OH). Total RNA was extracted and quantified, and 200 ng of each sample was reversely transcribed into cDNA (iSCRIPT cDNA kit, Bio-Rad). Two μl of each cDNA sample was used as template for the amplification reaction carried out with Assays-on-Demand™ Gene Expression Products (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplifications were carried out in a Light Cycler System (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with the LightCycler™ IQ software 3.0. The level of target mRNA (sGCα1) was quantitated by determining the amplification cycle where the respective PCR products were first detected (CT) and normalized to the endogenous 18 S rRNA level.RESULTSIdentification of the Segments Involved in α1/β1 Heterodimerization—To map grossly the sequence segments involved in sGC dimerization, we dissected the human α1 and β1 subunits into three major segments, i.e. the N-terminal portion including the regulatory domain (positions 1–419 in α1 and 1–348 in β1, respectively), the central region (422–466 and 349–403), and the C-terminal portion comprising the catalytic domain (466–690 and 404–619). Using the yeast interaction trap assay we found that the N-terminal regulatory domains and the central regions of α1 and β1 consistently showed mutual interactions, whereas other combinations did not (data not shown). In COS cells binding of full-length α1 to β1 was sensitive to the deletion of the β1 central region (positions 349–403) but not of the β1 catalytic domain (404–619) (data not shown). These initial results pointed to a role of both the N-terminal portions and central regions of the sGC subunits in heterodimer formation.Studies with N- and C-terminal Truncation Variants of the β1 Subunit—To define more precisely the sequence segments participating in sGC dimerization, we dissected the rat β1 subunit which is almost identical to its human homolog (98.5% sequence identity). We generated a number of N-terminal, C-terminal, and internal deletion mutants (summarized in Fig. 1) and coexpressed them with the myc-tagged rat α1 in COS cells. We first analyzed the deletion mutants where we had progressively shortened the C-terminal portion of β1 by 183 residues (β1[1–436]), 211 residues (β1[1–408]), and 240 residues (β1[1–379]). Although similar expression levels were achieved for the various forms, only the longer variants β1[1–436] and β1[1–408] but not the shortest variant β1[1–379] lacking the entire catalytic domain and part of the central region were present in anti-myc immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A). In the reverse approach using cells cotransfected with wild-type α1 and His6-tagged full-length β1 or its C-terminal deletion mutants, we coprecipitated α1 from cell lysates containing full-length β1 or β1[1–408] but not from cells expressing β1[1–379] (not shown). Thus, the C-terminal 211 residues (positions 409–619) of β1 are dispensable for heterodimerization, whereas residues 380–408 appear to be critical for binding to α1.Fig. 2Heterodimerization of truncation mutants of β1. A, COS cells were cotransfected with the cDNAs encoding myc-tagged α and full-length or various deletion mutants of β1 of rat sGC. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was done with anti-myc, and the resultant precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (WB) with an antibody to α1 (top) or β1 (middle). Expression of β deletion mutants was monitored in lysates using anti-β1 (bottom). wt, wild-type. B, COS cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding myc-tagged α1 wild-type and V5-tagged β1 or deletion mutants thereof, as indicated. The presence of equal amounts of α1 in the immunoprecipitates was followed by Western blotting with anti-α1 (top). Immunoprecipitates with anti-myc were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-V5 (upper middle). To follow expression levels, cell lysates were blotted with anti-α1 or anti-V5 (lower middle and bottom, respectively). Representatives of experiments repeated at least twice with identical results are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we tested V5-tagged β1 mutants with progressive deletions of the N-terminal portion by 61 (β1[62–619]), 203 (β1[204–619]), 303 (β1[304–619]), 346 (β1[347–619]), or 379 residues (β1[380–619]). After coexpression of the β1 deletion constructs with full-length myc-tagged α1 followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-myc and Western blotting with anti-V5, we observed that β1 constructs lacking the first 61 or 203 amino acids fully retain their ability to bind to α1 (Fig. 2B). Further shortening of the N terminus by 303, 346, or 379 residues drastically reduced the presence of β1 in anti-myc immunoprecipitates, suggesting that the segment spanning positions 204–303 (or parts thereof) may be involved in α1/β1 heterodimerization. Importantly, the difference in binding of the β1 deletion mutants to α1 cannot be attributed to differences in the expression levels of α1 or β1 constructs, nor is it because of different amounts of immunoprecipitated α1 (cf. control panels in Fig. 2B). It should, however, be noted that after prolonged exposure faint signals were observed for the β1[304–619] and β1[347–619] deletion mutants (not shown). The above data taken together suggest that the sequence segment spanning residues 204–408 of β1 contains the structural elements mediating heterodimerization with α1 and that two distinct subsegments extending over positions 204–303 and 380–408 are critically involved in this binding.Identification of Two Distinct Binding Sites Mediating Heterodimerization—To study further the relative contributions of the various sequence segments for heterodimerization we generated internal deletion mutants of β1 affecting the critical region between positions 204–408 and coexpressed them with myc-tagged α1. Binding to α1 was reduced moderately for full-length β1 lacking positions 204–244 (β1Δ204–244) or positions 204–303 (β1Δ204–303) and was reduced drastically for deletion mutants β1Δ379–408 and β1Δ379–436 (Fig. 3). Because we did not observe a significant difference in the binding to α1 between β1Δ204–244 and β1Δ204–303, we concluded that the region spanning residues 245–303 does not contain critical residues for heterodimer formation. Moreover, deletion of the segment 379–408 further reduced the binding affinity of β1Δ204–244 mutant, almost to background level (Fig. 3). Thus it appears that segment 204–408 mediates β1 binding to α1 and that the C-terminal portion covering positions 379–408 of β1 exposes a major binding site for α1, whereas the N-terminal portion of 204–244 of β1 contributes a minor interaction site.Fig. 3Selective deletion of segments from the dimerization region. COS cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding myc-tagged α1 and wild-type (wt) β1 or its deletion mutants. The presence of equal amounts of α1 in the immunoprecipitates (IP) done with anti-myc was followed by Western blotting (WB) using anti-α (top). Western blots of the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by anti-β1 (upper middle). To monitor expression levels lysates were blotted with anti-α1 or anti-β1 (lower middle and bottom, respectively). Blots are representative of experiments repeated at least two times with identical results. The arrowhead marks the β1Δ204–303/379–436 protein. The designation of the constructs is according to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of the Expressed Binding Site Segment—If our notion is correct that sequence segment of 204–408 of the β1 subunit is necessary and sufficient to mediate binding to α1, we reasoned that (i) full-length α1 should bind to the critical sequence segment of β1[204–408] thereby producing an inactive cyclase and that (ii) fusion of β1[204–408] to an unrelated partner, e.g. EGFP, should confer α1 binding activity to the recipient protein. To test the former assumption, we coexpressed wild-type α1 with VSV-tagged β1[204–408] in COS cells and applied an antiserum to α1 under the same conditions successfully used for coimmunoprecipitation of the various β1 mutants (see above). Surprisingly cells cotransfected with β1[204–408] had greatly reduced α1 levels compared with cells coexpressing unrelated protein AGAP1-PH (Fig. 4A), and antibodies to α1 failed to coprecipitate significant amounts of β1[204–408] (not shown) although the protein was clearly present in cell lysates (Fig. 4A). Using real time PCR we found that the relative expression levels of α1 mRNA were almost identical in the presence of β1[204–408] or control protein, indicating that α1 protein was selectively down-regulated in the presence of β1[204–408]. Indeed coexpresssion of α1 and increasing amounts of β1[204–408] revealed a gradual decrease in α1 protein levels, whereas increasing expression levels of the control protein IA2βcyt did not affect α1 protein levels (Fig. 4B). Thus we reasoned that coexpression of and complex formation with β1[204–408] targets α1 for intracellular degradation.Fig. 4Effect of coexpression of β1 dimerization region on α1 protein level. A, lysates of COS cells cotransfected with cDNAs encoding α1 and VSV-tagged β1[204–408] or unrelated protein AGAP1-PH was analyzed by anti-α1 (top) or anti-VSV (bottom). The relative expression levels of α1 mRNA were quantified by real time PCR at 48 h post-transfection and normalized for endogenous 18 S rRNA (ΔCT; arrowheads). wt, wild-type; WB, Western blot. B, COS cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of α1, decreasing amounts of cDNA encoding VSV-tagged β [204–408] (2.0–0 μg), and increasing amounts (0–2.0 μg) of control protein AGAP1-PH. Protein levels were monitored by Western blotting of total cell lysates using anti-α1 (top) or anti-VSV (bottom). C, COS cells expressing wild-type α1 in the absence (–) or presence (+) of VSV-tagged β1 [204–408] were incubated for 12 h with (+) or without (–) proteasome inhibitors 10μm MG132 or 5 μm epoxomycin, as indicated. Protein levels were monitored by Western blotting of lysates using anti-α1. D, COS cells expressing α1 and β1 were cotransfected with increasing amounts (0–0.75 μg) of cDNA encoding VSV-tagged β1[204–408] and control protein VSV-IA2βcyt, as indicated. Cells were preincubated for 12 h in the absence (–) or presence (+) of 10 μm MG132. Western blotting of lysates was done with anti-α1 (top), anti-β1 loading, (upper middle), or anti-VSV (lower middle). To monitor protein lysates were probed for actin (bottom). The expression levels of α1 mRNA were quantified by real time PCR and normalized for endogenous 18 S rRNA at 48 h post-transfection (ΔCT; arrowheads).

We report here the characterization of oligomeric P protein of rinderpest virus (RPV) and provide a structural basis for its multimerization. By size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering analyses we show that bacterially expressed P protein exists as an oligomer, thus excluding the role of phosphorylation in P protein oligomerization. Gel filtration analyses of various parts of the P protein, also expressed in Escherichia coli, revealed that the predicted coiled coil region in the C-terminal domain is responsible for P protein oligomerization. Dynamic light scattering analysis confirmed the oligomeric nature of the coiled coil region of P. Chemical cross-linking analysis suggested that the C-terminal coiled coil region exists as a tetramer. The tetramer is formed by coiled coil interaction as shown by circular dichroism spectral analysis. Based on sequence homology, we propose a three-dimensional structure of the multimerization domain of RPV P using the crystal structure for multimerization domain of sendai virus (SeV) P as a template. Four-stranded coiled coil structure of the model is stabilized by a series of interactions predominantly between short nonpolar side chains emerging from different strands. In an in vivo replication/transcription system using a synthetic minigenome of RPV, we show that multimerization is essential for P protein function(s), and the multimerization domain is highly conserved between two morbilliviruses namely RPV and peste de petits ruminants virus.

The negative sense, single-stranded RNA genome codes for six structural proteins: namely nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin protein (H), and large protein (L). The viral N-RNA i.e. genomic RNA encapsidated with N protein is transcribed and replicated by the L (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and P complex (1Curran J. Kolakofsky D. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 54: 403-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The L protein is associated with N-RNA template through its interaction with P protein to form the transcribing ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. In addition to polymerization activity, L exhibits a number of other enzymatic activities including methyl transferase, 5′-cap synthesis of mRNA, and poly(A)+ polymerase (2Sedlmeier R. Neubert W.J. Adv. Virus Res. 1998; 50: 101-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During transcription, the intergenic start/stop signals are recognized by polymerase complex resulting in the synthesis of monocistronic, capped, and polyadenylated mRNAs. Once the intracellular concentration of viral proteins reaches a threshold level, genome replication begins. The intracellular concentration of unassembled N protein (N0) is believed to regulate the switch from transcription to replication (3Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Press, New York1996: 1177-1204Google Scholar). During replication, the same polymerase complex ignores stop signals and generates full-length unmodified encapsidated antigenomic RNA to serve as the template for the synthesis of progeny viral genomes. P proteins of negative-stranded RNA viruses play multiple roles during viral infection. They act as a transcriptional transactivator and recruit L protein onto viral N-RNA template (1Curran J. Kolakofsky D. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 54: 403-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gao Y. Lenard J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7718-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P proteins also bind to the N-RNA template, independent of its role in the L-P polymerase complex, and activate transcription (5Curran J. Virology. 1996; 221: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition to binding with the assembled nucleocapsid structure of the N-RNA template, P proteins interact with unassembled N proteins and prevent nonspecific aggregation of the latter by forming the N0-P complex, a precursor for encapsidating newly synthesized RNA during replication (6Curran J. Marq J.B. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 849-855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P proteins of mononegalovirales undergo phosphorylation in one or more serine residues, which has been shown to be important for its function (7Pattnaik A.K. Hwang L. Li T. Englund N. Nathur M. Das T. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8167-8175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dupuy L.C. Dobson S. Bitko V. Barik S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8384-8392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although P proteins function as a homo-oligomer, their oligomerization status as well as the requirement of phosphorylation for oligomerization has been shown to vary among them (1Curran J. Kolakofsky D. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 54: 403-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gao Y. Lenard J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Barik S. Banerjee A.K. Proc.

P proteins of all the paramyxoviruses harbor a coiled coil region at the C-terminal domain, and this region has been shown to be important for oligomerization in a number of viruses in the Paramyxoviridae family (13Tarbouriech N. Curran J. Ebel C. Ruigrok R.W. Burmeister W.P. Virology. 2000; 266: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Shaji D. Shaila M.S.

Biol. 2000; 7: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The P protein has a modular structure, which comprises two major domains: the N-terminal domain is highly variable among various paramyxoviruses whereas the C-terminal domain, though exhibiting low sequence similarity, is conserved in terms of secondary structure (13Tarbouriech N. Curran J. Ebel C. Ruigrok R.W. Burmeister W.P. Virology. 2000; 266: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The C terminus has been shown to have two subdomains in the sendai virus P protein: PMD, corresponding to the N-terminal region of the C-terminal domain that harbors the multimerization domain along with the L binding domain, and Px, corresponding to the rest of the C-terminal domain involved in nucleocapsid binding (13Tarbouriech N. Curran J. Ebel C. Ruigrok R.W. Burmeister W.P. Virology. 2000; 266: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Earlier work on the RPV P protein has shown that while the first 59 amino acid residues at the N terminus along with the predicted coiled coil region in the C-terminal half are important for interaction with unassembled N protein, the last 17 amino acid residues along with the predicted coiled coil region are required for interaction with the nucleocapsid structure (18Shaji D. Shaila M.S. Virology. 1999; 258: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This study also indicated the importance of the coiled coil region in P protein self-interaction. As a first step toward understanding the structure-function relationship of RPV P protein, we have looked at the oligomerization status of RPV P protein and examined the importance of coiled coil region of P protein in oligomerization as well as its function using different biochemical and biophysical approaches. Further, we propose a three-dimensional structure for the multimerization domain of RPV P based on its sequence similarity with that of SeV whose crystal structure has recently been solved (21Tarbouriech N. Curran J. Ruigrok R.W. Burmeister W.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The importance of phosphorylation and oligomerization of P protein in the transcription and replication processes of negative sense RNA viruses has also been examined. Materials—Escherichia coli DH5α strain was used for the maintenance of plasmids whereas the BL21 (DE3) strain was used for the expression of recombinant proteins (Invitrogen). p3e and p4a harboring the 1-291 (PNT) and 292-508 (PCT) amino acid regions of the P protein, respectively, were earlier cloned in the laboratory in pRSET vector whereas the full-length P (508 amino acids) gene isolated from a cDNA library of RPV (RBOK strain) was cloned in the expression vector pRSETB and designated pRP6 (22Kaushik R. Shaila M.S. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Plasmids pKSN-1 (RPV N gene in pBS), pPol10 (RPV L gene in pGEM), and pMDB8A (an RPV minigenome plasmid carrying the 3′-regulatory sequence; i.e. leader region, transcription/replication start regions, and 5′-trailer sequences flanking the CAT reporter gene open reading frame driven by the T7 promoter, T7 terminator, and δ ribozyme) were kindly provided by Dr. M. D. Baron, Institute of Animal Health, Pirbright, UK (23Baron M.D. Barrett T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid harboring the P gene of peste de petits ruminants virus (PPRV P in pGEM vector) was a gift from Dr. T. Barrett, Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright, UK. A549 cells derived from the Human Lung Carcinoma cell line were from ATCC. These cells were maintained on HAM12 containing 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen). VTF7-3 recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase in mammalian cells was a kind gift from Dr. Bernard Moss, National Institutes of Health. Cloning of the Coiled Coil Region (RPC), the Extreme C-terminal Region (Px) of RPV P, and the Multimerization Domain (PPMD) of PPRV P—The nucleotide sequence corresponding to RPC (amino acids 316-382), a part of the RPV PMD (amino acids 266-388) was released from pRP6 plasmid DNA by digestion with EcoRV and BamHI, and the end-filled insert was subcloned into NcoI- and XhoI-digested pET33b (+) vector after end-filling. The expressed protein from this clone gives nine additional amino acids, one (Met) at the N terminus and eight (Leu, Glu, and His6) at the C terminus. The Px (amino acids 377-508) was cloned by removing the NheI and SmaI fragment of pRP6 followed by religation of the backbone. The expressed protein results in 14 additional amino acids (MRGSH6GMAR) at its N terminus. The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the PPRV PMD region, PPMD (amino acids 264-387), was amplified using pTB-P DNA as template and appropriate primers (Forward, 5′-790CGA AAT GCG TCT GTG G805-3′, Reverse, 5′-TTA 1161CTC AGA TGT TGG GTC1147-3′). Nucleotide positions of the primers on the PPRV P gene are indicated within parentheses. The PCR product was cloned in the EcoRV site of pET20b (+) vector. The insert from the recombinant was released using NcoI and XhoI and subcloned into similar restriction sites of pET33b (+). The expressed protein codes for two additional amino acids (MD) at the N terminus. A stop codon was incorporated in the reverse primer to eliminate additional amino acids at the C terminus. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain was transformed with plasmids carrying full-length as well as different parts of the RPV P. The transformant was grown in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (except for RPC) or 50 μg/ml kanamycin (for RPC) and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an OD600 of 0.6 and grown for another 5 h. The cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in MCAC buffer (500 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and supplemented with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were centrifuged, and supernatant was mixed with Ni-NTA agarose. The resin was washed with 100 bed volumes of MCAC buffer containing 50 mm imidazole except for RPC in which imidazole was not used. Proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole in MCAC supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture. The RPC so obtained was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 and further purified by passing through a 5-ml QSepharose column using 0-300 mm NaCl in dialysis buffer as the gradient. Eluted samples of purified proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein concentration was measured by taking absorbance measurements at 280 nm, with the exception of RPC where the concentration was estimated by the Bradford assay. The identity of the proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit against bacterially expressed RPV P or PPRV P protein. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—Either the Sephadex G75 column (45 cm × 2.22 cm2, bed volume of 100 ml) or Sephacryl S300 column (60 cm × 2 cm2, 120-ml bed volume) was equilibrated with PBS or MCAC buffer, respectively, and calibrated using standard protein molecular mass markers. One milligram each of P, PNT, and PCT in MCAC or RPC and Px in 1 ml of PBS were separated on Sephacryl S300 or Sephadex G75, respectively, and the elution profiles were monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, except for RPC, which was monitored by protein estimation using the Bradford assay. The proteins were then identified using SDS-polyacrylamide gels and silver staining. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) Analysis—About 1 mg/ml of RPC (in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0 and 50 mm NaCl) or 0.5 mg/ml of P (in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl) was subjected to DLS analysis using the DynaPro machine (Protein Solutions). About 50 observations were made to calculate the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) using DynaPro software. The viscosity used for Rh calculation was estimated from the refractive index of the buffer as measured by refractometer. Chemical Cross-linking—About 20 μg of purified RPC protein were cross-linked using glutaraldehyde (final concentration of 0.5 and 1 mm) for different time intervals from 30 min to4hat25 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 200 mm glycine, and the products were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by silver staining. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—Purified RPC at 0.1 mg/ml in PBS or in 50% trifluoroethanol in PBS was analyzed in a spectropolarimeter (JASCO J-715) at room temperature. The CD spectrum was measured in a cuvette of 2-mm path length, with a bandwidth of 0.5 nm and a scan speed of 50 nm/s. The buffer spectrum was subtracted from the protein spectrum. An average of four independent measurements were used to calculate molar residue ellipticity [θ]MRW using Equation 1,[θ]MRW=(θ⋅100⋅Mr)/(c⋅l⋅NA)(Eq. 1) where [θ] is the mean residue molar ellipticity in deg cm2 dmol-1, θ is experimental ellipticity in millidegree, Mr is the molecular weight of the protein, c is protein concentration in mg/ml; l is cuvette path length in centimeters, and NA is the number of residues of the protein. The percent helicity was estimated in Equation 2 (24Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3331) Google Scholar, 25Wu C.S.C. Ikeda K. Yang J.T.

Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 26Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). In Vivo Replication/Transcription Assay—To assess the significance of tetramerization on the biological function of the P protein, an in vivo replication-transcription assay using the minigenome construct pMDB8A was performed as described earlier (23Baron M.D. Barrett T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcript from the minigenome is antigenomic sense, which is replicated to genomic sense RNA by the virus proteins, L, N, and P; expressed by co-transfected plasmids in A549 cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. The newly made genomic RNA was then transcribed into CAT mRNA, and the translated CAT protein was measured by ELISA (Roche Applied Science). A549 cells (1 × 106 cells/35-mm dish) were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus, VTF7-3 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 at 37 °C. At 1-h postinfection, the cells were washed with PBS and transfected using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (2 mg/ml) in 1 ml of OPTI-MEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 1 μg each of pMDB8A, pKS-N, pRP6, and 100 ng of pGEM-L with or without pRPC/pPPMD. At 48-h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, and CAT activity was assayed by ELISA. Co-expression of Full-length RPV P with the PPRV P Multimerization Domain—The plasmid DNA of pRP6 and pPPMD clones were co-transformed into BL21 (DE3) strains of E. coli, and the recombinant cells harboring both plasmids were selected using two antibiotics, i.e. ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Transformed cells were grown in Luria Broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 50 μg/ml of kanamycin to an OD600 of 0.6 at 37 °C. Expression and the purification of the protein by Ni-NTA agarose affinity chromatography were done as described above. The purity of both the purified proteins was tested by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Coomassie Blue staining and confirmed by Western blot analysis using the appropriate antibody. Prediction of Secondary Structures and Coiled Coil Regions—The sequence of the multimerization domain of RPV P-protein (PMD) was subjected to secondary structure prediction analysis using PHD as well as coiled coil region prediction (27Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar, 28Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J.

These predictions were employed in order to get views about the potential of this region to adopt α-helical structure as well as to form coiled coils, independent of the fact that a distant homologue (sendai virus phosphoprotein) has the same structural features. Comparative Modeling of the Coiled Coil Region of the P Protein—The amino acid sequence of RPV PMD protein (amino acids 266-388) was aligned with that of the sendai virus phosphoprotein whose crystal structure shows a homotetrameric α-helical coiled coil structure (21Tarbouriech N. Curran J. Ruigrok R.W. Burmeister W.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The two proteins are distantly related, and the alignment is non-trivial. Hence the structural features (such as solvent accessibility and secondary structure) at every residue were evaluated, and relationships such as hydrogen-bonding patterns in the crystal structure were assessed. While aligning the sequences the probability of a residue in the RPV PMD protein adopting the structural environment of equivalent residues in the known structure was considered. The positive matches between predicted secondary structures in the P protein and the observed secondary structures in the crystal structure during alignment were also given importance. The suite of programs encoded in COMPOSER and incorporated in SYBYL (Tripos Inc., St. Louis) was used to generate a three-dimensional model of the P-protein (32Srinivasan N. Blundell T.L. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The COMPOSER-generated model was energy-minimized in SYBYL using the AMBER force field (33Weiner S.I. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar). The energy-minimized model of a subunit of RPV PMD was superimposed with each one of the four subunits of SeV PMD, and the preliminary model for RPV PMD tetramer, so obtained, was subjected to further energy minimization to optimize interprotomer interactions. Recombinant Proteins—All recombinant proteins such as full-length P (amino acids 1-508), PNT (amino acids 1-291), PCT (amino acids 292-508), RPC (amino acids 316-382), and Px (amino acids 376-508) were expressed and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1). The authenticity of the purified proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibody made against purified P protein expressed in E. coli (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, the full-length P and PNT migrate at positions corresponding to 80 and 52 kDa, respectively, which are much higher than their calculated masses (62 and 39 kDa, respectively). This anomalous mobility is attributed to the cluster of acidic residues at the N-terminal domain (18Shaji D. Shaila M.S. Virology. 1999; 258: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mass spectroscopic analysis of full-length P protein further confirmed its authenticity (data not shown). P Protein Exists as a Homo-oligomer in Solution—The oligomerization state of bacterially expressed P protein was studied by SEC. As shown in Fig. 2, the majority of the P protein elutes at a position that corresponds to a molecular mass of more than 300 kDa. This result indicates that P forms a higher order multimer because the monomeric molecular mass is 62 kDa. The hydrodynamic radius of P protein was measured by DLS. The Rh of 7 nm for the P protein confirms the formation of an oligomer in solution. The chemical cross-linking experiment also suggested that the P protein exists as a multimer (data not shown). Coiled Coil Region on the C-terminal Domain Is Responsible for Oligomerization of P Protein into a Tetramer—Recombinant proteins corresponding to the various parts of the P protein were subjected to SEC. Elution profiles are shown in Fig. 3. PNT (mass ∼39 kDa) elutes at around 100 kDa, indicating that it is either an oligomer or is a partially structured monomer. Earlier work had revealed that the C terminus is involved in P protein self-interaction (18Shaji D. Shaila M.S. Virology. 1999; 258: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the measles virus P protein, the equivalent domain (PNT) has been shown to be a partially structured monomer (34Karlin D. Longhi S. Receveur V. Canard B. Virology. 2002; 296: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Further, PCT (mass ∼28 kDa) eluted from the gel filtration column at a position of molecular mass 150 kDa. Taken together, these results suggest that the oligomerization domain lies at the C terminus of P (PCT). The coiled coil region (RPC) and the rest of the C-terminal domain (Px) show molecular masses of 35 and 23 kDa, respectively, in SEC. This suggests that RPC (mass ∼8.5 kDa) is an oligomer, possibly a tetramer. The molecular size of Px (mass ∼16 kDa) is too small to be a dimer, and the increased molecular size of the monomer might result from its elongated shape or partially structured nature. The oligomeric state of RPC was further tested by DLS. The result showed an Rh of 2.8 nm (corresponding to ∼34 kDa) again confirming the oligomeric nature of RPC. To find out the exact stoichiometry of the RPC, chemical cross-linking of RPC was carried out. As shown in Fig. 4, in addition to monomers, cross-linked RPC was detected as dimers, trimers, and tetramers. With an increase in the duration of reaction and increase in cross-linker concentration, an increase in the number of tetramers was observed. Since cross-linked products higher than tetramer were not observed, we conclude that the most common form of RPC is a tetramer. The nature of interaction of such a tetramer was studied by CD spectral analysis in the presence and absence of trifluoroethanol (Fig. 5). These results indicated that RPC is rich in α-helical content (∼90%), and the ratio of ellipticities at 222/208 nm is greater than 1.0, indicative of the presence of interacting helices. Moreover, the ratio of ellipticities at 222/208 nm in 50% trifluoroethanol decreased to 0.918, a characteristic of non-interacting α-helices. Because trifluoroethanol has been shown to disrupt tertiary structure and quaternary structure and to promote secondary structure (35Lau S.Y. Taneja A.K. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13253-13261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this result suggests that RPC forms a coiled coil structure. Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that RPV P protein forms a tetramer through coiled coil interaction present in RPC.Fig. 5Coiled coil interaction of RPC. CD spectra of 20 μm RPC in PBS (open circle) and 20 μm RPC in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol in PBS (filled circle). The ratio of ellipticities 222/208 nm is greater than 1.0 indicating the presence of helix-helix interaction, i.e. coiled coil interaction. A ratio of less than 1.0 (0.918) in the presence of trifluoroethanol suggests non-interacting helices due to disruption of quaternary structure, i.e. coiled coil structure of RPC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) P Protein Functions as a Multimer, and the Multimerization Domain Is Conserved between Two Morbilliviruses—The biological function of the multimerization domain of P protein was assessed employing an in vivo replication/transcription system for RPV. As shown in Fig. 6a, the CAT protein level is significantly reduced when RPC is coexpressed with wild-type P protein compared with the control where the full-length P plasmid alone was used. Earlier studies in our laboratory have revealed that the coiled coil region does not interact with N protein (18Shaji D. Shaila M.S. Virology. 1999; 258: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or L protein (36Chattopadhyay A. Shaila M.S. Virus Genes. 2004; 28: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results clearly suggest that RPC forms a hetero-oligomer with wild-type P protein and"

The isolated PH domains of both proteins showed plasma membrane localization when expressed in the form of a green fluorescent protein fusion construct in various cells, although a significantly lower proportion of the PLCδ4 PH domain was membrane-bound than in the case of PLCδ1PH-GFP. Both PH domains selectively recognized phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), but a lower binding of PLCδ4PH to lipid vesicles containing PI(4,5)P2 was observed. Also, higher concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) were required to displace the PLCδ4PH from the lipid vesicles, and a lower Ins(1,4,5)P3 affinity of PLCδ4PH was found in direct Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding assays. In sharp contrast to the localization of its PH domain, the full-length PLCδ4 protein localized primarily to intracellular membranes mostly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This ER localization was in striking contrast to the well documented PH domain-dependent plasma membrane localization of PLCδ1. A truncated PLCδ4 protein lacking the entire PH domain still showed the same ER localization as the full-length protein, indicating that the PH domain is not a critical determinant of the localization of this protein. Most important, the full-length PLCδ4 enzyme still showed binding to PI(4,5)P2-containing micelles, but Ins(1,4,5)P3 was significantly less potent in displacing the enzyme from the lipid than with the PLCδ1 protein.

https://openalex.org/W1996917016,"Homologous recombinational repair preserves chromosomal integrity by removing double-strand breaks, cross-links, and other DNA damage. In eukaryotic cells, the Rad51 paralogs (XRCC2/3, Rad51B/C/D) are involved in this process, although their exact functions are largely undetermined. All five paralogs contain ATPase motifs, and XRCC3 exists in a single complex with Rad51C. To examine the function of this Rad51C-XRCC3 complex, we generated mammalian expression vectors that produce human wild-type XRCC3 or mutant XRCC3 with either a nonconservative mutation (K113A) or a conservative mutation (K113R) in the GKT Walker A box of the ATPase motif. The three vectors were independently transfected into Xrcc3-deficient irs1SF Chinese hamster ovary cells. Wild-type XRCC3 complemented irs1SF cells, albeit to varying degrees, whereas ATPase mutants had no complementing activity, even when the mutant protein was expressed at comparable levels to that in wild-type-complemented clones. Because of dysfunction of the mutants, we propose that ATP binding and hydrolyzing activities of XRCC3 are essential. We tested in vitro complex formation by wild-type and mutant XRCC3 with His6-tagged Rad51C upon co-expression in bacteria, nickel-affinity purification, and Western blotting. Wild-type and K113A mutant XRCC3 formed stable complexes with Rad51C and co-purified with Rad51C, whereas the K113R mutant did not and was predominantly insoluble. The addition of 5 mm ATP but not ADP also abolished complex formation by the wild-type proteins. These results suggest that XRCC3 probably regulates the dissociation and formation of Rad51C-XRCC3 complex through ATP binding and hydrolysis with both processes being essential for the ability of the complex to participate in homologous recombinational repair.

Homologous recombinational repair (HRR) 1The abbreviations used are: HRR, homologous recombinational repair; MMC, mitomycin C; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IR, ionizing radiation.1The abbreviations used are: HRR, homologous recombinational repair; MMC, mitomycin C; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; IR, ionizing radiation. is a major DNA repair pathway that preserves chromosomal integrity during DNA replication and contributes to the removal of double-strand breaks and interstrand cross-links from exogenous agents (see reviews in Refs. 1Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 2Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 49-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 3Thompson L.H. Limoli C.L. Caldecott K. Eukaryotic DNA Damage Surveillance and Repair. Landes Press, 2003: 107-145www.landesbioscience.comGoogle Scholar). HRR probably helps prevent double-strand breaks from arising during normal DNA replication and promotes their removal in an error-free manner when they do arise. In eukaryotic cells, this process is mediated by the highly conserved Rad51 DNA strand transferase and associated proteins that include distant relatives of Rad51, which are referred to as the Rad51 paralogs (XRCC2, XRCC3, Rad51B, Rad51C, and Rad51D). At least two stable complexes (a dimeric complex composed of XRCC3 and Rad51C and a larger complex composed of XRCC2, Rad51B, Rad51C, and Rad51D) have been found (4Masson J.Y. Tarsounas M.C.

Structural analysis of archeal Rad51 shows that the ATPase binding site is composed of Walker A and Walker B motifs from different Rad51 monomers (17Shin D.S. Pellegrini L. Daniels D.S. Yelent B. Craig L. Bates D. Yu D.S. Shivji M.K. Hitomi C. Arvai A.S. Volkmann N. Tsuruta H. Blundell T.L. Venkitaraman A.R. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4566-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATP binding may act as a “bridge” for protein-protein interaction. Interestingly, a conservative lysine to arginine mutation in the Walker A box resulted in a mutant human Rad51 with efficient DNA binding and strand transferase activity while a nonconservative lysine to alanine mutation inactivated Rad51 (18Morrison C. Shinohara A. Sonoda E. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Weichselbaum R.R. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6891-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because conservative mutation at Walker A motifs is thought to abrogate ATP hydrolysis without inhibiting ATP binding and because nonconservative mutations result in a nonbinding, nonhydrolyzing protein, these results indicate that ATP binding alone may be sufficient to maintain Rad51 function.The Rad51 paralogs also contain Walker A and B ATPase motifs. However, unlike Rad51, the biological significance of these ATPase motifs is not clearly established. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Rad51 paralogs, Rad55 and Rad57, showed differential requirements for the Walker A motifs. In a complementation analysis of mutant lines, neither nonbinding nor nonhydrolyzing mutants of Rad55 were able to complement IR sensitivity, whereas both mutants in Rad57 showed partial complementation (19Johnson R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4843-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This result could indicate that the ATPase binding site of yeast Rad51 paralogs may be composed of the Walker A box of Rad55 and the Walker B box of Rad57 and that ATPase binding sites may act as sites of proteinprotein interaction for the paralogs, much like the sites of interaction in Rad51.Genetic analysis of the human Rad51 paralogs, Rad51C and XRCC2, has been conducted by ectopic expression of the paralogs in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants. Interestingly, a similar trend of differential requirement for the Walker A motif seem to be emerging for the human Rad51 paralogs as well. A XRCC2 mutant that is unable to bind and/or hydrolyze ATP showed partial complementation for the CHO mutation (20O'Regan P. Wilson C. Townsend S. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas an analogous mutation in Rad51C showed no complementing activity (21Gaymes T.J. North P.S. Brady N. Hickson I.D. Mufti G.J. Rassool F.V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). When Rad51C retained its ability to bind ATP, it was able to partially restore MMC resistance in irs3 mutant V79 cells, suggesting that ATP binding, rather than hydrolysis, may be critical for Rad51C function. Rad51B also hydrolyzes ATP, and the Rad51C-Rad51B dimer exhibited additive ATPase activity, although the biological significance of the Rad51B ATPase activity is unknown (5Sigurdsson S. Van Komen S.

We report that the integrity of the Walker A motif of XRCC3 is required for biological activity and governs Rad51C-XRCC3 complex formation. This study is the first to address the relationship between complex formation and biological activity of the Rad51 paralogs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Mammalian XRCC3 Expression Constructs—Wildtype XRCC3 cDNA was amplified by PCR from IMAGE clone 3139703 and inserted into the pEF6-V5/His vector by TOPO-cloning (Invitrogen). The orientation was confirmed by restriction digestion and direct sequencing of the entire cDNA. Lys to Arg and Lys to Arg mutations were introduced at Lys-113 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The missense mutations were also confirmed by direct sequencing.Cell Culture and Generation of XRCC3 Expressing irs1SF Cells—Cells were grown in monolayer or suspension culture in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cell lines derived from irs1SF, which stably express wild-type XRCC3 or the ATPase mutants, were created by transfection of the XRCC3 expression constructs and subsequent selection for the drug resistance marker. 2 × 107 irs1SF cells were washed and resuspended in 1 ml of cold electroporation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6m m glucose), mixed with 10 μg plasmid DNA, electroporated at 250 V/1600 microfarads, and plated in a T150 flask for 24 h to allow for expression of the blasticidin resistance gene. Cells were then plated into 10-cm dishes at ∼5 × 105 cell/dish in 20 ml of medium containing 5 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) and incubated at 5% CO2 and 37 °C for 12 days when most colonies were clearly visible by eye. Twelve individual colonies were isolated and expanded as clones for each transfection.Western blotting was performed with nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of each clone to confirm that XRCC3 was being expressed. Extracts were prepared from cells using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce), quantitated by the Bradford method, and normalized for equal loading. Extracts were separated on a 12% PAGE gel and transferred to Hybond-ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences) according to standard protocol. Filters were probed with 1:500 diluted primary anti-XRCC3 antibody (Novagen) and visualized by ECL detection. The film was then scanned, and band strength was quantitated using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were loaded at a minimal level of detection to stay within the linear range of the film.MMC and IR Complementation Analysis—Mutagen sensitivities were determined by colony formation in 10-cm dishes. For each dose, 300 cells were plated in triplicate and allowed 12 days of growth. Dishes were then rinsed with saline, fixed with 95% ethanol, and stained with Gram crystal violet (BD Dickinson). Exposure to MMC was conducted in 10-ml suspension cultures. At each dose, 1× 105 cells were exposed to MMC for 60 min at 37 °C, centrifuged, and resuspended in fresh medium for plating. For exposure to IR, 137Cs γ-irradiation was performed on suspension cultures (1× 104 cells/ml) in 15-ml polypropylene tubes on ice.Purification and Detection of Rad51C-XRCC3 Heterodimer—To coexpress Rad51C and XRCC3 in E. coli, we replaced the origin of replication in pET15b (Novagen) from the colE1 origin with the p15a origin from pACYC177 (New England Biolabs). Using the modified pET15b, we generated a vector for Rad51C with an N-terminal His6 tag. We also removed all of the tag sequences from pET29b (Novagen) to create a vector for untagged XRCC3. BL21 DE3 (Novagen) was co-transformed with vectors for His-tagged Rad51C and untagged XRCC3 and selected for resistance to both ampicillin and kanamycin.Liquid cultures were inoculated from individual clones, and recombinant protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.5 with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for at least 16 h at 16 °C. Cells were lysed in the same buffer as the binding buffer for purification (50 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm Tris, pH 8.5) by freeze-thaw lysis followed by sonication on ice. Lysates were centrifuged (15,000 × g)at4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded on to nickel-charged HiTrap chelating HP using the ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The loaded column was washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm Tris, 5 mm imidazole, and 10 mm imidazole before eluting on a gradient with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 5 mm Tris, and 250 mm imidazole. One elution peak containing the dimer fraction was seen in all of the purification experiments. For each dimer pair, at least two independent transformations were conducted to ensure reproducibility. When purification containing 5 mm ATP or 5 mm ADP was conducted, induced cultures were split into two aliquots. One aliquot was used in the purification with ATP or ADP in the lysis/binding buffers, and the second aliquot was purified with regular lysis/binding buffer. Fractions corresponding to the peaks detected were separated on a 12% PAGE gel and probed with either anti-XRCC3 antibody as described above or with anti-Rad51C antibody diluted at 1:1000 (Novagen). The remaining steps for the detection of Rad51C were identical to XRCC3 detection.RESULTSExpression Level of Wild-type Human XRCC3 Determines Its Ability to Complement MMC and IR Sensitivity of irs1SF—We isolated 12 independent wild-type XRCC3-expressing transfectants derived from the CHO mutant line irs1SF by screening blasticidin-resistant colonies. These clones varied in the level of XRCC3 protein as illustrated in Fig. 1 for four of them, and the extent of complementation for MMC resistance ranged from 1 to 27% (Fig. 2A and Table I). We found that a narrow range of XRCC3 protein levels was associated with efficient complementation of MMC and IR sensitivity in irs1SF (Table I). At very high or very low levels, XRCC3 did not complement MMC sensitivity. Because of interspecies differences and antibody specificity for human XRCC3, we are unable to compare the XRCC3 ectopic level with that of wild-type Xrcc3 in parental AA8 cells. Therefore, we analyzed the XRCC3 level in all of the clones relative to those in 1SFA9 clone, which was our lowest detectable expression level.Fig. 2Survival curves for colony forming ability of cells exposed to MMC or IR.

Zhao Y. Tucker J.D. Scheerer J.B. Siciliano M.J. Hwang M. Liu N. Legerski R.J. Thompson L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6354-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This differential effect in favor of higher correction for IR sensitivity was seen previously (26Tebbs R.S. Zhao Y. Tucker J.D. Scheerer J.B. Siciliano M.J. Hwang M. Liu N. Legerski R.J. Thompson L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6354-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Clone 1SFK6 was also well corrected (26%) for MMC but was less well corrected for IR and had a weakly adherent colony morphology.Both Conservative and Nonconservative ATPase Mutations in the Walker A Box Abrogate XRCC3 Function—When either the conservative ATP binding mutation (K113R) or the nonconservative mutation (ATP-nonbinding, -nonhydrolyzing K113A) was expressed in irs1SF, no complementation was observed in any transfectants that expressed mutant protein. Of 12 blasticidin-resistant clones in each group, only three clones expressed K113R XRCC3 and two clones expressed K113A. Both clones expressing the K113A mutant had very little XRCC3, whereas K113R expression levels were substantial. None of these six clones had any complementation for MMC sensitivity (Fig. 2). To confirm that this loss of function was not caused by insufficient expression of the mutant protein, we compared the expression levels of mutant and wild-type XRCC3. For example, clone 1SFR3 had a level of the mutant protein comparable to 1SFK8 (20% correction) and 1SFA10 has more protein than 1SFK7, which had approximately ∼2-fold increased MMC resistance (1% correction, which is significantly above base line) (Fig. 1). Neither mutation reduced the ability of XRCC3 to localize to the nucleus as similar nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios were observed for wild-type XRCC3 and the two mutant forms (Fig. 1).Because 1SFR3 expresses K113R at a level comparable to 1SFK8, our most complemented clone, we tested whether the 1SFR3 mutant could complement the IR sensitivity of irs1SF. No significant increase in IR resistance occurred (Fig. 2B).Rad51C-XRCC3 Complex Formation Is Blocked by the K113R Mutation but Not by the K113A Mutation—Because XRCC3 forms a stable dimer in vivo with Rad51C, we examined the stability of K113R and K113A mutant complexes by coexpressing Rad51C and XRCC3 in bacterial hosts. An N-terminal His tag on Rad51C was used to pull down XRCC3 by nickel-affinity purification of bacterial extracts. Almost all of Rad51C was found complexed with XRCC3 when either wildtype or K113A protein was expressed, and no visible difference was seen in the ratio of Rad51C to XRCC3 between wild-type and mutant complexes (Fig. 3). Unexpectedly, when K113R was expressed, Rad51C alone was detected in the eluted fractions; no XRCC3 co-purified. There was a very small amount of XRCC3 in all of the Rad51C-containing fractions but most was in the insoluble pellet fraction. When photographic film was processed to significantly overexpose Rad51C, a very faint band was observed for XRCC3 in the eluted fractions. Starting with new transformants, we repeated this experiment three times and the results were the same.Fig. 3Complex formation by Rad51C with wild-type and mutant XRCC3.

Because the K113R XRCC3 mutant should have maintained the ability to bind ATP, we mimicked the conditions of ATP being bound to the ATPase site of XRCC3 by having excess ATP in the lysis buffer during the purification step. We used the same induced culture for the purification with lysis buffer with 5 mm ATP or 5 mm ADP or no added nucleotide. We found that ATP, but not ADP, interfered with the co-purification of XRCC3 and Rad51C, similarly to what we saw for the K113R mutant (Fig. 4). Unlike with the purification with the K113R mutant, XRCC3 was present in the pre-purified material and flowthrough material as expected but was absent in any of the purified fractions containing Rad51C. The addition of ADP had no effect on the co-purification, and the resulting Western analysis showed patterns very similar to those from wild-type and K113A mutant purification. All of the experiments were conducted three times from separate transformants and induced cultures, and the same results were observed.Fig. 4Complex formation by Rad51C with wild-type XRCC3 in the presence off excess ATP or ADP. Lanes 1-5 were probed for XRCC3, and lanes 6-10 were probed for Rad51C. Lanes 1 and 6, flow-through; lanes 2 and 7, first wash; lanes 3 and 8, second wash; lanes 4 and 9, first eluted fraction; lane 5, 10-s eluted fraction. Purifications shown here in the top and middle panels (without or with ATP, respectively) were done from the same induced culture. The corresponding purification with regular lysis buffer for the culture used in the ADP purification was very similar to that shown here with ADP (data not shown). The background lower band seen in lane 1 of the top two panels for XRCC3 was cut off in blot for the ADP purification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONXRCC3 is an essential protein for chromosome stability and cellular resistance to IR and certain chemical agents (1Thompson L.H.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Despite its presumed importance in the repair of doublestrand breaks through HRR, little is known regarding its biochemical properties or specific function. Although it has been shown that XRCC3 directly interacts with Rad51C to form a stable complex, the biological significance of this complex formation remains to be defined. We hypothesized that Rad51C-XRCC3 complex formation is necessary for the biological function of XRCC3, as measured by complementation of the MMC-sensitive mutant cell line irs1SF. However, we found that this complex can still form with the K113A mutation, which impairs HRR capacity. We showed that the biological activity of XRCC3 depends on its ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP, as neither K113R nor K113A mutants were able to complement the defect in irs1SF. Our wild-type transfectant clones showed partial resistance to MMC and IR. Because the sensitivity of irs1SF to MMC is much greater (75-fold) than that for IR (2-fold), we used MMC resistance as the main end point for measuring biological activity by complementation of colony-forming ability. Clone 1SFK8 shows better correction for MMC and IR sensitivity than previously reported clones, which makes this a valuable isogenic control for future experiments conducted on irs1SF.Our results suggest that the ATPase activity of XRCC3 is not required for complex formation with Rad51C, since mutant K113A forms a stable complex with Rad51C. If Rad51C binds to XRCC3 in a manner analogous to how Rad51 forms its ring structure, the ATP binding pocket may be created by the Walker A box of XRCC3 and the Walker B box of Rad51C. If so, it is possible that ATP binding in this pocket would disrupt the heterodimer by pushing the two proteins apart at the binding interface. Because the K113A mutation should not allow for ATP binding, it is possible that the two proteins may join together in the absence of such steric hindrance. In support of this hypothesis that ATP binding causes steric hindrance between Rad51C and XRCC3, we did not detect wild-type XRCC3-Rad51C complex in the presence of excess ATP. The addition of ADP did not affect the binding of wild-type XRCC3 to Rad51C. Thus, although ATP binding itself inhibits complex formation, ATP hydrolysis is apparently unnecessary for complex formation. The finding that K113A transfectants (which express a XRCC3 mutant that maintains the ability to form the Rad51C-XRCC3 complex) do not show complementation for MMC resistance suggests that complex formation alone is insufficient for the function of XRCC3. We speculate that ATP hydrolysis may be required for complex dissociation, which may be required for biological activity. ATP hydrolysis activity of XRCC3 appears necessary at a step other than in the formation of a stable Rad51C-XRCC3 complex. A theoretical role for the Rad51C-XRCC3 complex could be to bring Rad51C into the nucleus, upon which the complex must dissociate via ATP hydrolysis so that Rad51C can ass"

Current models for repeat expansion predict that h-FEN1 protein prevents mutations by removing 5′-flaps generated at ends of Okazaki fragments by strand displacement synthesis. The models propose that hairpin formations within flaps containing repeats enable them to escape h-FEN1 cleavage. Friedreich's ataxia is caused by expansion mutations in a d(GAA)n repeat tract. Single-stranded d(GAA)n repeat tracts, however, do not form stable hairpins until the repeat tracts are quite long. Therefore, to understand how d(GAA)n repeat expansions survive h-FEN1 activity, we determined the effects of h-FEN1 on d(GAA)n repeat expansion during replication of a d(TTC)n repeat template. Replication initiated within the repeat tract generated significant expansion that was suppressed by the addition of h-FEN1 at the start of replication. The ability of h-FEN1 to suppress expansion implies that DNA slippage generates a 5′-flap in the nascent strand independent of strand displacement synthesis by an upstream polymerase. Delaying the addition of h-FEN1 to the replication reaction abolished the ability of h-FEN1 ability to suppress d(GAA)n repeat expansion products of all sizes, including sizes unable to hairpin. Use of model substrates demonstrated that h-FEN1 cleaves d(GAA)n 5′-flaps joined to double-stranded nonrepeat sequences but not those joined to double-stranded repeat tracts. The results provide evidence that, given the opportunity, short d(GAA)n repeat expansion products rearrange from 5′-flaps to stable internal loops inside the repeat tract. Long expansion products are predicted to form hairpinned flaps and internal loops. Once formed, these DNA conformations resist h-FEN1. The biological implications of the results are discussed.

Repeat expansion mutations are responsible for more than 16 neuromuscular diseases including Friedreich's ataxia, myotonic dystrophy, and Fragile X syndrome (1Margolis R.L. Ross C.A. Trends Mol.

Disease-associated repeat expansions are generated during transmission from parent to child and vary from the addition of a few repeats to the addition of thousands of repeats within tracts that normally contain 20-30 tandem repeats (1Margolis R.L.

A RAD27 null mutation is responsible for at least a 1000-fold increase in large duplication mutations associated with Okazaki flap processing (10Tishkoff D.X. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kolodner R.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The model proposes that 5′-flap formation (6Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), generated by DNA strand displacement synthesis during lagging strand DNA replication, is the primary event mediating the occurrence of repeat expansion. Secondary structures forming within the flap that are resistant to cleavage by FEN1 would protect the flap from repair, resulting in an expansion mutation. Later refinements of the model require conversion to an internal loop conformation to allow ligation of the expanded nascent strand (11Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13728-13739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). FEN1 contains both double-stranded DNA 5′-exonuclease and single-stranded DNA 5′-flap endonuclease activities (12Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

Currently, evidence indicates that RNA primers associated with the 5′-end of Okazaki fragments are displaced during DNA synthesis to produce single-stranded DNA 5′-ends or flaps. Most of the resulting 5′-flap is removed by Dna2 protein; FEN1 trims the remainder of the flap to create a nick for ligation (18Bae S.H. Bae K.H. Kim J.A. Seo Y.S. Nature. 2001; 412: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). FEN1 haploinsufficiency in a mouse model lacking one copy of the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene generated tumors with microsatellite instability (19Kucherlapati M. Yang K. Kuraguchi M. Zhao J.

Based on the evidence and the latest models of repeat expansion mutagenesis, one might predict that mutations in h-FEN1 cause repeat expansion. Genetic analyses of repeat expansion disease inheritance patterns show, however, that the diseases map to loci containing the repeat expansions associated with each disease (reviewed in Ref. 20Cummings C.J. Zoghbi H.Y. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2000; 1: 281-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), not to the h-FEN1 locus. Furthermore, no mutations in h-FEN1 were detected in a study of patients with the repeat expansion disorder Huntington's disease (21Otto C.J. Almqvist E. Hayden M.R. Andrew S.E. Clin. Genet. 2001; 59: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, some aspect of the DNA expansion process would appear to be able to defeat apparently normal FEN1 activity. The biochemistry of h-FEN1 has been studied using synthetic constructs to test the different DNA structures that are subject to h-FEN1 activity (11Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

After gaining access, FEN1 translocates to the junction of the flap with double-stranded DNA where cleavage occurs (12Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

A study using CTG repeat constructs, however, provides evidence that the ability of the flap to be ligated to the upstream DNA fragment is inhibited by a hairpin within the flap (25Henricksen L.A.

Formation of a loop within the expanded repeat tract appears to be necessary to allow ligation of the expansion to the upstream DNA fragment (11Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13728-13739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here, we apply an in vitro model of repeat expansion (29Heidenfelder B.L. Makhov A.M. Topal M.D. J.

GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene is the most common mutation (98%) causing Friedreich's ataxia (31Pandolfo M. Movement Disorders. 2001; 16: 815-82129Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A wide size range of expansion products is generated during DNA replication in vitro (29Heidenfelder B.L.

Important for this study, small (15-30 base) single-stranded DNA GAA repeat tracts do not form stable hairpins in solution under nearly physiological conditions (32Gacy A.M. Goellner G.M. Juranic N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 2425-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, when constituting a flap, small GAA repeat expansions are expected to be targets for h-FEN1 cleavage, allowing us to test whether factors other than hairpin formation in the 5′-flaps involving repeat tracts are required for protection from FEN1 cleavage. Our results demonstrate that h-FEN1 is sufficient to suppress GAA repeat expansion during DNA replication in vitro. To do so, however, required h-FEN1 to be active throughout replication of the GAA repeat tract. H-FEN1-resistant structures were formed if the addition of h-FEN1 to the DNA replication reaction was delayed for even a brief period. The results provide evidence that (GAA)n primer slippage is sufficient to generate the required 5′-flap repeat expansion intermediate. Formation of the flap does not require strand displacement synthesis by an upstream polymerase. Moreover, experiments with model substrates provide additional evidence that, in the absence of FEN1 activity, relatively short GAA 5′-flaps rearrange to loops inside the double-stranded repeat tract. Larger GAA flaps are predicted to form either internal loops/hairpins or hairpin structures within the 5′-flap. All of these structures are resistant to FEN1. The new results enable refinement of previous models for the expansion pathway. The implications of the new model for genomic instability diseases are discussed. Oligonucleotides—Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligonucleotides) were synthesized by the Lineberger Nucleic Acids Core Facility at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC). DNA replication reactions were performed using synthetic oligonucleotide template-primers (Table I). Repeat template oligonucleotides 1 and 2, dUa(TTC)9Ub and dUa(TTC)10Ub, contained a 27- or 30-nucleotide TTC repeat sequence flanked by two 12-nucleotide unique sequences (Ua and Ub). The nonrepeat template (oligonucleotide 3; Table I) dUa(UT)Ub contained 30 nucleotides flanked by the Ua and Ub sequences. Replication templates were synthesized with three-carbon tails added to the 3′-ends to prevent extension by DNA polymerase. Primers for replication were either a 9-nucleotide GAA repeat primer (d(GAA)3) complementary to the repeat tract in the template or a 12-nucleotide unique primer (UP) complementary to Ub in the template (oligonucleotides 4 and 5) (Table I). Nonreplication (static) substrates for h-FEN1 contained “flap/loop” (so called because, in principle, they could form both flaps and loops when annealed to the templates) oligonucleotides 6-12 (Table I) annealed to templates. All oligonucleotides were gel-purified to >95% purity using either 10 or 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gels (7.5 m urea), except for oligonucleotides 4 and 5, which were found to be >95% pure by gel electrophoresis. All oligonucleotides were desalted using Roche Quick Spin G-25 columns.Table IOligonucleotides used in replication and h-FEN1 cleavage reactionsOligonucleotide numbers and namesSizeSequence (5′-3′)aNucleotides (nt) in the 5′ and 3′ unique regions are underlined.

Little W. Cheng X. Widen S.G. Kumar A. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). H-FEN1 protein and h-FEN1 constructs (pET-FCH in BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli) were generously provided by Sam Wilson and Michael Lieber, respectively. H-FEN1 was >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Enzyme Reactions—h-pol β replication products were either 5′-end-labeled or internally labeled during replication. To make end-labeled products, primer was 5′-end-labeled prior to annealing using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and passed through G-25 spin columns (Roche Applied Science) to remove unincorporated [32P]ATP and kinase buffer. To make internally labeled reaction products, primer was not labeled, but [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was included in the replication reaction. Prior to replication, DNA primer (60 nm) and template (60 nm) molecules were annealed by incubating at 95-100 °C for 5-10 min in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 20 mm MgCl2 and allowed to cool slowly to 4 °C. Replication reactions contained, in a final volume of 20 μl, 30 nm annealed primer-template, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, and 220 nm h-pol β. Reactions with 32P-end-labeled primers also contained 280 μm of dNTPs, whereas reactions with unlabeled primers contained 28 μm dNTPs, plus 5 μCi of 32P-labeled dATP. Reactions were assembled on ice, and transferring the reaction to 37 °C immediately after the addition of h-pol β started replication. All reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the lengths of time indicated in the figures. Reactions were stopped by the addition of formamide and EDTA (to a final concentration of 47.5% formamide and 10 mm EDTA) to reactions using end-labeled primers and by the addition of EDTA (final concentration 24 mm) to reactions using labeled dATP, followed by cooling to 4 °C. Internally labeled reaction products were passed through G-25 spin columns (Roche Applied Science) to remove unincorporated label, and formamide plus EDTA (final concentration of 47.5% formamide and 10 mm EDTA) were added prior to loading on polyacrylamide gels. Flap/loop substrates were prepared by annealing repeat and nonrepeat templates with oligonucleotides 6-14 (Table I). The repeat template dUa(TTC)9Ub was annealed to oligonucleotides (oligonucleotides 9-12; Table I) consisting of 9, 10, 12, or 15 GAA repeats plus 12 nucleotides complementary to the 5′ unique region (Ua) in the template. This created template-primers that could, in principle, contain flap conformations in equilibrium with loop conformations. For comparison, a nonrepeat template, dUa(UT)Ub, was annealed with oligonucleotides (oligonucleotides 6-8; Table I) complementary to UT and Ua in the template. This created a template-primer substrate with no flap and fixed flaps of one and three GAA repeats, respectively. h-FEN1 activity was assayed using a control substrate (oligonucleotides 13 and 14 annealed) adapted from Ref. 2Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar. The control substrate contained a 20-nucleotide flap lacking any repeats. Reaction conditions were identical to those of the replication reactions above, except the final reactions contained 10 nm annealed primer-template. h-pol β (but no dNTPs) was included in some reactions using flap/loop substrates to test the effects of h-pol β on h-FEN1 activity. H-FEN1 was added at the start of the incubations, which were at 37 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of formamide and EDTA (to a final concentration of 47.5% formamide and 10 mm EDTA) and cooled to 4 °C. A 10-base pair ladder (Invitrogen) was 5′-end-labeled as described above and used for estimating sizes of replication and expansion reaction products by gel electrophoresis. For determining the sizes of reaction products <10 nucleotides in length, end-labeled (GAA)3 primer was partially digested with P1 nuclease (Sigma) in 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 7.4), 1 mm ZnSO4, and 5% glycerol to generate a 1-nucleotide ladder. All reaction products were denatured by incubating at 100 °C for 10 min and were separated on 15 or 20% polyacrylamide denaturing gels containing 7.5 m urea. Gels were run at a constant temperature of 50-55 °C. Bands were visualized using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To determine relative amounts of products of interest, appropriate bands were quantitated using ImageQuant 5.0 image analysis software (Amersham Biosciences). Band densities were corrected for background and expressed as a percentage of the total lane density or as a ratio relative to the corresponding band density for a reference lane, as indicated under “Results.” To determine the relative amounts of expansion products per lane, all products larger than the full-length replication product were quantitated and expressed as a percentage of total lane density. To determine the relative amount of products per lane that were ∼100 nucleotides long, a rectangle was drawn around the perimeter of the 100-nucleotide band in the marker lane and was superimposed on each of the lanes of interest, at a position matching the mobility of the 100-nucleotide marker band. Plots of the amounts of reaction products were generated with Microsoft Excel software. Replication Primed from within the Repeat Tract Generates Large Amounts of Repeat Expansion—To characterize the effects of h-FEN1 on triplet repeat expansion during DNA replication, we utilized h-pol β and in vitro replication to generate repeat expansion (bottoms of Figs. 1 and 2) (29Heidenfelder B.L.

Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and generates significant amounts of expansion with our template primers (29Heidenfelder B.L. Makhov A.M. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2425-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We assume that h-FEN1 and DNA polymerase, under our conditions, act independently at opposite ends of the nascent strand. Substrate was composed of two 12-nucleotide flanking sequences and a 30-nucleotide TTC repeat tract (Fig. 1). Replication from a 12-nucleotide unique primer complementary to the upstream 12-base unique sequence Ub generated a full-length (unexpanded) product of 54 nucleotides. Replication from a 9-base (GAA)3 repeat primer complementary to the (TTC)10 repeat tract produced multiple bands, indicating products of eight different sizes (21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, and 42 nucleotides in length). The multiple products were assumed to result from the ability of the three-repeat primer to anneal to the 10-repeat template at any one of eight different positions along the repeat tract. The seven products, smaller than the predicted 42-nucleotide full-length product (30-base repeat tract plus downstream 12-base flanking sequence), were called “partial-length” products. Replication using either primer was completed within the first 5 min (Fig. 1). The amounts of repeat expansion (measured in a given lane from the band density above the fully replicated products, indicated by the arrows in the figures) in both the unique and repeat primer reactions were quantitated and expressed as a percentage of all reaction products (the total band density in the lane). For all time points tested subsequent to 0 min, reactions using the GAA repeat primer generated 7-fold larger amounts of repeat expansion (e.g. 21 ± 3% repeat expansion at 30 min (Fig. 1, lane 7), n = 4) than did reactions using the unique primer (3 ± 2% repeat expansion at 30 min (Fig. 1, lane 13), n = 4). The GAA expansion products have previously been sequenced and were found to be perfect GAA repeats (29Heidenfelder B.L. Makhov A.M. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2425-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because of the greater amounts of expansion observed in reactions primed from within the repeat tract, we used GAA repeat priming for all subsequent experiments.Fig. 2H-FEN1 suppresses repeat expansion. A, end-labeled products.

https://openalex.org/W2143947047,"Regulation and expression of human CYP1A1 is demonstrated in transgenic mice. We have developed two transgenic mouse lines. One mouse strain (CYPLucR) carries a functional human CYP1A1 promoter (–1612 to +293)-luciferase reporter gene, and the other strain (CYP1A1N) expresses CYP1A1 under control of the full-length human CYP1A1 gene and 9 kb of flanking regulatory DNA. With CYPLucR+/– mice, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlordibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and several other aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands induced hepatocyte-specific luciferase activity. When other tissues were examined, TCDD induced luciferase activity in brain with limited induction in lung and no detectable luciferase activity in kidney. Treatment of CYP1A1N+/– mice with TCDD resulted in induction of human CYP1A1 in liver and lung, while mouse Cyp1a1 was induced in liver, lung, and kidney. Although induced CYP1A1/Cyp1a1 could not be detected by Western blot analysis in brains from CYP1A1N+/– mice, induction in brain was verified by detection of CYP1A1/Cyp1a1 RNA. The administration of TCDD to nursing mothers to examine the effect of lactational exposure via milk demonstrated prominent induction of luciferase activity in livers of CYPLucR+/– newborn pups with limited induction in brain. However, TCDD treatment of adult CYPLucR+/– mice led to a 7–10-fold induction of brain luciferase activity.

Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4875-4917Google Scholar). These genes are actively regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor (2Tukey R.H. Nebert D.W. Negishi M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6003-6008Google Scholar). The Ah receptor is a member of the basic helix loop helix family of proteins (5Ema M. Sogawa K. Watanabe N. Chujoh Y. Matsushita N. Gotoh O. Funae Y.

Mueller L. Williams S.N. Quattrochi L.C. Raucy J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1074-1079Google Scholar). The process of ligand association and Ah receptor activation culminates in nuclear translocation where it partners with the basic helix loop helix region of the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator protein (9Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Google Scholar, 10Reyes H. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O.

The Ah receptor-aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator complex serves as a transcriptional unit binding to highly conserved enhancer sequences termed xenobiotic response elements (XREs) (12Gonzalez F.J. Nebert D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7269-7288Google Scholar, 13Israel D.I. Whitlock Jr., P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5400-5402Google Scholar, 14Fujisawa-Sehara A. Sogawa K. Nishi C. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1465-1477Google Scholar). Those genes that carry conserved XREs in their regulatory region are susceptible to transcriptional activation. While the number of genes that are potential targets for the Ah receptor is extensive (15Nebert D.W. Puga A. Vasiliou V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 685: 624-640Google Scholar), the levels of transcriptional activation of Cyp1a1/CYP1A1 exceeds those of other target genes and often serves as a model to investigate the functional properties of the Ah receptor. Although CYP isoforms have been monitored in human tissues and have been shown to be differentially expressed (16Ding X. Kaminsky L.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 149-173Google Scholar), very little is known regarding the mechanisms associated with Ah receptor control of the CYP1A1 gene in vivo. For the most part, studies undertaken in tissue culture or through animal models have been extrapolated to predict the response in humans. For example, the Ah receptor is functional in early embryogenesis as demonstrated by induction of hepatic rodent Cyp1a1 transplacentally at 15 days gestation following administration of 3-methylcholanthrene to pregnant mice (17Kahl G.F. Friederici D.E. Bigelow S.W. Okey A.B. Nebert D.W. Dev. Pharmacol. Ther. 1980; 1: 137-162Google Scholar, 18Chen Y.T. Negishi M. Nebert D.W. DNA. 1982; 1: 231-238Google Scholar). Analysis of Cyp1a1 in rodents has demonstrated that exposure to Ah receptor ligands is a prerequisite for protein expression. Undetectable or minimal Cyp1a1 is found in hepatic as well as most extrahepatic tissues (19Okino S.T. Pendurthi U.R. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6991-6998Google Scholar, 20Kimura S.

Pharmacol. 2003; 187: 1-10Google Scholar). These expression profiles change dramatically after the animals have been exposed to Ah receptor ligands as confirmed by transcriptional activation of Cyp1a1 and induction of mRNA and protein. The induced expression of Cyp1a1 is found in many extrahepatic tissues. Studies in various strains and substrains of mice that are genetically compromised in Ah receptor function (22Kouri R.E. Schechtman L.M. Nebert D.W. Kouri R.E. Genetic Differences in Chemical Carcinogenesis. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1980: 21-66Google Scholar, 23Nebert D.W. Gielen J.E. Fed. Proc. 1972; 31: 1315-1325Google Scholar) demonstrate that induction of Cyp1a1 is modulated by the Ah receptor. This has also been verified in mice where the Ah receptor gene has been rendered non-functional by targeted gene knock-out studies (24Zaher H. Yang T.J. Gelboin H.V. Fernandez-Salguero P.

In addition, it is speculated that circulating humoral factors play an important role in Ah receptor function since the treatment of mice with agents known to alter circulating hormones influences Ah receptor-mediated expression of Cyp1a1 (19Okino S.T. Pendurthi U.R. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6991-6998Google Scholar, 27Raunio H. Pelkonen O. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 782-786Google Scholar). Thus, to understand the regulatory properties associated with Ah receptor function and human CYP1A1 gene expression, it would be an advantage to examine expression patterns of the human gene in transgenic mice. While the Ah receptor is conserved between rodents and humans, there are significant structural differences between the rodent Cyp1a1 and human CYP1A1 locus. The CYP1A cluster is located on chromosome 15q22-qter with CYP1A1 reading toward the telomere and CYP1A2 reading toward the centromere (28Corchero J. Pimprale S. Kimura S. Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 1-6Google Scholar). The distance between the start of transcription of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 is 23 kb (GenBank™ accession numbers AF253322 and NT 010194), and it has been speculated that active enhancer sequences that reside between the two promoters could contribute equally to the expression of both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 (28Corchero J. Pimprale S. Kimura S. Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 1-6Google Scholar). For example, there are 13 XRE core DNA sequences that may participate in CYP1A induction following activation of the Ah receptor. In comparison, the rodent Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 genes are organized similarly with Cyp1a1 transcription proceeding in the complement direction to Cyp1a2 transcription, but the promoters are separated by only 4.3 kb of DNA (GenBank™ accession number NT 039474). Since conservation within the regulatory regions of the human CYP1A and mouse Cyp1a locus has not been maintained, the regulatory regions flanking the human and mouse promoters may contribute significantly toward differences in expression patterns as determined by induction and through tissue-specific control. In this study we describe the development of transgenic CYPLucR mice that express the CYP1A1-luciferase reporter gene. Expression of the CYP1A1-luciferase reporter gene in different tissues is dependent upon exposure to Ah receptor ligands. To complement these studies, we also developed CYP1A1N transgenic mice that carry a 15-kb fragment of human DNA encoding the entire CYP1A1 gene and 11 kb of regulatory DNA. Treatment of both CYPLucR and CYP1A1N mice with TCDD provides a novel opportunity to study the differential patterns of expression of human CYP1A1 as well as rodent Cyp1a1. As will be demonstrated, the induction of human CYP1A1 by Ah receptor ligands is dependent upon tissue-specific as well as developmental factors. Chemicals and Reagents—TCDD was purchased from Wellington Laboratories (Guelph, Ontario, Canada). Benzo[a]pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysin, β-naphthoflavone, and 3-methylcholanthrene were obtained from Sigma. Luciferin was obtained from Analytical Luminescence Laboratory (San Diego, CA). Generation of CYP1A1 Transgenic Mice—The human CYP1A1 gene was cloned from a human liver genomic library constructed in the replacement vector λ-EMBL-3 (29Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 66-71Google Scholar). The λ-EMBL-3 clone encoded bases 3975–19807 (Fig. 1) as determined from alignment of DNA sequence with that deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AF253322). The λ-EMBL-3 DNA encoded exons 1–7 and ∼11 kb of 5′ flanking DNA. The CYP1A1 gene was removed from the λ-EMBL-3 clone by a single digest with SalI, and the purified DNA was used for microinjection into fertilized CB6F1 (F1 hybrid between BALB/c and C57BL/6N mice) mouse eggs and transplanted into the oviduct of pseudopregnant C57BL/6N mice for the production of transgenic mice. This service was provided by the UCSD Transgenic Mouse and Embryonic Stem Cell Shared Resource. For genotype analysis, DNA from tail clippings was screened by PCR using specific CYP1A1 primers that encoded a portion of exon 7. The oligonucleotides spanned bases 5558–5539 (5′-GCCCACAGCCCAGATAGCAA-3′) and bases 6551–6570 (5′-GGTCTGGCCAGGTCTAGGCA-3′). For PCR analysis, DNA was amplified in a 30-μl reaction containing 15 μl of Qiagen Hotstart Master Mix (following the manufacturer's instructions), 2 μl of template DNA, and a 0.6 μm concentration of each primer. A 15-min activation of the polymerase was carried out at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles from 95 °C for 30 s to 57 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 60 s followed by the final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Reactions were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR 2400 system. From 10 litters and 48 offspring, six founders were CYP1A1-positive. Each of the founders was bred, and all of the F1-CYP1A1 mice produced inducible human hepatic CYP1A1 following a single treatment of 0.32 μg/kg TCDD as determined by Western blot analysis. One founder, which we identified as CYP1A1N, was selected for breeding into C57BL/6N mice. Generation of CYP1A1-Luciferase Transgenic Mice—A portion of the 5′ flanking region of the human CYP1A1 gene from –1612 through +292 was cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene as reported previously (30Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Google Scholar). The CYP1A1 promoter and luciferase gene were removed from the pL1A1N plasmid by EcoRI-BamHI digestion, and the fragment was purified from agarose gels. The purified DNA was micro-injected into the pronucleus of fertilized CB6F1 (F1 hybrid between BALB/c and C57BL/6N mice) mouse eggs and transplanted into the oviduct of pseudopregnant C57BlL/6N mice. All procedures for the generation of transgenic mice were carried out at the University of California, San Diego Superfund Transgenic Core Facility. From 12 litters and 56 offspring, genomic DNA was extracted from tail clippings of 3-week-old mice using a Qiagen Dneasy tissue kit. The luciferase gene was identified using forward (5′-GGAGAGCAACTGCATAAGGC-3′, bases 70–88) and reverse (5′-AATCTCACGCAGGCAGTTCT-3′, bases 641–659) primers. The 590-bp amplified luciferase fragment was identified in four founders. The CYPLuc mice were bred with C57BL/6N mice from Jackson Laboratory, and F1-CYPLuc mice were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of TCDD (0.32 μg/kg). One of the founders, identified as Rico, produced F1-CYPLucR-positive mice that expressed highly inducible hepatic luciferase activity. The F1-CYPLucR mice were bred for at least three generations. Ethoxyresorufin O-Deethylase Assay—Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity, a marker of CYP1A1 activity, was determined spectrofluorometrically in liver microsomes isolated from CYP1A1N+/– and CYP1A1N–/– mice. The reaction was carried out in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm MgCl2,8 μm 7-ethoxyresorufin, and 1 mm NADPH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μg of microsomal protein. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Control samples were incubated in the absence of NADPH. The incubations were terminated by the addition of cold methanol. The formation of resorufin was measured fluorometrically with the excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm and was normalized to a resorufin standard curve. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of Mouse Cyp1a1 and Human CYP1A1 RNA—Approximately 200 mg of tissue was homogenized, and total RNA was extracted using acidic phenol/guanidinium isothiocyanate solution (TRIzol, Invitrogen). Three micrograms of total RNA were denatured in the presence of 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) primers at 70 °C for 10 min, and the cDNA was synthesized as described previously (31Strassburg C.P. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2979-2985Google Scholar). The PCR contained a 2 mm concentration of each primer for mouse Cyp1a1, human CYP1A1, firefly luciferase, and the actin gene. The forward Cyp1a1 primer was 5′-CTGGCTGTCACCGTATTCTGC-3′, and the reverse Cyp1a1 primer was 5′-GGTCACCCCACAGTTCCCGG-3′. The forward human CYP1A1 primer was 5′-CCGGCGCTATGACCACAACC-3′ and encoded bases 7661–7680 (GenBank™ accession number AF253322), and the reverse primer was 5′CCTCCCAGCGGGCAATGGTC-3′ encoding bases 5822–5842. The forward mouse actin primer was 5′-ATGGCCACTGCCGCATCCTC-3′, and the reverse actin primer was 5′-GGGTACATGGTGGTACCACC-3′. The reaction was carried out in a 100-μl volume containing 3 mm MgCl2, 50mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, a 0.2 mm concentration of each dNTP, and 5 units of VENT (exo–) DNA polymerase. The reaction was initiated by a 5-min incubation at 95 °C followed by elongation at 72 °C for 7 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for min. Detection of Expressed Luciferase Activity—Tissues extracted from mice were homogenized in 200 μl of 100 mm KPO4 lysis buffer containing 4 mm EGTA, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenates were freeze-thawed three times and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentrations were determined using a standardized Bradford kit purchased from Bio-Rad. For analysis of luciferase activity, 10 μl of each supernatant was mixed with 300 μl of 15 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 15 mm MgSO4, 2 mm ATP, 4 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tricine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. To start the reaction, 100 μl of luciferin was added, and light output was measured for 10 s at 24 °C using a Monolight 2001 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories). The relative light units were normalized to the protein content. Western Blot Analysis—Various tissues were homogenized in 4 volumes of 1.15% potassium chloride solution. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min in an Eppendorf Microfuge to obtain the supernatant fraction. The supernatant fraction was collected and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL100 tabletop ultracentrifuge. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.25) containing 0.1% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm butylated hydroxytoluene, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Microsomes were stored in aliquots at –80 °C prior to Western blot analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford solutions normalized to standard protein solutions. Twenty micrograms of microsomal protein were boiled for 5 min in loading buffer (6% SDS, 20% sucrose, 0.25 m dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gel (Novex, San Diego, CA). The resolved protein was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane with an electrotransfer apparatus (Novex) for 90 min. Incubating the membrane with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline solution for 1 h at room temperature blocked nonspecific protein binding sites. The membrane was then incubated with a rabbit anti-human CYP1A1 primary antibody (32Soucek P. Martin M.V. Ueng Y.F. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16013-16021Google Scholar) for 1 h followed by a wash and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Protein was visualized using chemiluminescence reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by exposure to the x-ray film. Hepatocyte Cell Isolation—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 8–12-week-old mice. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation. The inferior vena cava was cannulated and perfused at the rate of 4 ml/min. The portal vein was sectioned to allow flow through the liver. The liver was first perfused with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.5 mm EGTA and 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.4 followed by a perfusion with 0.2% collagenase solution buffered with 1 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 130 mm NaCl, and 3 mm KCl for 3 min at 4 ml/min. The liver was dissected, and hepatocytes were isolated by mechanical dissection, filtered through a sterile 70-μm filter, and washed twice by centrifugation at 50 × g for 5 min. The hepatocytes were either lysed or cultured in 6-well plates in 3 ml of Williams' Medium E (Invitrogen) containing 1% l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v). Four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Primary hepatocytes were treated 24 h after seeding and analyzed for luciferase activity as described above. Characterization of Hepatic CYP1A1-Luciferase Expression in CYPLucR+/– Mice—The human CYP1A1 gene is regulated in part through activation of the Ah receptor, but other important transcriptional factor activators such as Sp1 (33Sanderson J.T. Aarts J.M. Brouwer A. Froese K.L. Denison M.S. Giesy J.P. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 137: 316-325Google Scholar), NF1, NF-YB (34Boucher P.D. Piechocki M.P. Hines R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5144-5151Google Scholar), and protein kinase C (35Carrier F. Owens R.A. Nebert D.W. Puga A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1856-1863Google Scholar, 36Chen Y.-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Google Scholar) play important roles in modifying gene expression in the presence of Ah receptor ligands. In HepG2 cells, a –1612 bp fragment of the CYP1A1 promoter (Fig. 1) containing these DNA binding sequences as well as the XRE sequences has been shown to serve as a template for transcriptional activation of luciferase reporter gene activity in the presence of Ah receptor ligands (30Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Google Scholar). To examine whether this CYP1A1-luciferase gene can function as a reporter gene in vivo, CYP1A1-luciferase (CYPlucR)-positive mice (see “Materials and Methods”) were generated. Characterization of luciferase induction was examined in CYPLucR+/– mice after 24 h following a single intraperitoneal injection of TCDD. Examining a range of TCDD treatments between 0.0125 and 16 μg/kg, induction of luciferase activity was observed with a minimal dose of 0.32 μg/kg (Fig. 2). Detection of microsomal Cyp1a1 by Western blot analysis was also confirmed with a minimal dose of 0.32 μg/kg, demonstrating that the cellular and molecular properties that influence gene expression of the CYP1A1-luciferase and the endogenous Cyp1a1 gene are similar. In tissue culture cells, the human CYP1A1-luciferase gene is responsive to halogenated hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (30Postlind H. Vu T.P. Tukey R.H. Quattrochi L.C. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1993; 118: 255-262Google Scholar, 36Chen Y.-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Google Scholar) as well as to bioflavonoids such as chrysin (8Allen S.W. Mueller L. Williams S.N. Quattrochi L.C. Raucy J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1074-1079Google Scholar) and certain substituted benzimidazoles such as omeprazole (38Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 504-508Google Scholar). Along with TCDD, 3-methylcholanthrene, benzo[a]pyrene, and benz[a]anthracene induced hepatic luciferase activity as well as microsomal Cyp1a1 in CYPLucR+/– mice (Fig. 3). The compound 5,6-benzoflavone (β-naphthoflavone) was a good inducer of Cyp1a1 in liver microsomes and also induced luciferase activity, but the induction of luciferase activity was less than that observed for 3-methylcholanthrene, benzo[a]pyrene, and benz[a]anthracene. Omeprazole and chrysin, which induce human CYP1A1 in human tissue culture cells as well as CYP1A1-luciferase in TV101 cells (8Allen S.W. Mueller L. Williams S.N. Quattrochi L.C. Raucy J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1074-1079Google Scholar, 38Quattrochi L.C. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 504-508Google Scholar), were not able to induce luciferase activity in CYPLucR+/– mice. This result would indicate that chrysin and omeprazole are being influenced by in vivo factors in a pattern that differs from their ability to induce CYP1A1 in tissue culture cells. Microsomal P450 expression in liver is localized to the hepatocytes. To examine whether induced luciferase activity is expressed in hepatocytes, CYPLucR+/– mice were treated for 24 h with 3.2 μg/kg TCDD, and luciferase activity was assayed in isolated hepatocytes. When we compared luciferase activity in hepatocytes isolated from untreated mice, CYP1A1-luciferase activity was induced in hepatocytes from the TCDD-treated mice (Table I). A similar induction profile was observed when hepatocytes from untreated CYPLucR+/– mice were first cultured for 24 h and then treated with 10 nm TCDD. These results suggest that integration of the CYP1A1-luciferase gene into the mouse genome can be regulated in a tissue-specific and inducible fashion comparable to what is observed for expression of the mouse Cyp1a1 gene.Table IInduction of CYP1A1-driven luciferase activity following TCDD treatment in liver and isolated hepatocytes from CYPLucR+/– miceTreatmentLiveraLuciferase activity measured in cytosolic fractions from CYPLucR mice treated for 24 h with 3.2 μg/kg TCDD.HepatocytesbCYPLucR mice were treated for 24 h with TCDD, and luciferase activity was measured in isolated hepatocytes.Hepatocytes in culturecHepatocytes were isolated from CYPLucR mice and placed into culture for 24 h.

Open table in a new tab Extrahepatic Expression of CYP1A1-Luciferase—Analysis of luciferase activity in different tissues both in the absence and presence of Ah receptor ligands would be considered a good indicator of the actions of ligand toward activation of the Ah receptor and induction of the CYP1A1 gene. To examine the expression of CYP1A1-luciferase in different tissues, 8-week-old CYPLucR+/– mice were treated with 3.2 μg/kg TCDD for 24 h, the tissues were isolated, and luciferase activity was monitored (Fig. 4). As expected, the most significant level of induced expression was noted in liver. No induction was noted in small or large intestine, which differs from previous reports on the induction of Cyp1a1 in rat and mouse gastrointestinal tract (39Dey A. Jones J.E. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 525-537Google Scholar). To our surprise, there was no induction of luciferase activity in kidney and only limited induction in lung, two tissues that have been studied extensively and shown to elicit induction of Cyp1a1 (19Okino S.T. Pendurthi U.R. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6991-6998Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 5.Fig. 5Induction of CYP1A1 and Cyp1a1 in CYP1A1N+/– and CYP1A1N–/– mice by TCDD. Western blots were prepared using microsomal preparations, and TCDD-induced CYP1A1 or Cyp1a1 was monitored by detection with the anti-human CYP1A1 antibody. A, three CYP1A1N-negative (F1-1A1–/–) and three CYP1A1N-positive (F1-1A1+/–) mice derived from the same litter were treated with 3.2 μg/kg TCDD (T) for 24 h, and microsomal preparations from liver were analyzed for induction of human CYP1A1 and mouse Cyp1a1. Microsomes from an Me2SO (D)-treated CYP1A1N-positive (F1-1A1+/–) mouse is included. To monitor for induction of human CYP1A1, microsomal preparations from human HepG2 cells treated with 10 nm TCDD for 24 h were included. B, liver, lung, and kidney microsomes were prepared from adult CYP1A1N+/– (1A1+/–) and CYP1A1N–/– (1A1–/–) mice that were treated with either Me2SO (D) or TCDD (T). Tissues were pooled for two animals, and microsomal preparations were generated. Each lane contains 20 μg of microsomal protein. C, RNA from liver and brain tissue from Me2SO (D)-treated and TCDD (T)-treated CYP1A1N+/– (1A1+/–) and CYP1A1N–/– (1A1–/–) mice was used in a reverse transcription-PCR. Primers specific for the detection of human CYP1A1, mouse Cyp1a1, and actin were included in the same reaction. Std, standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interestingly significant levels of induced luciferase activity occurred in brain. This large increase in luciferase activity may in part be a result of basal luciferase activity that is nearly 100-fold higher than that observed in livers from untreated mice. Elevated levels of constitutive luciferase activity are in agreement with reports that Cyp1a1 is constitutively expressed in rodent brain (39Dey A. Jones J.E. Nebert"

In the current study, we have defined the borders of the interaction between the FEN-1 protein and its DNA substrates and identified six clusters of conserved positively charged amino acid residues, which are in direct contact with DNA substrate. To map further the corresponding interactions between FEN-1 residues and DNA substrates, we performed biochemical assays employing a series of flap DNA substrates lacking some structural components and a series of binding-deficient point mutants of FEN-1.

These two regions contain 7–8 conserved acidic amino acid residues that coordinate two magnesium ions and form an active center for catalysis (15Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Google Scholar). A third motif toward the C terminus is involved in the interaction between FEN-1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (16Shen B. Qiu J. Hosfield D. Tainer J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 171-173Google Scholar, 17Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2313-2321Google Scholar, 18Frank G. Qiu J. Zheng L. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36295-36302Google Scholar). This interaction is required for the recruitment of FEN-1 to proliferating cell nuclear antigen at sites of Okazaki fragment processing and DNA damage repair (4Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Google Scholar, 17Warbrick E. Lane D.P. Glover D.M. Cox L.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2313-2321Google Scholar, 19Kim K. Biade S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8842-8848Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, FEN-1 also has a C-terminal motif with multiple clusters of positively charged amino acid residues, which are important for the localization of FEN-1 into the nucleus (20Qiu J. Li X. Frank G. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4901-4908Google Scholar). Crystal structures of FEN-1 enzymes have identified structural elements that may be important for interactions with DNA flap substrates. Structures of FEN-1 and its homologs, including three archaeal FEN-1 proteins, T4 RNase H, and T5 exonuclease (21Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Google Scholar, 22Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Google Scholar, 23Hosfield D. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Google Scholar, 24Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.-Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Google Scholar) exhibit an arch element formed by a helix-loop-helix motif located over the active center. This “helical arch” structure contains a number of positively charged and bulky amino acid residues on its inner side, which could be in the direct contact with the single-stranded DNA flap of DNA flap substrates (23Hosfield D. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Google Scholar, 24Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.-Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Google Scholar). Corresponding residues in the 5′-nuclease of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I have been shown to play a role in DNA binding (25Xu Y. Potapova O. Leschziner A.E. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30167-30177Google Scholar). Furthermore, partial deletions of this region in Methanococcus jannaschii FEN-1 (mjFEN-1) abolish enzyme activity (24Hwang K.Y. Baek K. Kim H.-Y. Cho Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 707-713Google Scholar). This arch structure may allow FEN-1 to slide through the single-stranded flap of flap DNA substrate to perform structure-specific cleavages, a sliding-through mechanism proposed for FEN-1 by Barnes et al. (26Barnes C.J. Wahl F. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29624-29631Google Scholar). In addition, this structure was shown to be critical for catalysis in human FEN-1 (27Storici F. Henneke G. Ferrari E. Gordenin D.A. Hubscher U. Resnick M.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5930-5942Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the helical arch region undergoes a conformational change upon binding to substrate DNA, resulting in increased helical content, which may aid in positioning the single-stranded DNA flap near the catalytic site (28Kim C.Y. Park M.S. Dyer R.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3208-3214Google Scholar, 29Chapados B.R. Hosfield D.J. Han S. Qiu J. Yelent B. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 39-50Google Scholar). In addition to the helical arch region, analysis of the Pyrococcus furiosus FEN-1 (pfFEN-1) crystal structure revealed a positively charged groove containing the active center and a H3TH motif, which were proposed to mediate binding of the double- or single-stranded regions of the flap DNA substrates to FEN-1 (23Hosfield D. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Google Scholar). The recent structure of Archaeoglobus fulgidus FEN-1 (afFEN-1) bound to DNA identified two additional helix-loop-helix motifs that contact the upstream portion of the DNA flap substrate (29Chapados B.R. Hosfield D.J. Han S. Qiu J. Yelent B. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 39-50Google Scholar). Consistent with this report, mutation of Arg47 and Arg70 in human FEN-1, which are both located in these regions, affects substrate binding specificity (30Qiu J. Bimston D.N. Partikian A. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24659-24666Google Scholar). Furthermore, biochemical and mutational analysis of Pyrococcus horikoshii FEN-1 (phFEN-1) (31Matsui E. Musti K.V. Abe J. Yamasaki K. Matsui I. Harata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37840-37847Google Scholar) revealed a total of five loop regions important for protein-DNA interactions, which include the helical arch, H3TH, and other structurally identified DNA binding regions. Although evidence for the DNA-protein interaction of FEN-1 is accumulating, it is still important to identify all of the elements directly involved in substrate binding to understand how the enzyme positions its substrates in a way that optimizes cleavage. Here we present mutational and biochemical analyses of human FEN-1 which define how FEN-1 interacts with DNA. We defined the borders of the interactions between the FEN-1 and its DNA substrates by exonuclease III (exoIII) footprinting. In addition, we identified 14 FEN-1 mutations that affect DNA binding. Using FEN-1 substrates designed to test the interactions of these mutants with known specific regions of the flap substrate, we determined the substrate binding orientation for human FEN-1 and implicated key structural elements in DNA binding. Moreover, Arg70 and Arg47, which are known to be involved in FEN-1·DNA binding, were determined to interact with the sites around the 2nd nucleotide (Arg70) and the 5th/6th nucleotide (Arg47) of the template strand in the upstream duplex portion counting from the nick point of the flap substrate. Together, these results and the protein·DNA complex structure (29Chapados B.R. Hosfield D.J. Han S. Qiu J. Yelent B. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 39-50Google Scholar) allowed us to propose a reasonable model for how the human FEN-1 protein interacts with its DNA substrates. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Overexpression, and Purification—All human FEN-1 mutants used for this study were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Mutagenic primers were synthesized at the City of Hope DNA/RNA/peptide synthesis core facility. Mutations and corresponding oligonucleotide sequences for primers are listed in Table S1 for clarity as supplementary material and are available upon request. Site-directed mutagenesis, overexpression, and purification of wild type and mutant FEN-1 enzymes were carried out based on our previously published procedures (30Qiu J. Bimston D.N. Partikian A. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24659-24666Google Scholar). Mutagenesis reactions were performed using pET-28-derived plasmids harboring the wild type human FEN-1 sequence as a template so that the isolated plasmids containing a mutation could be used directly for protein expression in E. coli. Protein Sequence Alignment and Three-dimensional Structure Modeling of Human FEN-1 and FEN-1·DNA Complexes—The sequences of FEN-1 proteins were aligned using ClustalW 1.8 Multiple Sequence Alignment Algorithm at BCM Search Launcher, Baylor College of Medicine HGSC (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu). The structure of human FEN-1 was modeled using the crystal structures of M. jannaschii and P. furiosus FEN-1 proteins as templates (PDB files 1A76 and 1B43). Using the homology module within the molecular modeling program Insight II (Accelrys, San Diego), the sequence of human FEN-1 was aligned with the archaeal FEN-1 sequences. Structural information was then used to modify the final alignment of the three FEN-1 sequences so that insertions and deletions fell between secondary structure elements. The model was built and refined using scripts provided with the program. The hFEN-1·DNA model was constructed using initial DNA coordinates from the crystal structure of afFEN-1 bound to DNA (PDB code 1RXW). The upstream DNA substrate was initially positioned by aligning the hFEN-1 model with the afFEN-1 based on Cα positions. Close contacts in the initial hFEN-1·DNA were eliminated by rigid body minimization based only on stereochemical parameters using crystallography NMR software (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The downstream DNA and 5′-flap regions were then added to the model and positioned in a way that satisfied the greatest number of contacts to residues known to affect DNA binding. The steric clashes between side chains and the DNA were resolved by minimizing only the side chain atoms of hFEN-1 using crystallography NMR software. DNA Substrate Preparation and FEN-1 Nuclease Activity Assays— Protocols for DNA substrate preparation and nuclease activity assays were performed as published previously (30Qiu J. Bimston D.N. Partikian A. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24659-24666Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides as shown in the relevant figures were individually phosphorylated at the 5′-end. This was done by incubating 40 pmol of the oligonucleotide with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μl (10 units/μl) of polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 60 min. Polynucleotide kinase was then inactivated by heating at 72 °C for 10 min. 80 pmol each of remaining oligonucleotides for individual substrates listed in the relevant figures were added to the labeled oligonucleotides, respectively. The samples were incubated at 70 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to 25 °C, thus allowing the oligonucleotides to anneal and form the flap and nick duplex substrates. Substrates were precipitated at -20 °C overnight after adding 20 μl of 3 m NaOAc and 1 ml of 100% ethanol. Substrates were collected by centrifugation and washed once with 70% ethanol and resuspended in sterile water. Reactions were carried out with the indicated amount of hFEN-1 and 80 nm flap or nick duplex substrate in reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 mm MgCl2. Each reaction was then brought to a total volume of 10 μl with water. All reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated by adding an equal volume of stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol). An aliquot of each reaction was then run on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 1900 V for 1 h. The gel was dried at 70 °C for 50 min, and the bands were visualized by autoradiography. Kinetic Analysis—FEN-1 cleavage kinetic assays were performed using various concentrations of DNA substrates (30–500 nm) and constant amounts of FEN-1 (92 nm) following the procedures described by Hosfield et al. (33Hosfield D.J. Frank G. Weng Y. Tainer J.A. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27154-27161Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were initiated by combining standard reaction buffer, substrate, and enzyme in order. Samples were mixed and incubated for 2 min. The products and substrates were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The initial velocity was calculated by measuring product and substrate intensity on the gel using the IPLab Gel program and the equation, v=(I1/(I0+0.5I1)t)×[substrate](Eq. 1) where t = time in seconds, I1 = product intensity, and I0 = final substrate concentration. The substrate concentration was expressed in nm. Vmax and Km values were calculated by directly fitting the data into the Michaelis-Menten equation, and then Kcat was calculated by Vmax/[E0]. Km, Kcat, and Kcat/Km values were finally used for plotting. Direct Enzyme/Substrate Binding Analysis—This assay was conducted using a method modified from one established by Harrington and Lieber (34Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Google Scholar). In brief, the indicated amounts of FEN-1 were mixed with 80 nm labeled DNA in a final volume of 10 μl containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, each reaction was loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE. The reactions were then electrophoresed for 45 min at 100 V at 4 °C. The gel was dried and then exposed to Kodak x-ray film for imaging. ExoIII Footprinting—For this experiment, we followed a procedure described by Hohl et al. (35Hohl M. Thorel F. Clarkson S.G. Scharer O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19500-19508Google Scholar). Human FEN-1 mutant R100A or D181A was used to bind 0.27-pmol flap substrates with 5′-32P end labeling of the flap strand or template strand. They were incubated in 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 20 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin with 2 mm MgCl2 and 100-fold excess cold double-stranded DNA competitor for 20 min. Subsequently, 20 units of exoIII were added to allow a 15-min digestion at 15 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm and formamide loading buffer. After heating for 10 min at 75 °C, the reactions were analyzed on a 15% sequencing gel and the digestion patterns were visualized by autoradiography. Circular dichroism (CD) Measurements—CD measurements were performed using a J-600 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo) as described previously (36Chai Q. Qiu J. Chapados B.R. Shen B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1073-1081Google Scholar). Briefly, the far-UV (200–250 nm) CD spectrum was obtained at 25 °C using a solution containing 90 μg/ml enzyme, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) in a 2-mm path length cuvette. CD data were analyzed using the K2D program (37Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Google Scholar) for the calculation of the relative ratio of α-helices, β-sheets, and random coils. Defining the Region of DNA Substrates Contacted by FEN-1—To obtain an insight into how FEN-1 binds to DNA substrates, we used exoIII footprinting to determine the region of DNA protected by FEN-1. ExoIII is an Mg2+-dependent, 3′ → 5′-exonuclease that digests DNA in a progressive manner but is blocked by the presence of proteins bound to DNA. This method has recently been used to define the protein-DNA borders of XPG endonuclease, a FEN-1 homolog, complexed with its DNA substrate (35Hohl M. Thorel F. Clarkson S.G. Scharer O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19500-19508Google Scholar). To prevent substrate cleavage by FEN-1, we used catalytically inactive FEN-1 mutants (R100A and D181A), which are still capable of binding to DNA substrates (15Shen B. Nolan J.P. Sklar L.A. Park M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9173-9176Google Scholar). Although both mutants are catalytically inactive, the R100A mutant has a lower DNA binding affinity than D181A and was used to avoid nonspecific binding to long DNA substrates. FEN-1 substrates were 32P labeled at the 5′-end of either the template strand (Fig. 1A) or the flap strand (Fig. 1B). Addition of R100A (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5) enhanced a band 34 nucleotides in length indicated by black arrows both on the schematic diagram of the substrates and on the right side of gel image. This result implies that the 3′-end border of the template strand is at the position of the 20th nucleotide relative to the nick site. The addition of D181A to the 5′-flap-labeled substrate produces a clear stalling band next to the 3′-end of the flap strand (Fig. 1B, lanes 8 and 9, black arrows). This result indicates that the flap strand forms a 3′-end border with FEN-1 at the position of 13th nucleotide relative to the nick site of flap substrate. Effects of Mutations of Positively Charged Amino Acids on hFEN-1 Nuclease Activities—To investigate comprehensively the key structural elements of FEN-1 which are involved in the interactions with DNA substrates, we mutated 29 positively charged amino acid residues to alanine, either individually or in combinations of two residues (Table I and Fig. 2). For each FEN-1 mutant, we determined both the flap endonuclease (Fig. 3A) and exonuclease (Fig. 3B) activities. In addition to R47A and R70A, which were described previously (30Qiu J. Bimston D.N. Partikian A. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24659-24666Google Scholar), 13 mutants were determined to have significantly reduced enzyme activities, including K93A, R100A, R103A/R104A, K125A, K128A/R129A, K132A, R192A, K200A, K201A, K244A/R245A, K252A/K254A, K267A, and K326A/R327A. Of these mutant proteins, K93A, R100A, K128A/R129A, K132A, R192A, and K201A have no detectable enzyme activities, whereas the rest of them are partially deficient.Table INuclease activity and binding activity alterations of human FEN-1 mutants +++; wide type enzyme activity; ++; decreased activity; +; minimal activity; -, no activity; ND not defined; *, with binding deficiency; Up-D, upstream duplex; Down-D, downstream duplex; ss-Flap, single-stranded DNA Flap.MutationsFEN-1 motifsNuclease activitiesBinding capacityBinding deficiencyInteractive DNA regionEndo-activityExo-activityFlap substrateNick substrateWild type++++++++++++K29A/K80AND++++++++++++R47ASmall loop 1+++++++*Up-DR70AND++++++*Up-DR73AND++++++++++++K93ALarge loop––+++++*ss-FlapK99A++++++++++++R100A––++++++R103A++++++++++++R103A/R104A++++*K125A+++++++++*ss-FlapK128A/R129A++++*K132A––––*R192ASmall loop 2––––*K200A++++*Down-DK201A––––*R239ASmall loop 3++++++++++++K244A/R245A+++++++*Down-DK252A/K254ASmall loop 4+–––*Down-DR261A/R262A++++++++++++K267A+++++++++*NDR320AND++++++++++++K326A/R327AND+++++++++*Up-D Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Enzyme activities of wild type and mutant FEN-1 proteins.

For both A and B, the top bands represent the uncut substrates, and the bottom bands are the cleavage products. The oligonucleotide size is indicated in nucleotides (nt). Reactions were carried out with 133 nm hFEN-1 protein and 80 nm of flap or nick duplex substrate in reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 10 μl with water. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also tested whether these mutations could affect the stimulation of nuclease activities by an additional 3′-flap on the substrate. As reported previously, FEN-1 activity is stimulated significantly by an extra nucleotide at the 3′-end of the upstream primer of the normal flap substrate (38Lyamichev V. Brow M.A.D. Varvel V.E. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6143-6148Google Scholar). Such a double flap substrate was proposed to be an in vivo substrate for FEN-1 (39Kao H.I. Henricksen L.A. Liu Y. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14379-14389Google Scholar). If the corresponding amino acid residues are critical for interacting with the 3′-overlapping nucleotide of the upstream primer, we expect to see a loss or reduction of activity stimulation in the mutants. However, our results indicate that these mutations had no effect on activity stimulation by the 3′-flap (data not shown), indicating that these positively charged amino acid residues are not involved in the interaction with the 3′-flap nucleotide of a double flap DNA substrate. Residues That Are Critical for Substrate Binding—Loss or reduction of the nuclease activities in the 15 mutants identified above could be the result of conformational changes caused by mutations, deficiency in substrate binding, or destruction of the catalytic center. Because CD spectra are good indicators of major protein conformational changes, we analyzed the conformation of the 15 mutants with decreased activities using CD spectroscopy. The CD spectrum profiles and calculated ratios of α-helices to β-sheets for the mutants were similar to those of wild type FEN-1, indicating that the FEN-1 mutations did not cause significant conformational changes (data not shown). To measure the DNA binding capacity of the activity-deficient mutants, we performed gel shift assays. These assays are especially important for determining the substrate binding capacity of the mutants that do not show any FEN-1 activity because these mutants cannot be characterized by conventional kinetic analysis. FEN-1 forms a complex with both the flap substrate (Fig. 4A) and the nicked duplex substrate (data not shown) in the presence of EDTA, which prevents the cleavage reaction (33Hosfield D.J. Frank G. Weng Y. Tainer J.A. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27154-27161Google Scholar). Overall, among the 15 mutants, almost all except for R100A have reduced affinity for DNA compared with wild type FEN-1. Twelve mutants, R47A, R70A, R103A/R104A, K128A/R129A, K132A, R192A, K200A, K201A, K244A/R245A, K252A/K254A, K267A, and K326A/R327A, had significantly lower affinity for both flap and nick duplex substrates compared with wild type FEN-1, whereas K93A and K125A had binding affinities slightly lower than wild type FEN-1. K132A, R192A, K201A, and K252A/K254A had no detectable affinity for either DNA substrate. Although the R100A mutant did not show any deficiency in binding to DNA, its enzyme activities were lost, indicating that Arg100 may play a critical role in enzyme catalysis. This might also be true for Lys93 because its mutation to alanine has only a slight effect on FEN-1 affinity for DNA but completely abolishes FEN-1 enzyme activity. To address further the roles of these positively charged amino acid residues in cleavage or substrate binding, we performed kinetic analysis. We measured cleavage activity with both the flap and nick duplex DNA substrates. Mutants with no detectable enzyme activity (6 of 15) were excluded in this analysis because their kinetic parameters were not measurable. In this analysis, Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to derive Vmax and Km values, and Kcat and Kcat/Km values were then calculated (Fig. 5). Overall, the mutants R47A, R70A, R103A/R104A, K125A, K128A/R129A, K200A, K244A/K245A, and K326A/R327A have increased Km, decreased Kcat, and decreased Kcat/Km values (Fig. 5). The increased Km values of the mutants suggest a substrate binding deficiency. In particular, the mutants R103A/R104A, K128A/R129A, K200A, and K244A/K245A had significantly higher Km values compared with the wild type protein, whereas their Kcat and Kcat/Km values were proportionally reduced. These results indicate that the decreased activity of these mutants is mainly the result of a substrate binding deficiency and therefore, the corresponding amino acid residues of these mutants are important for DNA substrate binding. These results are consistent with the gel shift assays (Fig. 4), supporting the role of these residues in DNA binding. Determination of the Binding Orientation between FEN-1 and Its 5′-Overhang Substrate—A typical flap DNA substrate can be designated into three portions: upstream duplex, single-stranded flap, and downstream duplex (Fig. 1). To understand fully FEN-1-DNA interactions, it is critical to determine the identified protein structure elements (amino acid residues) that interact with each portion of the DNA substrate. Compared with the standard flap substrates, the 5′-overhang substrate has no upstream duplex portion, which allows us to determine which amino acid residues of FEN-1 interact with the upstream duplex. If the amino acid residues interact with this component, we expect that mutations of these residues will significantly affect FEN-1 flap cleavage activity using a standard flap substrate. However, when a 5′-overhang substrate that lacks the upstream duplex is used, the mutations should have no effect. A comparison of the substrate"

These enzymes are important targets of a variety of anti-bacterial and anti-cancer agents. We identified a mutation in human topoisomerase II α, changing aspartic acid 48 to asparagine, that has the unique property of failing to transform yeast cells deficient in recombinational repair. In repair-proficient yeast strains, the Asp-48 → Asn mutant can be expressed and complements a temperature-sensitive top2 mutation. Purified Asp-48 → Asn Top2α has relaxation and decatenation activity similar to the wild type enzyme, but the purified protein exhibits several biochemical alterations compared with the wild type enzyme. The mutant enzyme binds both covalently closed and linear DNA with greater avidity than the wild type enzyme. hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn) also exhibited elevated levels of drug-independent cleavage compared with the wild type enzyme. The enzyme did not show altered sensitivity to bisdioxopiperazines nor did it form stable closed clamps in the absence of ATP, although the enzyme did form elevated levels of closed clamps in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog compared with the wild type enzyme. We suggest that the lethality exhibited by the mutant is likely because of its enhanced drug-independent cleavage, and we propose that alterations in the ATP binding domain of the enzyme are capable of altering the interactions of the enzyme with DNA.

Changes in DNA topology require cleavage of the DNA backbone. For eukaryotic type II topoisomerases, DNA cleavage results from a transesterification reaction between phosphates in the DNA backbone and catalytic tyrosines from each of the two identical subunits of the enzyme, resulting in a protein-bridged DNA double-strand break. ATP binding and hydrolysis are required for the enzyme to carry out catalytic changes in DNA topology, although the high energy cofactor does not play a direct role in the breakage/reunion reaction of the enzyme. Current models suggest that ATP hydrolysis is required for regeneration of the enzyme to complete the catalytic cycle (3Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 4Roca J. Berger J.M. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4057-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), although it has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis may also accelerate strand transfer reactions (5Harkins T.T. Lewis T.J. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7299-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition to an absolute requirement for type II topoisomerase activity in processes such as chromosome segregation (6Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 7Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar), these enzymes are targeted by a number of antibacterial and anticancer agents in widespread clinical use. Drugs targeting DNA topoisomerases principally act by increasing the levels of the covalent complex that is an intermediate of the enzyme reaction (reviewed in Refs. 2Walker J.V. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Investig. 2002; 20: 570-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8Nitiss J.L. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 3: 1512-1516PubMed Google Scholar, and 9Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The overall domain organization of prokaryotic and eukaryotic type II topoisomerases is similar, although the eukaryotic enzyme is a homodimer, and the prokaryotic enzymes are heteromultimers. The subunits of the prokaryotic topoisomerase II are homologous to regions of the monomeric subunit of topoisomerase II. The ATPase domain of the protein occurs in the amino-terminal 400 amino acids of topoisomerase II (10Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 11Lewis R.J. Singh O.M. Smith C.V. Maxwell A. Skarzynski T. Wonacott A.J. Wigley D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas the central 700 amino acids are required for breakage/reunion reactions and include a CAP homology domain that is involved in DNA binding (12Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 13Fass D. Bogden C.E. Berger J.M. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), as well as residues involved in binding the divalent cation that is essential for the cleavage and religation reactions. High resolution electron microscopy suggests that the amino-terminal domain sits on top of the breakage reunion domain (15Kirchhausen T. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1985; 41: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Schultz P. Olland S. Oudet P. Hancock R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5936-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Benedetti P. Silvestri A. Fiorani P. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12132-12137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that conformational changes within the protein are needed for communication between different protein domains (18Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Anticancer agents such as etoposide inhibit type II topoisomerases by stabilizing the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate of the enzyme reaction (19Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 20Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32A: 958-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The initial ternary complexes formed between drugs such as etoposide and the enzyme-DNA covalent adduct are mainly reversible (21Yang L. Rowe T.C. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5872-5876PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lee M.P. Hsieh T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5027-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, cellular processing of the complexes into an irreversible covalent adduct elevates the intracellular level of DNA damage leading to cell death (8Nitiss J.L. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 3: 1512-1516PubMed Google Scholar). The result of topoisomerase II inhibition by complex-stabilizing agents is conversion of the normal catalytic activity of an essential enzyme into a cellular toxin; hence these agents are termed topoisomerase poisons. Although the breakage/reunion domain is likely to be the principal focus of action of topoisomerase II poisons, the nucleotide cofactor also influences the formation of stabilized covalent complexes. Liu and co-workers (23Wang H. Mao Y. Zhou N. Hu T. Hsieh T.S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15990-15995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Mao Y. Yu C. Hsieh T.S. Nitiss J.L. Liu A.A. Wang H. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10793-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have suggested that topoisomerase II poisons can be divided into ATP-dependent and ATP-independent classes. Etoposide, which can inhibit both the ATPase and decatenation activities of topoisomerase II, is an example of an ATP-dependent poison, because ATP stimulates the level of trapped covalent complexes in the presence of the drug. By contrast, the level of covalent complexes formed in the presence of ATP-independent poisons such as amonafide are not substantially altered by the presence of nucleotides (23Wang H. Mao Y. Zhou N. Hu T. Hsieh T.S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15990-15995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Mao Y. Yu C. Hsieh T.S. Nitiss J.L. Liu A.A. Wang H. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10793-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The influence of ATP on DNA cleavage stimulation by topoisomerase poisons is consistent with communication between the amino-terminal ATPase domain, and the domains involved in DNA binding, cleavage, and strand passage. In this work we describe a novel mutation in the amino-terminal domain of human topoisomerase II α that is toxic in repair-deficient yeast cells. The mutant enzyme has normal strand passage activity in vitro, but has enhanced DNA binding for both linear and covalently closed DNA, and forms elevated levels of drug-independent cleavage complexes. The properties of the mutant protein suggest that its alteration affects communication between the ATPase and cleavage/religation domains of the protein. This mutant protein is also a novel tool for understanding the biochemical mechanisms of drugs targeting topoisomerase II. Yeast Strains—Experiments to assess the in vivo effects of topoisomerase II alleles used yeast strains derived from JN362a (MATa, ura3-52, leu2, trp1, his7, ade1-2, ISE2, rad52::LEU2, top2-4). Isogenic derivatives of this strain with the temperature-sensitive top2-4 allele, disruptions of the RAD52 gene, and top2-4 rad52::LEU2 double mutants have been described previously (25Nitiss J.L. Liu Y.X. Harbury P. Jannatipour M. Wasserman R. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4467-4472PubMed Google Scholar). Assessment of the complementation of null alleles of TOP2 was carried out by using a strain carrying a heterozygous deletion of the yeast TOP2 gene generated from the Saccharomyces deletion project (BY4743 TOP2/top2-Δ0::KANMX4) obtained from Open Biosystems. Wild type human topoisomerase II α and the mutant enzyme were purified using the previously described strain JEL1t1 (trp1, leu2, ura3-52, pbr1-1122, pep4-3, his3:: pGAL10GAL4, top1::LEU2) (18Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Hsiung Y. Elsea S.H. Osheroff N. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20359-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Plasmids—For experiments assessing the properties of human topoisomerases in yeast, the human enzyme was expressed by using the vector pMJ1 (27Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. McMahon J. Duncan D. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 91-99PubMed Google Scholar). This vector includes the open reading frame of human topo 1The abbreviations used are: topo, topoisomerase; ADPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. II α under the control of the yeast TOP1 promoter. The plasmid pYX113hTOPII was used for initial experiments for overexpression of human topo II α in yeast for enzyme purification (24Mao Y. Yu C. Hsieh T.S. Nitiss J.L. Liu A.A. Wang H. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10793-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Nitiss J.L. Zhou J. Rose A. Hsiung Y. Gale K.C. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, this plasmid generates low yields of protein (∼1 mg/liter of culture). We therefore modified the previously described expression plasmid for human topoisomerase II α yEPwob6 (29Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). yEPwob6 expresses human topo II α from the GAL1 promoter, but the coding sequence in that plasmid lacks the first 28 amino acids of human topo II α and contains instead the first six amino acids of yeast Top2p. Given the close proximity of Asp-48 to the region deleted in yEPWOB6, we modified the plasmid to restore all of the amino acids from human topo II α. The hTOP2α coding sequence of pCM1 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. pCM1 efficiently expresses hTOP2 with yields of ∼5 mg of purified protein/liter of culture (data not shown). Purification of topoisomerase II was carried out as described previously (28Nitiss J.L. Zhou J. Rose A. Hsiung Y. Gale K.C. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Kingma P.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17999-18002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Yeast Transformation—Yeast transformation was carried out using the lithium acetate procedure (31Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The yeast plasmid YCp50 (32Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) was used as a transformation control. All transformations used 5 μg of plasmid DNA. Plasmid DNA was prepared in Escherichia coli using the strain DH5α and purified from E. coli using Qiagen kits, following manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotided-directed Mutagenesis—The Asp-48 → Asn mutation was introduced into pMJ1, pYX113hTOP2, and pCM1 using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (33Sehested M. Wessel I. Jensen L.H. Holm B. Oliveri R.S. Kenwrick S. Creighton A.M. Nitiss J.L. Jensen P.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1460-1468PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dong J. Walker J. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7980-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The two mutagenic primers used were ATTTTGCTCCGCCCAAACACCTACATTGGTTC and GAACCAATGTAGGTGTTTGGGCGGAGCAAAAT, where the underlined nucleotides indicate the changed nucleotides. Primers that change Tyr-805 to Phe were as described previously (35Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J. Zhou J. Hu T. Osheroff N. Jensen P.B. Sehested M. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2137-2146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Measurement of Topoisomerase II Enzymatic Activity—DNA topoisomerase II relaxation assays were carried out as described previously (34Dong J. Walker J. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7980-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Decatenation was carried out by using a similar procedure except kinetoplast DNA from Crithidia fasciculata was used as the substrate. The rate of enzyme-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis was measured by using a coupled enzyme assay as described previously (36Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Samples containing DNA included 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Assays for Closed Clamp Formation by Topoisomerase II—Two assays were used to assess the formation of salt-stable closed clamps by topoisomerase II α. Filter binding assays were carried out as described previously (3Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Salt-stable closed clamp formation was also determined by analytical ultracentrifugation as described previously (35Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J. Zhou J. Hu T. Osheroff N. Jensen P.B. Sehested M. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2137-2146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 37Chang S. Hu T. Hsieh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19822-19828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 μg of an 8.6-kb plasmid was incubated at 37 °C with 6 μg of human topoisomerase II α or D48N mutant protein in a 40-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Some reactions also contained a cofactor ADPPNP at a concentration of either 50 μm or 0.5 mm. After the reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min, it was terminated by adding 330 μl of saturated CsCl solution and 107 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The reaction mixture along with a balance solution containing all ingredients except for DNA and enzyme were spun at 40,000 rpm at 20 °C for 30 h in an analytical ultracentrifuge (XL-A ultracentrifuge, Beckman Instruments). The absorbance at 260 or 280 nm was scanned across the gradient to monitor the distribution of DNA in the density gradient. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to measure the binding of DNA to topoisomerase II. The assay was performed as described previously (38Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (34Dong J. Walker J. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7980-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) Briefly, a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5% glycerol, 88.5 ng of supercoiled or linearized pUC18, and the indicated concentrations of purified Top2p were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The samples were mixed with 1 μl of loading buffer containing 0.67% orange G and 60% sucrose and subjected to electrophoresis at 6 V/cm in a 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate and 10 mm EDTA). The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. DNA Cleavage by Topoisomerase II—DNA cleavage using plasmid DNA as a substrate was determined using the procedure described by Robinson and Osheroff (39Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In this assay, supercoiled plasmid DNA was incubated with purified enzyme, and the enzyme reaction was stopped with SDS to trap enzyme covalently bound to DNA. DNA cleavage was measured by determining the amount of linearized DNA formed following protease digestion to remove the protein covalently bound to the DNA ends. Cleavage assays were incubated in a total volume of 100 μl for 15 min at 37 °C and terminated with 25 μl of 10% SDS. Samples were digested with 400 μg of proteinase K at 50 °C overnight, except where indicated, phenolextracted, precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in TE buffer, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA cleavage sites were examined using 32P-end-labeled pUC18 DNA. Briefly, 5 μg of EcoRI-digested pUC18 was labeled by a fill-in reaction with [32P]dATP, non-radioactive nucleotides, and Klenow for 15 min at room temperature. After ethanol precipitation, the 32P-pUC18 was digested with BamHI for 3 h at 37 °C in order to create a uniquely end-labeled molecule. After digestion with BamHI, the DNA was purified over a chroma spin STE-30 column (Clontech). Topoisomerase II cleavage reactions containing 150 ng of 32P-pUC18, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2,2mm ATP, 6.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin were incubated with various concentrations of protein in a final volume of 100 μl for 10 min at 37 °C. Some reactions also contained 10 μg/ml etoposide. Reactions were terminated with 12.5 μl of 20% SDS and then treated with 400 μg of proteinase K at 50 °C overnight. The sample volume was increased by adding 200 μl of water followed by ethanol precipitation. Samples were resuspended in 10 μl of loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis at 2.5 V/cm in a 1.5% agarose gel for 15 h in 1× TAE buffer. The gel was dried, and labeled fragments were visualized either by exposure to film or with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn) Is Lethal in Yeast Strains Lacking RAD52—We reported previously (33Sehested M. Wessel I. Jensen L.H. Holm B. Oliveri R.S. Kenwrick S. Creighton A.M. Nitiss J.L. Jensen P.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1460-1468PubMed Google Scholar) that mutations of human topo II α changing amino acid Tyr-50 to Phe result in an enzyme that is insensitive to bisdioxopiperazines. Because this region is conserved in all eukaryotic type II topoisomerases, we explored the effects of mutating other amino acids in the vicinity of Tyr-50. We introduced mutations in the vector pMJ1, which expresses human topoisomerase II α from the yeast TOP1 promoter, and transfected the mutated plasmids into yeast cells carrying a temperature-sensitive top2-4 allele and a deletion of the RAD52 gene. One mutation in this region, changing Asp-48 to Asn could not be transformed into rad52– cells. We carried out quantitative transformation of plasmids containing either wild type hTop2α or hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn) using the isogenic strains JN362a (RAD52+) and JN394 (rad52–). A typical result is shown in Fig. 1. The RAD52+ and rad52– strains could be readily transformed with a yeast vector (yCP50) or with a plasmid expressing wild type hTop2α. However, no transformants were obtained when rad52– cells were transformed with pMJ1(D48N). In our previously published experiments, we could introduce pMJ1-carrying Y50F into rad52– cells (33Sehested M. Wessel I. Jensen L.H. Holm B. Oliveri R.S. Kenwrick S. Creighton A.M. Nitiss J.L. Jensen P.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1460-1468PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together these results indicated that expression of hTOP2α(Asp-48 → Asn) was deleterious in recombination-deficient yeast cells. We also transformed pMJ1(D48N) into JN362at2-4 cells. This strain is isogenic to JN362a but carries a temperature-sensitive topoisomerase II allele (top2-4). Transformation of either pMJ1 or pMJ1(D48N) supported growth of JN362t2-4 at 34 °C, a non-permissive temperature for the top2-4 allele (data not shown). To further assess whether pMJ1(D48N) could complement the in vivo function of yeast topoisomerase II, we examined whether pMJ1(D48N) could complement a null allele of yeast topoisomerase II. We introduced pMJ1, pMJ1(D48N), or an empty vector into strain BY4743 (TOP2/top2-Δ0::KANMX4), a diploid strain carrying a heterozygous deletion of the entire open reading frame of TOP2 (40Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S. Dow S. Lucau-Danila A. Anderson K. Andre B. Arkin A.P. Astromoff A. El Bakkoury M. Bangham R. Benito R. Brachat S. Campanaro S. Curtiss M. Davis K.

Johnston M. Nature. 2002; 418: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar). The strains bearing each of these plasmids was sporulated, and the resulting asci were micro-dissected to recover individual haploid spores. Viable spores carrying the top2-Δ0::KANMX4 allele were obtained with both pMJ1 and pMJ1(D48N) but not with the empty vector (data not shown). There was no obvious difference in the growth rate of cells carrying either the wild type or Asp-48 → Asn allele of hTop2α. These results indicate that hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn) can support all of the essential functions of yeast topoisomerase II and strongly suggested that the Asp-48 → Asn allele encodes an active protein, a result confirmed below. We also examined other amino acid changes of Asp-48 for the ability to confer rad52-dependent lethality or the inability to complement a top2-4 allele of yeast Top2. We introduced Asp-48 → Glu and Asp-48 → Ala mutations into pMJ1, and we examined transformation into JN362t2-4 (RAD52+) and JN394 (rad52–) cells. Both of these mutations could be introduced into JN394 (rad52–) cells, indicating that these alleles did not have the same property as the Asp-48 → Asn allele. Furthermore, both alleles could complement the top2-4 allele, suggesting that they did not compromise Top2 activity in vivo (data not shown). We next determined whether the rad52-dependent lethality of the Asp-48 → Asn allele required the ability of the enzyme to cleave DNA. We constructed a double mutant of human topoisomerase II having both Asn substituted for Asp at residue 48 and Phe substituted for the catalytic Tyr-805. Expression of the hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn/Tyr-805 → Phe) double mutant in a rad52-deleted yeast strain did not substantially reduce the transformation efficiency (Fig. 1B), indicating that enzyme activity was required for the lethality. We also examined several other DNA repair-deficient strains to determine what other repair functions were required for cell survival when the Asp-48 → Asn allele was expressed. Lethality was observed in mutants deficient in either rad50 or rad54, indicating that other defects in recombination repair beside rad52 resulted in an inability to viably express hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn). By contrast, cells lacking rad2 (defective in excision repair), rad6 (defective in post-replication repair), or rad9 (defective in a DNA damage checkpoint) all could be transformed with pMJ1D48N at efficiencies comparable with wild type cells (data not shown). These data indicate that the major DNA repair pathway required for expression of D48N is recombination repair. Enzymatic Activity of hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn)—We next introduced the Asp-48 → Asn mutation into a vector appropriate for overexpression, and we purified the mutant protein. Fig. 2A shows an SDS gel of the purified hTop2α wild type and hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn)-purified proteins. As shown in Fig. 2B, hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn) has essentially the same activity for relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA as the wild type enzyme. Similar results were obtained assessing decatenation of kinetoplast DNA (data not shown). Because the mutation occurs in a region of the protein known to be involved in ATP binding, we also characterized the ATPase activity of the mutant protein. In the absence of DNA, hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn) has the same ATPase activity as the wild type enzyme. Most interesting, the mutant protein was defective in DNA-stimulated ATPase activity, compared with the wild type protein (Fig. 3). However, in results to be reported elsewhere, we observed a similar deficiency in DNA-stimulated ATPase in other mutants such as hTop2α(Tyr-50 → Phe) that can be functionally expressed in rad52– cells. Therefore, we do not think that the inability to transform repair-deficient strains relates to the altered ATPase activity of hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn). We also assessed the ability of the enzyme to form a salt-stable complex with circular DNA in the absence of cofactors, in the presence of ATP, or in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog. Closed clamp formation was assessed by analytical ultracentrifugation in CsCl. Fig. 4 displays the results obtained without cofactor or in the presence of ADPPNP. Both the wild type and Asp-48 → Asn mutant proteins incubated with DNA but without any cofactor result in a single DNA peak, consistent with a lack of enzyme binding to DNA in CsCl. A series of bands of lower buoyant density is seen when either enzyme is incubated with ADPPNP; however, there is a greater reduction in the free DNA and a greater shift toward lighter densities for samples that included hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn). Similar results were obtained using a filter binding assay (data not shown). Although greater levels of complexes were seen with ADPPNP and hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn), there were no detectable complexes in the presence of ATP. Furthermore, there was no difference in the levels of salt-stable complexes detected by ultracentrifugation in the presence of the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-187 (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Closed clamp formation is not altered for hTop2α(Asp-48 → Asn) protein in the presence of a bisdioxopiperazine.

https://openalex.org/W2012816069,"Bacterial glutamine synthetases (GSs) are complex dodecameric oligomers that play a critical role in nitrogen metabolism, converting ammonia and glutamate to glutamine. Recently published reports suggest that GS from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) may be a therapeutic target (Harth, G., and Horwitz, M. A. (2003) Infect. Immun. 71, 456–464). In some bacteria, GS is regulated via adenylylation of some or all of the subunits within the aggregate; catalytic activity is inversely proportional to the extent of adenylylation. The adenylylation and deadenylylation of GS are catalyzed by adenylyl transferase (ATase). Here, we demonstrate via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry that GS from pathogenic M. tuberculosis is adenylylated by the Escherichia coli ATase. The adenylyl group can be hydrolyzed by snake venom phosphodiesterase to afford the unmodified enzyme. The site of adenylylation of MTb GS by the E. coli ATase is Tyr-406, as indicated by the lack of adenylylation of the Y406F mutant, and, as expected, is based on amino acid sequence alignments. Using electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy methodology, we found that GS is not adenylylated when obtained directly from MTb cultures that are not supplemented with glutamine. Under these conditions, the highly related but non-pathogenic Mycobacterium bovis BCG yields partially (∼25%) adenylylated enzyme. Upon the addition of glutamine to the cultures, the MTb GS becomes significantly adenylylated (∼30%), whereas the adenylylation of M. bovis BCG GS does not change. Collectively, the results demonstrate that MTb GS is a substrate for E. coli ATase, but only low adenylylation states are accessible. This parallels the low adenylylation states observed for GS from mycobacteria and suggests the intriguing possibility that adenylylation in the pathogenic versus non-pathogenic mycobacteria is differentially regulated.

Worldwide there are ∼16 million cases of active Tb each year, with about 2 million deaths (1Corbett E.L. Watt C.J. Walker N. Maher D. Williams B.G. Ravliglione M.C. Dye C. Arch. Intern. Med. 2003; 163: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). Deaths resulting directly from primary Tb occur mainly in third world populations. However, opportunistic Tb infections are a serious pathophysiological manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus disease globally, including in the United States The treatment of Tb requires multi-drug therapy delivered for 6–12 months. In light of the world-wide emergence of multi-drug resistant Tb, new and simpler strategies are urgently required (2Flynn J.L. Chan J. Ann. Rev.

Shinnick T.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 387-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 7Harth G.

GS plays a critical role in nitrogen metabolism in prokaryotes, catalyzing the ATP-dependent conversion of glutamate and NH3 to glutamine. X-ray crystal structures and electron micrographs of GSs from several bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb), demonstrate that each is a dodecameric aggregate of identical subunits (Refs. 9Eisenberg D.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17681-17690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Interestingly, the level of extracellular GS in cultures of different strains of mycobacteria correlates with virulence (12Raynaud C. Etienne G. Peyron P. Laneelle M.A. Daffe M. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Tullius M.V. Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6348-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, methionine sulfoximine (MSOX), a “classic” GS inhibitor, or antisense oligonucleotides against GS mRNA inhibit MTb cell growth in culture (5Miller B.H. Shinnick T.M. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 387-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Also, methionine sulfoximine augments the therapeutic efficacy of isoniazid in a guinea pig tuberculosis model and inhibits the growth of MTb in human macrophages (6Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Tullius M.V. Harth G. Horwitz M.A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3927-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the glnA1 gene encoding MTb GS appears to be essential for bacterial survival (14Collins D.M. Wilson T. Campbell S. Buddle B.M. Wards B.J. Hotter G. De Lisle G.W. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and Mycobacterium bovis mutants with GS inactivated by illegitimate recombination were avirulent (15Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations indicate that GS activity is required for MTb pathogenicity, but the precise role of this enzyme is unknown. Inhibition of GS could alter the pools of glutamine required for synthesis of the MTb cell wall, which contains high concentrations of glutamine. In fact, the MTb cell wall contains unusual peptidoglycans with isoglutamine constituents, and unique poly(Glu/Gln) proteins (16Hirschfield G.R. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Crick D.C. Mahapatra S. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 107R-118RCrossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GS could play a role in controlling NH3 levels, which may help thwart phagosome-lysosome fusion in the infected macrophages (2Flynn J.L. Chan J. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 93-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 18Gordon A.H. Hart P.D. Young M.R. Nature. 1980; 286: 79-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Currently, both mechanisms are speculative.The importance of GS in MTb biology has been suggested further by genetic disruption of the glnE gene, which encodes the enzyme adenylyl transferase (ATase; Refs. 19Atkins W.M.

In many bacteria, ATase catalyzes the adenylylation of a Tyr side chain on each GS subunit, and this, in turn, decreases the catalytic activity of GS as described initially by Stadtman and co-workers (Refs 20Shapiro B.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 26327-26332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The ATase reaction is highly specific for GS; no other substrates for ATase have been identified or suggested. In many bacteria, the adenylylation process involves a highly regulated enzymatic cascade that responds to environmental nitrogen levels (20Shapiro B.M. Kingdon H.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Shapiro B.M. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

For Escherichia coli GS, the biochemical effects of adenylylation on GS catalytic activity are well characterized (20Shapiro B.M. Kingdon H.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Reynaldo L.P. Villafranca J.J. Horrocks Jr., W.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2532-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Disruption of the glnE gene in MTb yields a lethal phenotype (26Parish T. Lewis J. Stoker N.G. Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2001; 81: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Parish T. Stoker N.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5715-5720Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that GS adenylylation is a critical process in Mycobacteria also. Thus, we hypothesized that the adenylylation cascade may provide additional pharmacological targets for tuberculosis therapy. However, the adenylylation process in MTb has not been characterized.Here we demonstrate the utility of mass spectrometric methods to monitor the adenylylation of MTb GS expressed in mycobacteria or E. coli. Interestingly, although the E. coli adenylylation system faithfully modifies in vivo the “correct” tyrosine on MTb GS with the expected functional effects, we observed incomplete adenylylation under conditions that yield complete adenylylation of the cognate E. coli GS. Moreover, we report differences in the extent of adenylylation of GS obtained directly from cultures of MTb versus M. bovis BCG.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Growth—The E. coli strains YMC21E and YMC21D are genetically engineered strains that yield fully adenylylated and completely unadenylylated GS, respectively, when E. coli GS is expressed in them. These strains were developed by Dr. J. Bowie of UCLA but are not extensively characterized in the literature, although they have been used extensively. Both strains lack a chromosomally encoded GS and require plasmid-encoded GS. The YMC21E also lacks ATase, whereas YMC21D lacks the uridyl transferase that modulates the adenylylation/deadenylylation rates of ATase. Culture conditions for the expression of E. coli GS or MTb GS in these strains has been described previously (10Gill H.S. Pfluegl G.M. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9863-9872Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Reynaldo L.P. Villafranca J.J. Horrocks Jr., W.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2532-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv (ATCC 27294) and M. bovis BCG-Russia (American Type Culture Collection number 35740) were grown to mid-log phase in 7H9 media with 0.05% Tween 80 and an ADC (5 g of albumin,2gof dextrose, and 3 mg of catalase per 100 ml) supplement and stored as 1-ml aliquots in 15% glycerol (final concentration) at -80 °C. For each experiment, thawed bacilli were inoculated into 30 ml of modified Sauton's medium (28Andersen P. Askgaard D. Ljungqvist L. Bennedsen J. Heron I. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1905-1910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with or without 20 mm glutamine at a starting A600 of 0.05 and harvested after twelve days of growth (29Sorensen A.L. Nagai S. Houen G. Andersen P. Andersen A.B. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1710-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell pellets were lysed as described previously (30Sherman D.R. Voskuil M. Schnappinger D. Liao R. Harrell M.I. Schoolnik G.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7534-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Filtrates were concentrated 100× through a Centricon Plus-20 filter device (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA).Protein Purification—E. coli GS was purified as described previously (24Abell L.M. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Specifically, the ZnSO4 precipitation, acetone precipitation, and NH4SO4 precipitation steps were omitted. After treatment with streptomycin sulfate, the supernatant was chromatographed over blue Sepharose CL-6B (Sigma) and eluted with 20 mm ADP. Pooled fractions containing GS activity, as determined by the γ-glutamyl transferase assay, were concentrated and chromatographed over G-25 (Sigma). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and was >95%. For MTb GS, the cell lysate obtained from sonication in Buffer 1 (10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 50 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2) was treated with streptomycin sulfate, and the supernatant was loaded on a DEAE Fast Flow anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer 2 (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm KCl, and 1 mm MnCl2). After washing with Buffer 2 for 10 column volumes, the GS was eluted with Buffer 2 containing 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions containing activity based on the γ-glutamyl transferase assay were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer 2. Purified protein was stored in 1-ml aliquots at -20 °C and found to be stable for nearly a year.Snake Venom Phosphodiesterase Treatment—Samples containing 0.1 mg/ml GS, 1 mg/ml snake venom phosphodiesterase (Type IV, Crotalus atrox; Sigma) in Tris buffer, pH 9, and 5 mm MgCl2 were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Samples were assayed directly by the γ-glutamyl transferase assay or ESI-MS as described below.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The plasmid containing the MTb GS cDNA, pTrcHisB-TBGS, was denatured by 0.2 m NaOH. The presence of the cDNA was verified by double digestion with NcoI and HindIII (10 units each). The denatured plasmid was then mutagenized with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the forward primer 5′-CGACAAGGATCTCTTCGAGCTGCCGCC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGCGGCAGCTCGAAGAGATCCTTGTCG-3′ (Invitrogen), with 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo polymerase per reaction. Template amounts were varied from 500 to 15.6 ng per reaction. PCR was performed using the following program on an Eppendorf temperature cycler: (i) an initial denaturation for 60 s at 95 °C; (ii) 17 cycles of denaturation for 30 s per cycle at 95 °C; (iii) 60 s of elongation at 55 °C; (iv) 12 min of annealing at 68 °C; and (v) a final 10 min of annealing at 72 °C. Agarose gel electrophoresis (1% w/v) verified the presence of a 6 kb of PCR product, which is indicative of successful amplification of pTrcHisB-TBGS. The amount of template had no apparent effect on the amount of product obtained. The PCR-mutagenized plasmid was digested with DpnI (20 units) to degrade any template plasmids present in the PCR product mix. E. coli XL-1 Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the mutagenized plasmids and grown overnight on Luria-Bertani agar plates infused with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. Mutagenized plasmid was purified from picked colonies using the QIAprep Spin Mini-prep protocol (Qiagen).Forward and reverse strands of the cDNA in the mutagenized plasmids were sequenced using the BigDye 3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI 3730XL high-throughout capillary DNA analyzer to screen for successful mutagenesis and any spurious mutations that were introduced. The following thermal cycling program was used: (i) 60 s at 96 °C; (ii) 25 cycles of 10 s per cycle at 96 °C; (iii) 5 s at 50 °C; and (iv) 240 s at 60 °C. The DNA used for sequencing was purified by ethanol precipitation.Catalytic Activity Assays—Enzyme activity was monitored by the “γ-glutamyl transferase assay,” which is based on the formation of the colored product monitored at 430 nm (31Stadtman E.R. Smyrniotis P.Z. Davis J.N. Wittenberer M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), or by the “Mg2+ biosynthetic assay,” which is a coupled enzyme assay that reports on the conversion of glutamate to glutamine and monitors NADPH production at 340 nm (24Abell L.M. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the biosynthetic assay, solutions contained 100 mm HEPES (Sigma), 100 mm PIPES (USB), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm P-enolpyruvate, 190 mg of NADH, 150 μg/ml pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 150 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), 50 mm MgCl2, and 1 μg of GS. Reaction was initiated with ATP, which was varied between 0 and 500 mm. For determination of the adenylylation state via the transferase assay, we used two solutions that included either Mn2+ (Solution A) or Mg2+ (Solution B). The Mg2+ form of GS is inactivated specifically by the adenylyl group so that the adenylylation state, n, is calculated as n = 12 - 12[b/a], where b and a are the absorbances at 540 nm in the assay solutions B and A respectively. This assay is described in detail elsewhere (31Stadtman E.R. Smyrniotis P.Z. Davis J.N. Wittenberer M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry—Samples were chromatographed through a Poros R2 column with a linear gradient from 94.95% H2O, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v/v) to 39.95% H2O, 60% acetonitrile, and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v/v) over 7 min and interfaced with a Fisons VG quatro II mass spectrometer fitted with a Z-spray ESI source. Mass spectra were deconvoluted using the maximum entropy method provided in the MassLynx™ software. Calculation of the adenylylation state, n, was by n = I(MW +330)/[I(MW) + I(MW + 330)] × 12, where I(MW + 330) is the intensity of the molecular ion at the molecular weight of the adenylylated species, I(MW) is the intensity of the molecular ion at the molecular weight of the unadenylylated species, and 12 is the maximum adenylylation state. For some experiments with E. coli GS, a site-directed mutant, E165C, was used as a model. E165C is fully adenylylated when expressed in YMC21D and fully unadenylylated in YMC21E. The adenylylation state was calculated as with wild type, using the appropriate masses.Molecular Modeling—Molecular models were constructed using Chimera™, and the available x-ray structure was reported in Ref. 9Eisenberg D.

The Protein Data Bank file used was 1HTQ.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMass Spectral Characterization of Adenylylation—As noted, for many enteric bacteria there is a well characterized inverse correlation between the average number of adenylyl groups/GS dodecamer and the enzymatic activity of the Mg2+ form of the enzyme. However, a detailed characterization of the functional effects of adenylylation on GS from any strain of Mycobacteria has not been performed. Moreover, the adenylylation process in Mycobacteria is not characterized. To initiate a systematic characterization of the adenylylated MTb GS in the absence of a source of MTb ATase, we recognized the potential utility of the E. coli adenylylation system for providing adenylylated MTb GS. In addition, we were interested in developing a convenient method for monitoring the adenylylation process directly in Mycobacteria. Therefore, we utilized ESI-MS to monitor the GS preparations for covalent modification. We also exploited a well established method (32Fink D. Falke D. Wohlleben W. Engels A. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2313-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Munoz-Centeno M.C. Cejudo F.J. Paneque A. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) for the removal of adenylyl groups via snake venom phosphodiesterase (SVPDE) to seek a change in mass corresponding to the adenylyl moiety (Δ mass = 330 atomic mass units; Fig. 1). The validity of this strategy was established first with E. coli GS, wherein the previously described strains YMC21E and YMC21D produce fully unadenylylated and fully adenylylated GS, respectively (25Reynaldo L.P. Villafranca J.J. Horrocks Jr., W.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2532-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Yanchunas Jr., J. Dabrowski M.J. Schurke P. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14949-14956Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mass spectra for E. coli GS in the fully adenylylated, fully unadenylylated, and SVPDE-treated states are shown in Fig. 2. For the GS from YMC21E, the recovered mass of 51,761 Da is within the S.E. for a theoretical mass of 51, 772 Da. The post-translational modification corresponding to the adenylyl group is easily observed by the mass shift of 331 atomic mass units for GS isolated from E. coli strain YMC21D, and this mass increment is lost upon treatment with SVPDE. The SVPDE treatment had no effect on the unadenylylated GS (not shown), thus confirming the loss of the adenylyl group as the source of the mass shift in the adenylylated preparations. These results are summarized in Table I, along with data describing functional characteristics as described below.Fig. 2Deconvoluted electrospray ionization mass spectra ofE. coliGS. The enzyme expressed in strain YMC21E is completely unadenylylated (top), whereas the GS from YMC21D is completely adenylylated (center). Upon treatment of the adenylylated enzyme with snake venom phosphodiesterase, the mass shifts to the unadenylylated form (bottom). The mass difference corresponds to the adenylyl group, ∼330 atomic mass units, within S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table ICatalytic Effects of Adenylylation in the Biosynthetic AssayGS isoform/sourceAdenylylation state via mass spectrometryaCalculated as described under “Material and Methods.” Values of “0” were reported when no peak was observed at the appropriate mass of the adenylylated form.

We reasoned that if the E. coli adenylylation system recognized the MTb GS, then expression in both YMC21E and YMC21D strains would provide “standards” for mass spectral characterization of adenylylated and unadenylylated M. tuberculosis GS and for functional characterization.Indeed, the M. tuberculosis GS purified from E. coli strain YMC21D was 25–30% adenylylated, based on the presence of two major species with appropriate masses that differed by 330 atomic mass units and their collapse to a single species with the lower mass upon treatment with SVPDE (Fig. 3). The theoretical mass of the MTb GS (53,570 Da) is slightly greater than that of the E. coli isoform because of 10 additional amino acids, including the N-terminal methionine, and the experimentally recovered mass is within the S.E. Notably, the adenylylated form of MTb GS was always 25–35% of the total protein present, in contrast to the E. coli isoform obtained from YMC21D, which was completely adenylylated.Fig. 3Deconvoluted electrospray ionization mass spectra ofM. tuberculosisGS expressed inE. coli. The M. tuberculosis GS expressed in YMC21E (top) is completely unadenylylated, but ∼ 25% adenylylated when expressed in YMC21D (53,876 Da; center). Treatment with SVPDE generates the unadenylylated enzyme (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These results were important for two reasons. First, they demonstrated that the adenylylated and unadenylylated forms of M. tuberculosis GS can be identified by this approach. Second, this is the first evidence for adenylylation of mycobacterial GS by E. coli ATase, and there is clearly some difference in the processing of MTb GS versus E. coli GS by E. coli ATase. These results are also summarized in Table I.Functional Effects of Adenylylation on M. tuberculosis GS—As further validation for the mass spectrometric method, we initiated a functional characterization of the MTb GS preparation from different sources. Adenylylation of GSs that are regulated by this mechanism leads to a decrease in the activity of the Mg2+-bound form of GS, but not the Mn2+-bound form. Therefore, we also performed the Mg2+ biosynthetic assay. The expected decrease in activity was observed for adenylylated MTb GS obtained from YMC21D (Table I). In fact, in light of the 20–25-fold decrease in Vmax for E. coli GS upon complete adenylylation, as observed here and by others (9Eisenberg D. Gill H.S. Pfluegl G.M.U. Rotstein S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 122-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 24Abell L.M. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it might be expected that the partially (30%) adenylylated MTb GS would have a Vmax decreased by 7–8-fold as compared with the unadenylylated MTb GS. In fact, we observe a larger decrease in activity of 15-fold. Furthermore, the Km for ATP increased 1.4-fold upon partial adenylylation of the MTb GS, a result that is consistent with what has been established for partially adenylylated GS from E. coli (9Eisenberg D. Gill H.S. Pfluegl G.M.U. Rotstein S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 122-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 24Abell L.M. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Identification of the Adenylylation Site on MTb GS—An issue not directly addressed by the mass spectrometry approach or catalytic studies is the location of the adenylyl group on MTb GS when the E. coli ATase attaches it. It is formally possible that the E. coli ATase could misadenylylate the MTb GS at the “incorrect” residue and still regulate the catalytic function. To address this issue, the fidelity of the reaction was validated by construction of the site-directed mutant Y406F, which eliminates the tyrosine that is homologous to the E. coli site of adenylylation (9Eisenberg D. Gill H.S. Pfluegl G.M.U. Rotstein S.H. Biochim."
https://openalex.org/W2085125612,"Syntaxin 1C is an alternative splice variant lacking the transmembrane domain of HPC-1/syntaxin 1A. We found previously that syntaxin 1C is expressed as a soluble protein in human astroglioma (T98G) cells, and syntaxin 1C expression is enhanced by stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). However, the physiological function of syntaxin 1C is not known. In this study, we examined the relationship between syntaxin 1C and glucose transport. First, we discovered that glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) was the primary isoform in T98G cells. Second, we demonstrated that glucose uptake in T98G cells was suppressed following an increase in endogenous syntaxin 1C after stimulation with PMA, which did not alter the expression levels of other plasma membrane syntaxins. We further examined glucose uptake and intracellular localization of GLUT-1 in cells that overexpressed exogenous syntaxin 1C; glucose uptake via GLUT-1 was inhibited without affecting sodium-dependent glucose transport. The value of Vmax for the dose-dependent uptake of glucose was reduced in syntaxin 1C-expressing cells, whereas there was no change in Km. Immunofluorescence studies revealed a reduction in the amount of GLUT-1 in the plasma membrane in cells that expressed syntaxin 1C. Based on these results, we postulate that syntaxin 1C regulates glucose transport in astroglioma cells by changing the intracellular trafficking of GLUT-1. This is the first report to indicate that a syntaxin isoform that lacks a transmembrane domain can regulate the intracellular transport of a plasma membrane protein.

This is the first report to indicate that a syntaxin isoform that lacks a transmembrane domain can regulate the intracellular transport of a plasma membrane protein. The protein machinery that regulates intracellular transport and vesicle formation, docking, and fusion has been the focus of intense research over the last few years. The SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor; 2-DG, 2-deoxyglucose; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; GLUT, glucose transporter; HA, hemagglutinin; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; SGLT, sodium-dependent glucose transporter; Syn, syntaxin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; nt, nucleotide; CNS, central nervous system; SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein. hypothesis (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) attachment protein receptor) constitutes a widely accepted model in which dynamic interactions among proteins within the acceptor (t-SNARE: syntaxin and SNAP-25) and donor (v-SNARE: VAMP) compartments control exocytosis (1Sollner T.

Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that syntaxins function in a wide variety of cells and tissues, including neurons, endocrine glands, amphibian ectodermal cells, epithelial cells, cells of the immune system, platelets, and yeast (3Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Consequently, a unified role for the SNARE complex in the docking and fusion of vesicles during intracellular trafficking, as well as in nerve terminals, has been proposed. To date, 18 members of the mammalian syntaxin family have been identified, all of which localize to specific membrane compartments via a transmembrane domain at the C terminus. In contrast to the localization of syntaxins 5-18 to different intracellular compartments, such as the Golgi and post-Golgi apparatus (4Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar), syntaxins 1-4 are restricted predominantly to the plasma membrane, where they mediate constitutive and regulated vesicle trafficking to the cell surface (4Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). All syntaxins have a coiled-coil helix domain (called H3 in syntaxin 1A) next to the transmembrane domain at the C terminus. The H3 domain is a highly conserved region that interacts with several different SNARE proteins, including SNAP-25, VAMP, and α-SNAP, and to some extent, nSec-1/Munc-18 (4Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 1C is an alternative splice variant of HPC-1/syntaxin 1A. Syntaxin 1A is involved in the docking of synaptic vesicles at active zones in neurons (5Inoue A. Obata K. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10613-10619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), and is deleted hemizygously in patients with the neurodevelopmental disorder, Williams syndrome (7Jagadish M.N. Tellam J.T.

Akagawa K. Cytogenet Cell Genet. 1998; 82: 49-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we demonstrated that syntaxin 1C is expressed as a soluble protein in astroglioma cells (9Nakayama T. Mikoshiba K. Yamamori T. Akagawa K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 536: 209-214Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). While the N-terminal domain of syntaxin 1C is the same as that of syntaxin 1A, the functionality of the H3 and transmembrane domain has been lost, caused by the generation of a novel 34-residue C-terminal domain by the insertion of a 91-bp splicing region. Several other isoforms of syntaxin that lack a transmembrane domain by alternative splicing have been identified, namely syntaxin 2D, syntaxin 3D, and syntaxin 16C (10Quinones B. Riento K. Olkkonen V.M. Hardy S. Bennett M.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4291-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ibaraki K. Horikawa H.P. Morita T. Mori H. Sakimura K. Mishina M. Saisu H. Abe T. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but the function of syntaxin isoforms that lack a transmembrane domain is unknown. Facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs) are proteins that regulate the entry of glucose into cells and maintain cell metabolism and homeostasis throughout the periphery and brain (13Vannucci S.J. Maher F. Simpson I.A. Glia. 1997; 21: 2-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). There are at least six different GLUT genes with differential tissue distributions, subcellular localizations, and kinetics for glucose uptake (14Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). In the brain, there are two GLUT isoforms, namely GLUT-1 and GLUT-3. GLUT-1 appears during early embryogenesis and is required for cell metabolism and homeostasis in glial cells (13Vannucci S.J. Maher F. Simpson I.A. Glia. 1997; 21: 2-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 15Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). GLUT-3 is found primarily in neurons (15Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). GLUT-4 is expressed only in muscle and fat cells, where it resides in an intracellular compartment under basal conditions and is translocated to the cell surface after stimulation with insulin (15Olson A.L. Pessin J.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Recently, it became clear that syntaxin 4 and several SNARE-related molecules participate in the translocation of GLUT-4 to the plasma membrane (16Thurmond D.C. Kanzaki M. Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Foster L.J. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C877-C890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have revealed that glucose transport is regulated though several signal transduction pathways, including those that involve mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and protein kinase C (PKC) (18Fujishiro M. Gotoh Y. Katagiri H. Sakoda H. Ogihara T. Anai M. Onishi Y. Ono H. Funaki M. Inukai K. Fukushima Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol.

Metab. 2002; 283: E338-E345Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We showed previously that astroglioma cells express syntaxin 1C but not syntaxin 1A, and that the expression of syntaxin 1C protein is up-regulated via a PKC signaling pathway by stimulating cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (9Nakayama T. Mikoshiba K. Yamamori T. Akagawa K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 536: 209-214Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used a human astroglioma cell line that expresses syntaxin 1C to determine whether syntaxin 1C is involved in glucose transport. We found that the induction of endogenous syntaxin 1C expression by PMA caused a reduction in GLUT-1 in the plasma membrane and suppressed glucose uptake. Expression of exogenous syntaxin 1C in T98G cells had the same effects. These results suggest that the physiological function of syntaxin 1C in astroglioma cells is the regulation of intracellular trafficking of GLUT-1. Reagents—All tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA) with the exception of fetal calf serum (FCS), which was purchased from Sigma. Human insulin was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Basel, Switzerland). Acrylamide/bis-acrylamide was obtained from WAKO Chemical (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), unless otherwise noted. DNA Cloning—Total cellular RNA was extracted using the QIA-Amp RNA extraction kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was carried out using an RNA PCR kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan), according to the manufacturer's protocol. To clone the coding region of human syntaxins, we designed oligonucleotide primers based on the sequence of human (h) syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 1C (DDBJ accession nos. D37932 and AB086954M, respectively), and syntaxin 4 (GenBank™ accession no. NM004604). The primers were used in RT-PCR cloning, using mRNA that was isolated from the human brain library (BIO101) and T98G human astroglioma cells, as described below. RT was performed using the oligo(dT) primer and AMV reverse transcriptase (Takara), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length human syntaxin cDNAs were inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI site of a pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), or cloned into the BamHI site of a pcDNA3 expression vector as an N-terminal 5× HA-tagged version. The subcloned syntaxins were confirmed by using an ABI 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Semiquantitative PCR—GLUT gene expression was quantified according to the method of Schreiber et al. (21Schreiber J. Enderich J. Sock E. Schmidt C. Richter-Landsberg C. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32286-32293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cDNA template (5 ng) that was synthesized from total RNA in cells was used for semiquantitative PCR, with primer pairs that were specific for hGLUT-1, hGLUT-2, hGLUT-3, and hGLUT-4 (GenBank™ accession nos. K03195, J03810, M20681, and M20747, respectively). Human small intestine cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Yoshikatsu Kanai (Kyorin University, Japan). The primer pairs were as follows: hGLUT-1 sense, 906-932 nt; hGLUT-1 antisense, 1519-1491 nt; hGLUT-2 sense, 2223-2243 nt; hGLUT-2 antisense, 2626-2607 nt; hGLUT-3 sense, 884-912 nt; hGLUT-3 antisense, 1375-1349 nt; hGLUT-4 sense, 1485-1513 nt; and hGLUT-4 antisense, 2076-2048 nt. As a control, we used a pair of primers for β-actin (Maxim Biotech, South San Francisco, CA) that amplifies a 540-bp DNA segment. The primers for β-actin span at least one intron, and contamination of RNA samples by genomic DNA can be detected according to the size of the amplified product (1116 bp for genomic DNA). PCR was linear up to 30 cycles for each pair of primers (data not shown). The intensity of the SYBR-green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) signals from scanned images of the gels was measured using NIH Image (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was carried out, according to the method of Nagamatsu et al. (22Nagamatsu S. Nakamichi Y. Inoue N. Inoue M. Nishino H. Sawa H. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg) isolated from native and transfected (see below) T98G cells was separated by electrophoresis in 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose denaturing gels. The EcoRI-digested 600-bp fragments of the GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 cDNA were labeled with 32P by random priming. The GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 cDNAs were a kind gift from Dr. Shinya Nagamatsu (Kyorin University, Japan). The intensity of the autoradiographic signals was measured directly from digital images (Bas 2000, Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Cell Culture and Transfection—Two human astroglioma cell lines, T98G and U87MG, were provided by Dr. Hiroki Sawa (Kyorin University, Japan). Cells were grown on 90-mm in diameter plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, penicillin (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For drug stimulation, cells were treated for 3-48 h with 1-10 μm PMA (Sigma), 10 μm 4α-PMA (Sigma), or 10 μm forskolin (RBI). T98G and U87MG cells were trypsinized, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 0.3 ml of serum-free DMEM on ice. Approximately 1 × 106 T98G cells were transfected with 150 μg/ml recombinant syntaxins by electroporation (Bio-Rad gene pulsar, 0.75 kV/cm field strength, 960 microfarad capacitance). The cells were then cultured in DMEM (that included 800 μg/ml neomycin) for 2 weeks, and the transfected cells were cloned as a single colony. Immunoblot Analysis—Equal amounts of protein from each sample were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (9Nakayama T. Mikoshiba K. Yamamori T. Akagawa K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 536: 209-214Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Following antibodies were used as a primary antibody: a monoclonal antibody (14D8) that had been raised against the N-terminal of syntaxin 1A (9Nakayama T. Mikoshiba K. Yamamori T. Akagawa K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 536: 209-214Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), a polyclonal anti-syntaxin 1C antibody (9Nakayama T. Mikoshiba K. Yamamori T. Akagawa K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 536: 209-214Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), a polyclonal anti-syntaxin 2 antibody (Stressgen Biotech, Victoria, BC, Canada), a polyclonal anti-syntaxin 3 antibody (Sigma), a monoclonal anti-syntaxin 4 antibody (BD-Transduction Laboratory, San Jose, CA), anti-GLUT-1 antiserum, anti-GLUT-3 antiserum (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), or anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10, Roche Applied Science). After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel, Irvine, CA), or anti-rat IgG (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). For GLUT immunoblotting, a total cell membrane preparation was made, as described previously (23Fladeby C. Bjonness B. Serck-Hanssen G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cell surface biotinylation assay for GLUT-1 was carried out, according to the method of McMahon et al. (24McMahon R.J. Hwang J.B. Frost S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of the syntaxin immunoblots was carried out as described previously (9Nakayama T. Mikoshiba K. Yamamori T. Akagawa K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 536: 209-214Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). After drug application, cells were treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the precipitate was solubilized in 8 m urea, 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5). The protein concentration was measured by using a DC-protein assay (Bio-Rad). The intensities of the immunoblotted signals were measured using NIH Image and normalized to that with anti-α-tubulin IgG (DM1A) (Sigma). Immunocytofluorescence—Immunostaining was carried out essentially as described previously (9Nakayama T. Mikoshiba K. Yamamori T. Akagawa K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 536: 209-214Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, to study GLUT-1 localization in cells treated with PMA or transfected with HA-tagged syntaxin, cells were fixed and permeabilized with acetone/methanol (1:1). After treatment with a blocking solution, the cells were then incubated with a monoclonal antibody (14D8) (9Nakayama T. Mikoshiba K. Yamamori T. Akagawa K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 536: 209-214Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) or an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10) and an anti-GLUT-1 polyclonal antibody. After another wash with PBS, the cells were exposed to either anti-mouse IgG, anti-rat IgG coupled to Cy-3, or anti-rabbit IgG coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate. The immunostained cells were examined using a confocal scanning laser microscope (Zeiss LSM 410, Jena, Germany) that was equipped with a triple band-pass filter set. Cell Growth and Cell Cycle Analysis—T98G cells that had been starved of serum for 24 h were stimulated with DMEM containing 10% FCS for 0-96 h. Control and syntaxin-expressing cells were seeded in 90-mm in diameter culture dishes (5 × 104 cells/dish). The number of living cells was counted up to 96 h following DMEM/FCS treatment. The growth rate in the logarithmic growth phase (48-96 h) was calculated for each cell line. The cell cycle analysis was carried out as reported previously (25Smit M.J. Verzijl D. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15084-15089Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Growth of T98G cells that had been plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells per 90-mm in diameter culture dish was arrested by removing serum for 24 h. The cells were restimulated for 40 h with medium containing 10% serum. Thereafter, the cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) treated with 0.5 mg/ml RNase (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) were analyzed immediately after propidium iodide (Sigma) staining using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS, BD Biosciences Epics Profile II) with argon laser excitation (488 nm) and a 588-nm (FL2) emission filter. At least 10,000 cells were collected for each sample (excluding the gated cells). The percentage of cells in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase was estimated from FL2-height histograms using ModFit (Verity Software, Topsham, ME). Measurement of Glucose Uptake—Glucose transport was assayed by measuring the uptake of 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose (2-DG), essentially as described previously (22Nagamatsu S. Nakamichi Y. Inoue N. Inoue M. Nishino H. Sawa H. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but with slight modifications. The uptake assay was carried out 48-72 h after cell passaging. Cells (1 × l05) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), containing 0.03 g/100 ml bovine serum albumin, 136.9 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KC1, 0.34 mm NaHPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 1.27 mm CaCl2, and 4.20 mm NaHCO3,20mm HEPES, pH 7.4, were incubated on 12-well multiplates at 37 °C, for 30 min. Glucose uptake was initiated by adding 0.5 μCi of 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H(N)]glucose (2-[3H]DG; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to 0.5 ml of HBSS buffer, in the presence of 0.1 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose, in 35-mm in diameter wells. After 13 min at room temperature, uptake was terminated by rapid washing with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. The uptake of 2-DG was linear between 0 and 20 min of incubation (data not shown). For the kinetic analysis, we used 0.1-100.0 mm 2-DG (0.0064-6.4 μm 2-[3H]DG). The cells were solubilized in 1% SDS, and the amount of radioactivity was measured. Protein content was measured using the DC protein assay from Bio-Rad. The difference in the amount of uptake in the presence and absence of 0.5 mm cytochalasin B (a transport inhibitor) was calculated; this represented glucose transporter-dependent activity. In each experiment, glucose uptake was assayed in triplicate. We studied the kinetics of glucose uptake using different concentrations of d-glucose, as described previously (26Muona P. Sollberg S. Peltonen J. Uitto J. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cultures of T98G cells were incubated with either 5.5 or 25.0 mm d-glucose for 7 days. The culture medium was changed daily to maintain a relatively constant concentration of glucose. To study basal glucose uptake via sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs), cells were treated with Na+-free HBSS buffer containing 0.03 g/100 ml bovine serum albumin, 138 mm N-methyl-d-(-)glucamine (NMDG), 5.6 mm KC1, 0.34 mm KHPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 1.27 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Measurement of 2-DG Uptake via GLUTs and SGLTs in T98G Cells—To examine the relationship between syntaxin 1C expression and glucose transport, we first determined whether there was glucose uptake via GLUT in T98G cells. The amount of 2-DG uptake via GLUTs and SGLTs was measured in the presence of cytocharasin B (an antagonist of GLUTs) and in Na+-free medium. GLUT activity accounted for ∼80% of total 2-DG uptake in T98G cells. By contrast, SGLT activity accounted for less than 20% of total 2-DG uptake (data not shown). Uptake of 2-DG was linear for up to 20 min of incubation (data not shown). These observations indicate that GLUTs are expressed in T98G cells. Identification of GLUT Isoform in T98G Cells—There are several reports that the GLUT isoforms GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 are the main components of several types of glioma (22Nagamatsu S. Nakamichi Y. Inoue N. Inoue M. Nishino H. Sawa H. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Nagamatsu S. Sawa H. Wakizaka A. Hoshino T. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2048-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Boado R.J. Black K.L. Pardridge W.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, whether GLUTs are expressed in T98G cells has not been determined. To determine which GLUT isoform(s) is expressed in T98G cells, we investigated the kinetics of 2-DG uptake. As shown in Fig. 1A, the Km of 2-DG uptake in T98G cells was 2.42 ± 0.12 mM. GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and GLUT-4 are high affinity glucose transporters, whereas GLUT-2 is a low affinity transporter (29Walmsley A.R. Barrett M.P. Bringaud F. Gould G.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 476-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because the value of Km in the present study is far smaller than that of GLUT-2 (Km: 20-40 mM), it is likely that the GLUT isoform functioning in T98G cells is not GLUT-2, but rather a high affinity transporter, i.e. GLUT-1, GLUT-3, or GLUT-4. As shown in Fig. 1B, semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed that GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 were expressed in T98G cells; GLUT-2 and GLUT-4 expression was undetectable except under saturated PCR conditions (data not shown). To examine the expression levels of endogenous GLUT-1 and GLUT-3, we studied expression of the mRNA of these GLUT isoforms in T98G cells by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, GLUT-1 mRNA was more abundant than that of GLUT-3. We also confirmed expression of GLUT-1 protein by immunoblotting (see Fig. 3C) and localization in plasma membrane in T98G cells by cell surface biotinylation assay (data not shown). It has been reported that glucose uptake via GLUT-1 in cells cultured in low glucose medium is higher than in the presence of high concentrations of glucose (26Muona P. Sollberg S. Peltonen J. Uitto J. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1587-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We investigated glucose uptake in T98G cells that were cultured with different concentrations of glucose. As expected, 2-DG uptake was ∼1.5 times greater in low-glucose medium (5.5 mM glucose), compared with high glucose medium (25 mM glucose) (Fig. 1D). Another property of GLUT-4 is that it translocates to the plasma membrane in cells that have been stimulated with insulin, which results in an increase in glucose uptake (16Thurmond D.C. Kanzaki M. Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Consequently, we tested whether the amount of 2-DG uptake in T98G cells would increase after stimulation with insulin; this was not the case (Fig. 1D). The results shown in Fig. 1, B and D suggest that there is no functional GLUT-4 in T98G cells. The aforementioned results demonstrate that the major isoform of GLUT in T98G cells is GLUT-1. Activation of Endogenous Syntaxin 1C by PMA Suppresses Translocation of GLUT-1 to the Plasma Membrane in T98G Cells—Our previous study revealed that T98G astroglioma cells express syntaxin 1C, but not syntaxin 1A, and that syntaxin 1C expression can be activated by PMA (9Nakayama T. Mikoshiba K. Yamamori T. Akagawa K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 536: 209-214Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether a change in the level of syntaxin 1C expression might affect glucose transport. Fig. 2, A and B shows the change in syntaxin 1C expression and 2-DG uptake in T98G cells that were treated with either PMA, forskolin, or 4α-PMA (a nonfunctional analog of PMA). Uptake of 2-DG in PMA-treated cells was reduced by ∼85%, compared with control cells (Fig. 2B), whereas 2-DG uptake was not affected by either forskolin or 4α-PMA (Fig. 2B). None of the aforementioned treatments had any effect on the uptake of 2-DG via SGLTs (data not shown). In addition, an analysis of the time course of glucose uptake (Fig. 2, C and D) revealed that 2-DG uptake in T98G cells was reduced as the PMA-induced level of syntaxin 1C expression increased. Because syntaxin 1A mRNA is not found in astroglioma cells, irrespective of whether cells are treated with PMA (9Nakayama T. Mikoshiba K. Yamamori T. Akagawa K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 536: 209-214Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the observed change in glucose uptake in PMA-treated T98G cells was not caused by the actions of syntaxin 1A. To determine whether the reduction in glucose uptake was caused by the presence of syntaxin 1C, we examined the expression of syntaxin 2, syntaxin 3, and syntaxin 4 in the plasma membrane. In contrast to the expression of syntaxin 1C, which is increased in a dose-dependent manner by PMA treatment (7.37 ± 1.34-fold increase in response to 10 μm PMA), the expression of syntaxin 2, syntaxin 3, and syntaxin 4 was not affected by PMA (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, PMA had no effect on the expression of GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 mRNA and protein in T98G cells (Fig. 3, B and C). These results suggest that the treatment of T98G cells with PMA did not alter the level of expression of GLUT-1, GLUT-3, or syntaxins other than syntaxin 1C. We also analyzed the effect of PMA using immunofluorescence and found that in cells in which the expression of endogenous syntaxin 1C had been enhanced by PMA, GLUT-1 expression in the plasma membrane decreased, whereas expression in the intracellular fraction increased (Fig. 4, B and F). By contrast, neither forskolin (Fig. 4, D and H) nor 4α-PMA (Fig. 4, C and G) had any effect on GLUT-1 expression. Glucose Uptake via GLUT-1 in T98G Cells Transfected with Syntaxin 1A, Syntaxin 1C, or Syntaxin 4—To determine whether syntaxin 1C expression affects glucose transport in astroglioma cells, we introduced exogenous syntaxin 1A, syntaxin 1C, or syntaxin 4 tagged with HA into at"

We previously identified five novel residues of NS5B in a JK-1 isolate indispensable for RdRP activity in vitro (Qin, W., Yamashita, T., Shirota, Y., Lin, Y., Wei, W., and Murakami, S. (2001) Hepatology 33, 728–737). We addressed the role of these residues in HCV RNA replication using a HCV replicon system derived from an M1LE isolate (Kishine, H., Sugiyama, K., Hijikata, M., Kato, N., Takahashi, H., Noshi, T., Nio, Y., Hosaka, M., Miyanari, Y., and Shimotohno, K. (2002) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 293, 993–999). The five residues of NS5B in M1LE were found to be critical for HCV replication in vivo and also indispensable for RdRP activity in vitro along with purified bacterial recombinant proteins. We also found a chimeric replicon of JK-1 and M1LE in which only the NS5B sequence derived from JK-1 could not replicate in Huh-7 cells. The residues responsible for the phenomenon were mapped by several chimeric and substituted forms of NS5B M1LE and/or JK-1 isolates in the HCV RNA replicon. Two residues, amino acids 220 and 288, were critical, and two residues, amino acids 213 and 231, were important for efficient HCV replication. Mutant JK-1 NS5B harboring all four residues of M1LE was replication-competent in the chimeric replicon and was as efficient as the original M1LE replicon. By comparing the replication competence in vivo and RdRP activity in vitro with various chimeric and mutated versions of NS5B, the HCV replication ability was found to correlate well with the RdRP activity. However, heat- and dilution-sensitive NS5Bs exhibiting weaker RdRP activity in vitro were found to be replication-incompetent, suggesting that HCV replication requires RdRP activity higher than a certain critical threshold. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a central catalytic enzyme of HCV RNA replication.

Persistent infection with HCV is an important cause of chronic liver disease around the world. Infections with this hepatotropic flavivirus are associated with inflammatory liver injury, progressive fibrosis, and, in the most severely affected patients, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (2Seeff L.B.

This polyprotein precursor can be processed by the host and virally encoded proteases to generate mature structural and nonstructural proteins required for virus replication and assembly (6Major M.E.

Studies on the replication of HCV have been hampered by the lack of efficient cell culture systems. Many attempts have been made to identify cell lines that allow efficient infection with HCV and virus production, but these systems suffer from low virus yield and poor reproducibility (23Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. Antiviral. Res. 2001; 52: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recently, a cell culture system was developed based on subgenomic selectable replicons consisting of the HCV 5′-nontranslated region directing translation segment of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene, internal ribosomal entry site of the encephalomyocarditis virus, HCV NS proteins NS3 to NS5B, and HCV 3′-nontranslated region. After transfection these RNAs into Huh-7 cells and selection with G418, cell colonies can be generated that carry persistently replicating HCV replicons (24Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U.

Yamashita T. Shirota Y. Lin Y. Wei W. Murakami S. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among them, Glu-18 and His-502 are critical for homomeric oligomerization, Tyr-276 is crucial for template/primer binding, and the role of Tyr-191 and Cys-274 remains to be elucidated (47Qin W.

In this study, we evaluated the role of these residues in HCV replication in vivo using a HCV replicon system derived from an M1LE isolate (31Kishine H. Sugiyama K. Hijikata M. Kato N. Takahashi H.

Here, we report that the five residues critical for RdRP activity are indispensable for HCV replication. Also, we discovered the incompetence of JK-1 NS5B in HCV replication and specified four residues within or in vicinity of the conserved motifs responsible for the incompetence that may reflect the labile property of JK-1 NS5B in diluted concentrations or at high temperatures.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Plasmids—pNNRZ2RU (31Kishine H.

For convenience, pNNRZ2RU was digested with MluI and BglII, and the MluI and BglII fragments were inserted into pGL3 Basic vector (Promega) to create pGL3-MluI-BglII. An adaptive mutation S232I within NS5A, which significantly increases RNA replication, was introduced into this plasmid to create pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I. It was then used as an intermediate vector. All mutations were introduced once into pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I, and the MluI and BglII fragments of pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I containing each mutation were ligated back to the MluI and BglII sites of pNNRZ2RU to create each mutant (39Shimakami T.

MA is the replicon carrying the point mutation S232I in NS5A and was used as a wild type in this study. To generate M1LE/VDD as a negative control, a point mutation that changed the GDD motif of NS5B to VDD was introduced into M1LE/wild as previously reported (39Shimakami T. Hijikata M. Luo H. Ma Y.

Next, HCV JK-1 cDNA was subcloned by PCR using the primers 5AAatII For and JK5BBglII Rev. We digested this fragment using AatII and BglII to generate two fragments, AatII-AatII and AatII-BglII, because there are two AatII sites and one BglII site within the fragment. These two fragments were inserted into the AatII and BglII sites of pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I to create pGL3/JK(I+II+III), and the correct direction was confirmed by PCR using the corresponding primers. The fragment from pGL3/JK(I+II+III) digested by MluI and BglII was reintroduced into the corresponding MA/JKIV site.To construct MA/JKI, we digested pGL3/JK(I+II+III) using AatII, inserted it into pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I to yield pGL3/JKI, and confirmed the correct direction by PCR. To generate MA/JKII and MA/JKIII, we first constructed pGL3/JK (II+III). For this purpose, we digested pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I with AatII then inserted this fragment into the corresponding part of pGL3/JK(I+II+III) to produce pGL3/JK (II+III). We confirmed the correct direction by PCR. To generate MA/JKII, we moved the fragment pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I digested by Eco81I and BglII into the corresponding sites of pGL3/JK (II+III) to yield pGL3/JKII. We produce MA/JKIII by moving the fragment pGL3/JK (II+III) digested by Eco81I and BglII into pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I to create pGL3/JKIII.M1LE/E18A from NS5B was generated by PCR using primers carrying nucleotide alternations, and 5AAatII For or NR5Bt Rev. The PCR fragment containing this mutation was digested by AatII then inserted into the AatII sites of pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I, and the direction was confirmed by PCR. MA/Y191A, C274A, Y276A, C213N, D220C, N231S, S288N, D444G, and MA/4M(C213N/D220C/N231S/S288N) of NS5B were individually generated by PCR using primers carrying the necessary nucleotide alternations along with 5BSEF5 or NR5Bt Rev. PCR fragments containing each mutation were digested with Eco81I and BglII and inserted into the Eco81I and BglII sites of pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I. MA/H502A from NS5B was also generated by PCR using primers carrying the corresponding mutation and 5BSEF5 or 5BAgeI Rev. The PCR fragment containing this mutation was digested using BglII and AgeI and then inserted into the corresponding site of MA.To create MA/JKIII4M(N213C/C220D/S231N/N288S of NS5B), MA/JKIII was subcloned by PCR using primers with the necessary mutation and Eco81I For or NR5Bt Rev. This PCR fragment was digested by Eco81I and BglII and inserted into pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I. To produce MA/JK5B4M(N213C/C220D/S231N/N288S), MA/JK5B4MC213N, MA/JK5B4MN231S, MA/JK5B4MD220C, and MA/JK5B4MS288N, mutations were introduced by PCR using primers with the necessary mutations and 5BSEF5 or NR5Bt Rev, and PCR fragments containing each mutation were inserted into the Eco81I and BglII sites of pGL3/JK(I+II+III).A plasmid derived from pGENK1, pGENKS (16Yamashita T.

Virology. 1994; 199: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was used to express recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused protein in Escherichia coli, which contains multiple cloning sites (EcoRI, SacI, KpnI, XmaI, SalI, and BamHI) downstream of the sequences encoding the GST protein. HCV JK-1 and M1LE cDNA harboring NS5B were subcloned by PCR with JK5B For/JK5Bt Rev and NS5B For/NS5Bt Rev, respectively, which have artificial SacI and BamHI sites. The PCR fragments were inserted into the SacI and BamHI sites of pGENKS to yield pGENKS-JK-GST5Bt/WT and pGENKS-M1LE-GST5Bt/WT, which encode wild type GST-fused NS5B proteins. pGENKS-M1LE-G-ST5Bt/Y191A, pGENKS-M1LE-GST5Bt/C274A, pGENKS-M1LE-GST-5Bt/Y276A, pGENKS-M1LE-GST5Bt4M(C213N/D220C/N231S/S-288N), pGENKS-JK-GST5Bt4M(N213C/S231N/C220D/N288S), pGEN-KS-JK-GST5Bt4M/C213N, pGENKS-JK-GST5Bt4M/N231S, pGENKS-JK-GST5Bt4M/D220C, and pGENKS-JK-GST5Bt4M/S288N, each encoding mutant GST-fused NS5B protein, were constructed by digestion and transfer of the corresponding pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I DNA containing each mutation. First, pGL3-MluI-BglII-S232I containing each mutation was digested with MunI and BglII, and these fragments were introduced into pGENKS-M1LE-GST5Bt/WT or pGENKS-JK-GST5Bt/WT, respectively. To generate pGENKS-M1LE-GST5Bt/E18A and pGENKS-M1LE-GST5Bt/H502A, mutations were introduced by PCR using the primers with the necessary mutation and NR5B For or NR5Bt Rev. The PCR fragments were individually inserted into the SacI/MunI and MunI/BamHI sites of pGENKS-M1LE-GST5Bt/WT. The sequences of all the constructs were confirmed using the dideoxy sequence method.

Hijikata M. Luo H. Ma Y. Kaneko S. Shimotohno K. Murakami S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2738-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For the selection of G418-resistant cells, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen) 24–48 h after transfection, and the medium was changed twice a week thereafter. Three weeks after transfection, G418-resistant cell colonies were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) (0.6 g/liter in 50% methanol-10% acetic acid).Expression and Purification of Bacterial Recombinant NS5Bt Protein—GST-fused HCV NS5Bt protein was expressed and purified as previously described (16Yamashita T.

The reaction was stopped by transferring the reaction solution to a DE81 filter (Whatman), and the filter was then extensively washed with 0.5 m Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0) and briefly rinsed with 70% ethanol. The filter-bound radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter.Western Blotting Assay—20 or 160 ng of JK-GST5Bt/WT, M1LE-GST5Bt4M, and M1LE-GST5Bt/WT was analyzed using Western blotting assay prior to or after incubation at 37 °C in the presence of RdRP reagent (as shown above) for 1 h. We used the anti-NS5B (14–5) monoclonal antibody, which was kindly provided by Dr. M. Kohara (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Rinshoken, Japan).RESULTSThe Five NS5B Residues Are Critical for HCV Replication in Vivo —Previously, we identified five amino acid residues in NS5B of a JK-1 isolate that are critical for RdRP (Figs. 1 and 2). Alanine substitution at these residues abolished RdRP activity of purified bacterial recombinant NS5B protein in a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused form, GST-NS5Bt, that was missing the C-terminal membrane recruitment domain (34Qin W. Yamashita T. Shirota Y. Lin Y. Wei W. Murakami S. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The one or more roles of these residues remain to be evaluated in vivo, because these properties of the residues were only studied in vitro. We then applied the M1LE HCV replicon to Huh-7 cells (40Hijikata M. Mizushima H. Tanji Y. Komoda Y. Hirowatari Y. Akagi T. Kato N. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10773-10777Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The components of the replicon are similar to a construct previously reported (25Pietschmann T. Lohmann V. Rutter G. Kurpanek K. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1252-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), but NS3–NS5B were derived from an M1LE isolate (Fig. 2). For enhanced HCV replication efficiency, we utilized an improved HCV RNA replicon system using an M1LE HCV replicon harboring the S232I-adapted mutation (conventionally designated MA in this report), and Huh-7-KV-C cells, a Huh-7 cell line cured from replicating HCV replicon by interferon treatment (39Shimakami T. Hijikata M. Luo H. Ma Y. Kaneko S. Shimotohno K. Murakami S. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2738-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In vitro transcribed replicon RNA with one of the five mutations of NS5B (E18A, Y191A, C274A, Y276A, or H502A) was transfected by electroporation into the Huh-7-KV-C subline, and cells were cultured in the presence of G418. As a negative control, a replicon M1LE/VDD in which the GDD motif of NS5B was mutated to VDD was used. The GDD motif is highly conserved among viral RdRPs, and even NdNPs and is critical for RdRP activity of NS5B, whereas NS5B/VDD has no RdRP activity (16Yamashita T. Kaneko S. Shirota Y. Qin W. Nomura T. Kobayashi K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15479-15486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). After G418 selection for 3 weeks, more than 900 colonies with the MA replicon were visible, and no colonies were observed with these five mutant replicons or the replicon M1LE/VDD (Fig. 3A), indicating that all five residues are critical for HCV RNA replication in vivo.Fig. 2Schematic presentation of HCV mutant replicons. NS5B was separated into four regions by convenient restriction sites: I (aa 1–108), II (aa 108–183), III (aa 183–448), and IV (aa 448–590). The amino acids analyzed are shown as follows: critical residues (dashes), important residues (arrow), and replaceable residue (double dashes). MA is the M1LE wild type wit"
