https://openalex.org/W2066872423,"FLAVONOIDS are rare in the animal kingdom, but Ford1, using a simple colour test, suggested that they were present in a number of butterflies. A difficulty in characterizing the pigments is the fact that a large number of specimens, of the order of hundreds, is required, and it is not always possible to obtain one species in such large numbers. Morris and Thomson2, using some 400 specimens, identified tricin and a glycoside of this flavone as well as a glycoside of another flavone, orientin, from the wings of the marble white butterflies Melanargia galathea. They found3 that the small heath butterflies Coenonympha pamphilus contained tricin both free and as glycoside but not orientin. The flavonoids seem to be obtained by the insects through the caterpillars feeding on a particular food host. Carotenoids, on the other hand, are well known in animals, and Goodwin4 has suggested that insects accumulate their dietary carotenoids as such or that they may be altered to form other carotenoids not found in the insects' food. A number of specimens of the common blue butterfly Polyommatus icarus Rott. were collected both in France and in England with a view to characterizing the flavonoids and the carotenoids and to comparing these with their food plants. One hundred specimens of P. icarus from Box Hill, Surrey, were feeding on rest harrow Ononis repens and those from St Martial, France (800 specimens), on a species of Anthyllis; both plants are members of the Leguminosae."

https://openalex.org/W2080160822,"I HAVE recently shown1 that Maxwell's equations admit solutions for charge moving in a straight line with the speed of light c. The accompanying electromagnetic field Fik is that of a plane-fronted wave, that is, one whose front is plane and whose amplitude varies over the front. The source is a null four-current, Ji satisfying where gik is the metric tensor of flat space-time. The charge is localized in a world-tube about the z-axis of coordinates; all appropriate conditions are satisfied at the boundary of the tube, and the Fik are everywhere continuous. Although charge is radiated away from the source, conservation of charge is of course automatically ensured by Maxwell's equations. The solutions have precise analogues in Einstein–Maxwell theory2."

https://openalex.org/W2012308108,"THE view that induction is an operation of valid inference of the same kind as deduction, expounded notably by John Stuart Mill, has been rightly rejected by modern scientists and philosophers. Instead, the growth of scientific understanding is looked on as a hypothetico-deductive activity. According to this view, hypotheses or theories are created, subsuming far more than the known facts they are intended to explain; they are tested for internal logical consistency and compatibility with the known facts; and implications are deduced from them for test by further observation or experiment. If such a test is adequately carried out and gives a negative result, the theory is scrapped or, alternatively, modified so as to be compatible with the new facts. Thus theories (if they have an adequate degree of generality) cannot be absolutely verified, though they can be absolutely falsified. Supporting evidence can corroborate them—strengthen our reasons for believing that they are true—but not verify them."
