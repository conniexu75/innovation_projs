https://openalex.org/W3178620206,"Background Longer-term consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming an important burden to societies and healthcare systems. Data on post-COVID-19 syndrome in the general population are required for the timely planning of healthcare services and resources. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of impaired health status and physical and mental health symptoms among individuals at least six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to characterize their healthcare utilization. Methods This population-based prospective cohort study (Zurich SARS-CoV-2 Cohort) enrolled 431 adults from the general population with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to health authorities between 27 February 2020 and 05 August 2020 in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland. We evaluated the proportion of individuals reporting not to have fully recovered since SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the proportion reporting fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale), dyspnea (mMRC dyspnea scale) or depression (DASS-21) at six to eight months after diagnosis. Furthermore, the proportion of individuals with at least one healthcare contact after their acute illness was evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with these main outcomes. Results Symptoms were present in 385 (89%) participants at diagnosis and 81 (19%) were initially hospitalized. At six to eight months, 111 (26%) reported not having fully recovered. 233 (55%) participants reported symptoms of fatigue, 96 (25%) had at least grade 1 dyspnea, and 111 (26%) had DASS-21 scores indicating symptoms of depression. 170 (40%) participants reported at least one general practitioner visit related to COVID-19 after acute illness, and 10% (8/81) of initially hospitalized individuals were rehospitalized. Individuals that have not fully recovered or suffer from fatigue, dyspnea or depression were more likely to have further healthcare contacts. However, a third of individuals (37/111) that have not fully recovered did not seek further care. Conclusions In this population-based study, a relevant proportion of participants suffered from longer-term consequences after SARS-CoV-2 infection. With millions infected across the world, our findings emphasize the need for the timely planning of resources and patient-centered services for post-COVID-19 care."
https://openalex.org/W3178327661,"Microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) process utilising the biogeochemical reactions for low energy cementation has recently emerged as a potential technology for numerous engineering applications. The design and development of an efficient MICP process depends upon several physicochemical and biological variables; amongst which the initial bacterial cell concentration is a major factor. The goal of this study is to assess the impact of initial bacterial cell concentration on ureolysis and carbonate precipitation kinetics along with its influence on the calcium carbonate crystal properties; as all these factors determine the efficacy of this process for specific engineering applications. We have also investigated the role of subsequent cell recharge in calcium carbonate precipitation kinetics for the first time. Experimental results showed that the kinetics of ureolysis and calcium carbonate precipitation are well-fitted by an exponential logistic equation for cell concentrations between optical density range of 0.1 OD to 0.4 OD. This equation is highly applicable for designing the optimal processes for microbially cemented soil stabilization applications using native or augmented bacterial cultures. Multiple recharge kinetics study revealed that the addition of fresh bacterial cells is an essential step to keep the fast rate of precipitation, as desirable in certain applications. Our results of calcium carbonate crystal morphology and mineralogy via scanning electron micrography, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis exhibited a notable impact of cell number and extracellular urease concentration on the properties of carbonate crystals. Lower cell numbers led to formation of larger crystals compared to high cell numbers and these crystals transform from vaterite phase to the calcite phase over time. This study has demonstrated the significance of kinetic models for designing large-scale MICP applications."
https://openalex.org/W3182645224,"Contaminated soil and vegetables have continued to instigate threat to human health globally and specially in developing countries. This study was aimed to determine concentrations of certain heavy metals in soil and vegetables (cabbage and tomato) from Koka area of central Ethiopia using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrophotometer (ICP-OES). The amounts of As, Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Hg and Co detected in soil samples were found to surpass the reference values for agricultural soil. Similarly, the concentrations of As, Pb, Cd, Cr and Hg obtained in both tomato and cabbage samples have exceeded the recommended values with the mean levels generally ranging from 0.93–6.76, 1.80–7.26, 0.33–1.03, 0.86–5.16 and 3.23–4.36 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. The result obtained have signified that leafy vegetable has hoarded heavy metals more than non-leafy vegetable. The total hazard quote for As and Hg from tomato ingestion and for As, Hg and Co from cabbage ingestion were greater than unity, signifying potential health hazard to the public. The health index (HI) owing to tomato and cabbage ingesting were 5.44 and 14.21, respectively, signifying likely adversative health implication to the population from the ingestion of the vegetables. The Total Cancer Risk (TCR) analysis have uncovered the possible cancer hazard persuaded by Cd, Hg, As and Ni from the ingestion of both vegetables. From the outcomes this study, it can be concluded that the soil and vegetables from Koka areas are possibly contaminated with toxic metals and hence demand strict monitoring to safeguard the public around the study area and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W3180797208,"Backgrounds Health professionals are among the frontline of COVID-19 pandemic exposure and identified as a priority target group that need to receive COVID-19 vaccines. However, intention to receive vaccine is still matters the extent of COVID-19 vaccinations among health professionals. This study aimed to assess intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine and the factors that will determine their intention among health professionals working at public hospitals of Illu Aba Bora and Buno Bedelle zone hospitals. Methods A cross-sectional study design was applied to assess the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccines among health professionals working in public health hospitals of Illu Aba Bora and Buno Bedelle zone hospitals. Self-administered questionnaire were used for assessing intention to receive COVID-19 Vaccine. Multiple linear regressions were performed to identify factors associated with intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine with p-value&lt; 0.05 as cutoff point for statistical significance at 95% confidence interval (CI). Result In this study, almost half of respondents 217(53.1% [95.0%: CI 49.3–58.9]) of study participants scored above the mean. Attitude (β = 0.54, 95% CI: [0.49, 0.63], p&lt;0.01), knowledge (β = 0.27, 95% CI: [0.21, 0.35], p&lt;0.01, perception (β = 0.43, 95% CI: [0.39, 0.56], p = 0.02 and age (β = 0.64, 95% CI: [0.51, 0.72], p&lt;0.01 were variables associated with intention to receive vaccine against COVID-19. Conclusions This study result indicated that the overall magnitude of intention to receive COVID-19 is low. increasing attitudes, knowledge and perception among health professionals related to COVID-19 vaccine will helps to increase the overall intention to receive vaccine against COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3179564021,"Signaling by the Rho GTPase Rac1 is key to the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, cell spreading and adhesion. It is widely accepted that the inactive form of Rac1 is bound by Rho GDI, which prevents Rac1 activation and Rac1-effector interactions. In addition, GDI-bound Rac1 is protected from proteasomal degradation, in line with data showing that Rac1 ubiquitination occurs exclusively when Rac1 is activated. We set out to investigate how Rac1 activity, GDI binding and ubiquitination are linked. We introduced single amino acid mutations in Rac1 which differentially altered Rac1 activity, and compared whether the level of Rac1 activity relates to Rac1 ubiquitination and GDI binding. Results show that Rac1 ubiquitination and the active Rac1 morphology is proportionally increased with Rac1 activity. Similarly, we introduced lysine-to-arginine mutations in constitutively active Rac1 to inhibit site-specific ubiquitination and analyze this effect on Rac1 signaling output and ubiquitination. These data show that the K16R mutation inhibits GTP binding, and consequently Rac1 activation, signaling and–ubiquitination, while the K147R mutation does not block Rac1 signaling, but does inhibits its ubiquitination. In both sets of mutants, no direct correlation was observed between GDI binding and Rac1 activity or -ubiquitination. Taken together, our data show that a strong, positive correlation exists between Rac1 activity and its level of ubiquitination, but also that GDI dissociation does not predispose Rac1 to ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W3178984288,"Introduction A highly sensitive triage test that captures most symptomatic patients at increased likelihood of having pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) would ‘rule-out’ lower-risk patients from expensive confirmatory testing. Although studies have assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a C-reactive protein (CRP) triage test for PTB in HIV+ patients, limited data are available from HIV- cohorts. Materials and methods In this retrospective case-control study, 765 serum samples were selected from FIND’s biobank. Each sample had been collected from an adult presenting with respiratory symptomatology to district hospitals in South Africa and referral hospitals in Cambodia, Peru, Georgia and Vietnam between 2007–2017. Serum CRP measurements were obtained using a laboratory-based assay. CRP cutoff-points of ≥8mg/L and ≥10mg/L were predefined as a positive triage test result. The PTB reference standard was two contemporaneously collected sputum liquid culture results. Results CRP demonstrated an overall sensitivity for PTB of 79.8% (95%CI 75.5–83.5) and 77.7% (95%CI 73.4–81.6) for cutoff-points of 8mg/L and 10mg/L respectively. Specificity was 62.8% (95%CI 57.8–67.6%) and 66.6% (95%CI 61.1–70.7) respectively. Area-under-the-curve using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was 0.77 (95%CI 0.74–0.81). Threshold analysis showed optimal CRP cutoff-points were higher in HIV+ than HIV- participants. An algorithm in which CRP triage was followed by confirmatory Xpert MTB/Rif testing achieved a sensitivity of 75.1% (95%CI 69.0–80.4%) whilst decreasing Xpert usage by 40.6%. Discussion CRP may not meet the challenge of a catch-all TB triage test. However, it shows promise in HIV+ individuals. Further research is required in a prospective study using point-of-care platforms to further evaluate its capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W3180978329,"Background The biological maturation (BM) analyzed by peak height velocity (PHV) and bone age (BA), and lean body mass has been associated with the strength and muscle power of young athletes. However, the ability of BM (PHV and BA) and LM markers to predict muscle strength and power in young athletes remains uncertain. Objective The Aim was determine the predicting power of BM markers (PHV and BA) and LM in relation to muscle power of upper and lower limbs and muscle strength of upper limbs in adolescent athletes at puberty. Methods Ninety-two adolescent athletes (both sexes; age 12.4 ± 1.02 years) were assessed for body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Power of upper limbs (ULP), force handgrip (HG), vertical jump (VJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ) were recorded. BM was predicted by mathematical models to estimate PHV and BA. Multilayer artificial neural network analyses (MLP’s) were used to determine the power of prediction of LM, PHV and BA on muscle power and strength of upper- and lower-limbs of the athletes. Results LM, BA and PHV were associated with HG (r&gt;0.74, p&lt;0.05) and ULS (r&gt;0.60, p&lt;0.05) in both sexes. In both sexes BA was associated with VJ (r&gt;0.55, p&lt;0.05) and CMJ (r&gt;0.53, p&lt;0.05). LM indicated associations (r&gt;0.60, p&lt;0.05) with BA and with PHV (r&lt;0.83, p&lt;0.05) in both sexes. MLP’s analysis revealed that the LM provides &gt; 72% of probability to predict the muscle power of upper- and lower-limbs, and the strength of the upper limbs; whereas PHV provides &gt; 43% and bone age &gt;64% in both female and male adolescent athletes. Conclusion We identified that, like PHV and BA, LM is a strong predictor of low cost of both upper limbs muscle strength and upper and lower limbs power in adolescent athletes."
https://openalex.org/W3181161206,"Scavenger receptor class A (SR-A) proteins are type II transmembrane glycoproteins that form homotrimers on the cell surface. This family has five known members (SCARA1 to 5, or SR-A1 to A5) that recognize a variety of ligands and are involved in multiple biological pathways. Previous reports have shown that some SR-A family members can bind modified low-density lipoproteins (LDLs); however, the mechanisms of the interactions between the SR-A members and these lipoproteins are not fully understood. Here, we systematically characterize the recognition of SR-A receptors with lipoproteins and report that SCARA1 (SR-A1, CD204), MARCO (SCARA2), and SCARA5 recognize acetylated or oxidized LDL and very-low-density lipoprotein in a Ca2+-dependent manner through their C-terminal scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains. These interactions occur specifically between the SRCR domains and the modified apolipoprotein B component of the lipoproteins, suggesting that they might share a similar mechanism for lipoprotein recognition. Meanwhile, SCARA4, a SR-A member with a carbohydrate recognition domain instead of the SRCR domain at the C terminus, shows low affinity for modified LDL and very-low-density lipoprotein but binds in a Ca2+-independent manner. SCARA3, which does not have a globular domain at the C terminus, was found to have no detectable binding with these lipoproteins. Taken together, these results provide mechanistic insights into the interactions between SR-A family members and lipoproteins that may help us understand the roles of SR-A receptors in lipid transport and related diseases such as atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3179079024,"Mammalian cells synthesize H2S from sulfur-containing amino acids and are also exposed to exogenous sources of this signaling molecule, notably from gut microbes. As an inhibitor of complex IV in the electron transport chain, H2S can have a profound impact on metabolism, suggesting the hypothesis that metabolic reprogramming is a primary mechanism by which H2S signals. In this study, we report that H2S increases lipogenesis in many cell types, using carbon derived from glutamine rather than from glucose. H2S-stimulated lipid synthesis is sensitive to the mitochondrial NAD(P)H pools and is enabled by reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate. Lipidomics analysis revealed that H2S elicits time-dependent changes across several lipid classes, e.g., upregulating triglycerides while downregulating phosphatidylcholine. Direct analysis of triglyceride concentration revealed that H2S induces a net increase in the size of this lipid pool. These results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the effects of H2S on increasing lipid droplets in adipocytes and population studies that have pointed to a positive correlation between cysteine (a substrate for H2S synthesis) and fat mass."
https://openalex.org/W3180744849,"DS (David’s site) is one of the new archaeological sites documented in the same paleolandscape in which FLK 22 was deposited at about 1.85 Ma in Olduvai Gorge. Fieldwork in DS has unearthed the largest vertically-discrete archaeological horizon in the African Pleistocene, where a multi-cluster anthropogenic accumulation of fossil bones and stone tools has been identified. In this work we present the results of the techno-economic study of the lithic assemblage recovered from DS. We also explore the spatial magnitude of the technological behaviors documented at this spot using powerful spatial statistical tools to unravel correlations between the spatial distributional patterns of lithic categories. At DS, lavas and quartzite were involved in different technological processes. Volcanic materials, probably transported to this spot from a close source, were introduced in large numbers, including unmodified materials, and used in percussion activities and in a wide variety of reduction strategies. A number of volcanic products were subject to outward fluxes to other parts of the paleolandscape. In contrast, quartzite rocks were introduced in smaller numbers and might have been subject to a significantly more intense exploitation. The intra-site spatial analysis has shown that specialized areas cannot be identified, unmodified materials are not randomly distributed, percussion and knapping categories do not spatially overlap, while bipolar specimens show some sort of spatial correlation with percussion activities."
https://openalex.org/W3180146276,"The human endometrium undergoes cycle-dependent changes and is only receptive to an implanting blastocyst within a narrow window of 2-4 days in the mid-secretory phase. Such functional changes require delicate interplay between a diversity of factors including cytokines and signaling pathways. The Notch signaling pathway members are expressed in human endometrium. We have previously demonstrated that Notch ligand Jagged1 (JAG1) localizes in the endometrial luminal epithelium (LE) and is abnormally reduced in infertile women during receptivity. However, the functional consequences of reduced JAG1 production on endometrial receptivity to implantation of the blastocyst are unknown. This study aimed to determine the role of JAG1 in regulating endometrial receptivity in humans and mice. Knockdown of JAG1 in both primary human endometrial epithelial cells and Ishikawa cells significantly reduced their adhesive capacity to HTR8/SVneo (trophoblast cell line) spheroids. We confirmed that in human endometrial epithelial cells, JAG1 interacted with Notch Receptor 3 (NOTCH3) and knockdown of JAG1 significantly reduced the expression of Notch signaling downstream target HEY1 and classical receptivity markers. Knockdown of Jag1 in mouse LE significantly impaired blastocyst implantation. We identified ten genes (related to tight junction, infertility, and cell adhesion) that were differentially expressed by Jag1 knockdown in LE in mice. Further analysis of the tight junction family members in both species revealed that JAG1 altered the expression of tight junction components only in mice. Together, our data demonstrated that JAG1 altered endometrial epithelial cell adhesive capacity and regulated endometrial receptivity in both humans and mice likely via different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3179542945,"Spheroids encapsulated within alginate capsules are emerging as suitable in vitro tools to investigate the impact of mechanical forces on tumor growth since the internal tumor pressure can be retrieved from the deformation of the capsule. Here we focus on the particular case of Cellular Capsule Technology (CCT). We show in this contribution that a modeling approach accounting for the triphasic nature of the spheroid (extracellular matrix, tumor cells and interstitial fluid) offers a new perspective of analysis revealing that the pressure retrieved experimentally cannot be interpreted as a direct picture of the pressure sustained by the tumor cells and, as such, cannot therefore be used to quantify the critical pressure which induces stress-induced phenotype switch in tumor cells. The proposed multiphase reactive poro-mechanical model was cross-validated. Parameter sensitivity analyses on the digital twin revealed that the main parameters determining the encapsulated growth configuration are different from those driving growth in free condition, confirming that radically different phenomena are at play. Results reported in this contribution support the idea that multiphase reactive poro-mechanics is an exceptional theoretical framework to attain an in-depth understanding of CCT experiments, to confirm their hypotheses and to further improve their design."
https://openalex.org/W3178271651,"The human apolipoprotein L gene family encodes the apolipoprotein L1–6 (APOL1–6) proteins, which are effectors of the innate immune response to viruses, bacteria and protozoan parasites. Due to a high degree of similarity between APOL proteins, it is often assumed that they have similar functions to APOL1, which forms cation channels in planar lipid bilayers and membranes resulting in cytolytic activity. However, the channel properties of the remaining APOL proteins have not been reported. Here, we used transient overexpression and a planar lipid bilayer system to study the function of APOL proteins. By measuring lactate dehydrogenase release, we found that APOL1, APOL3, and APOL6 were cytolytic, whereas APOL2, APOL4, and APOL5 were not. Cells expressing APOL1 or APOL3, but not APOL6, developed a distinctive swollen morphology. In planar lipid bilayers, recombinant APOL1 and APOL2 required an acidic environment for the insertion of each protein into the membrane bilayer to form an ion conductance channel. In contrast, recombinant APOL3, APOL4, and APOL5 readily inserted into bilayers to form ion conductance at neutral pH, but required a positive voltage on the side of insertion. Despite these differences in membrane insertion properties, the ion conductances formed by APOL1-4 were similarly pH-dependent and cation-selective, consistent with conservation of the pore-lining region in each protein. Thus, despite structural conservation, the APOL proteins are functionally different. We propose that these proteins interact with different membranes and under different voltage and pH conditions within a cell to effect innate immunity to different microbial pathogens.

APOL1 is a cation channel forming protein that inserts into lipid bilayers at acidic pH and forms a closed-state ion channel. These channels are gated by pH, such that they open upon pH neutralization and allow the flux of cations across the bilayer (13Thomson R. Finkelstein A.

Therefore, according to the proposed model of trypanosome lysis, HDL is first endocytosed into endosomes where APOL1 inserts into the endosomal membrane at acidic pH to form a closed ion channel. During membrane recycling, the membrane-inserted APOL1 ion channel reaches the plasma membrane where it is exposed to neutral pH (extracellular milieu), allowing for APOL1 ion channel opening. This in turn causes an ionic imbalance, followed by osmotic swelling and lysis of the parasite (13Thomson R. Finkelstein A.

To account for these data, a dose-dependent gain-of-function model of cytotoxicity has been proposed. According to this model, APOL1 is capable of insertion into the membranes of acidic Golgi and/or secretory vesicles during transit through the secretory pathway, allowing for the opening of APOL1 cation channels in the plasma membrane of human cells. Increases in expression (e.g., overexpression or upregulation by interferon) and increased channel-forming propensity (in the case of renal-risk variants) allows for increased channel formation and therefore greater cation influx and cytotoxicity (19Giovinazzo J.A.

Little is known about the ion-channel properties of the other APOL family proteins, although recombinant APOL3 was recently reported to produce an ion flux in artificial lipid bilayers (22Uzureau S.

In addition, APOL genes show signatures of positive selection, providing additional evidence for their role in innate immunity (4Smith E.E. Malik H.S.

However, until now, there has been no reported attempt to characterize and compare the basic cellular and biochemical functions of the APOL proteins. In order to understand the function of these proteins, we compared the cytotoxic effects of APOL proteins in human cells and their ability to generate an ion conductance in planar lipid bilayers. Of the six human APOL genes (Fig. 1A), APOL1 is the most studied; the APOL1 protein is known for its ability to kill some Trypanosomatids and for its association with chronic kidney disease in humans (8Shiflett A.M. Bishop J.R. Pahwa A. Hajduk S.L. Human high density lipoproteins are platforms for the assembly of multi-component innate immune complexes.J. Biol.

Here, we investigated the function of other human APOL proteins using APOL1 as a template. Using a comparative analysis of human, baboon, and synthetic APOL1 mutants, Schaub et al. (27Schaub C. Verdi J. Lee P. Terra N. Limon G. Raper J. Thomson R. Cation channel conductance and pH gating of the innate immunity factor APOL1 is governed by pore lining residues within the C-terminal domain.J.

The first two transmembrane domains are important for pH-dependent insertion into target membranes (membrane-insertion domain; MID), whereas the fourth transmembrane domain (pore-lining region; PLR) is important for pH-dependent ion-channel gating and cation versus anion selectivity of the channel (27Schaub C.

We used transmembrane prediction servers and comparison with APOL1 to annotate the domain structures of APOL1-6 (2Duchateau P.N. Pullinger C.R. Cho M.H. Eng C. Kane J.P.

Chem. 2020; 295: 13138-13149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We found a high degree of structural similarity among all APOL proteins, with APOL1 through APOL4 more similar than APOL5 and APOL6 (Fig. 1B). Notably, APOL1 has an extra putative transmembrane domain (257–273) that was not predicted in the case of any other APOL protein (Figs. 1B and S1). Likewise, APOL6 has a unique predicted transmembrane structure at the C-terminal end of the protein (Figs. 1B and S1). Only APOL1 and APOL4 have isoforms with a predicted signal peptide sequence (Fig. S2). However, conservation of the MID and PLR transmembrane domains in all APOL proteins suggests functional similarity. In order to investigate the potential cytotoxic functions of APOL1-6, we first generated expression constructs to provide an Myc-tag at the N-terminus of each protein (Fig. S2), or in the case of APOL1 and APOL4, just C-terminal of the reported signal peptide cleavage site (3Duchateau P.N. Pullinger C.R. Orellana R.E. Kunitake S.T. Naya-Vigne J. O'Connor P.M. Malloy M.J. Kane J.P. Apolipoprotein L, a new human high density lipoprotein apolipoprotein expressed by the pancreas.

In the transient transfection mouse model transfected by hydrodynamic gene delivery, the N-terminally tagged APOL1 protected against African trypanosome T. brucei brucei infection similar to wild-type APOL1 (Fig. 2A). Importantly, the N-terminally tagged APOLs functioned similarly to untagged APOL proteins when produced in human HEK293 cells and assayed for cytotoxicity (Fig. 2B). In the overexpressing cells, we observed significant release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by cells expressing APOL1, APOL3, and APOL6 at 24 h posttransfection when there is peak production of the proteins (Fig. 2, B–D). Although we saw marked differences in the cellular abundance of different APOL proteins (Fig. 2D), these differences could not fully account for the divergent levels of cytotoxicity observed (Fig. 2C). For example, the amount of APOL2 protein was higher than all other APOLs, yet no cytotoxicity was observed, and the APOL6 level was as low as APOL4, yet significant LDH release was measured in the case of APOL6, but not APOL4 (Fig. 2, C and D). Under a light microscope, the cells producing APOL1 and APOL3 (Myc:APOL1 and Myc:APOL3) appeared swollen at 24 h (Fig. S3), whereas cells producing APOL6 or Myc:APOL6 did not visibly swell (Fig. S3). Consistent with the LDH assay results, there were fewer cells visible when APOL1, APOL3, and APOL6 were being expressed compared with APOL2, APOL4, and APOL5 (Figs. 2, B and C and S3). Thus, our results suggest that APOL1, APOL3, and APOL6 are cytotoxic when overexpressed in HEK293 cells but APOL2, APOL4, and APOL5 are not. In addition to the most abundant APOL1 isoform (variant v.A also called v.1) used above, there exists a minor splice variant (v.C also called v.3) that lacks a strong signal peptide prediction using SignalP-5.0 software (Figs. 3A and S2B) (28Almagro Armenteros J.J. Tsirigos K.D. Sønderby C.K. Petersen T.N. Winther O. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. SignalP 5.0 improves signal peptide predictions using deep neural networks.Nat.

Exon 4-encoded sequence is a major determinant of cytotoxicity of apolipoprotein L1.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2015; 309: C22-C37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To test the effect of the APOL1 signal peptide, we expressed the two isoforms in HEK293 cells. LDH release from cells producing APOL1 v.3 was reduced compared with APOL1 v.1 and was similar to those cells producing APOL2 that is noncytotoxic to the transfected cells (Fig. 3B). This occurred despite similar protein levels between the two APOL1 isoforms (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the signal peptide is required for significant cytotoxicity. APOL4 is reported to have two isoforms—isoform 2 (v.2), which has a weak predicted signal peptide; and isoform 1 (v.1), which lacks any hint of an N-terminal signal peptide (Figs. 3A and S2B). Therefore, we tested the cytotoxicity of these naturally occurring APOL4 isotypes. Cells producing either of these two APOL4 isoforms showed very low LDH release (Fig. 3, B and C) and hence no measurable cytotoxicity. We conclude that APOL1, but not APOL4 cytotoxicity, was affected by the presence of a signal peptide when overexpressed in HEK293 cells. Taken together, our results show that APOL1, APOL3, and APOL6 are cytotoxic when overexpressed in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, cells producing APOL1 and APOL3 were morphologically distinct from cells producing APOL6. To determine if these differences in cytotoxicity between APOLs could be related to differences in ion-channel forming properties, we tested recombinant APOL proteins (Fig. 4) for their ability to generate an ion conductance in artificial planar lipid bilayers. APOL1, the most studied of all the APOLs, is known to insert into planar lipid bilayers and form a closed ion channel, when the pH on the cis side (i.e., the side the APOL is added to the chamber) is acidic (mimicking the trypanosome endocytic compartment or the secretory pathway of human cells including podocytes) and the pH on the trans side (the side opposite to where APOL is added) is neutral (mimicking the cytoplasmic compartment). This closed channel subsequently opens to allow the conductance of cations when the cis pH is neutralized (mimicking the extracellular side of the plasma membrane), while keeping the trans (cytoplasmic face) pH neutral (13Thomson R. Finkelstein A. Human trypanolytic factor APOL1 forms pH-gated cation-selective channels in planar lipid bilayers: Relevance to trypanosome lysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We propose that other APOL proteins would form ion channels, because their domain structures are largely conserved, including the transmembrane domains (Fig. 1B). To investigate this, we compared the amino acids of the conserved first and second transmembrane regions, which together form the membrane-insertion domain (MID) (Fig. 5) (27Schaub C. Verdi J. Lee P. Terra N. Limon G. Raper J. Thomson R. Cation channel conductance and pH gating of the innate immunity factor APOL1 is governed by pore lining residues within the C-terminal domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 13138-13149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As previously reported, negatively charged glutamic acid residues in the APOL1 MID play an important role in pH-dependent channel formation by APOL1 in planar lipid bilayers, suggesting that they must be protonated/neutralized at acidic pH to allow membrane insertion and channel formation to occur (13Thomson R. Finkelstein A. Human trypanolytic factor APOL1 forms pH-gated cation-selective channels in planar lipid bilayers: Relevance to trypanosome lysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015; 112: 2894-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The amino acid alignment shows that other than APOL1, only APOL2 shares the negatively charged amino acid residues corresponding to APOL1 E201 and E209, whereas the other APOLs completely lack charged amino acid residues in the MID (Fig. 5). Utilizing the planar lipid bilayer setup, with alteration of the cis pH (Fig. 6A), we found that APOL2, like APOL1, inserted into lipid bilayers at acidic pH 5.6 (step 5), but not at neutral cis pH, as detected by a relatively small change in bilayer ion conductance at pH 5.6 (Fig. 6, B and C). This APOL2-induced ion conductance increased by 15-fold after subsequent neutralization of cis compartment with KOH compared with a 100-fold increase with APOL1 (Fig. 6, B and C) (13Thomson R.

https://openalex.org/W3179791534,"Introduction In low and middle-income countries, the manually operated municipal waste collection system prominently depended on the performance of waste collectors (WC). Most of the literature has focused on the impact of waste collection tasks on WCs’ physical health, while little was known about the psychological effects of work-related stress. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of psychological stress and related factors among waste collectors in Hanoi, Vietnam. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 802 WCs in 2017. The questionnaire included the 7-item Stress component of the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, and questions on demographics and work conditions. Descriptive and multivariate logistics regression analyses were conducted to examine the factors related to psychological stress among WCs. Results Results showed that 13.4% of WCs reported stress symptoms; among them, 3.3% of WCs experienced severe stress. Factors related to lower odds of self-reported psychological stress included self-perceived frequent exposure to high and low temperatures in the working environment (OR = 0.51 and 0.52, respectively). Factors associated with the increased likelihood of symptoms included frequent exposure to hot/flammable objects (OR = 2.41), working a night shift in the last three months (OR = 1.82), education lever lower than high school (OR = 1.82), and having an insufficient monthly income (OR = 1.99). Conclusion The high percentage of workers with severe stress implies the need for mental health prevention and treatment for WCs who participated in this study."

Barrow, Alaska. Statistically-significant positive correlations were observed among krill population structure (proportion of juveniles and adults), the volume of Late Season Melt Water (LMW), and late-spring Chukchi Sea sea ice extent. High proportions of juvenile and adult krill were seen in years with larger volumes of LMW and greater spring sea ice extents (2006, 2009, 2012–2014) while the converse, high proportions of furcilia, were seen in years with smaller volumes of LMW and lower spring sea ice extent (2005, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2015). These different life stage, sea ice and water mass regimes represent integrated advective responses to mean fall and/or spring Chukchi Sea winds, driven by prevailing atmospheric pressure distributions in the two sets of years. In years with high proportions of juveniles and adults, late-spring and preceding-fall winds were weak and variable while in years with high proportions of furcilia, late-spring and preceding-fall winds were strong, easterly and consistent. The interaction of krill life history with yearly differences in the northward transports of krill and water masses along with sea ice retreat determines the population structure of late-summer krill populations in the DBO5 region near Pt. Barrow. Years with higher proportions of mature krill may provide larger prey to the Pt. Barrow area bowhead whale prey hotspot. The characteristics of prey near Pt. Barrow is dependent on krill abundance and size, large-scale environmental forcing, and interannual variability in recruitment success of krill in the Bering Sea."
https://openalex.org/W3180589967,"Background There is conflicting evidence whether limb amputation (LA) disproportionately affects indigenous populations. To better understand this disparity, we compared the LA incidence rate between First Nations persons registered under the Indian Act of Canada (RI) and the general population (GP) in Saskatchewan. Methods We used Saskatchewan’s retrospective administrative data containing hospital discharge LA cases, demographic characteristics (age and sex), and residents population reported in the database stratified by RI and GP from 2006–2019. The LA cases for each stratified group were first disaggregated into three broad categories: overall LA (all reported LA), primary LA (first reported LA), and subsequent LA (revision or contralateral LA), with each category further split into the level of amputation defined as major amputation (through/above the ankle/wrist joint) and minor amputation (below the ankle/wrist joint). LA rates were calculated using LA cases as the numerator and resident population as the denominator. Joinpoint and negative binomial regressions were performed to explore the trends further. Results Overall, there were 1347 RI and 4520 GP LA cases reported in Saskatchewan from 2006–2019. Primary LA made up approximately 64.5% (869) of RI and 74.5% (3369) of GP cases, while subsequent LA constituted 35.5% (478) of RI and 25.5% (1151) of GP cases. The average age-adjusted LA rate was 153.9 ± 17.3 per 100,000 in the RI cohort and 31.1 ± 2.3 per 100,000 in the GP cohort. Overall and primary LA rates for the GP Group declined 0.7% and 1.0%, while subsequent LA increased 0.1%. An increased LA rate for all categories (overall 4.9%, primary 5.1%, and subsequent 4.6%) was identified in the RI group. Overall, minor and major LA increased by 6.2% and 3.3%, respectively, in the RI group compared to a 0.8% rise in minor LA and a 6.3% decline in major LA in the GP group. RI females and males were 1.98–1.66 times higher risk of LA than their GP counterparts likewise, RI aged 0–49 years and 50+ years were 2.04–5.33 times higher risk of LA than their GP cohort. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was the most prevalent amputation predisposing factor in both groups with 81.5% of RI and 54.1% of GP diagnosed with DM. Also, the highest proportion of LA was found in the lowest income quintile for both groups (68.7% for RI and 45.3% for GP). Conclusion Saskatchewan’s indigenous individuals, specifically First Nations persons registered under the Indian Act of Canada, experience LA at a higher rate than the general population. This disparity exists for all variables examined, including overall, primary, and subsequent LA rates, level of amputation, sex, and age. Amplification of the disparities will continue if the rates of change maintain their current trajectories. These results underscore the need for a better understanding of underlying causes to develop a targeted intervention in these groups."

https://openalex.org/W3180078295,"Background Health and social care students are expected to apply evidence-based practice (EBP). An innovative mobile application, EBPsteps , was developed to support learning EBP. Aim The aim of this study was to explore health and social care students’ experiences of learning about EBP using the mobile application EBPsteps during their clinical placements. Methods An interpretive description approach guided the exploration of student experiences. Four focus groups were conducted with a convenience sample of students from three undergraduate degree programs: occupational therapy, physical therapy, and social education. The constant comparison method was used to categorize and compare the qualitative data. Results Three integrated themes were generated: ""triggers for EBP"", ""barriers to EBP"", and ""design matters"". Information needs, academic requirements, and encouragement from clinical instructors triggered the students to use EBPsteps . Lack of EBP knowledge, lack of academic demand, and lack of emphasis on EBP in clinical placement were barriers to using EBPsteps . Design issues mattered, as use of the app was motivated by design features such as the opportunity to practice EBP in one place and taking notes in a digital notebook. The use of the app was hindered by anticipation that the use of phones during clinical placements would be viewed negatively by others and by specific design features, such as unfamiliar icons. Conclusions The students perceived the EBPsteps app as a relevant tool for learning EBP, although they also suggested specific changes to the design of the app. Requirements must be embedded in the curriculum to ensure that the app is used. Our findings bring important information to developing and implementing mobile applications as a teaching method in health and social care educations."
https://openalex.org/W3180735877,"Fall armyworm (FAW; Spodoptera frugiperda ), an exotic moth which recently invaded Africa, is a highly destructive pest of cereals especially maize a highly valued staple crop in Nigeria. The use of natural enemies such as predators or parasitoids for FAW control is more economically viable and environmentally safer than currently recommended synthetic insecticides. Natural enemies to combat the pest have not yet been reported in Nigeria. An exploration for the pests’ natural enemies was undertaken by collecting FAW eggs and larvae from maize fields. These were reared in the laboratory for emergence, identification and efficacy as natural enemies. This yielded Euplectrus laphygmae (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae); Telenomus remus (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) and Trombidium sp. (Acari.: Trombidiidae). Cotesia or Apanteles spp. were inferred to occur since Stictopisthus sp.

Species of yet-to-be identified predators were also observed in various niches of maize plants. A positive relationship was found between FAW instar and the number of E . laphygmae eggs/instar ranging, on average, from 1.5 on second instar to 5.5 on fourth instars hosts. Parasitism rate of T . remus on FAW eggs was 100%. Parasitic mite infestation resulted in increasing paleness, reduced feeding, growth and movement as well as death of FAW 1 st instars. Thus, the occurrence of FAW natural enemies in Nigeria calls for advocacy campaign to incorporate their use into integrated pest management strategies that attract and allow natural enemies to thrive for FAW management."
https://openalex.org/W3182873937,"This study investigates individual preferences for work arrangements in a discrete choice experiment. Based on sociological and economic literature, we identified six essential job attributes—earnings, job security, training opportunities, scheduling flexibility, prestige of the company, and gender composition of the work team—and mapped these into hypothetical job offers. Out of three job offers, with different specifications in the respective job attributes, respondents had to choose the offer they considered as most attractive. In 2017, we implemented our choice experiment in two large-scale surveys conducted in two countries: Germany (N = 2,659) and the Netherlands (N = 2,678). Our analyses revealed that respondents considered all six job attributes in their decision process but had different priorities for each. Moreover, we found gendered preferences. Women preferred scheduling flexibility and a company with a good reputation, whereas men preferred jobs with high earnings and a permanent contract. Despite different national labor market regulations, different target populations, and different sampling strategies for the two surveys, job preferences for German and Dutch respondents were largely parallel."
https://openalex.org/W3170431482,"When estimating the influence of sentence complexity on reading, researchers typically opt for one of two main approaches: Measuring syntactic complexity (SC) or transitional probability (TP). Comparisons of the predictive power of both approaches have yielded mixed results. To address this inconsistency, we conducted a self-paced reading experiment. Participants read sentences of varying syntactic complexity. From two alternatives, we selected the set of SC and TP measures, respectively, that provided the best fit to the self-paced reading data. We then compared the contributions of the SC and TP measures to self-paced reading times when entered into the same model. Our results showed that while both measures explained significant portions of variance in reading times (over and above control variables: word/sentence length, word frequency and word position) when included in independent models, their contributions changed drastically when SC and TP were entered into the same model. Specifically, we only observed significant effects of TP. We conclude that in our experiment the control variables explained the bulk of variance. When comparing the small effects of SC and TP, the effects of TP appear to be more robust."

In this study, the X-ray structure of wild-type HadA (HadAWT) co-complexed with reduced FAD (FADH–) and 4-nitrophenol (4NP) (HadAWT−FADH–−4NP) was solved at 2.3-Å resolution, providing the first full package (with flavin and substrate bound) structure of a monooxygenase of this type. Residues Arg101, Gln158, Arg161, Thr193, Asp254, Arg233, and Arg439 constitute a flavin-binding pocket, whereas the 4NP-binding pocket contains the aromatic side chain of Phe206, which provides π-π stacking and also is a part of the hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe155, Phe286, Thr449, and Leu457. Based on site-directed mutagenesis and stopped-flow experiments, Thr193, Asp254, and His290 are important for C4a-hydroperoxyflavin formation with His290, also serving as a catalytic base for hydroxylation. We also identified a novel structural motif of quadruple π-stacking (π-π-π-π) provided by two 4NP and two Phe441 from two subunits. This motif promotes 4NP binding in a nonproductive dead-end complex, which prevents C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD formation when HadA is premixed with aromatic substrates.

Halogenated phenols (HPs) and nitrophenol (NP) are persistent pollutants resulting from anthropogenic activities including the use of agro- and household chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, and flame retardants. Their accumulation in the environment can pose a hazard to human health, with toxic effects ranging from causing chronic diseases to acute death (1Olaniran A.O. Igbinosa E.O. Chlorophenols and other related derivatives of environmental concern: Properties, distribution and microbial degradation processes.Chemosphere. 2011; 83: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Through natural evolution, microbes have developed enzymes and metabolic pathways to combat against these chemicals by degrading them into common metabolites, which can then be used as cellular energy sources (2Pimviriyakul P.

The had pathway from Ralstonia pickettii is one of the most well-known pathways for biodegrading HPs and NP. It contains several enzymatic reactions catabolizing pesticides such as 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol to generate benzoquinone (BQ) derivatives, which can be assimilated into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (4Hatta T.

HadA can detoxify a wide range of toxicants, and its ability to convert monosubstituted HPs and NP to a valuable compound such as D-luciferin has recently been shown (9Watthaisong P. Pongpamorn P. Pimviriyakul P. Maenpuen S. Ohmiya Y. Chaiyen P. A chemo-enzymatic cascade for the smart detection of nitro- and halogenated phenols.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Rather than allowing HPs or NP to be dissipated into the open environment, thereby creating toxic ecological effects, a proper waste collection and detoxification procedure can be performed using HadA to detoxify and convert them to valuable compounds. HadA belongs to the class D two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases, which use reduced FAD (FADH–) as a substrate (7Pimviriyakul P. Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P.

Kinetic mechanisms of wild-type HadA (HadAWT) using 4-chlorophenol (4CP), 4-bromophenol, 4-iodophenol, 4-fluorophenol, 4-nitrophenol (4NP), and phenol as substrates have shown that a binary complex of HadA-FADH– is the first species to form before reacting with O2 to form a C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD intermediate (Fig. 1) (7Pimviriyakul P. Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Kinetic mechanism of the dechlorinating flavin-dependent monooxygenase HadA.J. Biol.

A substrate such as 4CP then binds and receives a terminal –OH group (electrophile) from the C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD, which is incorporated into the C4 position of 4CP (nucleophile) via an electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism, resulting in a C4a-hydroxy-FAD intermediate and the hydroxylated product. Next, a halide or nitro group is eliminated to form benzoquinone as a final product while C4a-hydroxy-FAD is dehydrated to form oxidized FAD before the product is released from HadA to complete the catalytic cycle. The quantitative structure–activity relationship analysis revealed that the overall reaction of HadA is controlled by the ability of the substrate to be deprotonated because the rate constants of HadA reactions with substrates having different substituents at the 4-position depend directly on the pKa values of the compounds (8Pimviriyakul P. Surawatanawong P. Chaiyen P. Oxidative dehalogenation and denitration by a flavin-dependent monooxygenase is controlled by substrate deprotonation.Chem.

Despite its potential use in biodetoxification and known reaction mechanisms, the X-ray crystallographic structures of HadA or related homologs in complex with flavin and aromatic substrates have not been reported. Only structures of apo-HadAWT and its homologs including apo-ReTcpA from Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 and apo-TftD from Burkhodelria cepacia AC1100 without bound ligand were reported (15Hayes R.P.

The reaction of HadA also has a side pathway that impedes the application of this enzyme in real and scalable usage. HadAWT displays strong substrate inhibition by the preformed HadAWT–4CP complex or “dead-end complex,” which prevents formation of C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD and thus inactivates the overall reaction (Fig. 1) (7Pimviriyakul P. Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Kinetic mechanism of the dechlorinating flavin-dependent monooxygenase HadA.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 4818-4832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We note that substrate inhibition by formation of a dead-end complex is also found in other two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases such as bacterial luciferase (class C) (18Abu-Soud H.M.

Biochem. 2007; 142: 539-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, no structural features that can promote substrate inhibition in these enzymes are known. This phenomenon limits the enzyme usage in biocatalysis because the flavin and substrate need to bind to the enzyme in a strict sequential order to avoid inhibition. This can be achieved under low substrate concentrations because the rate of flavin binding is generally faster. However, under high substrate concentrations, the rate of substrate binding (bimolecular reaction), which is dependent on the concentration, can be faster than the flavin binding. This can cause the turnovers to cease (7Pimviriyakul P. Thotsaporn K. Sucharitakul J. Chaiyen P. Kinetic mechanism of the dechlorinating flavin-dependent monooxygenase HadA.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 4818-4832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, molecular insights into the mode of substrate inhibition gained by structural analysis of HadA would be useful for shedding light on the mechanisms underlying catalysis and inhibition and would allow improvement in applications of HadA and other two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases in general. In this work, we present the crystal structures of a ternary complex of HadAWT and FADH– and 4-nitrophenol (HadAWT–FADH––4NP), representing the first comprehensive ligand-bound structure of dehalogenating/denitrating flavin-dependent monooxygenases. The binding pocket of substrates 4NP and FADH– was identified, and the interactions of the substrates with the surrounding and key catalytic residues that enable HadA catalysis were determined by site-directed mutagenesis, stopped-flow experiments, and product analysis. Moreover, we found rigid quadruple π-stacking (π-π-π-π) interactions between the aromatic moieties of the two bound 4NP molecules and the two aromatic side chains of Phe441 from two subunits at the dimer interface. This unusual π-π-π-π interaction explains the root cause of substrate inhibition by forming a dead-end complex. We verified this hypothesis by disrupting the quadruple π-stacking interaction by site-directed mutagenesis of Phe441. The results indeed showed that the substrate inhibition was alleviated in the HadAPhe441Val and HadAPhe441Leu variants. This is the first time that the substrate inhibition mechanism in flavin-dependent monooxygenases can be explained structurally. The outcome of this work should help improve future applications of flavin-dependent monooxygenases in general. In order to gain structural and mechanistic insights into HadA, we cocrystallized the enzyme with FADH– and 4NP to obtain the first ternary structure of HadAWT−FADH–−4NP at a 2.3-Å resolution. Data and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. The HadAWT−FADH–−4NP ternary complex (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code: 7E8P) adopts a common structural fold of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase flavoenzyme family with two dimers associated to form a tetramer (Fig. 2A), similar to that of apo-HadAWT (PDB code: 6JHM) (RMSD of 0.439) previously reported (Fig. S1) (16Pongpamorn P. Watthaisong P. Pimviriyakul P. Jaruwat A. Lawan N. Chitnumsub P. Chaiyen P. Identification of a hotspot residue for improving the thermostability of a flavin-dependent monooxygenase.Chembiochem. 2019; 20: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Each protomer is composed of three domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1–146), the β-sheet domain (residues 147–275), and the C-terminal domain (residues 276–517) (Fig. 2B). The co-complex with FADH– and 4NP allowed identification of four binding sites for ligands in which strong electron densities could be observed for all four FADH– molecules, whereas only one 4NP molecule could be clearly seen in the expected pocket of subunit A (Fig. 2B, Inset). Of interest, two 4NP molecules were found to locate to the dimer interface between subunits C and D. The key difference between the HadAWT−FADH–−4NP structure reported here and the previously reported apo-HadAWT structure is the loop of residues 157 to 170, which assumes a distinct structure in the ternary complex, whereas it is disordered in the apo-HadAWT. In contrast, the C-terminal helix α19, which can be clearly observed in the apo-HadAWT, is disordered in the ternary complex (Figs. S1 and S2).Table 1Summary of crystallographic data of HadA complexesComplexHadAWT–FADH––4NPHadAPhe441Val–FADH––4NPWavelength (Å)1.541.54Space groupP212121P212121Unit cell parametersa,b,c (Å)α,β,γ (o)a = 97.8,b = 161.9,c = 168.6,α,β,γ = 90a = 97.8,b = 161.6,c = 168.6,α,β,γ = 90Molecules in asymmetric unit44Resolution (Å)20.74–2.30 (2.40–2.30)21.10–2.30 (2.40–2.30)No. of measured reflections586,953635,201No. of unique reflections118,305118,765Redundancy4.9 (3.4)5.3 (4.0)Completeness (%)99.1 (98.4)99.6 (98.8)<I/σ(I)>10.2 (2.8)19.4 (6.7)Rmerge (%)10.7 (34.2)6.2 (16.1)Wilson B factor (Å2)17.513.7Rfactor/Rfree (%)20.71/26.2516.63/20.99Average B-factor (Å2)20.915.1R.m.s. bond deviation (Å)0.010.01R.m.s. angle deviation (o)1.671.65Favored, Allowed, Outliers90.6, 9.1, 0.291.4, 8.4, 0.2PDB code7E8P7E8Q Open table in a new tab FADH– binds to each subunit in a tabular-shaped pocket, created by the N-terminal and β-sheet domains, and extends to the C-terminal domain. The adenosine moiety protrudes out toward the dimer interface and is stabilized by polar interactions and hydrophobic residues of the dimer (Fig. 3A). The loop of residues 157 to 170 (Fig. 2B) forms a lid to confine the bound FADH– via interactions with an adenosine diphosphate moiety. This loop is designated as the “flavin-binding loop” that was previously identified in other two-component flavin-dependent enzymes (21Deng Y. Faivre B. Back O. Lombard M. Pecqueur L. Fontecave M.

Gln158 and Arg161, which are parts of the flavin-binding loop, and Arg′387 (from a neighboring subunit) anchor the diphosphate backbone via salt-bridge and hydrogen-bonding interactions. The geometry of these arginine side chains is strengthened by salt-bridge interactions with Asp156. Similar to the structure of p-hydroxyphenylacetate (4HPA) hydroxylase from Thermus thermophilus HB8 (TtHpaB-FAD-4HPA), the diphosphate moiety of the ribityl side chain of FAD is hydrogen bonded to side chains of the conserved glutamine and arginine, stabilizing the loop closure upon FADH– binding (22Kim S.H.

Therefore, this structural feature may be a universal motif specific for selectively binding FADH– in two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases. The ribose moiety of adenosine is hydrogen bonded to Arg′326 and Asp′383 in the C-terminal domain of the neighboring subunit of the dimer, whereas the adenine ring resides within the van der Waals contacts of Ile′315, Thr′317, Ile′320, Val′323, Leu′384 of the neighboring C-terminal domain and in a water tunnel of the tetrameric inner-interface. The 2D scheme for HadA–FADH– interactions in the presence of 4NP within its active site is shown in Figure 3B. The isoalloxazine ring of FADH– binds deeply at the base of the tabular pocket and interacts with residues of both subunits of the dimer (Fig. 3A). The aromatic ring of the isoalloxazine moiety makes van der Waals contacts with Ile191, Val442, Phe443, Phe446, and Arg′387 and Ile′391 of the neighboring subunit, whereas the ribityl side chain forms hydrogen bonds to the backbones of Phe446 and Asn447. The 2-carbonyl (O2) and 3-NH(H(N3)) groups of the isoalloxazine are hydrogen bonded to the amino and carboxyl backbones of Phe154 and Pro152 with distances of 2.8 and 3.1 Å, respectively, whereas the 4-carbonyl (O4) and 5-NH(H(N5)) are fixed by hydrogen bonding from side chains of Arg101 (2.7 Å) and Thr193 (3.1 Å), respectively. The position of a guanidine side chain of Arg101 is controlled by a nearby Asn447 side chain (3.0 Å). The hydroxyl group of Thr193 is 2.7 Å from the carboxyl ion of Asp254, which is salt bridged to the guanidine side chains of Arg233 and Arg439. This FADH– configuration suggests that a molecular O2 would diffuse to reach the C4a atom on the re-face to form C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD; this geometric mode of oxygen reaction is also commonly found in other two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases (27Chaiyen P. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. The enigmatic reaction of flavins with oxygen.Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The interactions contributed by Thr193 together with Asp254, Arg233, and Arg439 should be important for the flavin chemistry of HadA, as they are directly involved in the alteration of the hybridization of the isoallozaxine N5 during the reaction. To identify the functions of these residues, four HadAThr193 and two HadAAsp254 variants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (listed in Table. S1). Three HadAThr193 variants, including HadAThr193Ala, HadAThr193Val, and HadAThr193Ser, could be expressed in soluble form. In contrast, HadAThr193Cys could only be expressed in inclusion bodies. Both HadAAsp254 variants of Asp254Ala and Asp254Asn could also be expressed in soluble form. Thus, the catalytic properties of the soluble enzymes were further characterized by monitoring 4NP consumption and by performing transient kinetics studies (Experimental procedures). Results showed that HadAThr193Ala and HadAThr193Val could not utilize 4NP as a substrate (Fig. 4). Kinetic data of HadAThr193Ala and HadAThr193Val revealed that only free FADH– oxidation (Fig. S3) was observed when mixing FADH– with these enzymes, indicating impairment in their FADH– binding. These two variants did not show C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD formation as in the HadAWT (Fig. 5, A–C). For the HadAThr193Ser variant, its 4NP consumption activity was ⁓72% relative to HadAWT (Fig. 4). Kinetic traces of the HadAThr193Ser reaction with aerobic 4CP (Fig. 5D) revealed two observable phases (0.01 – 1s and 1s – 100 s) when detected at wavelength 450 nm (A450). These kinetic phases indicate oxidations of free FADH– (84%) and the HadA-bound FADH– (16%) species. A small amount of C4a-adduct formation could be observed at wavelength 380 nm (A380). Therefore, the HadAThr193Ser variant could maintain partial ability to bind FADH– but with less efficiency than HadAWT. This indicates the importance of the hydroxyl group of residue 193, which is required for interacting with H(N5) of FADH–. Therefore, we propose that the -OH group of Thr193 directly interacts with H(N5) of FADH– for binding and stabilization of FADH– and for formation of its intermediates.Figure 5Transient kinetics of HadA variants. Rapid kinetics of reactions of HadAvariant–FADH– (75 and 25 μM, respectively) mixing with an aerobic solution of 4-chlorophenol (0.5 mM 4-chlorophenol and 0.13 mM O2) using the single mixing mode of a stopped-flow apparatus. Absorption changes at wavelengths 380 nm (solid line) and 450 nm (dashed line) were monitored to observe the C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD intermediate and oxidized FAD, respectively. C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD absorbs mainly at A380, whereas oxidized FAD absorbs at both wavelengths. HadA variants are (A) HadAWT, (B) HadAThr193Ala, (C) HadAThr193Val, (D) HadAThr193Ser, (E) HadAAsp254Ala, (F) HadAAsp254Asn, (G) HadAHis290Ala, (H) HadAHis290Cys, and (I) HadAHis290Asn. Inset in (A) and (I) are spectra of the C4a-hydroperoxy-FAD intermediate detected at 10 s of reaction time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Apart from Thr193, Asp254 is also important for FADH– binding. Disruption of hydrogen bonding networks in the variants HadAAsp254Ala and HadAAsp254Asn also resulted in complete loss of 4NP consumption activity (Fig. 4). Based on kinetic data, these variants also lose FADH– binding ability because only free FADH– oxidation was observed in their reactions (Fig. 5, E and F). We propose that hydrogen bonding and salt-bridge interactions between the Thr193 side chain and neighboring residues such as Asp254, Arg233, and Arg439 may render greater negative charge on the hydroxyl group of Thr193, leading to stronger interactions with H(N5) on the si-face of the isoalloxazine ring. To analyze whether the nature of the amino acids found in the FADH–-binding pocket of the ternary complex structure of HadA is also common in other group D monooxygenases, amino acid sequences and structures of these enzymes were analyzed.

https://openalex.org/W3180401549,"Aberrant DNA methylation profiles have been implicated in numerous cardiovascular diseases; however, few studies have investigated how these epigenetic modifications contribute to stroke recurrence. The aim of this study was to identify methylation loci associated with the time to recurrent cerebro- and cardiovascular events in individuals of European and African descent. DNA methylation profiles were generated for 180 individuals from the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention clinical trial using Illumina HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip microarrays, resulting in beta values for 470,871 autosomal CpG sites. Ethnicity-stratified survival analyses were performed using Cox Proportional Hazards regression models for associations between each methylation locus and the time to recurrent stroke or composite vascular event. Results were validated in the Vall d’Hebron University Hospital cohort from Barcelona, Spain. Network analyses of the methylation loci were generated using weighted gene coexpression network analysis. Primary analysis identified four significant loci, cg04059318, ch.2.81927627R, cg03584380, and cg24875416, associated with time to recurrent stroke. Secondary analysis identified three loci, cg00076998, cg16758041, and cg02365967, associated with time to composite vascular endpoint. Locus cg03584380, which is located in an intron of ZDHHC6 , was replicated in the Vall d’Hebron University Hospital cohort. The results from this study implicate the degree of methylation at cg03584380 is associated with the time of recurrence for stroke or composite vascular events across two ethnically diverse groups. Furthermore, modules of loci were associated with clinical traits and blood biomarkers including previous number of strokes, prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, thrombomodulin, thrombin-antithrombin complex, triglyceride levels, and tissue plasminogen activator. Ultimately, these loci could serve as potential epigenetic biomarkers that could identify at-risk individuals in recurrence-prone populations."

Cerasus humilis is an important fruit species widely planted for soil and water conservation in northern China due to its strong tolerance to drought and salinity stresses. In this study, a total of 170 LecRLK family genes (125 G-types, 43 L-types and 2 C-types) were identified in the newly released whole-genome sequences of C . humilis . Furthermore, nine representative LecRLK genes in young plants of C . humilis under varying drought and salinity stresses were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. Our systematic comparative analyses revealed the active participation of these nine LecRLK genes in the salt and drought stress responses of C . humilis . The results from our study have provided a solid foundation for future functional verification of these LecRLK family genes and will likely help facilitate the more rapid and effective development of new stress resistant Cerasus humilis cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W3177508108,"People use numerous metaphors to describe God. God is seen as a bearded man, light, and love. Based on metaphor theories, the metaphors people use to refer to God reflect how people think about God and could, in turn, reflect their worldview. However, little work has explored the common metaphors for God. This was the purpose of the current investigation. Four trained raters coded open-ended responses from predominantly Christian U.S. undergraduates (N = 2,923) describing God for the presence or absence of numerous metaphoric categories. We then assessed the frequency of each of the metaphor categories. We identified 16 metaphor categories that were present in more than 1% of the responses. The top categories were “GOD IS POWER,” “GOD IS HUMAN,” and “GOD IS MALE.” These findings were similar across religious affiliations. We attempted to support our coding analysis using top-down and bottom-up automated language analysis. Results from these analyses provided added confidence to our conclusions. We discuss the implications of our findings and the potential for future studies investigating important psychological and behavioral outcomes of using different metaphors for God."

https://openalex.org/W3177800527,"Based on the data of China’s outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) in energy sector to 133 countries from 2005 to 2014, this paper uses a gravity model to investigate the impact of “intimate” relations on China’s OFDI locations in energy sector. We find that the “intimate” relations have significant effects on China’s OFDI locations in energy sector, namely: bilateral senior leaders’ visits, institutional distance, genetic distance, and immigration. Holding other factors fixed, for each one more bilateral senior leaders’ visit between China and the host country, China’s OFDI in energy sector for the host country will increase by 5.44%. If the genetic distance from China and host country increases by 1%, China’s OFDI in energy sector will fall by 1.69%. For every 1% increase in the institutional distance between China and host country, China’s energy OFDI will decrease by 1.09%. For every 1% increase in a country’s immigration to China, China’s energy OFDI will increase by 0.46%. Further, after distinguishing developed and developing countries, we find that compared with developed countries, “intimate” relations have greater impacts on China’s energy OFDI in developing countries. Finally, based on the dominance analysis, considering China’s “intimate” relations with countries along the “Belt and Road” and current locations of China’s OFDI, we find that China should further expand energy investment in countries along the “Belt and Road”."
https://openalex.org/W3179186363,"The present pre-registration aims to investigate the role of language as a dimension of social categorization. Our critical aim is to investigate whether language can be used as a dimension of social categorization even when the languages coexist within the same sociolinguistic group, as is the case in bilingual communities where two languages are used in daily social interactions. We will use the memory confusion paradigm (also known as the Who said what? task). In the first part of the task, i.e. encoding, participants will be presented with a face (i.e. speaker) and will listen to an auditory sentence. Two languages will be used, with half of the faces always associated with one language and the other half with the other language. In the second phase, i.e. recognition, all the faces will be presented on the screen and participants will decide which face uttered which sentence in the encoding phase. Based on previous literature, we expect that participants will be more likely to confuse faces from within the same language category than from the other language category. Participants will be bilingual individuals of two bilingual communities, the Basque Country (Spain) and Veneto (Italy). The two languages of these communities will be used, Spanish and Basque (Study 1), and Italian and Venetian dialect (Study 2). Furthermore, we will explore whether the amount of daily exposure to the two languages modulates the effect of language as a social categorization cue. This research will allow us to test whether bilingual people use language to categorize individuals belonging to the same sociolinguistic community based on the language these individuals are speaking. Our findings may have relevant political and social implications for linguistic policies in bilingual communities."
https://openalex.org/W3179240167,"The Nemegt Formation of the Gobi Desert of Mongolia has produced one of the most abundant and diverse oviraptorosaur records globally. However, the caenagnathid component of this fauna remains poorly known. Two caenagnathid taxa are currently recognized from the Nemegt Formation: Elmisaurus rarus and Nomingia gobiensis . Because these taxa are known from mostly non-overlapping material, there are concerns that they could represent the same animal. A partial, weathered caenagnathid skeleton discovered adjacent to the holotype quarry of Nomingia gobiensis is referable to Elmisaurus rarus , revealing more of the morphology of the cranium, mandible, pectoral girdle, and pubis. Despite metatarsals clearly exhibiting autapomorphies of Elmisaurus rarus , overlapping elements are identical to those of Nomingia gobiensis , and add to a growing body of evidence that these taxa represent a single morphotype. In the absence of any positive evidence for two caenagnathid taxa in the Nemegt Formation, Nomingia gobiensis is best regarded as a junior synonym of Elmisaurus rarus . Low caenagnathid diversity in the Nemegt Formation may reflect broader coexistence patterns with other oviraptorosaur families, particularly oviraptorids. In contrast to North America, competition with the exceptionally diverse oviraptorids may have restricted caenagnathids to marginal roles in Late Cretaceous Asian ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3180013876,"Background This study aims to understand the key factors influencing guardians’ decisions when purchasing spectacles for their children in semi-urban and urban areas of Cross River State, Nigeria, where a spectacle cross-subsidisation scheme will be implemented. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among all consecutive guardians visiting the Calabar (urban), Ugep, Ikom and Ogoja (semi-urban) public eye clinics in Cross River State, southern Nigeria, from August 1 to October 31 2019, and whose children had significant refractive errors (myopia ≤-0.50D, hyperopia ≥1.50D, astigmatism &gt;0.75D) and received spectacles. Guardians were interviewed using a questionnaire which included i) close-ended questions on reasons guardians choose to purchase spectacles for their children in eye clinics, ii) guardians’ perceptions of the quality and design of children’s current spectacle, iii) factors most heavily influencing their choice of spectacles for children, and iv) open-ended questions to seek guardians’ suggestions on how to improve the current spectacle range. Results All 137 eligible guardians (67.2% women [n = 92]) who visited the selected eye clinics participated in the study (response rate = 100%), with 109 (79.6%) from semi-urban and 28 (20.4%) attending urban clinics. Guardians from both urban and semi-urban clinics prioritised frame design, quality, and material as the main factors affecting their decision when purchasing spectacles for their children. Female guardians and those with higher incomes were both 1.5 times more likely to emphasise frame quality when describing selection criteria for purchasing spectacles for their children than male guardians (p = 0.01) or guardians earning less (p = 0.03). Conclusion Design, material, and frame quality are key factors influencing guardians when purchasing spectacles for their children in these setting and female guardians or those with higher income prioritise frame quality. This study could guide the planning and implementation of a novel cross-subsidisation scheme in Cross River State."
https://openalex.org/W3180611052,"X—linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA, OMIM #300755) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by pathogenic variations in the BTK gene, characterized by failure of development and maturation of B lymphocytes. The estimated prevalence worldwide is 1 in 190,000 male births. Recently, genome sequencing has been widely used in difficult to diagnose and familial cases. We report a large Indian family suffering from XLA with five affected individuals. We performed complete blood count, immunoglobulin assay, and lymphocyte subset analysis for all patients and analyzed Btk expression for one patient and his mother. Whole exome sequencing (WES) for four patients, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) for two patients have been performed. Carrier screening was done for 17 family members using Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) and haplotype ancestry mapping using fineSTRUCTURE was performed. All patients had hypogammaglobulinemia and low CD19+ B cells. One patient who underwent Btk estimation had low expression and his mother showed a mosaic pattern. We could not identify any single nucleotide variants or small insertion/ deletions from the WES dataset that correlates with the clinical feature of the patient. Structural variant analysis through WGS data identifies a novel large deletion of 5,296 bp at loci chrX:100,624,323–100,629,619 encompassing exons 3–5 of the BTK gene. Family screening revealed seven carriers for the deletion. Two patients had a successful HSCT. Haplotype mapping revealed a South Asian ancestry. WGS led to identification of the accurate genetic mutation which could help in early diagnosis leading to improved outcomes, prevention of permanent organ damage and improved quality of life, as well as enabling genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis in the family."
https://openalex.org/W3180808744,"Background Health-seeking behaviour, stigma, and discrimination towards people affected by tuberculosis (TB) are influenced by awareness of the disease. Gender differentials in the diagnosis and treatment of TB have been reported in other settings of the world. However, little is known about the gender differences in the knowledge of TB transmission and curative possibility in Ghana. Methods The analysed data were a weighted sample of 9,396 women aged 15–49 years and 4,388 men aged 15–59 years, obtained from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. The dependent variable, correct knowledge regarding TB transmission and cure was derived from questions on the transmission of the disease and the possibility of a cure. A design-based multivariate logistic regression model in Stata 13.0/SE was used to identify the correlates of reporting correct knowledge. Results Overall, the mean knowledge score was 6.1±0.9 (maximum = 7). Of the 13,784 respondents, 45.7% (95% CI: 44.0–47.3) reported correct knowledge regarding TB transmission and cure. Men had significantly higher knowledge than women (50.9% versus 43.2%). Misconceptions, including TB transmitted through sharing utensils (13.3%), food (6.9%), touching a person with TB (4.5%), sexual contact (4.1%), and mosquito bites (0.4%) were noted. About 30% (33% women and 25% men) of the total sample would keep the information secret when a household member is affected with TB. In the adjusted analysis, age, gender, education, region, place of residence, wealth quintile, frequency of reading newspaper/magazine, listening to the radio, and watching television were significantly associated with reporting correct knowledge. Conclusions There was low knowledge regarding TB transmission and cure. Misconceptions regarding the transmission of TB prevailed among the participants. Gender differential in knowledge was observed. Comparatively, females were less likely to be aware of TB and report correct knowledge regarding TB transmission but were more likely to conceal information when a household member was affected by the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3181036595,"In humans, several members of the CEACAM receptor family have been shown to interact with intestinal pathogens in an inflammatory context. While CEACAMs have long been thought to be only present in mammals, recent studies have identified ceacam genes in other vertebrates, including teleosts. The function of these related genes remains however largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of CEACAM proteins in fish, we undertook the study of a putative member of the family, CEACAMz1, identified in Danio rerio . Sequence analysis of the ceacamz1 gene product predicted a GPI-anchored extracellular protein containing eleven immunoglobulin domains but revealed no evident orthology with human CEACAMs. Using a combination of RT-PCR analyses and in situ hybridization experiments, as well as a fluorescent reporter line, we showed that CEACAMz1 is first expressed in discrete cells on the ventral skin of zebrafish larvae and later on in the developing gills. This distribution remains constant until juvenile stage is reached, at which point CEACAMz1 is almost exclusively expressed in gills. We further observed that at late larval stages, CEACAMz1-expressing cells mostly localize on the afferent side of the branchial filaments and possibly in the inter-lamellar space. Using immunolabelling and 3D-reconstructions, we showed that CEACAMz1 is expressed in cells from the uppermost layer of skin epidermis. These cells are embedded within the keratinocytes pavement and we unambiguously identified them as proton-pump rich ionocytes (HR cells). As the expression of ceacamz1 is turned on concomitantly to that of other known markers of HR cells, we propose that ceacamz1 may serve as a novel marker of mature HR cells from the zebrafish epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W3181413128,"An appropriate exposure to the light-dark cycle, with high irradiances during the day and darkness during the night is essential to keep our physiology on time. However, considering the increasing exposure to artificial light at night and its potential harmful effects on health (i.e. chronodisruption and associated health conditions), it is essential to understand the non-visual effects of light in humans. Melatonin suppression is considered the gold standard for nocturnal light effects, and the activation of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) through the assessment of pupillary light reflex (PLR) has been recently gaining attention. Also, some theoretical models for melatonin suppression and retinal photoreceptors activation have been proposed. Our aim in this study was to determine the influence of correlated color temperature (CCT) on melatonin suppression and PLR, considering two commercial light sources, as well as to explore the possible correlation between both processes. Also, the contribution of irradiance (associated to CCT) was explored through mathematical modelling on a wider range of light sources. For that, melatonin suppression and PLR were experimentally assessed on 16 healthy and young volunteers under two light conditions (warmer, CCT 3000 K; and cooler, CCT 5700 K, at ~5·1018 photons/cm2/sec). Our experimental results yielded greater post-stimulus constriction under the cooler (5700 K, 13.3 ± 1.9%) than under the warmer light (3000 K, 8.7 ± 1.2%) (p < 0.01), although no significant differences were found between both conditions in terms of melatonin suppression. Interestingly, we failed to demonstrate correlation between PLR and melatonin suppression. Although methodological limitations cannot be discarded, this could be due to the existence of different subpopulations of Type 1 ipRGCs differentially contributing to PLR and melatonin suppression, which opens the way for further research on ipRGCs projection in humans. The application of theoretical modelling suggested that CCT should not be considered separately from irradiance when designing nocturnal/diurnal illumination systems. Further experimental studies on wider ranges of CCTs and light intensities are needed to confirm these conclusions."

The present study evaluated the growth and seed production of E . colona grown alone or with four and eight cover crop plants per pot (i.e., 80 and 160 plants m -2 ). Four legume (cowpea, lablab, pigeonpea, and soybean) and two grass (forage sorghum and Japanese millet) cover crops were used. Interference by cover crops reduced the height, the number of leaves and tillers, inflorescence number, seed production, and biomass of this weed than when it was grown alone. Cover crops differed in their ability to suppress the growth and seed production of E . colona . The effect of cover crop density on the studied attributes was non-significant in most cases. Pigeonpea as a cover crop was the least effective in suppressing the growth and seed production of E . colona . In general, leguminous cover crops exhibited less suppression of E . colona than grasses. Forage sorghum was most efficient in reducing the growth of this weed. Forage sorghum and Japanese millet reduced E . colona leaf and tiller numbers per plant by 90 and 87%, respectively. These cover crops reduced E . colona leaf number to only 17 per plant as against 160 per plant recorded without cover crops. Inflorescence number per E . colona plant growing alone was as high as 48. However, it was reduced by 20–92% when this weed was grown with cover crop plants. E . colona ’s seed production was significantly suppressed by all the cover crops, except pigeonpea. Biomass of E . colona was suppressed largely by forage sorghum and Japanese millet compared to other cover crops. Among the cover crops, pigeonpea produced the lowest biomass of 11 g pot -1 , and the highest biomass (114 g pot -1 ) was produced by forage sorghum. The study demonstrated the usefulness of cover crops, especially forage sorghum and Japanese millet, to suppress the growth and seed output of E . colona ."

To clarify the role of Sam68 in energy metabolism in the adult stage, we generated an inducible Sam68 knockout mice. Knockout of Sam68 was induced at the age of 7-10 weeks, and then we examined the metabolic profiles of the mice. Sam68 knockout mice gained less body weight over time and at 34 or 36 weeks old, had smaller fat mass without changes in food intake and absorption efficiency. Deletion of Sam68 in mice elevated thermogenesis, increased energy expenditure, and attenuated core-temperature drop during acute cold exposure. Furthermore, we examined younger Sam68 knockout mice at 11 weeks old before their body weights deviate, and confirmed increased energy expenditure and thermogenic gene program. Thus, Sam68 is essential for the control of adipose thermogenesis and energy homeostasis in the adult."
https://openalex.org/W3179297279,"Background Transcutaneous auricular Vagal Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) is a non-invasive neurostimulation technique with potential analgesic effects. Several studies based on subjective behavioral responses suggest that taVNS modulates nociception differently with either pro-nociceptive or anti-nociceptive effects. Objective This study aimed to characterize how taVNS alters pain perception, by investigating its effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by different types of spinothalamic and lemniscal somatosensory stimuli, combined with quantitative sensory testing (detection threshold and intensity ratings). Methods We performed 3 experiments designed to study the time-dependent effects of taVNS and compare with standard cervical VNS (cVNS). In Experiment 1, we assessed the effects of taVNS after 3 hours of stimulation. In Experiment 2, we focused on the immediate effects of the duty cycle (OFF vs. ON phases). Experiments 1 and 2 included 22 and 15 healthy participants respectively. Both experiments consisted of a 2-day cross-over protocol, in which subjects received taVNS and sham stimulation sequentially. In addition, subjects received a set of nociceptive (thermonociceptive CO 2 laser, mechanical pinprick) and non-nociceptive (vibrotactile, cool) stimuli, for which we recorded detection thresholds, intensity of perception and ERPs. Finally, in Experiment 3, we tested 13 epileptic patients with an implanted cVNS by comparing OFF vs. ON cycles, using a similar experimental procedure. Results Neither taVNS nor cVNS appeared to modulate the cerebral and behavioral aspects of somatosensory perception. Conclusion The potential effect of taVNS on nociception requires a cautious interpretation, as we found no objective change in behavioral and cerebral responses to spinothalamic and lemniscal somatosensory stimulations."
https://openalex.org/W3179469786,"Although numerous studies have examined the relationship between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and suicide, research is needed that studies the effects of specific ACEs, including subclasses of ACEs, independent of the effect of other ACEs. We explored the relationship between ACEs and suicidal ideation (SI) with special attention to patterns according to generation cohort (millennials: 22–37 years old, generation X: 38–53 years old, and baby boomers: 54–72 years old), and assessed the extent to which mood and anxiety disorders account for the relationship between ACEs and suicidal ideation. Patients in behavioral healthcare services of a large federally qualified health center (n = 4,392) were assessed at baseline on ACEs, SI, and mood and anxiety disorders. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine the data. Emotional neglect was the strongest predictor of SI among Millennials (OR = 1.59), Generation X (OR = 1.81), and Baby Boomers (OR = 1.88) after controlling for mood and anxiety disorders, race/ethnicity, and gender. Findings suggest ACEs predict an increased likelihood of having SI over and above the influence of mood and anxiety disorders, in models adjusted for gender and race/ethnicity. Across generations, the association with suicidal ideation was strongest for any child abuse and neglect, but not for household dysfunction. The observed association of ACEs with suicidal ideation suggests that ACEs should be considered as a risk factor and incorporated into screening assessments for suicidal ideation. Lastly, additional research on the association of ACEs and suicidality in individuals not actively being managed in behavioral healthcare settings is also warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3180636911,"Phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) selectively cleaves the phosphodiester bond of cAMP and is inhibited by cGMP, making it an important regulator of cAMP-cGMP signaling crosstalk in the pulmonary vasculature. In addition, the nitric oxide-cGMP axis is known to play an important role in maintaining endothelial barrier function. However, the potential role of protein kinase G-Iα (PKG-Iα) in this protective process is unresolved and was the focus of our study. We describe here a novel mechanism regulating PDE3A activity, which involves a PKG-Iα-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of PDE3A at serine 654. We also show that this phosphorylation is critical for maintaining intracellular cAMP levels in the pulmonary endothelium and endothelial barrier integrity. In an animal model of acute lung injury (ALI) induced by challenging mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an increase in PDE3 activity and a decrease in cAMP levels in lung tissue was associated with reduced PKG activity upon PKG-Iα nitration at tyrosine 247. The peroxynitrite scavenger manganese (III) tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin prevented this increase in PDE3 activity in LPS-exposed lungs. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of PDE3A to replace serine 654 with alanine yielded a mutant protein that was insensitive to PKG-dependent regulation. Taken together, our data demonstrate a novel functional link between nitrosative stress induced by LPS during ALI and the downregulation of barrier-protective intracellular cAMP levels. Our data also provide new evidence that PKG-Iα is critical for endothelial barrier maintenance and that preservation of its catalytic activity may be efficacious in ALI therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3177589960,"Background Ferritin is the major iron storage protein and an acute phase reactant. Hyperferritinemia is frequently seen in the critically ill where it has been hypothesized that not only underlying conditions but also factors such as transfusions, hemodialysis and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) lead to hyperferritinemia. This study aims to investigate the influence of transfusions, hemodialysis, and ECLS on hyperferritinemia in a multidisciplinary ICU cohort. Methods This is a post-hoc analysis of a retrospective observational study including patients aged ≥ 18 years who were admitted to at least one adult ICU between January 2006 and August 2018 with hyperferritinemia ≥ 500 μg/L and of ≥ 14 days between two ICU ferritin measurements. Patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) were excluded. To identify the influence of transfusions, hemodialysis, and ECLS on ferritin change, multivariable linear regression analysis with ferritin change between two measurements as dependent variable was performed. Results A total of 268 patients was analyzed. Median duration between measurements was 36 days (22–57). Over all patients, ferritin significantly increased between the first and last measurement (p = 0.006). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed no effect of transfusions, hemodialysis, or ECLS on ferritin change. Changes in aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score were identified as influencing factors on ferritin change [unstandardized regression coefficient (B) = 2.6; (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9, 3.3); p &lt; 0.001 and B = 376.5; (95% CI 113.8, 639.1); p = 0.005, respectively]. Using the same model for subgroups of SOFA score, we found SOFA platelet count to be associated with ferritin change [B = 1729.3; (95% CI 466.8, 2991.9); p = 0.007]. No association of ferritin change and in-hospital mortality was seen in multivariable analysis. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that transfusions, hemodialysis, and ECLS had no influence on ferritin increases in critically ill patients. Hyperferritinemia appears to be less the result of iatrogenic influences in the ICU thereby underscoring its unskewed diagnostic value. Trial registration The study was registered with www.ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02854943 ) on August 1, 2016."
https://openalex.org/W3177935106,"Objective While prior research shows that mental illness is associated with lower utilization of screening imaging, little is known about how mental illness impacts use of diagnostic imaging, other than for screening. This study explores the association between a history of anxiety or depression in the prior year and utilization of diagnostic imaging. Methods Commercial and Medicare Advantage health plan claims from 2017 and 2018 from patients with plans from one national organization were extracted. Exclusions were made for patients without continuous plan enrollment. History of anxiety or depression was determined using 2017 claims, and downstream diagnostic imaging was determined using 2018 claims. Univariate associations were assessed with Chi-square tests. A matched sample was created using Coarsened Exact Matching, with history of mental illness serving as the treatment variable. Logistic regressions were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios, before and after matching, controlling for age, sex, urbanicity, local income, comorbidities, claims history, region, and health plan characteristics. Associations between mental illness and chest imaging, neuroimaging, and emergency department imaging were also evaluated. Results The sample included 2,381,851 patients before matching. Imaging was significantly more likely for patients with a history of anxiety (71.1% vs. 55.7%, P &lt; .001) and depression (73.2% vs. 55.3%, P &lt; .001). The adjusted odds of any imaging were 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22–1.26) for patients with a history of anxiety, and 1.43 (CI: 1.41–1.45) for patients with a history of depression before matching, and 1.18 (CI: 1.16–1.20) for a history of anxiety and 1.33 (CI: 1.32–1.35) for a history of depression after matching. Adjusted analyses found significant, positive associations between mental illness and chest imaging, neuroimaging, and emergency department imaging both before and after matching. Discussion In contrast to prior findings on screening, anxiety and depression were associated with greater likelihood of diagnostic imaging within the population studied."
https://openalex.org/W3178917735,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are considered a promising source of pancreatic β-cells for the treatment of diabetes. However, this approach is limited by issues such as low efficiency and high cost. Here, we have developed a new protocol to induce insulin-producing cells. To reduce costs, we decreased the number of reagents and replaced protein reagents with chemical compounds. In this method, we increased induction efficiency with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and an ALK5 inhibitor, RepSox. In 2D culture, the majority of cells were immature β-cells with low glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Transferring to 3D culture immediately after endocrine progenitor cell differentiation, however, improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This simplified method will contribute to realizing transplantation therapy of β-cells using iPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W3180026800,"The aim of this study was twofold: first, to compare individuals’ strategy choices in low and high intensity conditions and the actual efficacy of these strategies; second, to assess whether and how perceived intensity levels of aversive situations moderate the relationship between depressive symptoms and a strategies’ efficacy. In Experiment 1A ( N = 58), we replicated previous results, showing that individuals prefer distraction in high- and reappraisal in low-intensity conditions, irrespective of depressive symptom levels. Experiment 1B ( N = 50) assessed the efficacy of distraction and reappraisal strategies in aversive conditions with low and high intensity. Contrary to our prediction, reappraisal was more effective than distraction, independent of the intensity of the aversive conditions. In Experiment 2 ( N = 113), we tested the interactive relationship between perceived intensity levels and depression on the relative effectiveness of reappraisal and distraction. We found that while in perceived low-intensity situations the advantage of distraction over reappraisal increased as depressive symptoms increased, no such relationship was found in high-intensity situations. The results suggest that while all individuals prefer to apply reappraisal in both low- and high-intensity conditions, for those with high level of depressive symptoms, such a preference acts against their own interests. The study highlights the need to distinguish between emotion regulation preferences and their actual efficacy, while illuminating possible implications for individuals with depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3183080553,"We aimed to investigate Mycoplasma infections among chicken flocks (Ross, Lohmann and native) in Giza, Egypt, using serological tests, including the slide plate agglutination (SPA) test, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The slide plate agglutination examination, a serological test, indicated the prevalence of Mg and Ms infections of 10.9% and 13.2%, respectively. On 91 SPA test positive serum samples for either Mg or Ms , a passive hemagglutination/hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was performed. The SPA and HI test findings were found to be comparable. On 90 SPA test positive samples, an ELISA was performed using commercial kits for Mg and Ms serodiagnosis. According to the ELISA data, only 83.33% and 18.88% of SPA test positive samples were confirmed as positive for Ms and Mg infections, respectively. The prevalence increased to 84.44% and 77.77%, respectively, when suspected samples were deemed positive."
https://openalex.org/W3179304575,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory neurotransmission are believed to be the neuronal basis of learning and memory. Both processes are primarily mediated by neuronal activity-induced transport of postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). While AMPAR subunits and their specific phosphorylation sites mediate differential AMPAR trafficking, LTP and LTD could also occur in a subunit-independent manner. Thus, it remains unclear whether and how certain AMPAR subunits with phosphorylation sites are preferentially recruited to or removed from synapses during LTP and LTD. Using immunoblot and immunocytochemical analysis, we show that phosphomimetic mutations of the membrane-proximal region (MPR) in GluA1 AMPAR subunits affect the subunit-dependent endosomal transport of AMPARs during chemical LTD. AP-2 and AP-3, adaptor protein complexes necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and late endosomal/lysosomal trafficking, respectively, are reported to be recruited to AMPARs by binding to the AMPAR auxiliary subunit, stargazin (STG), in an AMPAR subunit-independent manner. However, the association of AP-3, but not AP-2, with STG was indirectly inhibited by the phosphomimetic mutation in the MPR of GluA1. Thus, although AMPARs containing the phosphomimetic mutation at the MPR of GluA1 were endocytosed by a chemical LTD-inducing stimulus, they were quickly recycled back to the cell surface in hippocampal neurons. These results could explain how the phosphorylation status of GluA1-MPR plays a dominant role in subunit-independent STG-mediated AMPAR trafficking during LTD."

https://openalex.org/W3181111768,"Background Optimal nutrition during lactation is essential for the well-being of the mother and the infant. Studies have shown that access to nutrient-rich foods during lactation is critical as minimal stores of nutrients can have adverse effects. This study aimed to investigate the diversity, composition, and nutrient adequacy of diets of lactating mothers in Southwest Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional survey was carried out in three districts of Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia, in February 2014. A stratified multistage sampling technique was used to select 558 lactating mothers. Data were collected using a pre-tested and structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. Minimum dietary diversity for women (MDD-W) was computed from a single 24-h recall. A cut off value of 5 was used to classify the dietary diversity into achieving MDD-W or not. The proximate, mineral and anti-nutritional compositions of 12 commonly consumed foods were analysed using standard methods. Nutrient adequacy ratio (NAR) and Mean adequacy ratio (MAR) of these foods were estimated. Results The mean (±SD) dietary diversity score (DDS) of the study participants was 3.73±1.03. Meeting MDD-W was positively associated with agricultural production diversity (P = 0.001) and educational level of the women (P = 0.04). Conversely, district of the study (P = 0.003) and place of residence (P = 0.019) were negatively associated with meeting MDD-W. The proximate composition (g/100g) of the sampled foods ranged between 24.8–65.6 for moisture, 7.6–19.8 for protein, 2.1–23.1 for crude fat, 2.0–27 for crude fibre, 1.0–21.2 for total ash, and 0.9–45.8 for total carbohydrate content. The calorific value ranged between 124.5–299.6 Kcal/100g. The mineral contents (mg/100g) ranged between 9.5–52.5 for iron, 2.2–4.2 for zinc, 42.6–318.2 for calcium, and 150.7–379.9 for phosphorus. The content of anti-nutritional factors (mg/100g) ranged between 11.1–178.9 for phytate and 3.7–315.9 for tannin. All the commonly consumed maternal foods were not sufficient to meet the energy, fat and protein requirements, (NAR&lt;1). However, all diets provided adequate iron and most of the cereal-based foods provided adequate carbohydrate and minerals. The overall nutrient adequacy was below the cut-off point for all food types. Conclusions The diets of lactating mothers in Southwest Ethiopia lack diversity and nutrient adequacy. A community-based nutrition education program on the importance of diet diversity and nutrient intake during lactation based on a multi-sectoral approach is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3181196451,"Purpose Evaluation of skin organ doses in six different cone-beam computed tomography scanners (CBCT) dedicated to dentomaxillofacial imaging. Our hypothesis is that the dose varies between different devices, protocols and skin areas. Materials and methods An anthropomorphic adult head and neck phantom was used to which a dosimeter (Waterproof Farmer® Chamber, PTW, Freiburg, Germany) was attached to anatomic landmarks of both parotid glands, both ocular lenses, the thyroid gland and the neurocranium. CBCT examinations were performed on six different CBCT devices dedicated to dentomaxillofacial imaging with standard settings and, if available, also in high dose settings. Measurements were repeated five times each. Results The measured mean skin doses ranged from 0.48 to 2.21 mGy. The comparison of the region based dose evaluation showed a high correlation between the single measurements. Furthermore, the distribution of doses between regions was similar in all devices, except that four devices showed side differences for the dose of the parotid region and one device showed side differences for the lens region. The directly exposed regions, such as the parotid glands, showed significant higher values than the more distant regions like the neurocranium. When comparing examination protocols, a significant difference between the standard dose and the high dose acquisitions could be detected. But also a significant dose difference between the different CBCTs could be shown. 3D Accuitomo 170 (Morita, Osaka, Japan) showed the highest absorbed mean dose value for standard settings with 2.21 mGy, especially at the directly exposed regions and their adjacent organs. The lowest mean value for standard settings was achieved with VGi evo (NewTom, Verona, Italy) with 0.48 mGy. Conclusion Repeated measurements of skin organ doses in six different CBCT scanners using a surface dosimeter showed side differences in distribution of dose in five devices for the parotid and lens region. Additionally, significant dose differences between the devices could be detected. Further studies should be performed to confirm these results."
https://openalex.org/W3181389512,"Background Respiratory heat exchange is an important physiological process occurring in the upper and lower respiratory tract and is usually completed when inspired gases reach the alveoli. Animal and human studies demonstrated that heat exchange can be modulated by altering pulmonary ventilation and perfusion. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of acute ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch on respiratory heat exchange. In clinical practice, monitoring respiratory heat exchange might offer the possibility of real-time tracking of acute V/Q-mismatch. Methods In 11 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated pigs, V/Q-mismatch was established by means of four interventions: single lung ventilation, high cardiac output, occlusion of the left pulmonary artery and repeated whole-lung lavage. V/Q-distributions were determined by the multiple inert gas elimination technique (MIGET). Respiratory heat exchange was measured as respiratory enthalpy using the novel, pre-commercial VQm ™ monitor (development stage, Rostrum Medical Innovations, Vancouver, CA). According to MIGET, shunt perfusion of low V/Q compartments increased during single lung ventilation, high cardiac output and whole-lung lavage, whereas dead space and ventilation of high V/Q compartments increased during occlusion of the left pulmonary artery and whole-lung lavage. Results Bohr dead space increased after pulmonary artery occlusion and whole-lung lavage, venous admixture increased during single lung ventilation and whole-lung lavage, P a O 2 /F i O 2 was decreased during all interventions. MIGET confirmed acute V/Q-mismatch. Respiratory enthalpy did not change significantly despite significant acute V/Q-mismatch. Conclusion Clinically relevant V/Q-mismatch does not impair respiratory heat exchange in the absence of additional thermal stressors and may not have clinical utility in the detection of acute changes."
https://openalex.org/W3182354064,"Introduction Double disease burden such as Tuberculosis and Diabetes mellitus comorbidity is evident and on rising especially in high burden settings such as Tanzania. There is limited information about the availability of tuberculosis/diabetes integrated healthcare services in Tanzania. Therefore, this study explored the availability and examined the readiness of healthcare facilities with tuberculosis services to manage diabetes mellitus in Tanzania. Methods We abstracted data from the 2014–2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment Survey datasets. The service availability was assessed by calculating the proportion of tuberculosis facilities reported to manage diabetes mellitus. There were four domains; each domain with some indicators for calculating the readiness index. High readiness was considered if the tuberculosis facilities scored at least half (≥50%) of the indicators listed in each of the four domains (staff training and guideline, diagnostics, equipment, and medicines) as is recommended by the World Health Organization-Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual while low readiness for otherwise. Results Out of 341 healthcare facilities with tuberculosis services included in the current study, 238 (70.0%) reported providing management for diabetes mellitus. The majority of the facilities were dispensaries and clinics 48.1%; publicly owned 72.6%; and located in rural 62.6%. Overall, the readiness of tuberculosis facilities to manage diabetes was low (10.8%). Similarly, the readiness was low based on the domain-specific readiness of trained staff and guidelines. Conclusion Although the majority of the healthcare facilities with tuberculosis services had diabetes mellitus services the overall readiness was low. This finding provides a piece of evidence to inform the policymakers in high burden and low resource countries to strengthen the co-management of tuberculosis and diabetes."
