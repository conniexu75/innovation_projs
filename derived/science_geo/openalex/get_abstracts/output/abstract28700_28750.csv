https://openalex.org/W1997168691,"A vesicular intermediate in protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum is detected in a subset of temperature-sensitive mutants blocked early in the yeast secretory pathway. By electron microscopy three of the mutants, sec18, sec17, and sec22, accumulate 50 nm vesicles at the nonpermissive temperature. Vesicle accumulation is blocked by the mutations sec12, sec13, sec16, and sec23 as shown by analysis of double-mutant strains. Thus the early SEC genes can be divided into vesicle forming and vesicle fusion functions. Synthetic lethal interactions between sec mutations define two groups of SEC genes, corresponding to the groups involved in vesicle formation or fusion. Mutations in two of the genes involved in vesicle fusion, SEC17 and SEC18, are lethal in combination, and five of six possible pairwise combinations of mutations in genes required for vesicle formation, SEC12, SEC13, SEC16, and SEC23, are lethal. These interactions suggest cooperation between different SEC gene products in vesicle budding and vesicle fusion processes."
https://openalex.org/W1966608028,"We have identified and analyzed a meiotic reciprocal recombination hot spot in S. cerevisiae. We find that double-strand breaks occur at two specific sites associated with the hot spot and that occurrence of these breaks depends upon meiotic recombination functions RAD50 and SPO11. Furthermore, these breaks occur in a processed form in wild-type cells and in a discrete, unprocessed form in certain nonnull rad50 mutants, rad50S, which block meiotic prophase at an intermediate stage. The breaks observed in wild-type cells are similar to those identified independently at another recombination hot spot, ARG4. We show here that the breaks at ARG4 also occur in discrete form in rad50S mutants. Occurrence of breaks in rad50S mutants is also dependent upon SPO11 function. These observations provide additional evidence that double-strand breaks are a prominent feature of meiotic recombination in yeast. More importantly, these observations begin to define a pathway for the physical changes in DNA that lead to recombination and to define the roles of meiotic recombination functions in that pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2134098588,"During epidermal cell cornification, the deposition of a layer of covalently cross-linked protein on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane forms the cell envelope. We have isolated and characterized cDNA clones encoding a major differentiation product of mouse epidermal cells, which has an amino acid composition similar to that of purified cell envelopes. Transcripts of this gene are restricted to the granular layer and are as abundant as the differentiation-specific keratins, K1 and K10. An antiserum against a C-terminal peptide localizes this protein in discrete granules in the stratum granulosum and subsequently at the periphery of stratum corneum cells. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy detect this epitope only on the inner surface of purified cell envelopes. Taken together, these results suggest that it is a major component of cell envelopes. On the basis of its presumed function, this protein is named loricrin."
https://openalex.org/W1917670769,"Urease was purified 112-fold to homogeneity from the microaerophilic human gastric bacterium, Helicobacter pylori. The urease isolation procedure included a water extraction step, size exclusion chromatography, and anion exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme exhibited a Km of 0.3 +/- 0.1 mM and a Vmax of 1,100 +/- 200 mumols of urea hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein at 22 degrees C in 31 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The isoelectric point was 5.99 +/- 0.03. Molecular mass estimated for the native enzyme was 380,000 +/- 30,000 daltons, whereas subunit values of 62,000 +/- 2,000 and 30,000 +/- 1,000 were determined. The partial amino-terminal sequence (17 residues) of the large subunit of H. pylori urease (Mr = 62,000) was 76% homologous with an internal sequence of the homohexameric jack bean urease subunit (Mr = 90,770; Takashima, K., Suga, T., and Mamiya, G. (1988) Eur. J. Biochem. 175, 151-165) and was 65% homologous with amino-terminal sequences of the large subunits of heteropolymeric ureases from Proteus mirabilis (Mr = 73,000) and from Klebsiella aerogenes (Mr = 72,000; Mobley, H. L. T., and Hausinger, R. P. (1989) Microbiol. Rev. 53, 85-108). The amino-terminal sequence (20 residues) of the small subunit of H. pylori urease (Mr = 30,000) was 65 and 60% homologous with the amino-terminal sequences of the subunit of jack bean urease and with the Mr = 11,000 subunit of P. mirabilis urease (Jones, B. D., and Mobley, H. L. T. (1989) J. Bacteriol. 171, 6414-6422), respectively. Thus, the urease of H. pylori shows similarities to ureases found in plants and other bacteria. When used as antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, neither purified urease nor an Mr = 54,000 protein that co-purified with urease by size exclusion chromatography was as effective as crude preparations of H. pylori proteins at distinguishing sera from persons known either to be infected with H. pylori or not."
https://openalex.org/W1993763345,"The signal-transducing G protein Gk couples muscarinic receptors to K+ (K+[Ach]) channels in atrial cells. Recombinant human ras p21 GAP (GTPase activating protein) at subnanomolar concentrations inhibited GTP-dependent channel opening in isolated atrial cell membranes. This inhibition depended on interaction of GAP with ras p21 in the isolated membranes. In addition, recombinant ras p21 proteins blocked the currents; this effect could be blocked by prior incubation of membranes with specific anti-GAP antibodies. We therefore propose that ras p21 GTP complexed with GAP (ras p21-GAP) blocks K+[ACh] currents. The channel block could be overcome by GTPÎ³S activation of endogenous Gk; this indicates that ras p21-GAP does not interfere with interaction of Gk with the K+[ACh] channel directly, but prevents coupling of the muscarinic receptor to endogenous Gk."
https://openalex.org/W1481795044,"Exposure of quiescent, serum-starved 3T3-L1 cells to insulin promotes phosphorylation of initiation factors eIF-4F, eIF-4B, and eIF-3 p120, as well as ribosomal protein S6. Phosphorylation of both the p25 and p220 subunits of eIF-4F is stimulated typically by 2.5-5-fold, with a 2-4-fold increase in phosphorylation of eIF-4B and eIF-3 p120. Optimal stimulation is observed by 10(-9) M insulin. A similar pattern of stimulation is seen upon treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with 1 x 10(-6) M phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping of p25, isolated from quiescent, insulin- or PMA-stimulated cells, results in a single tryptic phosphopeptide, indicating a single phosphorylation site identical to that obtained with protein kinase C. A more complex phosphopeptide map is observed with the p220 subunit. Following PMA-stimulation of 3T3-L1 cells, phosphopeptide mapping of p220 results in a pattern similar to that observed in vitro with Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). Following insulin stimulation, mapping of p220 results in the appearance of novel peptides. Upon prolonged exposure to PMA, the cells are no longer responsive to this mitogen and no stimulation of phosphorylation of eIF-4F, eIF-4b, eIF-3 p120, or S6 via a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism is observed. Addition of insulin to these down-regulated cells leads to stimulation of phosphorylation of eIF-4F p220, ribosomal protein S6, and to a lesser extent, eIF-4B; little or no stimulation of phosphorylation of eIF-4F p25 and eIF-3 p120 is observed. Thus, eIF-4F p220, eIF-4B and ribosomal protein S6 are phosphorylated via PMA-dependent and insulin-dependent pathways, whereas phosphorylation of eIF-4F p25 and eIF-3 p120 is stimulated only upon activation of protein kinase C. Phosphopeptide maps of eIF-4F p220 and ribosomal protein S6 suggest that protease-activated kinase II is one of the protein kinases involved in the insulin-stimulated response in protein kinase C-depleted cells."

https://openalex.org/W1607853670,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a peptide synthesized by endothelial cells both in culture and in vivo. ET-1 induces contraction of smooth muscle cells and stimulates growth in a variety of mesenchymal cell types. We have previously characterized the genomic organization of the ET-1 gene and described its chromosomal localization and promoter region sequence. In this report, we describe the use of fusion plasmids containing ET-1 5'-flanking sequence and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene to identify cis-acting sequences that direct transcription of the ET-1 gene. When transfected into bovine aortic endothelial cells, constructs containing 143 base pairs of ET-1 5'-flanking sequence allowed maximal transcription, whereas constructs containing 129 base pairs of sequence had 40-fold lower rates of transcription. A synthetic DNA fragment encoding the region delineated by these deletion mutants was found to have a positive effect on transcription when placed in either orientation upstream of short inactive ET-1 promoter constructs. However, this increase in transcription was noted only when a second region containing an AP1 consensus sequence was also included in the constructs. In experiments with a heterologous promoter and a 119-base pair DNA fragment containing these two functional regions, this 119-base pair sequence acted in a positive and endothelial cell-specific fashion. Taken together, these data localize cis-acting sequences important in determining the rate and tissue specificity of ET-1 gene transcription and should allow the study of protein-DNA interactions which mediate transcription of this gene in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092985132,"Cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses were evaluated in humans immunized with recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) envelope glycoprotein gp160. Some vaccinees had gp160-specific CTLs that were shown by cloning to be CD4+. Although induced by exogenous antigen, most gp160-specific CTL clones also recognized gp160 synthesized endogenously in target cells. These clones lysed autologous CD4+ T lymphoblasts infected with HIV. Of particular interest were certain vaccine-induced clones that lysed HIV-infected cells, recognized gp160 from diverse HIV isolates, and did not participate in ""innocent bystander"" killing of noninfected CD4+ T cells that had bound gp120."
https://openalex.org/W1572521445,"We report conditions under which Golgi membranes depleted of peripheral membrane proteins can be reconstituted for intra-cisternal vesicular transport. Analysis of the reconstitution reveals requirements for N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, a purified peripheral protein involved in the fusion stage of vesicular transport, as well as other peripheral protein activities which can be provided by mammalian cytosol but not yeast cytosol. The restorative activity in bovine brain cytosol is found in two broad and complementing fractions, of average native molecular masses of about 500 and 40 kDa, termed Fr1 and Fr2, respectively. This resolved transport system was used to develop a purification scheme for Fr2. Three proteins of apparent molecular masses of 35, 36, and 39 kDa (Fr2-alpha, -beta, and -gamma, respectively) were found to be responsible for Fr2 activity and were purified to homogeneity. Each Fr2 protein has activity by itself in the reconstituted in vitro Golgi transport assay, although each exhibits a different specific activity and plateau value. No synergy of the three Fr2 proteins was observed during mixing experiments. The three Fr2 proteins seem to be closely related based on size, in vitro activities, chromatographic properties, and peptide maps and may comprise a new family of proteins involved in vesicular transport."
https://openalex.org/W1484036744,"RecA protein primarily associates with and dissociates from opposite ends of nucleoprotein filaments formed on linear duplex DNA. RecA nucleoprotein filaments that are hydrolyzing ATP therefore engage in a dynamic process under some conditions that has some of the properties of treadmilling. We have also investigated whether the net polymerization of recA protein at one end of the filament and/or a net depolymerization at the other end drives unidirectional strand exchange. There is no demonstrable correlation between recA protein association/dissociation and the strand exchange reaction. RecA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange is affected minimally by changes in reaction conditions (dilution, pH shift, or addition of small amounts of adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) that have large and demonstrable effects on recA protein association, dissociation, or both. Rather than driving strand exchange, these assembly and disassembly processes may simply represent the mechanism by which recA nucleoprotein filaments are recycled in the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1569256916,"Mouse entactin derived from the extracellular matrix of M1536-B3 cells and from insect cells infected with a recombinant virus containing entactin sequences were shown to promote the attachment of mouse mammary tumor, human melanoma, and other cells. The cell attachment was inhibited by antibodies against mouse entactin but not by anti-fibronectin or anti-laminin antibodies. On a weight basis entactin was as effective as laminin in promoting the attachment of mouse mammary tumor cells. The attachment of cells to entactin was in part mediated by the integrin recognition RGD peptide sequence. This was demonstrated by the cell attachment properties of peptides derived from entactin which contained this sequence. Furthermore, the peptide RGDS could inhibit the attachment of mouse mammary tumor cells to entactin to approximately 60% of control. It is suggested that additional cell recognition sequences may be present in entactin. The direct binding of calcium ions to entactin was observed. It is probable that the binding sites reside in peptide sequences located toward the NH2 terminus region of entactin. This conclusion was supported by the demonstration that synthetic peptides, containing potential calcium binding sequences derived from entactin, bound calcium. In addition, a recombinant peptide containing the amino-terminal 330 amino acids of entactin also bound calcium ions. The significance of these properties of entactin is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1973533589,"Adenovirus VA RNAL maintains protein synthesis by preventing activation of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase DAI. There appears to be a single binding site for dsRNA on DAI, and this site is blocked by VA RNAl. VA RNAl binds to purified DAI and can be cross-linked to the enzyme by UV irradiation. To determine the relationship between DAI binding and VA RNAl structure and function, we examined the binding abilities of wild-type and mutant VA RNAs. In several cases, the ability to bind DAI efficiently in vitro did not correlate with function in vivo. Secondary structure analysis suggested that efficient binding requires an apical stem-loop structure, whereas inhibition of DAI activation requires the central domain of the VA RNA molecule. We propose that the duplex stem permits VA RNA to interact with the dsRNA binding site on DAI and inhibits activation by juxtaposing the central domain of the RNA with the enzyme's active site."
https://openalex.org/W1560827533,"Formation of relaxosomes is the first step in the initiation of transfer DNA replication during bacterial conjugation. This nucleoprotein complex contains all components capable of introducing a site- and strand-specific nick at a cognate transfer origin (oriT) on supercoiled plasmid DNA, thus providing the substrate for generation of the strand to be transferred. Characterization of the terminal nucleotides at the oriT nick site revealed that relaxation occurs by hydrolysis of a single phosphodiester bond between a 2'-deoxyguanosyl and a 2'-deoxycytidyl residue. The relaxation nick site and a 19-base pair invert repeat sequence that is recognized by asymmetric binding of the RP4 TraJ protein are interspaced by 8 base pairs. The nicking reaction results in covalent attachment of the RP4 TraI protein to the 5'-terminal 2'-deoxycytidyl residue of the cleaved strand. The arrangement of the TraJ binding site and the relaxation nick site on the same side of the DNA double helix suggests that protein-protein interactions between TraJ and TraI are a prerequisite for oriT specific nicking. In accordance with the current model of transfer DNA replication, the 3' end remains accessible for primer extension by DNA polymerase I, enabling replacement strand synthesis in the donor cell by a rolling circle-type mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1529870717,"The steady state kinetic mechanism, molecular isotope exchange and the positional isotope exchange (PIX) reactions of D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase from Salmonella typhimurium have been studied. The kinetic mechanism has been determined to be ordered Ter-Ter from initial velocity and product inhibition experiments. The first substrate to bind is ATP followed by the addition of 2 mol of D-alanine. Pi is released, and then D-alanyl-D-alanine and ADP dissociate from the enzyme surface. In the reverse direction D-alanyl-D-alanine exhibits complete substrate inhibition (Ki = 1.15 +/- 0.05 mM) by binding to the enzyme-ATP complex. In the presence of D-alanine, D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase catalyzed the positional exchange of the beta,gamma-bridge oxygen in [gamma-18O4]ATP to a beta-nonbridge position. Two possible alternate dead-end substrate analogs, D-2-chloropropionic acid and isobutyric acid, did not induce a positional isotope exchange in [gamma-18O4]ATP. The positional isotope exchange rate is diminished relative to the net substrate turnover as the concentration of D-alanine is increased. This is consistent with the ordered Ter-Ter mechanism as determined by the steady state kinetic experiments. The ratio of the positional isotope exchange rate relative to the net chemical turnover of substrate (Vex/Vchem) approaches a value of 1.4 as the concentration of D-alanine becomes very small. This ratio is 100 times larger than the ratio of the maximal reverse and forward chemical reaction velocities (V2/V1). This situation is only possible when the reaction mechanism proceeds in two distinct steps and the first step is much faster than the second step. The enzyme was also found to catalyze the molecular isotope exchange of radiolabeled D-alanine with D-alanyl-D-alanine in the presence of phosphate. These results are consistent with the formation of D-alanyl phosphate as a kinetically competent intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2086903778,"The bacterial photosynthetic reaction center (RC) is a pigmented intrinsic membrane protein that performs the primary charge separation event of photosynthesis, thereby converting light to chemical energy. The RC pigments are bound primarily by two homologous peptides, the L and M subunits, each containing five transmembrane helices. These alpha helices and pigments are arranged in an approximate C2 symmetry and form two possible electron transfer pathways. Only one of these pathways is actually used. In an attempt to identify nonhomologous residues that are responsible for functional differences between the two branches, homologous helical regions that interact extensively with the pigments were genetically symmetrized (that is, exchanged). For example, replacement of the fourth transmembrane helix (D helix) in the M subunit with the homologous helix from the L subunit yields photosynthetically inactive RCs lacking a critical photoactive pigment. Photosynthetic revertants have been isolated in which single amino acid substitutions (intragenic suppressors) compensate for this partial symmetrization."
https://openalex.org/W1509027462,"Human apolipoprotein (apo) E gene constructs with 30 or 5 kilobases of 5'-flanking and 1.5 kilobases of 3'-flanking regions were used to create transgenic mice. High levels of human apoE mRNA were present in the transgenic kidney, but none was detected in the liver, which is normally the major source of apoE. When a construct with 5 kilobases of 5'- and 23 kilobases of 3'-flanking regions was used, only trace levels of human apoE mRNA were detected in the kidney, whereas high levels were found in the liver. These results indicated that regulatory elements downstream of the human apoE gene interacted with the transcription initiation complex to stimulate gene expression in the liver while suppressing expression in the kidney. In each case, human apoE was secreted into the plasma. The source of human apoE in the transgenic kidney was the epithelial cells lining the proximal tubule and Bowman's capsule."
https://openalex.org/W1485105669,"A novel phospholipase C specific for phosphatidylcholine has been shown to be activated by several agonists. Also, recent evidence suggests that transformation mediated by the ras oncogene possibly involves the activation of this novel phospholipid degradative pathway which would account for the increased diacylglycerol levels associated with transformation. Here we use a mutant of Ki-ras which is temperature-sensitive for transformation to investigate the kinetics of activation of the phosphodiesterase-mediated turnover of phosphatidylcholine. Upon shift to the permissive temperature, products of the activated phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C were detected by 30 min and reached maximal levels by 1-2 h. These results suggest that the product of the ras oncogene rapidly activates the phosphodiesteratic hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, the fact that at least 4 h are required for serum to activate this phospholipase C strongly suggests that the ras oncogene product might be involved in late steps of the mitogenic signaling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1555682241,"The mechanism of copper uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been investigated using a combination of 64Cu2+ and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. A wild type copper-resistant CUP 1R-containing strain and a strain carrying a deletion of the CUP1 locus (yeast copper metallothionein) exhibited quantitatively similar saturable energy-dependent 64Cu2+ uptake when cultures were pregrown in copper-free media (medium [Cu] approximately 15 nM). The kinetic constants for uptake by the wild type strain were Vmax = 0.21 nmol of copper/min/mg of protein and Km = 4.4 microM. This accumulation of 64Cu2+ represented net uptake as confirmed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. This uptake was not seen in glucose-starved cells, but was supported in glycerol- and ethanol-grown ones. Uptake was inhibited by both N3- and dinitrophenol and was barely detectable in cultures at 4 degrees C. When present at 50 microM, Zn2+ and Ni2+ inhibited by 50% indicating that this uptake process was relatively selective for Cu2+. 64Cu2+ accumulation was qualitatively and quantitatively different in cultures either grown in or preincubated with cold Cu2+. Either treatment resulted in the appearance of a fast phase (t 1/2 approximately 1 min) of 64Cu2+ accumulation which represented isotopic exchange since it did not lead to an increase in the mass of cell-associated copper; also, it was not energy-dependent. Exchange of 64Cu2+ into this pool was not inhibited by Zn2+. Pretreatment with Cu2+ caused a change in the rate of net accumulation as well; a 3-h incubation of cells in 5 microM medium Cu2+ caused a 1.6-fold increase in the velocity of energy-dependent uptake. Prior addition of cycloheximide abolished this Cu2(+)-dependent increase and, in fact, inhibited the 64Cu2+ uptake velocity by greater than 85%. The exchangeable pool was also absent in cycloheximide, Cu2(+)-treated cells suggesting that exchangeable Cu2+ derived from the copper taken up initially by the energy-dependent process. The thionein deletion mutant was similar to wild type in response to medium Cu2+ and cycloheximide indicating that copper metallothionein is not directly involved in Cu2+ uptake (as distinct from retention) in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1556915726,"An enhancer element in the 5' flanking region of the human apolipoprotein E gene, known as upstream regulatory element 1 (URE1), has previously been implicated in the expression of this gene. The URE1 element, which spans nucleotides -193 to -124 of the 5'-flanking region of the human apolipoprotein E gene, contains two sequences that bind to nuclear proteins, as determined by the DNase I footprinting assay. In the present study of URE1, we have characterized these sequences further. Deletion of one of the footprint sequences, at nucleotides -161 to -141, reduced URE1 enhancer activity substantially. A 30-base pair oligonucleotide that included this protein-binding sequence was able, by itself, to act as an enhancer. This sequence, termed the positive element for transcription (PET), was demonstrated by gel retention analysis to bind at least two protein factors, one of which is the transcription factor Sp1. Sp1 appeared to be the only protein required for the enhancer activity of PET to be manifested. In vitro transcription assays showed that the PET sequence was necessary for efficient transcription directed by the apoE promoter and that the PET sequence was the dominant regulatory element in the apoE promoter. Gel filtration chromatography and PET oligonucleotide-affinity chromatography were used to isolate a second PET-binding factor, a Mr = 55,000 protein, from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. It appeared to compete with Sp1 for a common binding site in the PET sequence, but it was not required for enhancer activity. The second footprint sequence in URE1, at nucleotides -184 to -173, also bound Sp1, but it was not required for enhancer activity. A third Sp1-binding region was located at a proximal GC box element (nucleotides -54 to -45). This region had no enhancer activity, but it was required for maximum transcriptional activity of the apoE promoter. Thus, the regulation of apoE gene expression is influenced by different protein-binding sequences, with transcription factor Sp1 playing major roles in both basal promoter activity and enhancer activity."
https://openalex.org/W1559929022,"Nonadhesive conditions cause Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts to enter a quiescent state that is reversed upon reattachment to a surface. Previously, we demonstrated that adhesion in serum-free conditions is sufficient to activate suspension-arrested cells out of Go, with the induction of the growth-associated genes, c-fos, c-myc, and actin. In this study, we have employed this system to identify programs of gene expression that respond primarily to the adhesive state of the cell, rather than the growth state. We show that cells in different adhesive states can be distinguished by their patterns of protein synthesis. Analysis of one adhesion-responsive protein led to its identification as pro-alpha 1 (I)-collagen. Pro-alpha 1 (I)-collagen synthesis and mRNA levels are decreased up to 6-fold in suspension-arrested fibroblasts, but are enhanced up to 5-fold as cells approach confluence. This suggests that the reduced expression in suspension-arrested cells is not simply a result of quiescence. In addition, reattachment of suspended cells in serum-free conditions caused a 7-fold induction of collagen mRNA levels and a greater than 20-fold rise in the rate of procollagen synthesis. The expression of c-myc was induced during adhesion in serum-free medium as well as by serum addition to suspension-arrested cells. However, alpha 1 (I)-collagen gene expression was unaffected by serum in the absence of adhesion. These results indicate that collagen gene expression is directly responsive to cell adhesion, independent of the growth state."
https://openalex.org/W1563808999,"Two colchicine analogs with modifications only in the C ring are better inhibitors than colchicine of cell growth and tubulin polymerization. Radiolabeled thiocolchicine (with a thiomethyl instead of a methoxy group at position C-10) and N-acetylcolchinol O-methyl ether (NCME) (with a methoxy-substituted benzenoid instead of the methoxy-substituted tropone C ring) were prepared for comparison with colchicine. Scatchard analysis indicated a single binding site with KD values of 1.0-2.3 microM. Thiocolchicine was bound 2-4 times as rapidly as colchicine, but the activation energies of the reactions were nearly identical (18 kcal/mol for colchicine, 20 kcal/mol for thiocolchicine). NCME bound to tubulin in a biphasic reaction. The faster phase was 60 times as fast as colchicine binding at 37 degrees C, and a substantial reaction occurred at 0 degrees C. The rate of the faster phase of NCME binding changed relatively little as a function of temperature, so the activation energy was only 7.0 kcal/mol. Dissociation reactions were also evaluated, and at 37 degrees C the half-lives of the tubulin-drug complexes were 11 min for NCME, 24 h for thiocolchicine, and 27 h for colchicine. Relative dissociation rates as a function of temperature varied little among the drug complexes. Activation energies for the dissociation reactions were 30 kcal/mol for thiocolchicine, 27 kcal/mol for NCME, and 24 kcal/mol for colchicine. Comparison of the activation energies of association and dissociation yielded free energies for the binding reactions of -20 kcal/mol for NCME, -10 kcal/mol for thiocolchicine, and -6 kcal/mol for colchicine. The greater effectiveness of NCME and thiocolchicine as compared with colchicine in biological assays probably derives from their more rapid binding to tubulin and the lower free energies of their binding reactions."

https://openalex.org/W1635530194,"The recA protein from Escherichia coli can homologously align two duplex DNA molecules; however, this interaction is much less efficient than the alignment of a single strand and a duplex. Three strand paranemic joints are readily detected. In contrast, duplex-duplex pairing is detected only when the incoming (second) duplex is negatively supercoiled, and even here the pairing is inefficient. The recA protein-promoted four strand exchange reaction is initiated in a three strand region, with efficiency increasing with the length of potential three strand pairing available for initiation. This indicates that a paranemic joint involving three DNA strands may be an important intermediate in all recA protein-mediated DNA strand exchange reactions and that the presence of three strands rather than four is a fundamental structural parameter of paranemic joints."
https://openalex.org/W1590373873,"Mirabilis antiviral protein (MAP), a ribosome-inactivating protein, exhibits inhibitory effects on both plant virus infection and protein synthesis. To study these functions by site-specific mutagenesis, the total synthetic gene of MAP was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. However, the growth of the host was inhibited by the products, and the yield of MAP was very low. To improve the system for expressing MAP, an expression vector, pSH7, was constructed. This vector is based on the high copy number plasmid pUC19 and includes PL promoter and temperature-sensitive cI857 repressor. The plasmid also contains the ompA signal sequence and the total synthetic MAP gene. The MAP gene was expressed and its product was secreted into the culture medium after E. coli transformants were cultivated at 30 degrees C and the temperature was raised to 42 degrees C. The secreted MAP was then purified and characterized. This protein was identical to native MAP as determined by its mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the amino acid sequence at the NH2 terminus, and its inhibitory effect on in vitro protein synthesis. MAP was found to inhibit the in vitro protein synthesis of rabbit reticulocyte and wheat germ. It further showed an IC50 concentration of approximately 200 nM in an E. coli in vitro translation system in contrast to ricin A-chain, a well known ribosome-inactivating protein."
https://openalex.org/W1634475175,"Increased extracellular proteolysis because of unregulated activation of blood coagulation, complement, and fibrinolysis is observed in thrombosis, shock, and inflammation. In the present study, we have examined whether the plasma kallikrein-kinin system, the classical pathway of complement, and the fibrinolytic system could be inhibited by alpha 1-antitrypsin reactive site mutants. Wild-type alpha 1-antitrypsin contains a Met residue at P1 (position 358), the central position of the reactive center. It did not inhibit plasma kallikrein, beta-factor XIIa, plasmin, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), or urokinase. In contrast, these serine proteases were inhibited by alpha 1-antitrypsin Arg358. For the inhibition of C1s, a double mutant having Arg358 and a Pro----Ala mutation at P2 (position 357) was required. This double modification was made because C1-inhibitor, the natural inhibitor of C1s, has Arg and Ala residues at positions P1 and P2. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, the natural inhibitor of t-PA, also has Arg and Ala residues at positions P1 and P2. In a purified system, alpha 1-antitrypsin Ala357-Arg358 was 150-fold less efficient against C1s than C1-inhibitor and 27,000-fold less efficient against t-PA than plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In plasma, 2.3 microM alpha 1-antitrypsin Ala357-Arg358 reduced by 65% the formation of a complex between kallikrein and C1-inhibitor following activation of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation by kaolin. Furthermore, after supplementation by 2.0 microM alpha 1-antitrypsin Ala357-Arg358, zymographic analysis showed that the majority of the free t-PA of normal plasma formed a bimolecular complex with the double mutant. In contrast, 3.4 microM alpha 1-antitrypsin Ala357-Arg358 did not prevent the activation of the classical pathway of complement observed when normal serum is supplemented with anti-C1-inhibitor F(ab')2 fragment. These results demonstrate that alpha 1-antitrypsin Ala357-Arg358 has therapeutic potential for disorders with unregulated activation of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation and the fibrinolytic system; however, the double mutant is not an efficient inhibitor for the classical pathway of complement."

https://openalex.org/W1545111305,"The frequency of replication initiation of the ColIb-P9 plasmid depends on the level of repZ expression, which has been shown to be negatively regulated by inc RNA, the approximately 70-base-long product of the inc gene. To further understand the regulatory mechanism of repZ gene expression, we isolated mutants defective in ColIb-P9 replication using a lambda:ColIb-P9 hybrid phage. Among six mutants isolated, one amber mutant, rep57, failed to synthesize the RepZ protein. The mutation occurred in the repZ leader sequence that encodes a 29-amino-acid reading frame, designated as repY. We also isolated mutants that suppressed the rep57 phenotype. These mutations were single base insertions between the repY initiation codon and the rep57 mutation site and resulted not only in a frame shift of repY but also in the formation of repY-repZ fusions without changing the amino acid sequence of RepZ. Thus, repY is not directly involved in the replication reaction but rather functions as a positive regulator for repZ expression. We propose that repZ expression is coupled with repY translation, which acts to disrupt a secondary structure sequestering the repZ translation initiation signal. The positive and negative regulations of repZ expression were discussed. The other mutants were mapped in repZ, confirming that repZ is essential for ColIb-P9 replication."
https://openalex.org/W1593511294,"A mutant of the Escherichia coli lactose carrier has been selected (in an invertase-positive strain) based on its ability to grow on 6 mM sucrose in a manner dependent upon lactose carrier induction by isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside. The mutant was cloned, and DNA sequencing revealed a point mutation in lacY which changed alanine 177 to valine. The valine 177 mutation increased the transport rate for both [14C]sucrose and the maltose analog 4-nitrophenyl-alpha-maltoside. The potency for inhibition of beta-ONPG transport by several sugars containing the glucopyranosyl moiety (maltose, cellobiose, or palatinose) was increased significantly relative to the parental carrier. Similar experiments showed that the mutation did not affect the affinity for such commonly studied substrates as 4-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-galactopyranoside and beta-D-galactopyranosyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside. These data indicate that gross structural alteration of the galactoside binding site cannot account for increased transport of sucrose and maltose by the valine 177 mutant. We conclude that effects of the valine 177 mutation are not limited strictly to changes in observed sugar affinity and that sugar-specific changes in turnover number may be an important determinant of the altered spectrum of sugar specificities exhibited by the Val-177 carrier. These phenomena may be related to the effect of this mutation on proton recognition (described in King, S.C., and Wilson, T.H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9645-9651)."

https://openalex.org/W1592220984,"The ilvGMEDA operon of Escherichia coli, which encodes four of the five enzyme activities required for the biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine, is preceded by tandem promoters ilvPG1 and ilvPG2 which are separated by 72 base pairs. While both of these promoters are transcriptionally active in vitro, only the operon proximal promoter, ilvPG2, is transcriptionally active in vivo, and upstream DNA sequences encoding the ilvPG1 promoter region enhance the in vivo transcriptional activity of the ilvPG2 promoter 60-fold. The binding of the integration host factor protein (IHF) to this upstream region (Tsui, P., and Freundlich, M. (1989) J. Mol. Biol. 203, 817-820) has been shown to repress transcription from the ilvPG1 promoter both in vivo and in vitro (Pereira, R. F., Ortuno, M. J., and Lawther, R. P. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16, 5972-5989). Furthermore, E. coli strains deficient for IHF are compromised for isoleucine and valine biosynthesis (Friden, P., Voelkel, K., Sternglantz, R., and Freundlich, M. (1984) J. Mol. Biol. 172, 573-579). Therefore, in order to further understand this repressor/activator role of IHF, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the interaction of IHF with the DNA sequences in the ilvPG1 promoter region. The results of hydroxyl radical footprinting, dimethyl sulfate protection, and ethylation interference experiments show that IHF binds to a target site that overlaps the ilvPG1 promoter region. The results of these experiments also demonstrate that IHF interacts primarily with the minor groove of the DNA helix and that the IHF target site in the ilvPG1 promoter region shares a high degree of DNA sequence identity with other high affinity IHF target sites involved in DNA replication and site-specific recombination."

https://openalex.org/W1546588955,"Glucosidase I involved in the processing of N-linked glycoproteins was purified to homogeneity from the lactating rat mammary gland. The purified enzyme exhibited a single band at 85 kDa on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the enzyme recognized a similar band on Western blots and also inhibited the enzyme activity. The enzyme levels gradually increased until the midlactation stage and thereafter declined sharply during the period of postlactation. A similar profile of the levels of immunoreactive glucosidase I was observed. These findings suggest that the accumulation of glucosidase I is modulated as a function of gland ontogeny. The results on hormonal regulation of glucosidase I indicate that the synthesis of the enzyme is stimulated by a combination of insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin; additionally, epidermal growth factor may play a role in this regulation. The above observation was substantiated by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled microsomal extracts with anti-glucosidase I antibodies. The immunoprecipitation of soluble extracts from [35S]methionine-labeled tissue with anti-rat alpha-lactalbumin antibodies indicates that these hormones not only stimulate the synthesis of alpha-lactalbumin but also play an important role in its glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1578938503,"A vaccinia virus vector was used to express the yeast KEX1 gene, which encodes a prohormone carboxypeptidase specific for the removal of basic amino acids from prohormone processing intermediates, in mammalian cells. When produced in BSC-40 cells, Kex1p was localized to the perinuclear region and conferred a large increase in enzymatic activity characteristic of this carboxypeptidase. Expression of the KEX1 gene together with the yeast KEX2 gene, which encodes a prohormone endopeptidase specific for cleavage at pairs of basic amino acids, and the mouse proopiomelanocortin (mPOMC) cDNA in BSC-40 cells resulted in the full conversion of mPOMC to mature peptides including gamma-lipotropin. This in vivo processing of mPOMC to mature peptides by the KEX2/KEX1 gene products demonstrates a significant functional homology of the basic prohormone processing machinery in yeast and neuroendocrine cells."

https://openalex.org/W1621016408,"Escherichia coli DNA photolyase was overproduced and purified from each of two mutant E. coli strains lacking dihydrofolate reductase. The extent of over-production in the mutants was comparable to that seen in the wild type strain. Examination of the isolated photolyase from these strains revealed that the folate cofactor, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, was present in these proteins at a level of 60-80% compared to that purified from the wild type strain. Further examination of the dihydrofolate reductase-deficient strains revealed the presence of other tetrahydrofolate derivatives. These findings demonstrate that dihydrofolate reductase is not essential for the production of tetrahydrofolates in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1487530692,"A cluster of conserved histidines and arginines (His-62, His-167, Arg-21, Arg-38, and Arg-168) in 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) has been implicated as possibly involved in the binding of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and/or stabilization of the negatively charged transition state. The role of these residues in the catalytic function of yeast PGK and in the substrate- and sulfate-dependent activation was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. The following substitutions, R21A, R21Q, H62Q, H167S, and R168Q, produced functional enzymes. In contrast, the R38A and R38Q mutations resulted in a complete loss of catalytic activity. These results demonstrate that of the basic residues studied, only arginine 38 is essential for the catalytic function of PGK. A moderate decrease in the catalytic efficiency as the result of the R21A, H167S, and R168Q mutations and an increased catalytic efficiency of the H62Q mutant rule out a possible role of a positive charge at these positions in the mechanism of phosphoryl transfer reaction. In contrast to the wild type PGK and the H62Q mutant, both of which are activated at low and inhibited at high sulfate concentration, the H167S, R168Q, and R21A mutants exhibited a progressive inhibition with increased concentration of sulfate. The activation observed at high concentration of either ATP or 3-PG as a variable substrate in the steady-state kinetics of wild type PGK was abolished as the result of the latter three mutations. The results of this work support the hypothesis that PGK has two binding sites for anionic ligands, the catalytic and regulatory sites for each substrate and the activatory and inhibitory sites for sulfate, and suggest that arginine 21, arginine 168, and histidine 167 are located in the activatory anion binding site, common for sulfate, 3-PG, and ATP. The increased Km values for both substrates and decreased specific activities of the mutants suggest that this regulatory site is close to the catalytic site."

https://openalex.org/W1512244694,"Iodoacetic acid inactivates dehydroquinase by simultaneously alkylating 2 methionine residues (Met-23 and Met-205), presumed to be active site residues (described in Kleanthous, C., Campbell, D. G., and Coggins, J. R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 10929-10934). Although both sites are carboxymethylated to the same degree in the inactivated enzyme, the modification of Met-205 may be reversed by treatment with mercaptoethanol at alkaline pH, as shown by the stoichiometric loss of label from this site. This, in turn, leads to partial reactivation of the inactive enzyme. Alkylation of Met-23 is not reversible under these conditions. The chemistry of the cleavage reaction at Met-205 was investigated by isolating the cleavage product which was identified by mass spectrometry as the ammonium salt of 2-hydroxyethyl thioacetate. This result is consistent with nucleophilic attack by the thiolate anion of mercaptoethanol on the alpha-carbon of the carboxymethyl moiety, which restores the side chain of the methionine residue (Met-205) and liberates 2-hydroxyethyl thioacetate. The differential reactivity of the 2 carboxymethylated methionine residues toward mercaptoethanol is likely to be a reflection of their different microenvironments in the folded protein. This assertion is borne out by unfolding experiments which indicate that neither of the carboxymethylated methionine residues in dicarboxymethylated dehydroquinase is susceptible to mercaptoethanol cleavage if the protein is first denatured by either guanidine hydrochloride or urea. Furthermore, this denatured material refolds after removal of denaturant to yield protein with reactivation properties similar to untreated, dicarboxymethylated enzyme."
