https://openalex.org/W3039901154,"A SARS-CoV-2 variant carrying the Spike protein amino acid change D614G has become the most prevalent form in the global pandemic. Dynamic tracking of variant frequencies revealed a recurrent pattern of G614 increase at multiple geographic levels: national, regional, and municipal. The shift occurred even in local epidemics where the original D614 form was well established prior to introduction of the G614 variant. The consistency of this pattern was highly statistically significant, suggesting that the G614 variant may have a fitness advantage. We found that the G614 variant grows to a higher titer as pseudotyped virions. In infected individuals, G614 is associated with lower RT-PCR cycle thresholds, suggestive of higher upper respiratory tract viral loads, but not with increased disease severity. These findings illuminate changes important for a mechanistic understanding of the virus and support continuing surveillance of Spike mutations to aid with development of immunological interventions."

Several structures have shown a stabilized ectodomain of the spike in its prefusion conformation. Cai et al. now provide insight into the structural changes in the S protein that result in the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. They purified full-length S protein and determined cryo–electron microscopy structures of both the prefusion and postfusion conformations. These structures add to our understanding of S protein function and could inform vaccine design. Science , this issue p. 1586"

To develop antiviral interventions quickly, drugs used for the treatment of unrelated diseases are currently being repurposed to treat COVID-19. Chloroquine is an anti-malaria drug that is used for the treatment of COVID-19 as it inhibits the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the African green monkey kidney-derived cell line Vero1–3. Here we show that engineered expression of TMPRSS2, a cellular protease that activates SARS-CoV-2 for entry into lung cells4, renders SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells insensitive to chloroquine. Moreover, we report that chloroquine does not block infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the TMPRSS2-expressing human lung cell line Calu-3. These results indicate that chloroquine targets a pathway for viral activation that is not active in lung cells and is unlikely to protect against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in and between patients. Expression of TMPRSS2—a protease that activates SARS-CoV-2 for entry into cells—renders SARS-CoV-2 insensitive to chloroquine."
https://openalex.org/W3045248985,"From cough to splutter In epidemiology, serial intervals are measured from when one infected person starts to show symptoms to when the next person infected becomes symptomatic. For any specific infection, the serial interval is assumed to be a fixed characteristic. Using valuable transmission pair data for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in mainland China, Ali et al. noticed that the average serial interval changed as nonpharmaceutical interventions were introduced. In mid-January 2020, serial intervals were on average 7.8 days, whereas in early February 2020, they decreased to an average of 2.2 days. The more quickly infected persons were identified and isolated, the shorter the serial interval became and the fewer the opportunities for virus transmission. The change in serial interval may not only measure the effectiveness of infection control interventions but may also indicate rising population immunity. Science , this issue p. 1106"
https://openalex.org/W3045220852,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global pandemic and no antiviral drug or vaccine is yet available for the treatment of this disease1–3. Several clinical studies are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of repurposed drugs that have demonstrated antiviral efficacy in vitro. Among these candidates, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been given to thousands of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—the virus that causes COVID-19—worldwide but there is no definitive evidence that HCQ is effective for treating COVID-194–7. Here we evaluated the antiviral activity of HCQ both in vitro and in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques. HCQ showed antiviral activity in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6) but not in a model of reconstituted human airway epithelium. In macaques, we tested different treatment strategies in comparison to a placebo treatment, before and after peak viral load, alone or in combination with azithromycin (AZTH). Neither HCQ nor the combination of HCQ and AZTH showed a significant effect on viral load in any of the analysed tissues. When the drug was used as a pre-exposure prophylaxis treatment, HCQ did not confer protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2. Our findings do not support the use of HCQ, either alone or in combination with AZTH, as an antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans. Hydroxychloroquine did not confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection or reduce the viral load after infection in macaques; these findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine as an antiviral drug treatment of COVID-19 in humans."

We whole-genome sequenced 446 colonic crypts from 46 IBD patients and compared these to 412 crypts from 41 non-IBD controls from our previous publication on the mutation landscape of the normal colon. The average mutation rate of affected colonic epithelial cells is 2.4-fold that of healthy colon, and this increase is mostly driven by acceleration of mutational processes ubiquitously observed in normal colon. In contrast to the normal colon, where clonal expansions outside the confines of the crypt are rare, we observed widespread millimeter-scale clonal expansions. We discovered non-synonymous mutations in ARID1A, FBXW7, PIGR, ZC3H12A, and genes in the interleukin 17 and Toll-like receptor pathways, under positive selection in IBD. These results suggest distinct selection mechanisms in the colitis-affected colon and that somatic mutations potentially play a causal role in IBD pathogenesis.

These results suggest distinct selection mechanisms in the colitis-affected colon and that somatic mutations potentially play a causal role in IBD pathogenesis. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a debilitating disease characterized by repeated flares of intestinal inflammation. The two major subtypes of IBD, Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are distinguished by the location, continuity, and nature of the inflammatory lesions. UC affects only the large intestine, spreading continuously from the distal to proximal colon, whereas CD most commonly affects the small and large intestine and is characterized by discontinuous patches of inflammation. In addition to the significant morbidity associated with the disease, IBD patients have a 1.7-fold increased risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers compared to the general population. Cancer risk is associated with the duration, extent, and severity of disease, and cancers tend to occur earlier in life in IBD patients (Lutgens et al., 2013Lutgens M.W.M.D. van Oijen M.G. van der Heijden G.J.

That somatic mutations contribute to the development of cancer is well established, but their patterns, burden, and functional consequences in diseases other than cancer have not been extensively studied. Methodological developments have now enabled the analysis of polyclonal somatic tissues, allowing characterization of somatic mutations in normal tissues such as skin (Martincorena et al., 2015Martincorena I.

In the setting of non-neoplastic diseases, chronic liver disease has had the most attention, with studies showing that compared to healthy liver, hepatic cirrhosis is associated with acquisition of new mutational processes, increased mutation burden and larger clonal expansions (Brunner et al., 2019Brunner S.F.

Colonic epithelium is well suited to the study of somatic mutations because of its clonal structure. It is organized into millions of colonic crypts, finger-like invaginations composed of ∼2,000 cells (Potten et al., 1992Potten C.S. Kellett M. Roberts S.A. Rew D.A. Wilson G.D. Measurement of in vivo proliferation in human colorectal mucosa using bromodeoxyuridine.Gut. 1992; 33: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) each extending into the lamina propria below. At the base of each crypt reside a small number of stem cells undergoing continuous self-renewal through stochastic cell divisions (Lopez-Garcia et al., 2010Lopez-Garcia C. Klein A.M. Simons B.D. Winton D.J. Intestinal stem cell replacement follows a pattern of neutral drift.Science. 2010; 330: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar; Snippert et al., 2010Snippert H.J. van der Flier L.G.

Intestinal crypt homeostasis results from neutral competition between symmetrically dividing Lgr5 stem cells.Cell. 2010; 143: 134-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). As a result, the progeny of a single stem cell iteratively sweeps through the entire niche, and the epithelial cells that line the crypt are the progeny of this single clone. Active IBD disrupts these normal stem cell dynamics—the epithelial lining is damaged, the organized crypt structure is ablated, and the barrier between lumen and mucosa is disrupted. We hypothesized that the recurrent cycles of inflammation, ulceration, and regeneration seen in IBD could impact the mutational and clonal structure of intestinal epithelial cells. To test these hypotheses, we isolated and whole-genome sequenced 446 colonic crypts from 46 IBD patients with varying degrees of colonic inflammation, both active and previous, and compared the mutation burden, clonal structure, mutagen exposure, and driver mutation landscape to colonic crypts from healthy donors (Lee-Six et al., 2019Lee-Six H. Olafsson S. Ellis P. Osborne R.J. Sanders M.A. Moore L. Georgakopoulos N. Torrente F. Noorani A. Goddard M. et al.The landscape of somatic mutation in normal colorectal epithelial cells.Nature. 2019; 574: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We used laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate 446 colonic crypts from endoscopic biopsies taken from 28 UC patients and 18 CD patients (Table S1). Biopsies were annotated as never, previously, or actively inflamed at the time of sampling (STAR Methods). The dissected crypts were whole-genome sequenced to a median depth of 18.2X, allowing us to call somatic substitutions and small insertions and deletions (indels) with high specificity and sensitivity (Figure S1; STAR Methods). We also called larger copy number changes, somatic retrotranspositions, and aneuploidies affecting whole chromosomes or chromosome arms (Tables S2 and S3; STAR Methods). To assess if IBD is associated with a difference in the mutation burden of the colonic epithelium, we combined our data with data from 412 crypts sequenced as part of our recent study of somatic mutations in normal colon (Lee-Six et al., 2019Lee-Six H. Olafsson S. Ellis P. Osborne R.J. Sanders M.A. Moore L. Georgakopoulos N. Torrente F. Noorani A. Goddard M. et al.The landscape of somatic mutation in normal colorectal epithelial cells.Nature. 2019; 574: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (hereafter referred to as the control data). We fitted linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) to estimate the independent effects of age, disease duration, and biopsy location on mutation burden, while controlling for the within-patient and within-biopsy correlations inherent in our sampling strategy (STAR Methods). Disease duration was included in the model as a proxy for inflammation exposure. We estimated the effect of IBD to be 55 substitutions per crypt per year of disease duration (35–75 95% confidence interval [CI], p = 3.1 × 10−7, LMMs and likelihood ratio test; Figure 1). These mutations are in addition to the 40 (31–50, 95% CI) substitutions we estimated are accumulated on average per year of life under normal conditions, suggesting that mutation rates are increased ∼2.4-fold in regions of the IBD-affected colon on average. Compared to controls, patients with IBD had greater between-patient variance in mutation burden (SD = 776 versus 383 substitutions and SD = 80 versus 34 indels for cases and controls, p = 4.2 × 10−8 and p = 1.1 × 10−16, respectively; LMMs and likelihood ratio test) and greater within-patient variance (SD = 955 versus 407 substitutions and SD = 81 and 18 indels for cases and controls, p = 0.032 and p = 0.0011, respectively). The increased between-patient variance likely reflects differences in inflammation exposure not captured by disease duration, because it does not account for variable disease severity, response to treatment, etc. among patients. The increased within-patient variance probably reflects region-to-region differences in disease severity along the colon. We similarly estimated an increase in the indel burden in IBD, with an excess of 6.8 indels per crypt per year of IBD (5.0—8.7 95% CI, p = 5.7 × 10−11; Figure 1) in addition to the estimated 1.0 (0.3–1.7 95% CI) indel that is accumulated per crypt per year of life. As shown in Figure 1B, a handful of clones and patients had a much higher mutation burden than expected given their age. This is partially driven by the effect of smoking and cancer driver status, as discussed below. The effect of IBD on the mutation burden remains significant if crypts carrying driver mutations, or the five IBD patients with the highest mutation burdens, are excluded (p = 0.0014 and 0.0099 for substitutions and p = 6.8 × 10−6 and 1.1 × 10−5 for indels, respectively). We found no significant difference in the mutation burden between UC and CD patients. Smoking status was available for a subset of the IBD cohort (35 patients who contributed 362 crypts). In this restricted dataset, we found an effect of smoking duration of 49 (18–81 95% CI, p = 0.0024) substitutions and 5.3 (2.3–8.2 95% CI, p = 6.5 × 10−4) indels per crypt per year of smoking. The effect of disease duration was unchanged, suggesting this effect is not driven by differences in smoking habits between cases and controls. Smoking has been reported to increase the risk of CD and be protective for UC (Mahid et al., 2006Mahid S.S. Minor K.S. Soto R.E. Hornung C.A. Galandiuk S. Smoking and inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis.Mayo Clin. Proc. 2006; 81: 1462-1471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), but we found no interaction effect between smoking and disease type (p = 0.68). Smoking status was not available for the control cohort. The full details of all LMMs are available in a GitHub directory accompanying this submission (https://github.com/Solafsson/somaticIBD/). The somatic mutations found in the cells of a colonic crypt reflect the mutational processes that have acted on the stem cells and their progenitors since conception. Distinct mutational processes each leave a characteristic pattern, a mutational signature, within the genome, distinguished by the specific base changes and their local sequence context (Alexandrov et al., 2013Alexandrov L.B.

We extracted mutational signatures jointly for IBD and control crypts and discovered 12 substitution signatures (SBS) and five indel signatures (ID), all of which have been previously observed in tissues from individuals without IBD (Figure S2; Table S2; STAR Methods). Comparing our IBD cases and controls, we found that ∼80% of the increase in mutation burden in cases is explained by signatures that are also found ubiquitously in normal colon (Blokzijl et al., 2016Blokzijl F. de Ligt J. Jager M. Sasselli V. Roerink S. Sasaki N. Huch M. Boymans S. Kuijk E.

These are substitution signatures 1, 5, and 18 and indel signatures 1 and 2, as defined by Alexandrov et al., 2020Alexandrov L.B. Kim J. Haradhvala N.J. Huang M.N. Tian Ng A.W. Wu Y. Boot A.

Substitution signatures 1 and 5 are clock-like and thought to be associated with cell proliferation, whereas signature 18 has been linked with reactive oxygen species (Alexandrov et al., 2020Alexandrov L.B. Kim J. Haradhvala N.J. Huang M.N. Tian Ng A.W. Wu Y. Boot A. Covington K.R. Gordenin D.A. Bergstrom E.N. et al.PCAWG Mutational Signatures Working GroupPCAWG ConsortiumThe repertoire of mutational signatures in human cancer.Nature. 2020; 578: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The indel signatures ID1 and ID2 are both thought to be the result of polymerase slippage during DNA replication (Alexandrov et al., 2020Alexandrov L.B. Kim J. Haradhvala N.J. Huang M.N. Tian Ng A.W. Wu Y. Boot A. Covington K.R. Gordenin D.A. Bergstrom E.N. et al.PCAWG Mutational Signatures Working GroupPCAWG ConsortiumThe repertoire of mutational signatures in human cancer.Nature. 2020; 578: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The remaining 20% of the increase in substitution burden is a consequence of rarer mutational processes and treatment. For example, 96 crypts had over 150 mutations attributed to purine treatment in a subset of seven IBD patients, five of whom have a documented history of such treatment. However, the number of mutations attributed to purine was not associated with purine therapy duration, and some patients showed large mutation burdens despite brief, or indeed no, documented exposure. For example, one patient received azathioprine for 2 weeks and mercaptopurine for 2 weeks and had significant adverse reactions to both drugs. This brief treatment resulted in a median of 204 mutations (range: 120–374) attributed to purine treatment in the crypts from this individual. Other patients had long-term exposure to azathioprine without accruing any purine-related mutations (Figure 2B). There was also great within-patient variation in the burden of the purine signature. The largest range was observed for patient 40, which has a 7 year history of purine treatment. The estimated burden of the purine signature in crypts from this patient ranged from 69–1,005. The reason for this large variation in purine-related mutation burden remains unknown, although it is associated with the number of putative cancer drivers (see below). Thiopurine use has been associated with higher overall cancer risk in epidemiological studies, but this is mostly driven by an effect on lymphoid cancers and possibly on urinary tract cancers, but not colorectal cancers (Pasternak et al., 2013Pasternak B. Svanström H. Schmiegelow K. Jess T. Hviid A. Use of azathioprine and the risk of cancer in inflammatory bowel disease.Am. J.

The continuing uncertainty about cancer risk in inflammatory bowel disease.Gut. 2016; 65: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The relationship between purines and colon cancer is complicated and requires further study. On one hand, our results show purine-related mutations accumulating in the crypts of a subset of patients, but on the other hand, effective purine treatment may prevent disease-related mutagenesis. Five signatures previously discovered in the normal colon (Lee-Six et al., 2019Lee-Six H. Olafsson S. Ellis P. Osborne R.J. Sanders M.A. Moore L. Georgakopoulos N. Torrente F. Noorani A. Goddard M. et al.The landscape of somatic mutation in normal colorectal epithelial cells.Nature. 2019; 574: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), SBSA, SBSB, SBSC, IDA, and IDB were also present in the context of IBD. SBSA and IDA and SBSB and IDB are highly correlated (Figure S2B) and likely represent the same underlying mutational processes. SBSA and IDA are of particular interest because they have recently been shown to be caused by the genotoxin colibactin, which is produced by bacteria harboring a polyketide synthases (pks) pathogenicity island (Pleguezuelos-Manzano et al., 2020Pleguezuelos-Manzano C.

As in normal colon, SBSA and SBSB were primarily found in early branches of the phylogenetic trees (Figures S3 and S4). Signatures SBSB, SBSC, and SBS32 have not been reported in studies of sporadic colorectal cancers (Alexandrov et al., 2020Alexandrov L.B. Kim J. Haradhvala N.J. Huang M.N. Tian Ng A.W. Wu Y. Boot A.

SBS32, however, would only be expected in patients receiving purine therapy and so would not be present in sporadic colorectal cancers.

Signatures 2 and 13, which are associated with APOBEC activity, and signatures 17a and 17b, which are of unknown etiology, were active in a small number of crypts with high mutation burdens. SBSB, SBSC, SBS17a/b, and SBS2/SBS13 are too rare for us to be powered to detect any difference between IBD and controls or to associate these with any clinical feature documented in our metadata. Finally, we found signature 35, associated with platinum compound therapy, in one patient with a history of platinum treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The patient received 40 mg/m2 of cisplatin therapy on a weekly basis. He completed three of six planned treatment cycles with therapy termination due to toxicity. This relatively brief treatment resulted in a medium of 430 mutations (range: 350–461) per crypt that were attributed to signature 35, equivalent to ∼10 years of normal mutagenesis. In crypts from this individual, we also observed a small number of double base substitutions of CT > AA and CT > AC classes (median 6, range: 5–13), probably indicative of DBS5, which has also been linked with platinum treatment. We called copy number variants (CNVs), somatic retrotranspositions, and loss-of-heterozygosity events affecting whole chromosomes or chromosome arms (referred to here as aneuploidies for simplicity) in both our IBD cases and non-IBD controls. The burden of structural variants is modest in both datasets (Figure 3), but for IBD, we identified the occasional clone that carried a large number of CNVs and ret"
https://openalex.org/W3045466751,"Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a key component of constitutive heterochromatin, which is crucial for chromosome maintenance and transcriptional silencing1-3. Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause the progressive neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome3-5, which is associated with severe mental disability and autism-like symptoms that affect girls during early childhood. Although previously thought to be a dense and relatively static structure1,2, heterochromatin is now understood to exhibit properties consistent with a liquid-like condensate6,7. Here we show that MeCP2 is a dynamic component of heterochromatin condensates in cells, and is stimulated by DNA to form liquid-like condensates. MeCP2 contains several domains that contribute to the formation of condensates, and mutations in MECP2 that lead to Rett syndrome disrupt the ability of MeCP2 to form condensates. Condensates formed by MeCP2 selectively incorporate and concentrate heterochromatin cofactors rather than components of euchromatic transcriptionally active condensates. We propose that MeCP2 enhances the separation of heterochromatin and euchromatin through its condensate partitioning properties, and that disruption of condensates may be a common consequence of mutations in MeCP2 that cause Rett syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W3044095240,"PD1 blockade-based combination therapy has been approved as a first-line treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the response rate remains relatively low, and patients with HNSCC eventually relapse. Here, we show that the combination treatment of anti-PD1 and cisplatin enriched BMI1+ CSCs in HNSCC while inhibiting HNSCC growth. In contrast, the pharmacological and genetic inhibition of BMI1 eliminated BMI1+ CSCs and enabled PD1 blockade therapy, resulting in the inhibition of metastatic HNSCC and prevention of HNSCC relapses. BMI1 inhibition strongly induced tumor cell-intrinsic immune responses by recruiting and activating CD8+ T cells in addition to eliminating BMI1+ CSCs. Mechanistically, BMI1 inhibition induced CD8+ T cell-recruiting chemokines by stimulating IRF3-mediated transcription and erasing repressive H2A ubiquitination. Our results suggest that targeting BMI1 may enable immune checkpoint blockade to inhibit metastatic tumor growth and prevent tumor relapse by activating cell-intrinsic immunity, in addition to purging CSCs."

These receptors are activated by binding of a family of ligands that include EGF, transforming growth factor α (TGF-α), amphiregulin and epigen, which interact with EGFR, as well as heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor, epiregulin, betacellulin, and neuregulin (NRG) 1–4 that interact with multiple receptors (Lemmon et al., 2014Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J.

The phenotypic differences observed between ligand and receptor knockouts overall suggests other ligands that interact with EGFR family must be responsible for driving ISC proliferation. The NRGs, which are part of the EGF family of ligands, interact with EGF and ErbB receptors (Britsch, 2007Britsch S. The neuregulin-I/ErbB signaling system in development and disease.Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 2007; 190: 1-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). NRG1 is critical for the establishment and proliferation of mouse mammary gland organoids (Jardé et al., 2016Jardé T. Lloyd-Lewis B. Thomas M. Kendrick H. Melchor L. Bougaret L. Watson P.D. Ewan K. Smalley M.J. Dale T.C. Wnt and Neuregulin1/ErbB signalling extends 3D culture of hormone responsive mammary organoids.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13207Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NRG1 has been implicated as a key driver of regeneration in a variety of tissues. For example, NRG1 secreted from nerves drives proliferation of cells within the blastema during regeneration of axolotl limbs (Farkas et al., 2016Farkas J.E. Freitas P.D. Bryant D.M. Whited J.L. Monaghan J.R. Neuregulin-1 signaling is essential for nerve-dependent axolotl limb regeneration.Development. 2016; 143: 2724-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and regulates repair mechanisms of spinal axons after injury (Bartus et al., 2016Bartus K. Galino J. James N.D. Hernandez-Miranda L.R. Dawes J.M. Fricker F.R. Garratt A.N. McMahon S.B. Ramer M.S. Birchmeier C. et al.Neuregulin-1 controls an endogenous repair mechanism after spinal cord injury.Brain. 2016; 139: 1394-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). NRG1 is also induced during cardiac damage in zebrafish (Gemberling et al., 2015Gemberling M. Karra R. Dickson A.L. Poss K.D. Nrg1 is an injury-induced cardiomyocyte mitogen for the endogenous heart regeneration program in zebrafish.eLife. 2015; 4: e05871Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and can induce proliferation of cardiomyocytes (Rupert and Coulombe, 2015Rupert C.E. Coulombe K.L. The roles of neuregulin-1 in cardiac development, homeostasis, and disease.Biomark. Insights. 2015; 10: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). However, the regenerative properties of this ligand in the intestine in vivo have not yet been explored. In this study, we investigated the role of EGF ligands during the regeneration of the epithelium following damage. Surprisingly, we found that NRG1, not EGF, is upregulated by niche cells during tissue regeneration. Our data also revealed robust induction of proliferation of ISCs and progenitors by NRG1, which challenges the concept that EGF is the main signaling ligand that drives proliferation of intestinal cells. These data provide critical insight into the regenerative signals activated upon damage and support a model where NRG1 is upregulated following injury in mesenchymal cells to drive proliferation in crypts. To investigate the role of EGF family ligands in epithelial repair following tissue damage, we challenged wild-type mice using two injury models, 13 Gy irradiation and exposure to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Both models induce DNA damage and apoptosis in proliferative cells within intestinal crypts (Potten and Grant, 1998Potten C.S. Grant H.K. The relationship between ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis and stem cells in the small and large intestine.Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 993-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This results in a dramatic shortening of crypts at day 2, followed by a period of rapid regeneration where progenitor cells display extensive plasticity and de-differentiate to drive increased proliferation, leading to crypt cell repopulation (Figures S1A and S1B; Ayyaz et al., 2019Ayyaz A.

The expression of EGF and NRG ligands during tissue regeneration was quantified in the small intestine (SI) following damage after injury (day 2 post-treatment) and during regeneration (day 5 post-injury; Figures 1A, 1C, S1C, and S1D). Alongside this, the expression of ISC markers Lgr5 and Olfm4 were examined. Two days after injury, Olfm4 and Lgr5 expression was downregulated as a reflection of injury-induced stem cell loss but was restored by day 5 (Figures 1A, 1C, S1A, and S1B; Nusse et al., 2018Nusse Y.M.

Strikingly, regeneration was marked by a robust increase in Nrg1 expression in both injury models, in contrast to the other ligands, where expression was either downregulated or unaltered (Figures 1A, 1C, S1C, and S1D). A strong NRG1 signal was detected in the vicinity of regenerating crypts post-injury (Figures 1B and 1D). The expression of the NRG1 receptor, ErbB3, was more abundant in regenerating crypts in both injury models (Figures S1E and S1F). These data suggest that NRG1 is a key endogenous ligand contributing to intestinal tissue regeneration following damage. To investigate the capacity of NRG1 to sustain efficient regeneration, proliferation, and differentiation, we examined the ability of NRG1 to support the growth of SI organoids. Organoid culture can also be considered a regeneration model, as it involves activation of defined signaling pathways critical for tissue regeneration, including transient activation of YAP, and leads to the development of complex intestinal structures starting from a single isolated crypt (Chiacchiera et al., 2016Chiacchiera F.

In the presence of EGF, which is one of the original constituents of the growth factor cocktail (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H.

Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3257) Google Scholar), organoids developed crypt domains that contain bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)+ proliferative cells. In marked contrast, organoids treated with NRG1 and without EGF were much larger, with buds composed of numerous rapidly proliferating cells, as shown by BrdU incorporation (Figures 1E and 1F). NRG1 dramatically increased organoid growth by 4-fold compared to EGF over 4 days (Figure 1G). EGF was no longer required, demonstrating that NRG1 can substitute for EGF. Furthermore, no cumulative effect was evident when both EGF and NRG1 were present (Figure 1G). The activation of MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling downstream of NRG1 has been described in several contexts (Britsch, 2007Britsch S. The neuregulin-I/ErbB signaling system in development and disease.Adv.

In healthy brains, spatially tuned hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells exhibit distinct spike patterns in different environments, a circuit function called ""remapping."" We tested remapping in amyloid precursor protein knockin (APP-KI) mice with impaired spatial memory. CA1 neurons, including place cells, showed disrupted remapping, although their spatial tuning was only mildly diminished. Medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) neurons severely lost their spatial tuning and grid cells were almost absent. Fast gamma oscillatory coupling between the MEC and CA1 was also impaired. Mild disruption of MEC grid cells emerged in younger APP-KI mice, although the spatial memory and CA1 remapping of the animals remained intact. These results point to remapping impairment in the hippocampus, possibly linked to grid cell disruption, as circuit mechanisms underlying spatial memory impairment in AD."
https://openalex.org/W3044515302,"The early peopling of the Americas has been one of the most hotly contested topics in American anthropology and a research issue that draws archaeologists into a multidisciplinary debate. In South America, although the background data on this issue has increased exponentially in recent decades, the core questions related to the temporal and spatial patterns of the colonization process remain open. In this paper we tackle these questions in the light of the quantitative analysis of a screened radiocarbon database of more than 1600 early dates. We explore the frequency of radiocarbon dates as proxies for assessing population growth; and define a reliable and statistically well supported lower chronological bound (not to the exact date) for the earliest human arrival. Our results suggest that the earliest chronological threshold for the peopling of South America should be between 16,600 and 15,100, with a mean estimated date ~ 15,500 cal BP (post Last Glacial Maximum). Population would have grown until the end of Antarctic Cold Reversal stadial ~12,500 cal BP at the time of the main extinctions of megafauna-, when the increase rate slows, probably as a result of the changes that occurred in the trophic niche of humans."
https://openalex.org/W3045149268,"Background Whole-body vibration (WBV) is a method utilizing vibrating platforms to expose individuals to mechanical vibration. In its various applications, it has been linked to improved muscular, skeletal, metabolic, or cognitive functioning, quality of life, and physiological parameters such as blood pressure. Most evidence concerning WBV is inconclusive and meta-analytical reviews may not readily produce insights since the research has a risk of misunderstandings of vibration parameters and incomplete reporting occurs. This study aims at laying an empirical foundation for reporting guidelines for human WBV studies to improve the quality of reporting and the currently limited comparability between studies. Method The Delphi methodology is employed to exploit the integrated knowledge of WBV experts to distil the specific aspects of WBV methodology that should be included in such guidelines. Over three rounds of completing online questionnaires, the expert panel (round 1/2/3: 51/40/37 experts respectively from 17 countries with an average of 19.4 years of WBV research experience) rated candidate items. Results A 40-item list was established based on the ratings of the individual items from the expert panel with a large final consensus (94.6%). Conclusion The final consensus indicates comprehensiveness and valuableness of the list. The results are in line with previous guidelines but expand these extensively. The present results may therefore serve as a foundation for updated guidelines for reporting human WBV studies in order to improve the quality of reporting of WBV studies, improve comparability of studies and facilitate the development of WBV study designs."

We analyze the trends of social production and resumption of life after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-influenced Spring Festival in 2020 with statistics on reported cases of COVID-19 from China’s National Health Commission and big data from Baidu Migration (a platform collecting population migration data). We find that (1) the distribution of COVID-19 cases throughout mainland China has a specific spatial pattern. Provinces in eastern China have more reported cases than those in western China, and provinces adjacent to Hubei have more confirmed COVID-19 cases than nonadjacent provinces. Densely populated regions with well-developed economies and transportation are more likely to have cluster infection incidents. (2) The COVID-19 epidemic severely impacts the return of the migrant population in the Spring Festival travel rush, as demonstrated by the significant reduction in the return scale, along with the extended timespan and uncertainty regarding the end of the travel rush. Among 33 provinces, special administrative regions, autonomous regions and municipalities, 23 of them (approximately 70%) have a return rate below 60%. Hubei, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia have the lowest return rates (below 5%), whereas the return rates in Hainan and Shandong, 272.72% and 97.35%, respectively, indicate the best trend of resumption. Due to government regulations, the population return in densely populated and well-developed regions shows a positive trend. (3) The resumption of urban traffic is slow and varies greatly in different regions. The urban traffic conditions in 22 provinces and municipalities have a more than 60% level of resumption. Guizhou and Yunnan have the highest level of resumption of urban traffic, whereas Xinjiang, Hubei, and Heilongjiang have the lowest (29.37%, 35.76%, and 37.90%, respectively). However, provinces and municipalities with well-developed intercity traffic have a lower level of resumption, mainly because of regulatory methods such as lockdowns and traffic restrictions. The increased public awareness of epidemic prevention and the decreased frequency of outdoor activities are also two positive factors slowing the spread of the epidemic. (4) Time will be necessary to fully resume social production and life throughout China. Xining and Jinan have the highest levels of resumption, 82.14% and 71.51%, respectively. Urumqi and Wuhan are the cities with the lowest levels of resumption, only 0.11% and 0.61%, respectively. Currently, 12 of 33 provinces and municipalities have levels of resumption of more than 80%; among them, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Gansu have with the highest levels of resumption and have nearly resumed the 2019 levels of work and life, whereas Xinjiang and Hubei have the lowest resumption rates, only 0.09% and 7.57%, respectively. Thus, relevant government departments should focus more on densely populated and well-developed provinces and cities when applying epidemic prevention and work resumption methods. We reveal the general conditions of the epidemic and the population return scale across China, along with urban traffic conditions and the resumption of social production and life under COVID-19, providing a scientific basis for local governments to make further decisions on work resumption."

A total of 108 fungi, 40 bacteria and 2 oomycetes were isolated. These isolates were then taxonomically identified using a combination of molecular and phylogenetic methods. The majority of the fungal isolates were classified as belonging to the classes Eurotiomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Sordariomycetes. Most fungal isolates were habitat generalists like Penicillium sp. and Cladosporium sp., but we also cultured a diverse set of rare taxa including possible habitat specialists like Colletotrichum sp. which may preferentially associate with Z. marina leaf tissue. Although the bulk of bacterial isolates were identified as being from known ubiquitous marine lineages, we also obtained several Actinomycetes isolates and a Phyllobacterium sp. We identified two oomycetes, another understudied group of marine microbial eukaryotes, as Halophytophthora sp. which may be opportunistic pathogens or saprophytes of Z. marina.

https://openalex.org/W3045319422,"Background Suicide is one of the most common causes of death among female adolescents. A greater risk is seen among adolescent mothers who become pregnant outside marriage and consider suicide as the solution to unresolved problems. We aimed to investigate the factors associated with suicidal behavior among adolescent pregnant mothers in Kenya. Methods A total of 27 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and 8 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) were conducted in a rural setting (Makueni County) in Kenya. The study participants consisted of formal health care workers and informal health care providers (traditional birth attendants and community health workers), adolescent and adult pregnant and post-natal (up to six weeks post-delivery) women including first-time adolescent mothers, and caregivers (husbands and/or mothers-in-law of pregnant women) and local key opinion leaders. The qualitative data was analyzed using Qualitative Solution for Research (QSR) NVivo version 10. Results Five themes associated with suicidal behavior risk among adolescent mothers emerged from this study. These included: (i) poverty, (ii) intimate partner violence (IPV), (iii) family rejection, (iv) social isolation and stigma from the community, and (v) chronic physical illnesses. Low economic status was associated with hopelessness and suicidal ideation. IPV was related to drug abuse (especially alcohol) by the male partner, predisposing the adolescent mothers to suicidal ideation. Rejection by parents and isolation by peers at school; and diagnosis of a chronic illness such as HIV/AIDS were other contributing factors to suicidal behavior in adolescent mothers. Conclusion Improved social relations, economic and health circumstances of adolescent mothers can lead to reduction of suicidal behaviour. Therefore, concerted efforts by stakeholders including family members, community leaders, health care workers and policy makers should explore ways of addressing IPV, economic empowerment and access to youth friendly health care centers for chronic physical illnesses. Prevention strategies should include monitoring for suicidal behavior risks during pregnancy in both community and health care settings. Additionally, utilizing lay workers in conducting dialogue discussions and early screening could address some of the risk factors and reduce pregnancy- related suicide mortality in LMICs."

Accordingly, manipulation of the gut microbiota was considered a future therapeutic strategy to combat disease and improve health (4Nicholson J.K. Holmes E. Kinross J. Burcelin R. Gibson G. Jia W. Pettersson S. Host-gut microbiota metabolic interactions.Science. 2012; 336 (22674330): 1262-126710.1126/science.1223813Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). Dietary nutrients containing a trimethylamine (TMA) moiety, inter alia l-carnitine or choline, were related to the development of atherosclerotic heart disease (9Tang W.H. Hazen S.L. The contributory role of gut microbiota in cardiovascular disease.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124 (25271725): 4204-421110.1172/JCI72331Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The C-N bond of these compounds is cleaved by bacterial carnitine monooxygenase (CntAB) or choline trimethylamine-lyase (CutCD), leading to the volatile compound TMA, which is further metabolized in the human liver by flavin monooxygenases (FMOs) (Fig. 1). The resulting trimethylamine N-oxide molecule (TMAO) was shown to enhance atherosclerosis development in animal models (10Miao J. Ling A.V. Manthena P.V. Gearing M.E. Graham M.J. Crooke R.M.

In multiple human studies, elevated TMAO levels have been associated with prevalent cardiovascular diseases and the risks for myocardial infarction and stroke (12Tang W.H. Wang Z. Fan Y. Levison B.

Only recently, inhibition of the choline lyase CutCD using the substrate analog 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol was exemplified as an efficient strategy to attenuate choline diet-enhanced atherosclerosis in a mouse model (14Wang Z.

The two-component carnitine monooxygenase CntAB (EC 1.14.13.239) catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of l-carnitine into TMA and malic semialdehyde (Fig. 2A). The latter compound serves as a carbon and energy source and is channeled into the tricarboxylic acid cycle by virtue of malic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase (15Kleber H.P. Seim H. Aurich H. Strack E. Utilization of trimethylammonium-compounds by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus.Arch. Microbiol. 1977; 112 (849100): 201-20610.1007/BF00429336Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Despite the structural similarity of the substrates l-carnitine and choline, CntAB catalysis is completely unrelated to CutCD, which utilizes an unusual glycyl radical enzyme mechanism (16Craciun S. Balskus E.P. Microbial conversion of choline to trimethylamine requires a glycyl radical enzyme.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Only recently, the clustering of genes cntA and cntB in bacterial reference genomes of the human microbiota has been demonstrated (17Falony G. Vieira-Silva S. Raes J. Microbiology meets big data: the case of gut microbiota-derived trimethylamine.Annu. Rev.

Theoretical sequence analyses for CntB revealed a potential nucleotide binding sequence, a flavin binding domain, and a motif characteristic of the presence of a plant-type [2Fe-2S] cluster. The sequence of CntA shows substantial homology to the family of Rieske-type oxygenases (Fig. 2B) (19Barry S.M. Challis G.L. Mechanism and catalytic diversity of rieske non-heme iron-dependent oxygenases.ACS Catal. 2013; 3: 2362-237010.1021/cs400087pCrossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These iron-dependent enzyme systems typically comprise an oxygenase, a specific reductase, and eventually an additional ferredoxin component (20Nam J.W. Nojiri H. Yoshida T. Habe H. Yamane H.

All highlighted oxygenases share a highly conserved Rieske sequence (-CXHX15-17CXXH-), providing two cysteine and two histidine ligands for the characteristic [2Fe-2S] cluster. Apart from this, CntA also possess a mononuclear iron-binding region. The related [Fe] center of Rieske proteins, typically ligated by two histidine residues and one carboxylate ligand, plays a fundamental role in the sophisticated activation of molecular oxygen (Fig. 2). The oligomeric architecture of Rieske oxygenases is of central importance, because the electron transfer onto the [Fe] center from the Rieske center is facilitated via an intersubunit rather than an intrasubunit redox process (29Parales R.E. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Aspartate 205 in the catalytic domain of naphthalene dioxygenase is essential for activity.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181 (10074076): 1831-183710.1128/JB.181.6.1831-1837.1999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). As judged from three-dimensional protein structures, a highly conserved aspartate residue (e.g. Asp-205 in naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase, PDB entry 1NDO) is substantial for the electron transfer between the adjacent subunits (29Parales R.E. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Aspartate 205 in the catalytic domain of naphthalene dioxygenase is essential for activity.J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181 (10074076): 1831-183710.1128/JB.181.6.1831-1837.1999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this “bridging” aspartate is replaced by a glutamate in all available sequences of CntA. Recently, carnitine monooxygenase activity of the Acinetobacter baumannii enzyme was reconstituted, and the functional relevance of the abovementioned Glu-205 has been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis (18Zhu Y. Jameson E. Crosatti M. Schafer H. Rajakumar K. Bugg T.D. Chen Y. Carnitine metabolism to trimethylamine by an unusual Rieske-type oxygenase from human microbiota.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Furthermore, a closely related substrate specificity of orthologous CntA proteins was demonstrated in vitro. High activity in the presence of l-carnitine and gamma-butyrobetaine, medium activity toward glycine betaine, and very low activity in the presence of choline was shown (14Wang Z. Roberts A.B. Buffa J.A. Levison B.S. Zhu W. Org E. Gu X. Huang Y. Zamanian-Daryoush M. Culley M.K. DiDonato A.J. Fu X. Hazen J.E. Krajcik D.

Apart from this, the underlying bio-inorganic redox chemistry of the unusual Rieske-type carnitine monooxygenase has not been investigated. Here, we present the first biochemical characterization of the redox-active components of CntB and CntA from A. baumannii. Site-directed mutagenesis in combination with kinetic and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments allowed us to resolve individual electron transfer steps required for the oxygenation of the carnitine substrate. Components CntB and CntA of the carnitine monooxygenase from A. baumannii were individually overproduced and purified from Escherichia coli cells. The N-terminally His-tagged CntB protein was affinity purified using Co2+-loaded chelating Sepharose. Approximately 5 mg purified CntB with a relative molecular weight of ∼45,000 (calculated molecular mass, 37,151 Da) was obtained from a 1-liter cell culture (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The catalytic component CntA was overproduced as an N-terminal GST fusion protein and purified using chromatography on GSH-Sepharose. The untagged target protein was eluted after on-column cleavage with PreScission protease. Overall, 6 mg CntA was purified from a 1-liter culture volume. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3A, lane 6) revealed a relative molecular weight of ∼43,000 (calculated molecular mass, 43,155 Da). CntAB-dependent conversion of l-carnitine into malic semialdehyde and TMA recently has been exemplified using ion chromatography- and GC-MS-based approaches, respectively (18Zhu Y. Jameson E. Crosatti M. Schafer H. Rajakumar K. Bugg T.D. Chen Y. Carnitine metabolism to trimethylamine by an unusual Rieske-type oxygenase from human microbiota.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (24591617): 4268-427310.1073/pnas.1316569111Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Here, we established a microplate reader-based l-carnitine depletion assay. Carnitine monooxygenase activity was reconstituted in the presence of 20 μm CntB, 5 μm CntA, 300 μm l-carnitine, and 2 mm electron donor NADH (or NADPH). l-carnitine concentrations were determined in the presence of acetyl-CoA and carnitine acetyltransferase. Emerging CoA leads to the cleavage of 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and the resulting 2-thio-5-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) was spectroscopically monitored. A specific CntAB activity of 771 ± 67 nmol min−1 mg−1 was determined (Fig. 3B). The reconstituted enzyme was substantially more active than recently described (80 nmol min−1 mg−1) (18Zhu Y. Jameson E. Crosatti M. Schafer H. Rajakumar K. Bugg T.D. Chen Y. Carnitine metabolism to trimethylamine by an unusual Rieske-type oxygenase from human microbiota.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Alternatively, a spectroscopic NADH depletion assay (performed at lower cofactor concentration) revealed a specific activity of 407 ± 11 nmol min−1 mg−1 (Fig. 3D). Oxygenation of the carnitine substrate must be considered a key step of CntAB catalysis, and molecular oxygen was proposed to be a source of the carbonyl oxygen of the malic semialdehyde reaction product (18Zhu Y. Jameson E. Crosatti M. Schafer H. Rajakumar K. Bugg T.D. Chen Y. Carnitine metabolism to trimethylamine by an unusual Rieske-type oxygenase from human microbiota.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (24591617): 4268-427310.1073/pnas.1316569111Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Only recently, in vivo experiments demonstrated higher TMA production in more aerobic environments. However, verification of molecular oxygen as a cosubstrate is still pending. Accordingly, components CntB and CntA were recombinantly purified under strict anaerobic conditions. A subsequent carnitine depletion assay or an NADH depletion assay (performed in an anaerobic chamber) did not reveal detectable CntAB activity (Fig. 3B and D), in agreement with the reaction scheme depicted in Fig. 2A. Enzymatic activity was effectively restored upon oxygen exposure. CntB acts as a carnitine monooxygenase reductase, transferring reduction equivalents from NADH onto CntA. Analytical size exclusion chromatography revealed a native molecular mass of 43,000 Da, indicating that CntB is functional as a monomer. The purified protein showed an orange/yellow color, and UV-visible spectroscopy revealed absorption maxima at 272 nm, 340 nm, 410 nm, and 463 nm, which might be indicative of a prosthetic FAD or FMN cofactor and/or the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster (30Mason J.R. Cammack R. The electron-transport proteins of hydroxylating bacterial dioxygenases.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46 (1444257): 277-30510.1146/annurev.mi.46.100192.001425Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Further experimental evidence for the presence of a flavin cofactor was obtained from fluorescence spectroscopy. In Fig. 4A, inset, the characteristic emission of the supernatant from a heat-denatured CntB sample at 526 nm (370 nm excitation) indicates the presence of a noncovalently bound flavin. Comparative HPLC analyses in the presence of authentic FAD/FMN samples clearly identified FMN as a cofactor (Fig. 4B). As judged from the supernatant of thermal denaturation experiments, an FMN content of 0.6 ± 0.1 mol per mol CntB was determined. FMN binding was further explored using structure-guided mutagenesis. Functional relevance of amino acid residues Asp-75 and Ser-82 in the FMN binding pocket of CntB was proposed after assessment of the three-dimensional structure of the orthologous protein benzoate dioxygenase reductase (PDB entry 1KRH, 23% sequence identity). Purified CntB variant proteins D75K and S82A revealed a characteristic decrease of the absorption at 340 and 463 nm and the parallel reduction of the fluorescence signal at 526 nm (Fig. 4A and Table 1). In agreement with a significant decrease of the cofactor content (78% ± 5% and 15% ± 4% FMN), residual activities of 70% ± 8% and 35% ± 6% were observed compared with the WT protein (Table 1). From these data, we conclude that Asp-75 and Ser-82 contribute to the tight binding of FMN. NADH-dependent electron transfer of both variants was efficiently restored when the flavin cofactor was externally supplied to the assay.Table 1Biochemical characterization of CntB wild-type and variant proteinsaTable summarizes biochemical and spectroscopic properties of CntB variants.

The aerobically purified CntB protein (∼1 mm) was EPR silent. However, upon reduction with 2 mm sodium dithionite, a complete loss of color, a drastic reduction of the characteristic optical absorption maxima, and an S = 1/2 signal with g values of g1 = 2.037, g2 = 1.943, and g3 = 1.900, located in a region characteristic for a [2Fe-2S]+ cluster, were observed (Fig. 4C and D) (31Voss I. Goss T. Murozuka E. Altmann B. McLean K.J. Rigby S.E. Munro A.W. Scheibe R. Hase T. Hanke G.T.

Concurrently, an iron content of 2.16 ± 0.18 mol Fe per mol CntB and a sulfur content of 2.07 ± 0.39 mol S per mol CntB was determined. Theoretical sequence analysis indicated an overall five cysteine residues as potential ligands of the redox-active [2Fe-2S] cluster of CntB. Accordingly, the respective amino acids were individually mutagenized into alanine and the purified variants C265A, C267A, C272A, C275A, and C305A were characterized. Mutant C265A revealed WT-like enzymatic activity in the carnitine and NADH depletion assay. UV-visible experiments, flavin quantification, and EPR spectroscopy indicated the presence of FMN and the [2Fe-2S] cofactor by analogy to the WT protein (compare Fig. 4E and Table 1). Clear differences for variants C267A, C272A, C275A, and C305A were observed. Eluate fractions always contained substantially lower amounts of the target protein (∼1/10) contaminated with significant amounts of CntB degradation products. Attempts to further purify these variants were impeded because of the instability of the respective target proteins. Accordingly, freshly prepared protein samples were directly analyzed after affinity purification. Variants C267A, C272A, C275A, and C305A did not reveal detectable enzymatic activity, and EPR measurements of the related samples indicated the complete loss of the [2Fe-2S] center (∼200 μm sample concentration). From these data, we propose residues Cys-267, Cys-272, Cys-275, and Cys-305 as ligands of the plant-type [2Fe-2S] cluster of CntB. Apart from functioning as a redox-active component of carnitine monooxygenase, we conclude that this oxygen-insensitive [2Fe-2S] cluster is of central importance for the structural integrity of CntB. EPR spectroscopy was also used to analyze the FMN-binding variants D75K and S82A (Fig. 4E). The dithionite-reduced samples indicated identical g values and approximately the same signal intensity as that observed for the WT protein. Obviously, these mutations in the FMN binding pocket do not impair the geometry or the maturation of the plant-type [2Fe-2S] cluster of CntB. The redox midpoint potential of CntB was accessed by employing UV-visible spectro-electrochemistry in a custom-built cell described previously (32Beinert H. Semi-micro methods for analysis of labile sulfide and of labile sulfide plus sulfane sulfur in unusually stable iron-sulfur proteins.Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131 (6614472): 373-37810.1016/0003-2697(83)90186-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Because of the limited stability of the protein during these experiments, only approximate values for the redox midpoint potential could be obtained (Fig. S1 and S2, left). For CntB, a midpoint potential of −162 ± 10 mV was established. Intersubunit electron transfer plays a central role for the redox catalysis of Rieske-type oxygenases. Accordingly, the oligomeric architecture of CntA was assessed by different experimental strategies. Analytical size exclusion chromatography revealed a native molecular weight of 139,000 Da, indicative of a functional CntA homotrimer (calculated monomer mass, 43,156 Da) (Fig. 5A). Subsequently, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments were performed to verify the proposed trimer. A dilute protein solution was used to determine the experimental CntA scattering curve.

It has been associated with factors such as uncontrolled consumption, lack of knowledge, beliefs, and sociodemographic characteristics. Lebanon is characterized by high levels of antibiotic misuse, as almost half of the population self-medicates with antibiotics and over 30% of the antibiotics are dispensed without prescription. To-date, no studies determined adequately the association between knowledge, beliefs and antibiotic misuse in Lebanon. Objective To assess the association between level of knowledge and beliefs about antibiotics, and antibiotic misuse in Lebanon. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among 1,421 parents of schoolchildren using an anonymous self-administered Knowledge, Attitude and Practices questionnaire. The participants´ level of agreement with each item of knowledge and beliefs was measured using a Likert-type (0–10) scale. Misuse practices in the last month were detected through a series of questions aimed at determining the level of compliance with physicians´ instructions in terms of dosage and duration. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Results 277 participants (16%) acknowledged using antibiotics in the previous month, 41% of whom showed at least one misuse behavior. Misconceptions and beliefs about antibiotics substantially increased the odds of their misuse. For instance, participants who believed that antibiotics were effective in treating viruses, cold, or sore throat infections were twice as likely to misuse antibiotics [Adjusted Interquartile Odds Ratio (aIqOR): 2.08 (95%CI: 1.32, 3.19), aIqOR: 1.81 (95%CI: 1.41, 2.29), aIqOR: 2.19 (95%CI: 1.61, 2.93), respectively]. Parents who usually keep antibiotics at home antibiotics for future use were more likely to misuse antibiotics [aIqOR: 2.44 (95%CI: 1.68, 3.46)]. Conclusions Our findings indicate that the low level of knowledge and the existence of erroneous beliefs about antibiotics are associated with increased odds of antibiotic misuse. Key elements including rationale prescription and control of dispensing should be addressed when designing educational campaigns against antibiotic misuse."
https://openalex.org/W3044799044,"Monocyte-derived macrophages are the major innate immune cells that provide the first line of cellular defense against infections or injuries. These recruited macrophages at the site of inflammation are exposed to a broad range of cytokines that categorically incite a robust pro-inflammatory response. However, macrophage pro-inflammatory activation must be under exquisite control to avert unbridled inflammation. Thus, endogenous mechanisms must exist that rigorously preserve macrophage quiescence and yet, allow nimble pro-inflammatory macrophage response with precise spatiotemporal control. Herein, we identify the CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with glutamic acid/aspartic acid-rich carboxyl-terminal domain 2 (CITED2) as a critical intrinsic negative regulator of inflammation, which broadly attenuates pro-inflammatory gene programs in macrophages. Our in vivo studies revealed that myeloid-CITED2 deficiency significantly heightened macrophages and neutrophils recruitment to the site of inflammation. Our integrated transcriptomics and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) studies uncovered that CITED2 deficiency broadly enhances NFκB targets, IFNγ/IFNα responses, and inflammatory response gene expression in macrophages. Using complementary gain- and loss-of-function studies, we observed that CITED2 overexpression attenuate and CITED2 deficiency elevate LPS-induced NFκB transcriptional activity and NFκB-p65 recruitment to target gene promoter in macrophages. More importantly, blockade of NFκB signaling completely reversed elevated pro-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. Collectively, our findings show that CITED2 restrains NFκB activation and curtails broad pro-inflammatory gene programs in myeloid cells."
https://openalex.org/W3044139261,"The objective of this study was to determine if commercially collected liquid porcine plasma contaminated with African swine fever virus (ASFV) and fed for 14 consecutive days would infect pigs. Commercially collected liquid porcine plasma was mixed with the serum from an ASFV experimentally infected pig. To simulate the potential of pigs slaughtered being ASFV viremic but asymptomatic and passing antemortem inspection, the ratio of liquid plasma from healthy animals to serum from an ASFV infected pig used in this study represented 0.4% or 2.0% of the pigs slaughtered being viremic (Studies 1 or 2, respectively). The contaminated liquid plasma was mixed on commercial feed and pigs were fed for 14 consecutive days providing to each pig 104.3 or 105.0 TCID50 ASFV daily (Studies 1 or 2, respectively). Pigs were observed for an additional 5 or 9 days (Studies 1 or 2, respectively). In both experiments, the pigs did not become infected with ASFV during the 14d feeding period or during the subsequent observation period. In these experiments, unprocessed liquid plasma contaminated with ASFV mixed on commercial feed and fed for 14 consecutive days did not infect pigs. From our results we can conclude that the infectious dose of ASFV on feed is much higher than that previously reported, at least with ASFV-spiked raw plasma."
https://openalex.org/W3045228465,"Several species of dryland cyanobacteria are known to occur as hypoliths under semi-translucent rocks. In the Mojave Desert, these organisms find refuge from intense solar radiation under milky quartz where moisture persists for a longer period of time than in adjacent soil surface habitat. Desert mosses, which are extremely desiccation-tolerant, can also occur in these hypolithic spaces, though little is known about this unique moss microhabitat and how species composition compares to that of adjacent soil surface communities. To address this question, we deployed microclimate dataloggers and collected moss samples from under and adjacent to 18 milky quartz rocks (quartz mean center thickness 26 ± 15 mm) in a western high elevation Mojave Desert site. Light transmission through Mojave quartz rocks may be as low as 1.2%, and data from microclimate loggers deployed for five months support the hypothesis that quartz provides thermal buffering and higher relative humidity compared to the soil surface. Of the 53 samples collected from hypolith and surface microhabitats, 68% were Syntrichia caninervis, the dominant bryophyte of the Mojave Desert biological soil crust. Tortula inermis accounted for 28% of the samples and 4% were Bryum argenteum. In a comparison of moss community composition, we found that S. caninervis was more likely to be on the soil surface, though it was abundant in both microhabitats, while T. inermis was more restricted to hypoliths, perhaps due to protection from temperature extremes. In our study site, the differences between hypolithic and surface microhabitats enable niche partitioning between T. inermis and S. caninervis, enhancing alpha diversity. This work points to the need to thoroughly consider microhabitats when assessing bryophyte species diversity and modelling species distributions. This focus is particularly important in extreme environments, where mosses may find refuge from the prevailing macroclimatic conditions in microhabitats such as hypoliths."
https://openalex.org/W3045374489,"Lifestyle habits associate with metabolic health in overall populations. Whether such association is similar among subjects with a different nutritional status has been less studied. We aimed to (i) determine the prevalence of metabolic phenotypes in Chile, and (ii) determine the association between lifestyle habits and metabolic health according to the nutritional status.The National Health Survey of Chile 2016-2017 was analyzed. A metabolically unhealthy phenotype was defined as manifesting ≥3 of the following risk factors: elevated blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, elevated glucose, elevated waist circumference, or reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Individuals manifesting <2 risk factors were considered as healthy. The nutritional status was defined as normal weight (18.5 to <25 kg/m2), overweight (25 to <30 kg/m2) or obesity (≥30 kg/m2). Questionnaires were used to estimate smoking habits, alcohol intake, sedentary behavior, moderate-vigorous physical activity, fruits/vegetables consumption, and fish/seafood consumption. The association (odds ratio [95%CI]) between lifestyle habits and metabolic health was determined within each nutritional status, adjusting for age, sex, BMI (in kg/m2), and education.The prevalence of a metabolically unhealthy phenotype was 36% in the overall sample. Such a prevalence was 7%, 33% and 58% among subjects with normal weight, overweight and obesity, respectively. In subjects with normal weight, the highest quartile of fruits/vegetables consumption was associated with reduced odds of having a metabolically unhealthy phenotype (0.09 [0.01-0.48]). In subjects with obesity, the highest quartile of moderate-vigorous physical activity was associated with reduced odds of having a metabolically unhealthy phenotype (0.29 [0.09-0.91]).One third of the Chilean population manifests an unhealthy phenotype. We identified associations between lifestyle habits and metabolic health that are specific to the nutritional status. Thus, emphasizing fruits/vegetables consumption in subjects with normal weight, and physical activity in subjects with obesity, may maximize the benefits of public health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3045438842,"HIV cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) escape is defined by a concentration of HIV-1 RNA in CSF above the lower limit of quantification of the employed assay and equal to or greater than the plasma HIV-1 RNA level in the presence of treatment-related plasma viral suppression, while CSF discordance is similarly defined by equal or higher CSF than plasma HIV-1 RNA in untreated individuals. During secondary CSF escape or discordance, disproportionate CSF HIV-1 RNA develops in relation to another infection in addition to HIV-1. We performed a retrospective review of people living with HIV receiving clinical care at Sahlgrenska Infectious Diseases Clinic in Gothenburg, Sweden who developed uncomplicated herpes zoster (HZ) and underwent a research lumbar puncture (LP) within the ensuing 150 days. Based on treatment status and the relationship between CSF and plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations, they were divided into 4 groups: i) antiretroviral treated with CSF escape (N = 4), ii) treated without CSF escape (N = 5), iii) untreated with CSF discordance (N = 8), and iv) untreated without CSF discordance (N = 8). We augmented these with two additional cases of secondary CSF escape related to neuroborreliosis and HSV-2 encephalitis and analyzed these two non-HZ cases for factors contributing to CSF HIV-1 RNA concentrations. HIV-1 CSF escape and discordance were associated with higher CSF white blood cell (WBC) counts than their non-escape (P = 0.0087) and non-discordant (P = 0.0017) counterparts, and the CSF WBC counts correlated with the CSF HIV-1 RNA levels in both the treated (P = 0.0047) and untreated (P = 0.002) group pairs. Moreover, the CSF WBC counts correlated with the CSF:plasma HIV-1 RNA ratios of the entire group of 27 subjects (P = <0.0001) indicating a strong effect of the CSF WBC count on the relation of the CSF to plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations across the entire sample set. The inflammatory response to HZ and its augmenting effect on CSF HIV-1 RNA was found up to 5 months after the HZ outbreak in the cross-sectional sample and, was present for one year after HZ in one individual followed longitudinally. We suggest that HZ provides a 'model' of secondary CSF escape and discordance. Likely, the inflammatory response to HZ pathology provoked local HIV-1 production by enhanced trafficking or activation of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes. Whereas treatment and other systemic factors determined the plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations, in this setting the CSF WBC counts established the relation of the CSF HIV-1 RNA levels to this plasma set-point."
https://openalex.org/W3043736101,"SMAD pathways govern epithelial proliferation, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β and BMP signaling through SMAD members has distinct effects on mammary development and homeostasis. Here, we show that LEFTY1, a secreted inhibitor of NODAL/SMAD2 signaling, is produced by mammary progenitor cells and, concomitantly, suppresses SMAD2 and SMAD5 signaling to promote long-term proliferation of normal and malignant mammary epithelial cells. In contrast, BMP7, a NODAL antagonist with context-dependent functions, is produced by basal cells and restrains progenitor cell proliferation. In normal mouse epithelium, LEFTY1 expression in a subset of luminal cells and rare basal cells opposes BMP7 to promote ductal branching. LEFTY1 binds BMPR2 to suppress BMP7-induced activation of SMAD5, and this LEFTY1-BMPR2 interaction is specific to tumor-initiating cells in triple-negative breast cancer xenografts that rely on LEFTY1 for growth. These results suggest that LEFTY1 is an endogenous dual-SMAD inhibitor and that suppressing its function may represent a therapeutic vulnerability in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3044284838,"Sexual and reproductive health are significant aspects of quality of life. Healthcare often fails to provide adequate support for young cancer survivors in this area, hence the need to develop more effective interventions. The present study aimed to describe experiences of participating in a web-based psycho-educational intervention focusing on sexual dysfunction and fertility distress after cancer, and to explore these experiences within the theoretical frame of the basic psychological needs for competence, relatedness and autonomy according to self-determination theory.Individual semi-structured interviews with 24 women and 4 men, age 19-40, were abductively analyzed using the Framework approach for qualitative content analysis.Participant experiences corresponded well with the three main deductive themes competence, relatedness and autonomy, divided into a total of nine subthemes illustrating varying degrees of basic need satisfaction with considerable nuance but not without ambiguity. While satisfaction of the need for competence could be linked to the amount of information in relation to participants' cognitive capacity, satisfaction of the need for relatedness seemed to be of special importance for these young adults with cancer experience. Invitation to the program meant a chance at alleviating loneliness and normalizing problems, symptoms and concerns. Participants' descriptions of perceived autonomy support were more challenging and ambiguous, because of the many contradictions in participants' responses to their variable situations.Basic psychological needs were confirmed as flexible positions along a continuum rather than discrete and mutually exclusive qualities. Understanding the variety of basic need satisfaction may enhance the design of future web-based interventions to be even more inclusive, tailorable and autonomy-supportive. Further research is warranted to determine the role of basic need satisfaction as a possible mediator for web-based psychoeducational interventions in cancer survivorship care."
https://openalex.org/W3044219222,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural protein 3-4A (NS3-4A) protease is a key component of the viral replication complex and the target of protease inhibitors used in current clinical practice. By cleaving and thereby inactivating selected host factors it also plays a role in the persistence and pathogenesis of hepatitis C. Here, we describe ovarian cancer immunoreactive antigen domain containing protein 1 (OCIAD1) as a novel cellular substrate of the HCV NS3-4A protease. OCIAD1 was identified by quantitative proteomics involving stable isotopic labeling using amino acids in cell culture coupled with mass spectrometry. It is a poorly characterized membrane protein believed to be involved in cancer development. OCIAD1 is cleaved by the NS3-4A protease at Cys 38, close to a predicted transmembrane segment. Cleavage was observed in heterologous expression systems, the replicon and cell culture-derived HCV systems, as well as in liver biopsies from patients with chronic hepatitis C. NS3-4A proteases from diverse hepacivirus species efficiently cleaved OCIAD1. The subcellular localization of OCIAD1 on mitochondria was not altered by NS3-4A-mediated cleavage. Interestingly, OCIAD2, a homolog of OCIAD1 with a cysteine residue in a similar position and identical subcellular localization, was not cleaved by NS3-4A. Domain swapping experiments revealed that the sequence surrounding the cleavage site as well as the predicted transmembrane segment contribute to substrate selectivity. Overexpression as well as knock down and rescue experiments did not affect the HCV life cycle in vitro, raising the possibility that OCIAD1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3043841792,"RB1 gene is often homozygously deleted or mutated in prostate adenocarcinomas following acquirement of castration resistance and/or metastatic ability. We found that SUCLA2 gene is frequently involved in the deletion of the RB1 gene region in advanced prostate cancer. SUCLA2 constitutes the β-subunit of succinate CoA ligase heterodimer that reversibly converts succinyl CoA into succinate. We sought the possibility that deletion of SUCLA2 gives rise to a metabolic vulnerability that could be targeted therapeutically. We found a significant metabolic shift in SUCLA2-deleted prostate cancer cells, including lower mitochondrial respiratory activity. By screening a number of libraries for compounds that induce cell death selectively in SUCLA2-deficient prostate cancer cells, we identified thymoquinone (2-isopropyl-5-methylbenzo-1,4-quinone) and PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) from a natural compound library. These findings indicate that the metabolic vulnerability in SUCLA2-deficient prostate cancer cells is pharmacologically targetable."
https://openalex.org/W3044049981,"This paper presents the derivation and experimental validation of algorithms for modeling and estimation of soft continuum manipulators using Lie group variational integration. Existing approaches are generally limited to static and quasi-static analyses, and are not sufficiently validated for dynamic motion. However, in several applications, models need to consider the dynamical behavior of the continuum manipulators. The proposed modeling and estimation formulation is obtained from a discrete variational principle, and therefore grants outstanding conservation properties to the continuum mechanical model. The main contribution of this article is the experimental validation of the dynamic model of soft continuum manipulators, including external torques and forces (e.g., generated by magnetic fields, friction, and the gravity), by carrying out different experiments with metal rods and polymer-based soft rods. To consider dissipative forces in the validation process, distributed estimation filters are proposed. The experimental and numerical tests also illustrate the algorithm’s performance on a magnetically-actuated soft continuum manipulator. The model demonstrates good agreement with dynamic experiments in estimating the tip position of a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) rod. The experimental results show an average absolute error and maximum error in tip position estimation of 0.13 mm and 0.58 mm, respectively, for a manipulator length of 60.55 mm."
https://openalex.org/W3045094054,"Background Anti-GD2 therapy with dinutuximab is effective in improving the survival of high-risk neuroblastoma patients in remission and after relapse. However, allodynia is the major dose-limiting side effect, hindering its use for neuroblastoma patients at higher doses and for other GD2-expressing malignancies. As polyamines can enhance neuronal sensitization, including development of allodynia and other forms of pathological pain, we hypothesized that polyamine depletion might prove an effective strategy for relief of anti-GD2 induced allodynia. Method Sprague-Dawley rats were allowed to drink water containing various concentrations of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) for several days prior to behavioral testing. Anti-GD2 (14G2a) was injected into the tail vein of lightly sedated animals and basal mechanical hindpaw withdrawal threshold assessed by von Frey filaments. Endpoint serum DFMO and polyamines, assessed 24h after 14G2a injection, were measured by HPLC and mass spectrometry. Results An i.v. injection of 14G2a causes increased paw sensitivity to light touch in this model, a response that closely mimics patient allodynia. Animals allowed to drink water containing 1% DFMO exhibited a significant reduction of 14G2a-induced pain sensitivity (allodynia). Increasing the dosage of the immunotherapeutic increased the magnitude (intensity and duration) of the pain behavior. Administration of DFMO attenuated the enhanced sensitivity. Consistent with the known actions of DFMO on ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), serum putrescene and spermidine levels were significantly reduced by DFMO, though the decrease in endpoint polyamine levels did not directly correlate with the behavioral changes. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that DFMO is an effective agent for reducing anti-GD2 -induced allodynia. Using DFMO in conjunction with dinutuximab may allow for dose escalation in neuroblastoma patients. The reduction in pain may be sufficient to allow new patient populations to utilize this therapy given the more acceptable side effect profile. Thus, DFMO may be an important adjunct to anti-GD2 immunotherapy in addition to a role as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic."
https://openalex.org/W3045194794,"Fossil fuels dominate domestic heating in temperate climates. In the EU, domestic space heating accounts for around 20% of final energy demand. Reducing domestic demand temperatures would reduce energy demand. However, cold exposure has been shown to be associated with adverse health conditions. Using an observational dataset of 77,762 UK Biobank participants, we examine the standard deviation of experienced temperature (named here thermal variety) measured by a wrist worn activity and temperature monitor. After controlling for covariates such as age, activity level and obesity, we show that thermal variety is 0.15°C 95% CI [0.07–0.23] higher for participants whose health satisfaction was ‘extremely happy’ compared to ‘extremely unhappy’. Higher thermal variety is also associated with a lower risk of having morbidities related to excess winter deaths. We argue that significant CO2 savings would be made by increasing thermal variety and reducing domestic demand temperatures in the healthiest homes. However, great care is needed to avoid secondary health impacts due to mould and damp. Vulnerable households should receive increased attention."
https://openalex.org/W3045302023,"The Emotional Quotient Inventory: Youth version-EQ-i:YV was developed by Bar-On & Parker in 2000 and later translated and adapted for the general Spanish adolescent population by Ferrandiz et al. in 2012. The Spanish scale presents similar psychometric properties to the original version (54 items and five subdimensions). The Emotional Quotient Inventory assesses a set of personal, emotional, and social skills that influence adaptation to and coping with environmental demands and pressures. These factors can influence an adolescent's success later in life, health, and psychological well-being. Traditionally, research in Down syndrome (DS) has focused on identifying cognitive deficits, relatively little is known about emotional intelligence (EI) and there are no scales that measure EI in people with DS adults.To validate and analyze the psychometric properties of the scale in the clinical population, specifically in Spanish adults with DS (EQ-i: SVDS).A cross-sectional investigation was carried out in several stages. Descriptive, exploratory factorial (n = 345), confirmatory (n = 397), and scale reliability analyses were performed with better goodness-of-adjustment indices.A new scale named Emotional Quotient Inventory: Short Version for DS adults was obtained with a structure of four factors called mood, stress management, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. This new scale was reduced to 25 items. Goodness-of-fit indices were excellent (RMSEA [95% CI] = 02[.01; .03]; CFI = .99; TLI = .98; GFI = .87; AGFI = .89). The internal consistency of the four dimensions and the calculated total score (α = .91, ω = .93 and divided halves = .90) yielded high values in this clinical sample.The results recommend the use of the revised EQ-i: YV, the EQ-i: SVDS, to assess EI in adults with DS. The psychometric properties of this study are satisfactory but have four factors. The findings are discussed in terms of future research and practical implication to gain a more thorough understanding of how this population behaves on both a general and preventive level in order to teach EI properly.This new version is a valid and reliable tool to evaluate emotional intelligence in people with intellectual disabilities and specifically in Spanish adults with DS."
https://openalex.org/W3043895941,"The perceived value of study material may have implications on learning and long-term retention. This study compares the perceived value of basic science of medical students from schools with a traditional ""2+2"" curriculum and the USMLE Step 1 placed before core clerkships to those from medical schools that have undergone curricular revisions, resulting in shortened pre-clerkship curricula and administration of the USMLE Step 1 after core clerkships.We hypothesize that differences in curricula, particularly duration of pre-clerkship curriculum and timing of the USMLE Step 1, affect medical students' perceived value of basic science.A twenty item anonymous questionnaire using a 5-point Likert scale was developed to assess medical students' perceptions of basic science. The questionnaire was distributed to third-year medical students across four medical schools. Generalized linear models and p-values were calculated comparing the perceived value and use of basic science between medical schools with the USMLE Step 1 before clerkships and 2-years of basic science (BC) and medical schools with the USMLE Step 1 after core clerkships and 1.5-years of basic science (AC).The questionnaire was distributed to 695 eligible students and completed by 287 students. Students at BC schools tended to view basic science as more essential for clinical practice than students at AC schools across both outcomes (rating independence of basic science and clinical practice, AC school mean = 2.97, BC school mean = 2.73, p = 0.0017; rating importance of basic science to clinical practice, AC school mean = 3.30, BC schools mean = 3.50, p = 0.0135).Our study suggests that students who have a longer basic science curriculum tend to value basic science greater than students with a shorter basic science curriculum. The timing of the USMLE Step 1 may also influence this relationship. Curricular decisions, such as reductions in pre-clerkship curricula and administration of the USMLE Step 1 after clerkships, may impact medical students' perceptions of the value of basic science to clinical practice. This can have implications on their future engagement with basic science and should be considered when modifying curriculum."

We compared the taxonomy of the microbial communities from samples taken at different times and different sites. Our results showed that the identity of the dominant bacterial phyla differed among the samples. Proteobacteria (23–86.2%) were the predominant bacterial phylum in all samples taken from site A in both 2017 and 2018. However, Actinobacteria (21–92.3%) were the most popular bacterial phylum in samples from sites B and C in 2017 and 2018. Ascomycota were identified as the only fungal phyla in samples in 2017. However, the group varied drastically in relative abundance between 2017 and 2018. Functional analysis of the soil bacterial community suggested that abundant members of the microbiota may be associated with metabolism and the specific environment. This report was the first high-throughput sequencing study of the soil of the Jinsha earthen relic microbiome. Since soil microbiota can damage soil and archeological structures, comprehensive analyses of the microbiomes at archeological sites may contribute to the understand of the influence of microorganisms on the degradation of soil, as well as to the identification of potentially beneficial or undesirable members of these microbial communities in archeological sites. The study will be helpful to provide effective data and guidance for the prevention and control of microbial corrosion of the Jinsha earthen relic."
https://openalex.org/W3044911540,"Background Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are ongoing evoked brain responses to continuous auditory stimuli that play a role for auditory processing of complex sounds and speech perception. Transient auditory event-related responses (AERRs) have previously been recorded using fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG) but involve different neurological pathways. Previous studies in children and adults demonstrated that the cortical components of the ASSR are significantly affected by state of consciousness and by maturational changes in neonates and young infants. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate ASSRs in human fetuses. Methods 47 fMEG sessions were conducted with 24 healthy pregnant women in three gestational age groups (30–32 weeks, 33–35 weeks and 36–39 weeks). The stimulation consisted of amplitude-modulated (AM) tones with a duration of one second, a carrier frequency (CF) of 500 Hz and a modulation frequency (MF) of 27 Hz or 42 Hz. Both tones were presented in a random order with equal probability adding up to 80–100 repetitions per tone. The ASSR across trials was quantified by assessing phase synchrony in the cortical signals at the stimulation frequency. Results and conclusion Ten out of 47 recordings were excluded due to technical problems or maternal movements. Analysis of the included 37 fetal recordings revealed a statistically significant response for the phase coherence between trials for the MF of 27 Hz but not for 42 Hz. An exploratory subgroup analysis moreover suggested an advantage in detectability for fetal behavioral state 2F (active asleep) compared to 1F (quiet asleep) detected using fetal heart rate. In conclusion, this pilot study is the first description of a method to detect human ASSRs in fetuses. The findings warrant further investigations of the developing fetal brain."
https://openalex.org/W3045487023,"States often seek to regulate the use of police force though citizen complaint systems. This paper examines these systems, specifically, whether patterns of bias found in other juridical contexts are mirrored in the adjudication of police assault. The analysis focuses on prosecutors as the first instance of adjudication who determine whether to move forward with investigation, effectively deciding the majority of cases. We ask whether prosecutor sex is associated with the probability that a police assault claim will be investigated. We leverage a natural experiment in Sweden where prosecutors are assigned through a modified lottery system, effectively randomizing appointment. Our findings suggest that prosecutor gender plays a role in judicial outcomes: women prosecutors are 16 percentage points more likely to investigate claims of police assault than their male counterparts. These findings have implications for scholars interested in state human rights abuses, democratic institutions, and judicial inequality."
https://openalex.org/W3043859820,"Simon tasks reveal implicit processing conflicts that arise when the abstract coding of stimulus position is incongruent with coding for location of the output response. Participants were tested with two versions of a Simon task in a counterbalanced order to examine a potential female bias for attending to object characteristics versus object location. Both tasks used a triangle pointing to the left or right. A simple version presented the triangle in an inner or outer position relative to central fixation. A more complex version included a frame surrounding the inner-outer triangle presentation area in order to introduce additional visual elements for left/right visual processing. When the No Frame version was the first presented, there were no sex differences in the Simon effect in either version, which is consistent with results from other studies that did not provide feedback regarding accuracy. When the initial test was the Frame version, we observed a reverse Simon effect for incongruent triangles presented in the left inner position, with females faster than males to identify the incongruent condition versus the congruent (-59 vs -5 msec). In the No Frame condition that followed, females showed a carryover effect from the previous Frame condition, exhibiting positive Simon effects that were two fold larger than males for identifying incongruent stimuli presented in the left and right outer positions. Similar to previous Simon studies, females showed longer overall reaction times than males (~15%). The difference was not related to the Simon effect and is also found in other types of tasks involving early visual processing of objects with location. Based on sex differences in the Simon effect that emerged following initial experience of the triangle adjoining the frame, the present results support a female bias toward broader integration of objects within the context of location."
https://openalex.org/W3044502386,"The ability to accurately measure the geometric characteristics of soil wetted bodies (SWBs) is very important for conserving water in agriculture. However, measurements of SWBs obtained using conventional methods have a number of defects. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a promising technique for detecting buried features. In this paper, we used GPR to nondestructively investigate SWBs formed under drip irrigation. First, numerical simulations were performed to obtain the theoretical radar-gram of SWBs. Then, controlled irrigation experiments were performed to obtain radar scan datasets in a laboratory. The GPR image was interpreted according to the numerical simulation results, and the SWB thickness detection accuracy was estimated. Finally, GPR detection was performed in the field with different irrigation volumes, and the detection effect was assessed. The GPR reflections in the laboratory and field measurements were more complex than in the numerical simulation images, but the location and thickness of SWBs were still clear; the accuracy of the measured thickness was high, and the accuracy decreased with an increase in irrigation volume. The radar image resolution and thickness accuracy measured in the field were slightly less than the values measured in the laboratory. Thus, GPR is able to quickly and accurately characterize SWBs formed by drip irrigation based on the thickness and relative position in the soil. Furthermore, the F-K offset transformation was an effective GPR data processing method for focusing reflections from SWBs to obtain their true position and physical extent."

Elongating stimulation pulse width (~25ms /phase) has been proposed as an effective method to improve spatial resolution of epi-retinal implants. However, it is unknown whether longer stimulus pulse width will increase the risk of damaging the retina. In addition, with the advent of next generation retinal prosthesis featuring high-density microelectrode array, it is tempting to optimizing a single set of parameters for all electrodes instead of optimizing parameters of each electrode, but this approach raised biosafety concern. We sought to study the effect of stimulus pulse width on the response of retinal ganglion cells to electrical stimulation, and evaluate if the single parameter set approach was valid based on biosafety measures.We stimulated mouse retina using biphasic pulse waveform generated by chosen electrodes (single or a 3x3 assembly) from multiple microelectrode arrays, recorded their action potentials and performed spike sorting. We tested various stimulus intensity with two fixed pulse width: a short one for 1 millisecond per phase, and a long one for 25 milliseconds per phase. All these assays were performed on two mouse models: the wildtype C57BL/6J mice and the photoreceptor degenerated rd10 mice. The action-potential-frequency vs stimulus amplitude profiles were plotted, and three parameters were extracted: the threshold (the lowest stimulus amplitude activating RGC units), safety-limit (stimulus amplitude that attenuated the firing rate to half of the maximum response), and the stimulation amplitude range (the difference between threshold and safety limit parameters).In single-electrode stimulation experiment, we found that on average 85% of the recorded units showed attenuated response to extreme stimulation; among those units, an average of 51% stopped responding during stimulation ramping and failed to recover after one-hour post-stimulation, indicating extreme stimulation can damage RGC units. Twenty-five-millisecond pulse stimulation significantly reduced safety-limit and stimulation-amplitude-range parameters of recorded RGC units compared to 1ms pulse stimulation. During stimulus amplitude ramping, the maximum proportion of responsive healthy RGC units was 51% on average in 25ms pulse condition, and 76% on average in 1ms pulse condition, indicating long pulse may inflict more strain on RGCs, and a significant amount of inappropriately stimulated RGCs always exist. The contrast of these proportions could be explained by the tight correlation between the threshold and safety-limit parameter in 25ms pulse condition. These results were corroborated by those from 3x3 array stimulation experiments.Base on a biosafety measure (RGCs' evoked firing rate in response to electrical stimulation), we proposed that longer stimulation pulse width could lead to reduced retinal response and thus highlighted the importance of carefully setting the stimulation amplitude in this case. Our results also suggested that optimizing a single set of parameters for all electrodes without individual tweaking always generated a significant amount of inappropriately stimulated RGCs, especially in the long pulse stimulation condition."

Adenoviruses have also been engineered into viral vectors to deliver therapeutic genes or induce immunity as vaccine carriers. The success of ocular gene therapy is driven partly by the immunologic and biochemical influences of the intraocular environment. We have shown that versican and hyaluronan modulate adenoviral vector transgene expression through CD44 signaling. Herein we explored the role of these pathways on virus replication and viral protein expression of wild type adenovirus. We report that the addition of vitreous humor (which contains both versican and hyaluronan) increases viral hexon protein levels. Vitreous humor also increased wild type adenovirus DNA replication in vitro. Metalloproteinase and γ-secretase inhibitors, which inhibit CD44 proteolytic activation, blocked adenoviral replication in vitro. Similarly, protein kinase C and RhoA kinase inhibitors, both proteins associated with CD44 mediated pathways, also inhibited wild type adenoviral replication in vitro. Application of metalloproteinase and γ-secretase inhibitors to human conjunctival explants sharply decreased adenoviral vector gene expression. Our results demonstrate that pharmacologic delivery of these inhibitors is easily achievable. The inhibition of these enzymes should be explored as potential therapies of wild type adenoviral infections."
https://openalex.org/W3045431247,"Background Herpetic keratitis (HK) models using whole human corneas are essential for studying virus-host relationships, because of high species specificity and the role of interactions between corneal cell populations that cell culture cannot reproduce. Nevertheless, the two current corneal storage methods (hypothermia and organ culture (OC)) do not preserve corneas in good physiological condition, as they are characterized by epithelial abrasion, stromal oedema, and excessive endothelial mortality. Methods To rehabilitate human corneas intended for scientific use, we used an active storage machine (ASM) that restores two physiological parameters that are essential for corneal homeostasis: intraocular pressure and storage medium renewal (21mmHg and 2.6 μL/min, respectively). ASM storage regenerates a normal multilayer epithelium in 2 weeks. We infected six pairs of corneas unsuitable for graft by inoculating the epithelium with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and compared each ASM-stored cornea with the other cornea stored in the same medium using the conventional OC method. Results Only corneas in the ASM developed a dendritic (n = 3) or geographic (n = 2) epithelial ulcer reproducing typical HSV-1-induced clinical lesions. Corneas in OC showed only extensive desquamations. None of the uninfected controls showed epithelial damage. Histology, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy and polymerase chain reaction on corneal tissue confirmed infection in all cases (excluding negative controls). Conclusions The ASM provides an innovative ex vivo model of HK in whole human cornea that reproduces typical epithelial lesions."
https://openalex.org/W4234237149,"Background Esophageal cancer is a deadly cancer with 5-year survival <20%. Although multiple risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) including obesity, GERD and smoking have been identified, these risk factors do not fully explain the rising incidence of EAC. In this study, we evaluated the association between prior history of tonsillectomy and EAC. Our goal was to determine whether tonsillectomies were more frequent in patients with EAC (cases) than in our thoracic surgery controls. Methods Cases included 452 esophagectomy cases, including 396 with EAC and 56 who underwent esophagectomy for Barrett’s esophagus (BE) with high grade dysplasia (HGD). 1,102 thoracic surgery patients with surgical indications other than dysplastic BE or esophageal cancer represented the controls for our analysis. The association of tonsillectomy and HGD/EAC were primarily evaluated by using univariate tests and then verified by logistic regression analysis. Baseline demographics, medical history, and thoracic surgery controls were compared by using χ2 tests or 95% CIs. Significant risk factors were considered as covariates in the multivariate models while evaluating the association between tonsillectomy and HGD/EAC. P-values or odds ratios were estimated with 95% confidence limits to identify significances which was more appropriate. Results Tonsillectomy was more common in cases than controls and was found to have a significant association with esophageal cancer (19.9% vs. 12.7%; p-value = 0.0003). This significant association persisted after controlling for other known risk factors/covariates. Conclusion A prior history of tonsillectomy was significantly associated with HGD/EAC and may represent an independent risk factor for the development of EAC. However, the underlying biology driving this association remains unclear."

https://openalex.org/W3044304399,"A series of potent HIV-1 protease inhibitors, containing diverse piperidine analogues as the P2-ligands, 4-substituted phenylsulfonamides as the P2'-ligands and a hydrophobic cyclopropyl group as the P1'-ligand, were designed, synthesized and evaluated in this work. Among these twenty-four target compounds, many of them exhibited excellent activity against HIV-1 protease with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values below 20 nM. Particularly, compound 22a containing a (R)-piperidine-3-carboxamide as the P2-ligand and a 4-methoxylphenylsulfonamide as the P2'-ligand exhibited the most effective inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 3.61 nM. More importantly, 22a exhibited activity with inhibition of 42% and 26% against wild-type and Darunavir (DRV)-resistant HIV-1 variants, respectively. Additionally, the molecular docking of 22a with HIV-1 protease provided insight into the ligand-binding properties, which was of great value for further study."

https://openalex.org/W3045419899,"The preprocedural assessment of outcomes and patients' prognosis after interventional therapy of functional MR (FMR) is uncertain. Therefore, we aim to develop an easy-to-handle scoring system for adequate prediction of individual outcomes in patients with FMR after the interventional treatment.We retrospectively used medical data of patients with symptomatic FMR, who underwent transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) from January 2014 to August 2016 in our heart center. All patients had the mean follow-up of 18 months. All clinical and echocardiographic data originate from the ""Bonner Mitral Valve Register Database"".We included 105 patients (76,7±8,8 years, 50,6% female) with symptomatic (NYHA functional class>II) moderate-to-severe or severe FMR at surgical high-risk. We modified the MIDA-Score for degenerative MR (DMR) according to the varying underlying pathomechanisms of FMR, called as ""The modified MIDA Score"". We found all-cause mortality of 7% within 18 months after the procedure. 34,1% of our cohort was rehospitalized; 90% of those were due to cardiovascular causes. The modified MIDA score was found to be a strong predictor for mortality and rehospitalization in patients with FMR (AUC: 0,89) and superior to the other conventional scoring systems in prediction of mortality (The modified MIDA-Score: AUC: 0,8, EuroSCORE II: AUC: 0,57, STS-Score: AUC: 0,51). The logistic regression analysis showed the modified MIDA score > 9 points to be the strongest predictor for mortality and rehospitalization after TMVR (OR: 3,35, p = 0,011).The modified MIDA score was found to be a promising, easy-to-handle, elementary scoring system for adequate prediction of individual postinterventional prognosis in patients with FMR undergoing TMVR. Further evaluation and validation of this novel scoring system in prospective multicentric studies with a large number of patients is warranted."
