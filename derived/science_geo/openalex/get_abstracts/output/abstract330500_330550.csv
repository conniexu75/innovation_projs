https://openalex.org/W1969724205,"Dramatic progress has been made in the development of gene transfer systems for higher plants. The ability to introduce foreign genes into plant cells and tissues and to regenerate viable, fertile plants has allowed for explosive expansion of our understanding of plant biology and has provided an unparalleled opportunity to modify and improve crop plants. Genetic engineering of plants offers significant potential for seed, agrichemical, food processing, specialty chemical, and pharmaceutical industries to develop new products and manufacturing processes. The extent to which genetically engineered plants will have an impact on key industries will be determined both by continued technical progress and by issues such as regulatory approval, proprietary protection, and public perception."

https://openalex.org/W2027349520,"By means of video-tape recording the visual presentation of a person's behavior as he carries out some task, can be delayed in such a way that the individual sees what he is doing a short time after he has done it. The effects of this delay of visual feedback on a variety of simple visual-motor tasks are found to be both marked and deleterious, and in some respects similar to the effects of delayed auditory feedback on speech and motor tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2064154553,A trace-element deficiency is evident from carbon-14 bioassays of Castle Lake's natural phytoplankton populations. Increase in photosynthetic rates with the addition of molybdic acid or sodium molybdate has been demonstrated throughout the year. It is likely that other trace elements may also be found to be limiting factors in lakes having a limited watershed.
https://openalex.org/W2021584378,The extremely potent sex attractant of the female gypsy moth has been isolated in pure form and identified as dextrorotatory 10-acetoxy-1-hydroxy-cis-7-hexadecene. The dl-form of the attractant has been synthesized.
https://openalex.org/W2042975402,"Analysis of 27 repeated observations of Global Positioning System (GPS) position-difference vectors, up to 11 kilometers in length, indicates that the standard deviation of the measurements is 4 millimeters for the north component, 6 millimeters for the east component, and 10 to 20 millimeters for the vertical component. The uncertainty grows slowly with increasing vector length. At 225 kilometers, the standard deviation of the measurement is 6, 11, and 40 millimeters for the north, east, and up components, respectively. Measurements with GPS and Geodolite, an electromagnetic distance-measuring system, over distances of 10 to 40 kilometers agree within 0.2 part per million. Measurements with GPS and very long baseline interferometry of the 225-kilometer vector agree within 0.05 part per million."

https://openalex.org/W2018292008,"Shoals and spits may grow seaward, despite powerful refracted wave attack, where the wave energy level is too low to handle the supply of sand introduced by the littoral drift. Spits and shoals of this type have distinctive shapes. They may support ripple marks which do not parallel the crests of the waves which form them."

https://openalex.org/W1978974969,"A new method is described for eliciting a stable spindle burst response after the production of unilateral lesions in the reticular formation of the cat. This permits quantifying the effects of stimulation of the reticular activating system, either electrically or by injection of epinephrine, on the cortical arousal response."
