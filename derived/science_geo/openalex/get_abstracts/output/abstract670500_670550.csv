https://openalex.org/W3137837560,"Background Brazil became the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in a brief period of a few months after the first officially registered case. The knowledge of the epidemiological/clinical profile and the risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients can assist in the decision making of physicians in the implementation of early and most appropriate measures for poor prognosis patients. However, these reports are missing. Here we present a comprehensive study that addresses this demand. Methods This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26th to August 10th, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. Results The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the lethality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Cardiac disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cardiac disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high lethality rate of around 50% was observed. The intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate was 39.37% and of these 62.4% died. 24.4% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with high mortality among them (82.98%). The main mortality risk predictors were older age and IMV requirement. In addition, socioeconomic conditions have been shown to significantly influence the disease outcome, regardless of age and comorbidities. Conclusion Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the hospitalized Brazilian COVID-19 patients profile and the mortality risk factors. The analysis also evidenced that the disease outcome is influenced by multiple factors, as unequally affects different segments of population."
https://openalex.org/W3137266751,"Hemp seed ( Cannabis sativa L.) contain large amounts of nutrients, e.g. protein, dietary fiber, minerals, and unsaturated fatty acids, which make them a good fortifying component in food production. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of hemp addition on the physicochemical properties, cooking quality, texture parameters and sensory properties of durum wheat pasta. The samples were fortified with 5–40% of commercially available hemp flour or 2.5–10% of hemp cake obtained from hemp seed oil pressing. Our study showed that the addition of hemp seed raw materials led to an increase in the protein, total dietary fiber (TDF), ash and fat content in the pasta samples. Due to its lower granulation and higher nutritional value, hemp flour was found to be a better raw material for the fortification of pasta than hemp cake. Pasta enriched with hemp flour at the level of 30–40% contains 19.53–28.87% d.m. of protein and 17.02–21.49% d.m. of TDF and according to the EU, a definition can be described as a high-protein and high-fiber products. All enriched pasta samples were also characterized by safe Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) content, and their sensory properties were accepted by consumers."
https://openalex.org/W3137082178,"Background Healthcare workers (HCW) are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from both patients and other HCW with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of SARS-CoV-2 ≤ 34 and the first 7–9 days of symptoms are associated with enhanced infectivity. We determined Ct values and duration of symptoms of HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. As HCW often assume their greatest risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 is working on a COVID-19 unit, we also determined Ct values and symptom duration of inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Methods From 6/24/2020-8/23/2020, Ct values and duration of symptoms from 13 HCW, 12 outpatients, and 28 inpatients who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. Results Among HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 46.2% (6/13) were asymptomatic and requested testing due to an exposure to someone with COVID-19; 83.3% (5/6) of those exposures occurred in the community rather than in the hospital. The median Ct value of HCW was 23.2, and 84.6% (11/13) had a Ct value ≤ 34. The median Ct value of 29.0 among outpatients with COVID-19 did not significantly differ from HCW. In contrast, inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test had a median Ct value of 34.0 (p = 0.003), which translated into a median ~1,000-fold lower viral load than observed in HCW. Among those with symptoms related to COVID-19, no (0/6) HCW compared to 50% (6/12) of inpatients had symptoms for at least one week (p = 0.04). Conclusions At our institution, asymptomatic COVID-19 accounted for nearly half of the cases among HCW. Symptomatic HCW had high viral loads and short duration of symptoms, both of which are associated with peak infectivity. Infection prevention programs should educate HCW on these findings in an effort to increase adherence to the requirement to maintain six feet separation in workspaces and breakrooms, in addition to consistently wearing personal protection equipment."
https://openalex.org/W3139105055,"Collective intelligence (CI) is the ability of a group to solve a wide range of problems. Synchrony in nonverbal cues is critically important to the development of CI; however, extant findings are mostly based on studies conducted face-to-face. Given how much collaboration takes place via the internet, does nonverbal synchrony still matter and can it be achieved when collaborators are physically separated? Here, we hypothesize and test the effect of nonverbal synchrony on CI that develops through visual and audio cues in physically-separated teammates. We show that, contrary to popular belief, the presence of visual cues surprisingly has no effect on CI; furthermore, teams without visual cues are more successful in synchronizing their vocal cues and speaking turns, and when they do so, they have higher CI. Our findings show that nonverbal synchrony is important in distributed collaboration and call into question the necessity of video support."
https://openalex.org/W3138085488,"Background A number of studies have reported the association between the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB) medications and the occurrence or severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Published results are inconclusive, possibly due to differences in participant comorbidities and sociodemographic backgrounds. Since ACEI and ARB are frequently used anti-hypertension medications, we aim to determine whether the use of ACEI and ARB is associated with the occurrence and severity of COVID-19 in a large study of US Veterans with hypertension. Methods Data were collected from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Corporate Data Warehouse (VA-COVID-19 Shared Data Resource) between February 28, 2020 and August 18, 2020. Using data from 228,722 Veterans with a history of hypertension who received COVID-19 testing at the VA, we investigated whether the use of ACEI or ARB over the two years prior to the index date was associated with increased odds of (1) a positive COVID-19 test, and (2) a severe outcome (hospitalization, mortality, and use of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation) among COVID-19-positive patients. We used logistic regression with and without propensity score weighting (PSW) to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between ACEI/ARB use and a positive COVID-19 test result. The association between medication use and COVID-19 outcome severity was examined using multinomial logistic regression comparing participants who were not hospitalized to participants who were hospitalized, were admitted to the ICU, used a mechanical ventilator, or died. All models were adjusted for relevant covariates, including demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), selected comorbidities, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Results The use of ACEI significantly decreased the odds of a positive COVID-19 test among Veterans with hypertension (OR = 0.917, (0.887, 0.948) and OR = 0.926, (0.894, 0.958) with PSW). The use of ACEI, but not of ARB, was also associated with significantly increased odds of using mechanical ventilators (OR = 1.265, (1.010, 1.584) and OR = 1.210, (1.053, 1.39) with PSW) among all COVID-19 inpatients compared to outpatients. Conclusions In this study of Veterans with hypertension, ACEI was significantly associated with decreased odds of testing positive for COVID-19. With the exception of the association of ACEI with a small non-clinically-important increase in the odds of using mechanical ventilators, neither ACEI nor ARB was found to be associated with clinical severity or mortality among COVID-19-positive Veterans. The results of this study need further corroboration and validation in other cohort samples outside the VA."
https://openalex.org/W3090557520,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is a novel human coronavirus strain (HCoV) was initially reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. This acute infection caused pneumonia-like symptoms and other respiratory tract illness. Its higher transmission and infection rate has successfully enabled it to have a global spread over a matter of small time. One of the major concerns involving the SARS-COV-2 is the mutation rate, which enhances the virus evolution and genome variability, thereby making the design of therapeutics difficult. In this study, we identified the most common haplotypes from the haplotype network. The conserved genes and population level variants were analysed. Non-Structural Protein 10 (NSP10), Nucleoprotein, Papain-like protease (Plpro or NSP3) and 3-Chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro or NSP5), which were conserved at the highest threshold, were used as drug targets for molecular dynamics simulations. Darifenacin, Nebivolol, Bictegravir, Alvimopan and Irbesartan are among the potential drugs, which are suggested for further pre-clinical and clinical trials. This particular study provides a comprehensive targeting of the conserved genes. We also identified the mutation frequencies across the viral genome."
https://openalex.org/W3137987165,"Purpose To assess efficacy and safety of imaging-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of Osteoid Osteoma (OO) in both typical and atypical sites. Methods and materials Between January 2014 and March 2019, 102 consecutive percutaneous RFA were performed and retrospectively reviewed. The procedures were performed using a RFA bipolar ablation system (Covidien, exposed tip of 0.7-1cm), under Computed Tomography (CT) guidance or using a navigation system (Masmec) under CT and Cone Beam CT (CBCT) guidance. Patients were followed up over 24 months. Clinical success and recurrences were considered on the base of established criteria. In patients with clinical failure and/or imaging evidence of relapse, retreatment was considered. Results Administered power per-procedure was ≤8 W (mean temperature, 90°C). The pre-procedure average value of visual analog scale (VAS) was 8.33+/-0.91. Primary and secondary success rate 96.08% (98/102) and100% (102/102), respectively. No major complication was described. Technical success was proved in every patient by CT scan acquisition after needle positioning. Relapse and tumour location were significantly correlated (p-value = 0.0165). The mean dose-length product was 751.55 mGycm2. Advanced bone healing was noted in 68 lesions after 1y-follow up and in 86 lesions after 2y-follow up. Conclusion Imaging-guided percutaneous RFA is a highly effective technique for OO, both in typical and atypical sites. CT or CBCT guidance, navigation systems and operator experience grant the technical success, which is the most crucial parameter affecting outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3138386814,"Cerebral ischemia causes tissue death owing to occlusion of the cerebral blood vessels, and cerebral ischemia activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and induces secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Adenosine A 2A receptor agonist, polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN), suppresses the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and exhibits anti-inflammatory effect. In the current study, the therapeutic effect of PDRN on cerebral ischemia was evaluated using gerbils. For the induction of cerebral ischemia, the common carotid arteries were exposed, and then aneurysm clips were used to occlude the common carotid arteries bilaterally for 7 minutes. In the PDRN-treated groups, the gerbils were injected intraperitoneally with 0.3 mL of saline containing 8 mg/kg PDRN, per a day for 7 days following cerebral ischemia induction. In order to confirm the participation of the adenosine A 2A receptor in the effects mediated by PDRN, 8 mg/kg 7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX), adenosine A 2A receptor antagonist, was treated with PDRN. In the current study, induction of ischemia enhanced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased phosphorylation of MAPK signaling factors in the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala. However, treatment with PDRN ameliorated short-term memory impairment by suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inactivation of MAPK signaling factors in cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, PDRN treatment enhanced the concentration of cyclic adenosine-3,5’-monophosphate (cAMP) as well as phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB). Co-treatment of DMPX and PDRN attenuated the therapeutic effect of PDRN on cerebral ischemia. Based on these findings, PDRN may be developed as the primary treatment in cerebral ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W3136304269,"Background Persistent symptoms attributed to presumed tick-bite exposure constitute an unresolved medical controversy. We evaluated whether Swedish adults who met the criteria for post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) exhibited characteristics distinguishable from adults who did not, but who displayed similar symptoms and disease course after suspected previous tick-bite infection (TBI). Methods and findings During 2015–2018, 255 patients–referred to the Centre for Vector-borne Infections, Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden with symptoms lasting longer than six months–were recruited. Of this group, 224 completed the study. Each patient was examined by an infectious disease specialist and, besides a full medical history, underwent a panel of blood and cerebrospinal fluid laboratory tests including hematological, biochemical, microbiological and immunological analyses, and the RAND-36 scale to measure quality of life. For analysis purposes, patients were divided into five subgroups, of which one represented PTLDS. According to serological results indicating TBI and documented/ reported objective signs of Lyme disease, 85 (38%) patients fulfilled the criteria for PTLDS and were compared with the other 139 (62%) serologically classified patients. In the PTLDS group, erythema chronicum migrans (ECM) was documented/reported in 86% of patients, previous neuroborreliosis in 15%, and acrodermatitis chronica atroficans (ACA) in 3.5%. However, there were no significant differences regarding symptoms, laboratory results or disease course between patients with PTLDS and those without laboratory evidence of Borrelia exposition. Most reported symptoms were fatigue-related (70%), musculoskeletal (79%), neurological (82%) and neurocognitive (57%). Tick bites were recalled by 74%. The RAND-36 score was significantly below that of the general Swedish population. Signs of immunological/inflammatory reactivity with myositis antibodies were detected in 20% of patients, fibrinogen levels were moderately increased in 21% and elevated rheumatoid factor in 6%. Conclusions The PTLDS group did not differ exclusively in any respect from the other subgroups, which either lacked previously documented/reported evidence of borreliosis or even lacked detectable serological signs of exposure to Lyme disease. The results suggest that symptoms often categorized as Chronic-Lyme-Disease (CLD) in the general debate, cannot be uniquely linked to Lyme disease. However, approximately 20% of the total group of patients showed signs of autoimmunity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying causes and mechanisms of PTLDS and there is reason to consider a multifactorial approach."
https://openalex.org/W3136376193,"Background The risk of thromboembolism and bleeding before initiation of oral anticoagulant (OAC) in atrial fibrillation patients is estimated by CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scoring system, respectively. Patients’ socioeconomic status (SES) could influence these risks, but its impact on the two risk scores’ predictive performance with respect to clinical events remains unknown. Our objective was to determine if patient SES defined by area deprivation index (ADI), in conjunction with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scores, could guide oral anticoagulation therapy. Methods and findings The study cohort included newly diagnosed patients with AF who were treated with warfarin. The cohort was stratified by the time in therapeutic range of INR (TTR), ADI, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, and HAS-BLED risk scores. TTR and ischemic and bleeding events during the first year of therapy were compared across subpopulations. Among 7274 patients, those living in the two most deprived quintiles (ADI ≥60%) had a significantly higher risk of ischemic events and those in the most deprived quintile (ADI≥80%) had a significantly increased risk of bleeding events. ADI significantly improved the predictive performance of CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc but not HAS-BLED risk scores. Conclusion ADI can predict increased risk for ischemic and bleeding events in the first year of warfarin therapy in patients with incident AF."
https://openalex.org/W3137870461,"Successful CAR T cell therapy for the treatment of solid tumors requires exemplary CAR T cell expansion, persistence and fitness, and the ability to target tumor antigens safely. Here we address this constellation of critical attributes for successful cellular therapy by using integrated technologies that simplify development and derisk clinical translation. We have developed a CAR-CD19 T cell that secretes a CD19-anti-Her2 bridging protein. This cell therapy strategy exploits the ability of CD19-targeting CAR T cells to interact with CD19 on normal B cells to drive expansion, persistence and fitness. The secreted bridging protein potently binds to Her2-positive tumor cells, mediating CAR-CD19 T cell cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo . Because of its short half-life, the secreted bridging protein will selectively accumulate at the site of highest antigen expression, ie. at the tumor. Bridging proteins that bind to multiple different tumor antigens have been created. Therefore, antigen-bridging CAR-CD19 T cells incorporate critical attributes for successful solid tumor cell therapy. This platform can be exploited to attack tumor antigens on any cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3138082165,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is traditionally prescribed by HIV specialist physicians. Given finite specialist resources, there is a need to scale up PrEP delivery by decentralizing services via other healthcare professionals. We aimed to assess the feasibility of delivering PrEP to men who have sex with men (MSM) through primary care physicians and sexual health clinic nurses. We piloted a multi-component, implementation and dissemination research program to increase provision of PrEP through primary care physicians and sexual health clinic nurses in Toronto, Canada. Community-based organizations (CBOs) provided prospective participants with information cards that contained links to an online module on engaging providers in a conversation about PrEP. In our patient-initiated continuing medical education (PICME) strategy, participants saw their family doctors and gave them the card, which also contained a link to a Continuing Medical Education module. In the nurse-led strategy, participants visited one of two participating clinics to obtain PrEP. We administered an optional online questionnaire to patients and providers at baseline and six months. CBOs distributed 3043 cards. At least 339 men accessed the online module and 196 completed baseline questionnaires. Most (55%) intended to visit nurses while 21% intended to consult their physicians. Among 45 men completing follow-up questionnaires at 6 months, 31% reported bringing cards to their physicians and obtaining PrEP through them; sexual health clinics delivered PrEP to 244 patients. Participants who went through the PICME approach reported no changes in relationships with their providers. Nurses showed fidelity to PrEP prescribing guidelines. Nurse-led PrEP and patient-initiated continuing medical education (PICME) for primary care physicians are feasible strategies to increase PrEP uptake. Nurse-led PrEP delivery was preferred by most patients."
https://openalex.org/W3139264030,"Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the association of allergic rhinitis with air pollutant concentrations using the follow-up data of elementary school children in Ulsan, Korea. Methods All students of four elementary schools in Ulsan, South Korea were surveyed at two-year intervals. The survey used data collected five times, over a nine-year period from June 2009 to April 2018. The questionnaire used in the survey was a modified version of the ISAAC (International society of asthma and allergy of children) questionnaire. A skin prick test (SPT) was performed with 24 standard antigens. To estimate the levels of exposure to outdoor air pollution, the concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter 10 μm or less in diameter (PM10) were used. As a dependent variable, a history of allergic rhinitis diagnosed by a doctor during the last 1-year was considered. Logistic regression analysis was used to select variables suitable for the statistical model. The selected variables were then used to assess their association with the dependent variable using the generalized estimation equation. Results Among environmental factors, SO 2 was associated with a high risk and PM10 was associated with a low risk of allergic rhinitis. The risk of allergic rhinitis from living in a house built within the last year was high, and the risk from living in a multi-family house or apartment was higher than that from living in a segregated house. History of allergic diseases in the family was a high-risk factor for allergic rhinitis. There was a relationship between a history of bronchiolitis at less than 2 years of age and a high risk of allergic rhinitis. Boys were at a higher risk than girls. Conclusion From the follow-up data of elementary school students in Ulsan, Korea, the concentration of SO 2 , which is an indicator of the degree of industrialization, was related to the prevalence of allergic rhinitis. Among all the risk factors, history of allergic disease in the parents was the most important factor, and the study reconfirmed the results of the previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W3136014345,"As in other countries, short-term rentals for tourism services are growing rapidly in China’s tourist cities, which are mainly operated through Airbnb. This paper explores whether the spatial distribution of Airbnb in China’s rapid urbanization process exhibits characteristics, paths, and drivers that are different from those of cities in other countries. Airbnb is a model for the global sharing economy, but it is increasingly influenced by other functions and facilities in cities as it grows. In this paper, the zero-expansion negative binomial regression was used to study the factors affecting the spatial distribution of Airbnb in Nanjing, China. The results showed that the spatial distribution of Airbnb listings was correlated with the distribution of cultural attractions, universities, public transport accessibility, shopping centers, and business apartments. By analyzing the driving forces of Airbnb’s development in Nanjing, this paper found that a large number of business apartments developed in cities were essential providers of Airbnb listings, and affected its spatial distribution. The gap between short-term and long-term rentals was also correlated with the distribution of Airbnb. In addition, similar to the previous literature findings, the increase in the proportion of professional hosts changes the original intention of Airbnb for sharing and communication. Our empirical results applies to the current situation of Airbnb in Chinese cities, which is conducive to the government’s more intelligent management and effective promotion of the Airbnb market. Our findings also provide positive references for urban renewal policies and public participation methods in China."
https://openalex.org/W3137394066,"Over 90% of oral cancers are oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Hitherto, early detection marker for OSCC has not been available. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic ability of salivary matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) for OSCC. Total of 318 participants with 106 cases and 212 controls were included: OSCC cases were from Seoul National University Dental Hospital and age, sex, and smoking matched controls were from Yangpyeong cohort. Unstimulated saliva was collected to determine MMP-9 and 8-OHdG using sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multivariable linear regression and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were applied to evaluate the adjusted association of markers with OSCC. Wilcoxon sign rank sum test and Friedman test for median were applied to evaluate follow-up level of MMP-9 after surgery. Receiver operating characteristic curve was obtained for diagnostic ability. Salivary MMP-9 was associated with OSCC (ANCOVA and multivariable linear regression, p&lt;0.05), while 8-OHdG was not. The diagnostic ability of MMP-9 was area under curve of 0.96 (100% specificity and 89.6% sensitivity, p&lt;0.001). MMP-9 decreased dramatically after tumor surgery (p&lt;0.05). Salivary MMP-9 could be a critical diagnostic and prognostic marker for OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W3138706911,"Farming is the main livelihood of a majority of people in India. The country is also home to a large population of undernourished people. This indicates potential for mainstreaming the nutrition dimension in the farming system to impact on nutrition outcomes. A Farming System for Nutrition (FSN) study was conducted in two agro-ecologically different locations from 2013–2018, to explore the feasibility of nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions. The baseline survey in 2013–2014 revealed that the population in the study area was largely undernourished and that household diets were cereal-dominated. The FSN model was designed in consultation with community members, to increase availability of nutrient-dense cereals and pulses, by enhancing production and crop diversification at the farm level, promoting cultivation of nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables in nutrition gardens and supporting interventions to promote access to animal foods. Nutrition awareness initiatives were undertaken to build capacity at the local level and translate production diversity to consumption diversity. An endline survey was conducted in 2017 (July-October), following three years of intervention. Crop, vegetable and animal food production and food consumption was compared with the baseline data. There was evidence of higher production and consumption of nutrient rich foods, improved household dietary diversity; and understanding and acceptance of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. The number of items consumed under each food group, frequency of consumption of food and average per capita intake of nutrient-rich foods were found to have improved. The results provide evidence regarding feasibility of location-specific FSN models to promote sustainable and healthy diets, using locally available plant and animal food resources, to address nutrition deficiencies in farm families."
https://openalex.org/W3139016677,"Background Pyriproxyfen (PPF), an insect growth hormone mimic is widely used as a larvicide and in some second-generation bed nets, where it is combined with pyrethroids to improve impact. It has also been evaluated as a candidate for auto-dissemination by adult mosquitoes to control Aedes and Anopheles species. We examined whether PPF added to larval habitats of pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors can modulate levels of resistance among emergent adult mosquitoes. Methodology Third-instar larvae of pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles arabiensis (both laboratory-reared and field-collected) were reared in different PPF concentrations, between 1×10 −9 milligrams active ingredient per litre of water (mgAI/L) and 1×10 −4 mgAI/L, or no PPF at all. Emergent adults escaping these sub-lethal exposures were tested using WHO-standard susceptibility assays on pyrethroids (0.75% permethrin and 0.05% deltamethrin), carbamates (0.1% bendiocarb) and organochlorides (4% DDT). Biochemical basis of pyrethroid resistance was investigated by pre-exposure to 4% PBO. Bio-efficacies of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets, Olyset ® and PermaNet 2.0 were also examined against adult mosquitoes with or without previous aquatic exposure to PPF. Results Addition of sub-lethal doses of PPF to larval habitats of pyrethroid-resistant An . arabiensis , consistently resulted in significantly reduced mortalities of emergent adults when exposed to pyrethroids, but not to bendiocarb or DDT. Mortality rates after exposure to Olyset ® nets, but not PermaNet 2.0 were also reduced following aquatic exposures to PPF. Pre-exposure to PBO followed by permethrin or deltamethrin resulted in significant increases in mortality, compared to either insecticide alone. Conclusions Partially-resistant mosquitoes exposed to sub-lethal aquatic concentrations of PPF may become more resistant to pyrethroids than they already are without such pre-exposures. Studies should be conducted to examine whether field applications of PPF, either by larviciding or other means actually exacerbates pyrethroid-resistance in areas where signs of such resistance already exist in wild the vector populations. The studies should also investigate mechanisms underlying such magnification of resistance, and how this may impact the potential of PPF-based interventions in areas with pyrethroid resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3139486082,"The purpose of the paper is to investigate spatial determinants of farmers’ interest in pro-investment programs co-financed by the EU, by identifying and describing the territorial clusters of rural areas in Poland where the applications rates for these programs were above or below the national average. We tested for spatial autocorrelation using Moran’s global spatial autocorrelation index, while the search for clusters was done using a local version of Moran’s statistics. The results show significant regional variation in the farmers’ interest in these programs in Poland. This interest was higher in regions with a greater level of agricultural development and better agrarian structure. In Poland, both of these factors are related not only to natural conditions, but also to strong historical context. We conclude that the pro-investment programs contribute to the deepening of development differences in Polish agriculture in the territorial dimension, which is not in line with the basic assumptions of cohesion policy."
https://openalex.org/W3136014853,"We evaluated the effects of the inclusion of copaíba (Copaifera officinalis L.) essential oil at 0.05 and 0.1% as a possible replacement of synthetic additive butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in sheep burgers during 14 days of storage in a refrigerated display case (4°C). During the shelf life days, analyzes of antioxidant activity, lipid oxidation, pH, color, cooking loss, texture and consumer acceptability were carried out on refrigerated burgers. The addition of copaíba essential oil showed an antioxidant effect in sheep burgers (P > 0.05), reducing lipid oxidation. Copaiba essential oil added at 0.05% showed the highest antioxidant activity, decreased cooking losses and delaying discoloration (loss of redness) during storage; it further improved, the tenderness of sheep burgers (P < 0.05). The treatments had no effect (P > 0.05) on consumer acceptability. Copaiba essential oil is a promising natural antioxidant to increase the shelf life of meat products, as well as being a viable solution to replace synthetic antioxidant BHT, thereby promoting the fresh-like quality appeal of sheep burgers."
https://openalex.org/W3137343152,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to identify imaging risk factors on contrast-enhanced hip MRI after closed reduction of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) that could predict future development of avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head. Materials and methods Fifty-eight infants (F: M = 53: 5, aged 3–18 months) who underwent immediate postoperative contrast-enhanced hip MRI after closed reduction of DDH were included in this study. Quality of reduction (concentric vs eccentric reduction with or without obstacles), abduction angle of the hip, presence of ossific nucleus, and pattern of contrast enhancement of the femoral head were retrospectively evaluated on MRI. Interobserver agreement of contrast enhancement pattern on MRI were evaluated by two radiologists. Development of AVN was determined through radiographic findings at 1 year after reduction. Results AVN of the femoral head developed in 13 (22%) of 58 patients. Excessive abduction of the hip joint (OR 4.65, [95% CI 1.20, 18.06] and global decreased enhancement of the femoral head (OR 71.66, [95% CI 10.54, 487.31]) exhibited statistically significant differences between the AVN and non-AVN groups (P &lt; 0.05). Eccentric reduction (P = 0.320) did not show statistically significant difference between two groups and invisible ossific nucleus (P = 0.05) showed borderline significance. Multi-variable logistic regression indicated that global decreased enhancement of the femoral head was a significant risk factor of AVN (OR 27.92, 95% CI [4.17, 350.18]) (P = 0.0031). Interobserver agreement of contrast enhancement pattern analysis and diagnosis of AVN were good (0.66, 95% CI [0.52, 0.80]). Conclusion Contrast-enhanced hip MRI provides accurate anatomical assessment of the hip after closed reduction of DDH. Global decreased enhancement of the femoral head could be used as a good predictor for future development of AVN after closed reduction of DDH."
https://openalex.org/W3137703670,"Abnormal cell membrane metabolism is associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders. Free phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters, which can be detected by in vivo 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), are important cell membrane building blocks. However, the quantification of phosphoesters has been highly controversial even in healthy individuals due to overlapping signals from macromolecule membrane phospholipids (MP). In this study, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cerebral 31 P MRS spectra were acquired from healthy volunteers at both 3 and 7 Tesla. Our results indicated that, with minimal spectral interference from MP, the [phosphocreatine (PCr)]/[phosphocholine (PC) + glycerophosphocholine (GPC)] ratio measured at 7 Tesla agreed with its value expected from biochemical constraints. In contrast, the 3 Tesla [PCr]/[PC+GPC] ratio obtained using standard spectral fitting procedures was markedly smaller than the 7 Tesla ratio and than the expected value. The analysis suggests that the commonly used spectral model for MP may fail to capture its complex spectral features at 3 Tesla, and that additional prior knowledge is necessary to reliably quantify the phosphoester signals at low magnetic field strengths when spectral overlapping is significant."
https://openalex.org/W3138551574,"Background A systemic evaluation of the antigenic differences of the H7 influenza hemagglutinin (HA) proteins, especially for the viruses isolated after 2016, are limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antigenic differences of major H7 strains with an ultimate aim to discover H7 HA proteins that can elicit protective receptor-binding antibodies against co-circulating H7 influenza strains. Method A panel of eight H7 influenza strains were selected from 3,633 H7 HA amino acid sequences identified over the past two decades (2000–2018). The sequences were expressed on the surface of virus like particles (VLPs) and used to vaccinate C57BL/6 mice. Serum samples were collected and tested for hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity. The vaccinated mice were challenged with lethal dose of H7N9 virus, A/Anhui/1/2013. Results VLPs expressing the H7 HA antigens elicited broadly reactive antibodies each of the selected H7 HAs, except the A/Turkey/Italy/589/2000 (Italy/00) H7 HA. A putative glycosylation due to an A169T substitution in antigenic site B was identified as a unique antigenic profile of Italy/00. Introduction of the putative glycosylation site (H7 HA-A169T) significantly altered the antigenic profile of HA of the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) strain. Conclusion This study identified key amino acid mutations that result in severe vaccine mismatches for future H7 epidemics. Future universal influenza vaccine candidates will need to focus on viral variants with these key mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3139166523,"A gas-phase Advanced Oxidation Process (gAOP) was evaluated for decontaminating N95 and surgical masks. The continuous process was based on the generation of hydroxyl-radicals via the UV-C (254 nm) photo-degradation of hydrogen peroxide and ozone. The decontamination efficacy of the gAOP was dependent on the orientation of the N95 mask passing through the gAOP unit with those positioned horizontally enabling greater exposure to hydroxyl-radicals compared to when arranged vertically. The lethality of gAOP was independent of the applied hydrogen peroxide concentration (2-6% v/v) but was significantly (P<0.05) higher when H2O2 was introduced into the unit at 40 ml/min compared to 20 ml/min. A suitable treatment for N95 masks was identified as 3% v/v hydrogen peroxide delivered into the gAOP reactor at 40 ml/min with continuous introduction of ozone gas and a UV-C dose of 113 mJ/cm2 (30 s processing time). The treatment supported >6 log CFU decrease in Geobacillus stearothermophilus endospores, > 8 log reduction of human coronavirus 229E, and no detection of Escherichia coli K12 on the interior and exterior of masks. There was no negative effect on the N95 mask fitting or particulate efficacy after 20 passes through the gAOP system. No visual changes or hydrogen peroxide residues were detected (<1 ppm) in gAOP treated masks. The optimized gAOP treatment could also support >6 log CFU reduction of endospores inoculated on the interior or exterior of surgical masks. G. stearothermophilus Apex spore strips could be applied as a biological indicator to verify the performance of gAOP treatment. Also, a chemical indicator based on the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole was found suitable for reporting the generation of hydroxyl-radicals. In conclusion, gAOP is a verifiable treatment that can be applied to decontaminate N95 and surgical masks without any negative effects on functionality."

We identified a set of 11 clinical variables and then performed unsupervised clustering analyses to identify unique clinical phenotypes among patients with LVrecEF, followed by a Kaplan-Meier analysis to identify differences in survival and the proportion of LVrecEF patients who maintained an LVEF ≥ 50% during the study period.We identified 889 patients with LVrecEF who clustered into 7 unique phenotypes ranging in size from 37 to 420 patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significant differences in mortality across clusters (logrank p<0.0001), with survival ranging from 14% to 87% at 1000 days, as well as significant differences in the proportion of LVrecEF patients who maintained an LVEF ≥ 50%.There is significant clinical heterogeneity among patients with LVrecEF. Clinical outcomes are distinct across phenotype clusters as defined by clinical cardiac characteristics and co-morbidities. Clustering algorithms may identify patients who are at high risk for recurrent HF, and thus be useful for guiding treatment strategies for patients with LVrecEF."
https://openalex.org/W3138464911,"Oyster aquaculture is expanding worldwide, where many farms rely on seed produced by artificial spawning. As sperm motility and velocity are key determinants for fertilization success, understanding the regulation of sperm motility and identifying optimal environmental conditions can increase fertility and seed production. In the present study, we investigated the physiological mechanisms regulating sperm motility in Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica . Sperm motility was activated in ambient seawater with salinity 4–32 PSU with highest motility and velocity observed at 12–24 PSU. In artificial seawater (ASW) with salinity of 20 PSU, sperm motility was activated at pH 6.5–10.5 with the highest motility and velocity recorded at pH 7.5–10.0. Sperm motility was inhibited or totally suppressed in Na + , K + , Ca 2+ , and Mg 2+ -free ASW at 20 PSU. Applications of K + (500 μM glybenclamide and 10–50 mM 4-aminopyridine), Ca 2+ (1–50 μM mibefradil and 10–200 μM verapamil), or Na + (0.2–2.0 mM amiloride) channel blockers into ASW at 20 PSU inhibited or suppressed sperm motility and velocity. Chelating extracellular Ca 2+ ions by 3.0 and 3.5 mM EGTA resulted in a significant reduction and full suppression of sperm motility by 4 to 6 min post-activation. These results suggest that extracellular K + , Ca 2+ , and Na + ions are involved in regulation of ionic-dependent sperm motility in Eastern oyster. A comparison with other bivalve species typically spawning at higher salinities or in full-strength seawater shows that ionic regulation of sperm motility is physiologically conserved in bivalves. Elucidating sperm regulation in C . virginica has implications to develop artificial reproduction, sperm short-term storage, or cryopreservation protocols, and to better predict how changes in the ocean will impact oyster spawning dynamics."

We used simulation modeling to assess projected outcomes associated with different management strategies of Veterans with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with COPD and/or CAD. Patients and methods Using data from a cohort of 14,029 Veterans (years 2000–2015) with NSCLC we extended a well-validated mathematical model of lung cancer to represent the management and outcomes of Veterans with stage I NSCLC with COPD, with or without comorbid CAD. We simulated multiple randomized trials to compare treatment with lobectomy, limited resection, or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Model output estimated expected quality adjusted life years (QALY) of Veterans with stage I NSCLC according to age, tumor size, histologic subtype, COPD severity and CAD diagnosis. Results For Veterans &lt;70 years old lobectomy was associated with greater projected quality-adjusted life expectancy regardless of comorbidity status. For most combinations of tumors and comorbidity profiles there was no dominant treatment for Veterans ≥80 years of age, but less invasive treatments were often superior to lobectomy. Dominant treatment choices differed by CAD status for older patients in a third of scenarios, but not for patients &lt;70 years old. Conclusions The harm/benefit ratio of treatments for stage I NSCLC among Veterans may vary according to COPD severity and the presence of CAD. This information can be used to direct future research study design for Veterans with stage I lung cancer and COPD and/or CAD."
https://openalex.org/W3136040796,"Lystrosaurus represents one of the most successful dicynodonts, a survivor of the end-Permian mass extinction that remained abundant in the Early Triassic, but many aspects of its paleobiology are still controversial. The bone histology of Lystrosaurus species from South Africa and India has provided important information on their growth strategy and lifestyle, but until recently no data was available on the bone histology of Lystrosaurus from China. Here, we report on the bone microstructure of seven Lystrosaurus individuals from the Lower Triassic of Xinjiang, providing the first such data for the Chinese Lystrosaurus species. Our samples indicate that the microstructure of Lystrosaurus limb bones from China is characterized by fibrolamellar bone tissue similar to those from South Africa and India. Three ontogenetic stages were identified: juvenile, early subadult, and late subadult based on lines of arrested growth (LAGs) and bone tissue changes. Bone histology supports a rapid growth strategy for Lystrosaurus during early ontogeny. Unlike Early Triassic Lystrosaurus from South Africa, lines of arrested growth are common in our specimens, suggesting that many individuals of Chinese Lystrosaurus had reached the subadult stage and were interrupted in growth. The differences in bone histology between Lystrosaurus from South Africa and China may indicate different environmental conditions in these two regions."
https://openalex.org/W3136231040,"At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was able to spread quickly in Wuhan and in the province of Hubei due to a lack of experience with this novel virus. Additionally, authories had no proven experience with applying insufficient medical, communication and crisis management tools. For a considerable period of time, the actual number of people infected was unknown. There were great uncertainties regarding the dynamics and spread of the Covid-19 virus infection. In this paper, we develop a system dynamics model for the three connected regions (Wuhan, Hubei excl. Wuhan, China excl. Hubei) to understand the infection and spread dynamics of the virus and provide a more accurate estimate of the number of infected people in Wuhan and discuss the necessity and effectivity of protective measures against this epidemic, such as the quarantines imposed throughout China. We use the statistics of confirmed cases of China excl. Hubei. Also the daily data on travel activity within China was utilized, in order to determine the actual numerical development of the infected people in Wuhan City and Hubei Province. We used a multivariate Monte Carlo optimization to parameterize the model to match the official statistics. In particular, we used the model to calculate the infections, which had already broken out, but were not diagnosed for various reasons."
https://openalex.org/W3136714385,"Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15 to 24 years face disproportionately high risks of acquiring HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A sexual health risk stratification tool can support the development and implementation of tailored HIV and STI prevention services for sub-groups of at-risk AGYW. Data were collected among sexually active AGYW aged 15 to 24 years in Tanzania between April 2015 and March 2017. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to construct and assess the latent structure of a ten-item scale for rapid assessment of sexual health risks. Items with high factor loadings and minimal cross loadings were retained in the final scale. Scale performance was appraised against condomless sex (defined as unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse) reported by AGYW for construct validity. A three-factor structure of vulnerability to HIV among AGYW was supported with subscales for socioeconomic vulnerability; lack of adult support; and sexual behavioral risks. The chi-square goodness-of-fit test, root mean square error of approximation, comparative fit index, and Tucker-Lewis index indicated a strong goodness-of-fit of the three-factor scale. Cronbach alphas (0.55 for socioeconomic vulnerability, 0.55 for lack of support, and 0.48 for sexual risk) indicated sub-optimal internal consistency for all sub-scales. The factor-item and factor-factor correlations identified in these analyses were consistent with the conceptual framework of vulnerability of HIV infection in AGYW, suggesting good construct validity. The scale also demonstrated a statistically significant association with condomless sex and could be potentially used for sexual health risk stratification (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.23). The sexual health and HIV risk stratification scale demonstrated potential in identifying sexually active AGYW at high risk for HIV and other STIs. Ultimately, all AGYW in Tanzania are not at equal risk for HIV and this scale may support directing resources towards those at highest risk of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W3137150364,"Arctic and boreal environments are changing rapidly, which could decouple behavioral and demographic traits of animals from the resource pulses that have shaped their evolution. Dall’s sheep ( Ovis dalli dalli ) in northwestern regions of the USA and Canada, survive long, severe winters and reproduce during summers with short growing seasons. We sought to understand the vulnerability of Dall’s sheep to a changing climate in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA. We developed ecological hypotheses about nutritional needs, security from predators, energetic costs of movement, and thermal shelter to describe habitat selection during winter, spring, and summer and evaluated habitat and climate variables that reflected these hypotheses. We used the synoptic model of animal space use to estimate parameters of habitat selection by individual females and calculated likelihoods for ecological hypotheses within seasonal models. Our results showed that seasonal habitat selection was influenced by multiple ecological requirements simultaneously. Across all seasons, sheep selected steep rugged areas near escape terrain for security from predators. During winter and spring, sheep selected habitats with increased forage and security, moderated thermal conditions, and lowered energetic costs of movement. During summer, nutritional needs and security influenced habitat selection. Climate directly influenced habitat selection during the spring lambing period when sheep selected areas with lower snow depths, less snow cover, and higher air temperatures. Indirectly, climate is linked to the expansion of shrub/scrub vegetation, which was significantly avoided in all seasons. Dall’s sheep balance resource selection to meet multiple needs across seasons and such behaviors are finely tuned to patterns of phenology and climate. Direct and indirect effects of a changing climate may reduce their ability to balance their needs and lead to continued population declines. However, several management approaches could promote resiliency of alpine habitats that support Dall’s sheep populations."
https://openalex.org/W3137424942,"Narrative information in electronic health records (EHRs) contains a wealth of information related to patient health conditions. In addition, people use Twitter to express their experiences regarding personal health issues, such as medical complaints, symptoms, treatments, lifestyle, and other factors.

Knowing detailed information about controlling disease risk factors has a great impact on modifying these risks and subsequently preventing disease complications. Text-mining tools provide efficient solutions to extract and integrate vital information related to disease complications hidden in the large volume of the narrative text. However, the development of text-mining tools depends on the availability of an annotated corpus. In response, we have developed the PrevComp corpus, which is annotated with information relevant to the identification of disease complications, underlying risk factors, and prevention measures, in the context of the interaction between hypertension and diabetes. The corpus is unique and novel in terms of the very specific topic in the biomedical domain and as an integration of information from both EHRs and tweets collected from Twitter. The annotation scheme was designed with guidance by a domain expert, and two further domain experts performed the annotation, resulting in a high-quality annotation, with agreement rate F-scores as high as 0.60 and 0.75 for EHRs and tweets, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3137995383,"Objective Failure of membrane oxygenator (MO) function of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenators (VV ECMO) remains problematic. The development of device-induced coagulation disorder (COD) or worsened gas transfer (WGT) necessitates a system exchange. The aim was to correlate von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag) with the predisposition to MO failure and mortality. Methods Laboratory parameters (inflammation, coagulation) and ECMO-related data from 31 VV ECMO patients were analyzed before and after the first MO exchange. Study groups were identified according to the exchange reasons (COD, WGT) and the extent of vWF:Ag (low, ≤425%; high, &gt;425%). Results vWF:Ag remained unchanged after system exchange. High vWF:Ag was associated with systemic endothelial activation of older and obese patients with elevated SOFA score, increased norepinephrine and higher requirement of continuous renal replacement therapy without an effect on MO runtime and mortality. Including the mechanism of MO failure (COD, WGT), various patient group emerged. COD/low vWF:Ag summarized younger and less critically ill patients that benefit mainly from ECMO by a significant improvement of their inflammatory and coagulation status (CRP, D-dimers, fibrinogen) and highest survival rate (91%). Instead, WGT/high vWF:Ag presented older and more obese patients with a two-digit SOFA score, highest norepinephrine, and aggravated gas transfer. They benefited temporarily from system exchange but with worst survival (33%). Conclusions vWF:Ag levels alone cannot predict early MO failure and outcome in VV ECMO patients. Probably, the mechanism of clotting disorder in combination with the vWF:Ag level seems to be essential for clot formation within the MO. In addition, vWF:Ag levels allows the identification different patient populations In particular, WGT/high vWF:Ag represented a critically ill population with higher ECMO-associated mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3138324502,"To function during social interactions, we must be able to consider and coordinate our actions with other people’s perspectives. This process unfolds from decision-making, to anticipation of that decision’s consequences, to feedback about those consequences, in what can be described as a “cascade” of three phases. The iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (iPD) task, an economic-exchange game used to illustrate how people achieve stable cooperation over repeated interactions, provides a framework for examining this “social decision cascade”. In the present study, we examined neural activity associated with the three phases of the cascade, which can be isolated during iPD game rounds. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 31 adult participants made a) decisions about whether to cooperate with a co-player for a monetary reward, b) anticipated the co-player’s decision, and then c) learned the co-player’s decision. Across all three phases, participants recruited the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), regions implicated in numerous facets of social reasoning such as perspective-taking and the judgement of intentions. Additionally, a common distributed neural network underlies both decision-making and feedback appraisal; however, differences were identified in the magnitude of recruitment between both phases. Furthermore, there was limited evidence that anticipation following the decision to defect evoked a neural signature that is distinct from the signature of anticipation following the decision to cooperate. This study is the first to delineate the neural substrates of the entire social decision cascade in the context of the iPD game."
https://openalex.org/W3138565544,"Background Poultry represent a widely held economic, nutritional, and sociocultural asset in rural communities worldwide. In a recent longitudinal study in western Kenya, the reported mean number of chickens per household was 10, with increases in flock size constrained principally by mortality. Newcastle disease virus is a major cause of chicken mortality globally and hypothesized to be responsible for a large part of mortality in smallholder flocks. Our goal was to determine the impact of routine Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccination on flock size and use this data to guide programs to improve small flock productivity. Methods We conducted a factorial randomized controlled trial in 537 households: in 254 households all chickens were vaccinated every 3 months with I-2 NDV vaccine while chickens in 283 households served as unvaccinated controls. In both arms of the trial, all chickens were treated with endo- and ecto parasiticides every 3 months. Data on household chicken numbers and reported gains and losses were collected monthly for 18 months. Results Consistent with prior studies, the overall flock size was small but with increases in both arms of the study over time. The mean number of chickens owned at monthly census was 13.06±0.29 in the vaccinated households versus 12.06±0.20 in the control households (p = 0.0026) with significant gains in number of chicks (p = 0.06), growers (p = 0.09), and adults (p = 0.03) in the vaccinated flocks versus the controls. Household reported gains were 4.50±0.12 total chickens per month when vaccinated versus 4.15±0.11 in the non-vaccinated controls (p = 0.03). Gains were balanced by voluntary decreases, reflecting household decision-making for sales or household consumption, which were marginally higher, but not statistically significant, in vaccinated households and by involuntary losses, including mortality and loss due to predation, which were marginally higher in control households. Conclusion Quarterly NDV vaccination and parasiticidal treatment resulted in an increase in flock size by a mean of one bird per household as compared to households where the flock received only parasiticidal treatment. While results suggest that the preventable fraction of mortality attributable to Newcastle disease is comparatively small relatively to all-cause mortality in smallholder households, there was a significant benefit to vaccination in terms of flock size. Comparison with previous flock sizes in the study households indicate a more significant benefit from the combined vaccination and parasiticidal treatment, supporting a comprehensive approach to improving flock health and improving household benefits of production in the smallholder setting."

Provider training programs have been implemented in many low-resource settings to improve obstetric and neonatal outcomes. This longitudinal investigation assessed diagnoses and management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, birth asphyxia (BA), and low birth weight (LBW), as part of the CARE’s AMANAT program in 22 District Hospitals in Bihar, between 2015 and 2017. Physicians and nurse mentors conducted clinical instruction, simulations and teamwork and communication activities, infrastructure and management support, and data collection for 6 consecutive months. Analysis of diagnosis included 11,259 non-referred and management included 11,800 total (non-referred and referred) admissions that were observed. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test for trend. PPH was diagnosed in 3.7% with no significant trend but diagnosis of hypertensive disorders increased from 1.0% to 1.7%, (p trend = 0.04), over the 6 months. BA was diagnosed in 5.8% with no significant trend but LBW diagnoses increased from 11% to 16% (p trend &lt;0.01). Among PPH patients, 96% received fluids, 85% received uterotonics and 11% received Tranexamic Acid (TXA). There was a significant positive trend in the number of patients receiving TXA for PPH (6% to 13.8%, p trend = 0.03). Of all neonates with BA, there were statistically significant increases in the proportion who were initially warmed, dried, and stimulated (78% to 94%, p trend = 0.02), received airway suction (80% to 93%, p trend = 0.03), and supplemental oxygen without positive pressure ventilation (73% to 86%, p trend = 0.05). Diagnoses of hypertensive disorders and LBW as well as initial management of BA increased during the AMANAT program. However, underdiagnoses of PPH and hypertensive disorders relative to population levels remain critical barriers to improving maternal morbidity and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3136329380,"Background Perinatal brain injury results in neurodevelopmental disabilities (neuroDDs) that include cerebral palsy, autism, attention deficit disorder, epilepsy, learning disabilities and others. Commonly, injury occurs when placental circulation, that is responsible for transporting nutrients and oxygen to the fetus, is compromised. Placental insufficiency (PI) is a reduced supply of blood and oxygen to the fetus and results in a hypoxic-ischemic (HI) environment. A significant HI state in-utero leads to perinatal compromise, characterized by fetal growth restriction and brain injury. Given that over 80% of perinatal brain injuries that result in neuroDDs occur during gestation, prior to birth, preventive approaches are needed to reduce or eliminate the potential for injury and subsequent neuroDDs. Sulforaphane (SFA) derived from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli sprouts (BrSps) is a phase-II enzyme inducer that acts via cytoplasmic Nrf2 to enhance the production of anti-oxidants in the brain through the glutathione pathway. We have previously shown a profound in vivo neuro-protective effect of BrSps/SFA as a dietary supplement in pregnant rat models of both PI and fetal inflammation. Strong evidence also points to a role for SFA as treatment for various cancers. Paradoxically, then SFA has the ability to enhance cell survival, and with conditions of cancer, enhance cell death. Given our findings of the benefit of SFA/Broccoli Sprouts as a dietary supplement during pregnancy, with improvement to the fetus, it is important to determine the beneficial and toxic dosing range of SFA. We therefore explored, in vitro , the dosing range of SFA for neuronal and glial protection and toxicity in normal and oxygen/glucose deprived (OGD) cell cultures. Methods OGD simulates, in vitro , the condition experienced by the fetal brain due to PI. We developed a cell culture model of primary cortical neuronal, astrocyte and combined brain cell co-cultures from newborn rodent brains. The cultures were exposed to an OGD environment for various durations of time to determine the LD50 (duration of OGD required for 50% cell death). Using the LD50 as the time point, we evaluated the efficacy of varying doses of SFA for neuroprotective and neurotoxicity effects. Control cultures were exposed to normal media without OGD, and cytotoxicity of varying doses of SFA was also evaluated. Immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot analysis of cell specific markers were used for culture characterization, and quantification of LD50. Efficacy and toxicity effect of SFA was assessed by IF/high content microscopy and by AlamarBlue viability assay, respectively. Results We determined the LD50 to be 2 hours for neurons, 8 hours for astrocytes, and 10 hours for co-cultures. The protective effect of SFA was noticeable at 2.5 μM and 5 μM for neurons, although it was not significant. There was a significant protective effect of SFA at 2.5 μM ( p&lt; 0.05) for astrocytes and co-cultures. Significant toxicity ranges were also confirmed in OGD cultures as ≥ 100 μM ( p&lt; 0.05) for astrocytes, ≥ 50 μM ( p&lt; 0.01) for co-cultures, but not toxic in neurons; and toxic in control cultures as ≥ 100 μM ( p&lt; 0.01) for neurons, and ≥ 50 μM ( p&lt; 0.01) for astrocytes and co-cultures. One Way ANOVA and Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison Test were used for statistical analysis. Conclusions Our results indicate that cell death shows a trend to reduction in neuronal and astrocyte cultures, and is significantly reduced in co-cultures treated with low doses of SFA exposed to OGD. Doses of SFA that were 10 times higher were toxic, not only under conditions of OGD, but in normal control cultures as well. The findings suggest that: 1. SFA shows promise as a preventative agent for fetal ischemic brain injury, and 2. Because the fetus is a rapidly growing organism with profound cell multiplication, dosing parameters must be established to insure safety within efficacious ranges. This study will influence the development of innovative therapies for the prevention of childhood neuroDD."
https://openalex.org/W3137986296,"The first step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis in all eukaryotes is the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI) which is catalysed by a UDP-GlcNAc: PI α1–6 GlcNAc-transferase, also known as GPI GnT. This enzyme has been shown to be a complex of seven subunits in mammalian cells and a similar complex of six homologous subunits has been postulated in yeast. Homologs of these mammalian and yeast subunits were identified in the Trypanosoma brucei predicted protein database. The putative catalytic subunit of the T . brucei complex, TbGPI3, was epitope tagged with three consecutive c-Myc sequences at its C-terminus. Immunoprecipitation of TbGPI3-3Myc followed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and anti-Myc Western blot showed that it is present in a ~240 kDa complex. Label-free quantitative proteomics were performed to compare anti-Myc pull-downs from lysates of TbGPI-3Myc expressing and wild type cell lines. TbGPI3-3Myc was the most highly enriched protein in the TbGPI3-3Myc lysate pull-down and the expected partner proteins TbGPI15, TbGPI19, TbGPI2, TbGPI1 and TbERI1 were also identified with significant enrichment. Our proteomics data also suggest that an Arv1-like protein (TbArv1) is a subunit of the T . brucei complex. Yeast and mammalian Arv1 have been previously implicated in GPI biosynthesis, but here we present the first experimental evidence for physical association of Arv1 with GPI biosynthetic machinery.

https://openalex.org/W3137851061,"Scientific knowledge cannot be seen as a set of isolated fields, but as a highly connected network. Understanding how research areas are connected is of paramount importance for adequately allocating funding and human resources (e.g., assembling teams to tackle multidisciplinary problems). The relationship between disciplines can be drawn from data on the trajectory of individual scientists, as researchers often make contributions in a small set of interrelated areas. Two recent works propose methods for creating research maps from scientists' publication records: by using a frequentist approach to create a transition probability matrix; and by learning embeddings (vector representations). Surprisingly, these models were evaluated on different datasets and have never been compared in the literature. In this work, we compare both models in a systematic way, using a large dataset of publication records from Brazilian researchers. We evaluate these models' ability to predict whether a given entity (scientist, institution or region) will enter a new field w.r.t. the area under the ROC curve. Moreover, we analyze how sensitive each method is to the number of publications and the number of fields associated to one entity. Last, we conduct a case study to showcase how these models can be used to characterize science dynamics in the context of Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W3138356459,"The human FBN1 gene encodes fibrillin-1 (FBN1); the main component of the 10–12 nm diameter extracellular matrix microfibrils. Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a common inherited connective tissue disorder, caused by FBN1 mutations. It features a wide spectrum of disease severity, from mild cases to the lethal neonatal form (nMFS), that is yet to be explained at the molecular level. Mutations associated with nMFS generally affect a region of FBN1 between domains TB3-cbEGF18—the ""neonatal region"". To gain insight into the process of fibril assembly and increase our understanding of the mechanisms determining disease severity in MFS, we compared the secretion and assembly properties of FBN1 variants containing nMFS-associated substitutions with variants associated with milder, classical MFS (cMFS). In the majority of cases, both nMFS- and cMFS-associated neonatal region variants were secreted at levels comparable to wild type. Microfibril incorporation by the nMFS variants was greatly reduced or absent compared to the cMFS forms, however, suggesting that nMFS substitutions disrupt a previously undefined site of microfibril assembly. Additional analysis of a domain deletion variant caused by exon skipping also indicates that register in the neonatal region is likely to be critical for assembly. These data demonstrate for the first time new requirements for microfibril biogenesis and identify at least two distinct molecular mechanisms associated with disease substitutions in the TB3-cbEGF18 region; incorporation of mutant FBN1 into microfibrils changing their integral properties (cMFS) or the blocking of wild type FBN1 assembly by mutant molecules that prevents late-stage lateral assembly (nMFS)."
https://openalex.org/W3113876529,"Background In British Columbia (BC), Canada, clinicians are responsible for giving involuntary psychiatric patients rights information upon admission. Yet an investigation by the BC Office of the Ombudsperson found that clinicians are not always fulfilling this responsibility. The Ombudsperson recommended that the provincial government fund an independent body to give rights advice to patients. Methods To understand how clinicians feel about this recommendation, focus groups of clinicians who may give psychiatric patients rights information ( n = 81) were conducted in Vancouver, BC, to probe their attitudes toward independent rights advisors. The focus group transcripts were thematically analyzed. Results Most clinicians believe that giving rights information is within their scope of practice, although some acknowledge that it poses a conflict of interest when the patient wishes to challenge the treatment team’s decisions. Participants’ chief concerns about an independent rights-advice service were that (a) patients may experience a delay in receiving their rights information, (b) integrating rights advisors into the workflow would complicate an already chaotic admission process, and (c) more patients would be counselled to challenge their hospitalization, leading to an increased administrative workload for clinical staff. However, many participants believed that independent rights advisors would be a positive addition to the admission process, both allowing clinicians to focus on treatment and serving as a source of rights-related information. Conclusions Participants were generally amenable to an independent rights-advice service, suggesting that the introduction of rights advisors need not result in an adversarial relationship between treatment team and patient, as opponents of the proposal fear. Clearly distinguishing between basic rights information and in-depth rights advice could address several of the clinicians’ concerns about the role that independent rights advisors would play in the involuntary admission process. Clinicians’ and other stakeholders’ concerns should be considered as the province develops its rights-advice service."
https://openalex.org/W3136036559,"Though we have a general understanding of the brain areas involved in motor sequence learning, there is more to discover about the neural mechanisms underlying skill acquisition. Skill acquisition may be subserved, in part, by interactions between the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex through a cerebello-thalamo-prefrontal network. In prior work, we investigated this network by targeting the cerebellum; here, we explored the consequence of stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) before administering an explicit motor sequence learning paradigm. Using a mixed within- and between- subjects design, we employed anodal (n = 24) and cathodal (n = 25) HD-tDCS (relative to sham) to temporarily alter brain function and examine effects on skill acquisition. The results indicate that both anodal and cathodal prefrontal stimulation impedes motor sequence learning, relative to sham. These findings suggest an overall negative influence of active prefrontal stimulation on the acquisition of a sequential pattern of finger movements. Collectively, this provides novel insight on the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in initial skill acquisition, when cognitive processes such as working memory are used. Exploring methods that may improve motor learning is important in developing therapeutic strategies for motor-related diseases and rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W3137127267,"Purpose Determine the cost-effectiveness of three financial incentive structures in obtaining a 1% within group drop in HbA1c among adults with diabetes. Methods 60 African Americans with type 2 diabetes were randomized to one of three financial incentive structures and followed for 3-months. Group 1 (low frequency) received a single incentive for absolute HbA1c reduction, Group 2 (moderate frequency) received a two-part incentive for home testing of glucose and absolute HbA1c reduction and Group 3 (high frequency) received a multiple component incentive for home testing, attendance of weekly telephone education classes and absolute HbA1c reduction. The primary clinical outcome was HbA1c reduction within each arm at 3-months. Cost for each arm was calculated based on the cost of the intervention, cost of health care visits during the 3-month time frame, and cost of workdays missed from illness. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated based on achieving a 1% within group drop in HbA1c and were bootstrapped with 1,000 replications. Results The ICER to decrease HbA1c by 1% was $1,100 for all three arms, however, bootstrapped standard errors differed with Group 1 having twice the variation around the ICER coefficient as Groups 2 and 3. ICERs were statistically significant for Groups 2 and 3 (p&lt;0.001) indicating they are cost effective interventions. Conclusions Given ICERs of prior diabetes interventions range from $1,000-$4,000, a cost of $1,100 per 1% within group decrease in HbA1c is a promising intervention. Multi-component incentive structures seem to have the least variation in cost-effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3138294390,"Rattus tanezumi is a common domestic rat and host of the bubonic plague pathogen in China and Southeast Asia (SEA). The origin, genetic differentiation and dispersal of R . tanezumi have received increasing attention from researchers. The population genetics of R . tanezumi based on its mitochondrial cytochrome b gene have been studied to explain the origin, relationships and dispersal of populations. In this study, we captured a total of 229 rats; morphological and molecular biological identification cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) confirmed 131 R . tanezumi individuals collected from 6 provincial areas, and their Cytb gene sequences were analyzed. The results showed that the population in Mohan (MH), Yunnan, had the highest genetic diversity, while that in Ningde (ND), Fujian, had the lowest. Tajima’s D statistic for all populations was negative and nonsignificant, indicating the possible expansion of R . tanezumi populations. Low gene flow occurred between the Zhangmu (ZM) R . tanezumi population and other populations, and the genetic differentiation among them was high. Furthermore, our analyses revealed the ZM lineage was the oldest lineage among the groups and diverged ~1.06 Mya, followed by the Luoyang (LY) lineages (~0.51 Mya) and Yunnan lineage (~0.33 Mya). In southeastern Yunnan, the Jinshuihe (JSH) and MH populations were more closely related to the populations in southeastern China (Fuzhou (FZ), ND, Quanzhou (QZ), Nanchang (NC)) and inland areas (Chongqing (CQ), LY) than to those in other areas of Yunnan (Jiegao (JG) and Qingshuihe (QSH)), indicating that R . tanezumi may have spread from southeastern Yunnan to the interior of China. In summary, R . tanezumi may have originated in ZM and adjacent areas, spread to Yunnan, and then spread from the southeast of Yunnan inland or directly eastward from ZM to inland China."
https://openalex.org/W3138445044,"The deconvolution process is a key step for quantitative evaluation of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) samples. By this process, the fluorescence impulse responses (FluoIRs) of the sample are decoupled from the instrument response (InstR). In blind deconvolution estimation (BDE), the FluoIRs and InstR are jointly extracted from a dataset with minimal a priori information. In this work, two BDE algorithms are introduced based on linear combinations of multi-exponential functions to model each FluoIR in the sample. For both schemes, the InstR is assumed with a free-form and a sparse structure. The local perspective of the BDE methodology assumes that the characteristic parameters of the exponential functions (time constants and scaling coefficients) are estimated based on a single spatial point of the dataset. On the other hand, the same exponential functions are used in the whole dataset in the global perspective, and just the scaling coefficients are updated for each spatial point. A least squares formulation is considered for both BDE algorithms. To overcome the nonlinear interaction in the decision variables, an alternating least squares (ALS) methodology iteratively solves both estimation problems based on non-negative and constrained optimizations. The validation stage considered first synthetic datasets at different noise types and levels, and a comparison with the standard deconvolution techniques with a multi-exponential model for FLIM measurements, as well as, with two BDE methodologies in the state of the art: Laguerre basis, and exponentials library. For the experimental evaluation, fluorescent dyes and oral tissue samples were considered. Our results show that local and global perspectives are consistent with the standard deconvolution techniques, and they reached the fastest convergence responses among the BDE algorithms with the best compromise in FluoIRs and InstR estimation errors."
https://openalex.org/W3138731475,"Background Migrant populations usually report higher smoking rates. Among those migrant populations, Turkish- and Kurdish-speaking migrants are often overrepresented. Providing equal access to health services is one of the major challenges of our time. The need for adapted smoking-cessation treatments for Turkish-speaking populations to achieve equity in health led, in 2006, to the development and implementation of the Tiryaki-Kukla smoking-cessation program. The aims of the current study were to evaluate one-year quit rates for smoking-cessation courses held from 2006–2018 and investigate whether certain characteristics predict long-term smoking cessation or reduction. Methods Program evaluation included a pre/post questionnaire (session 1/ 3 months after the quit day) and a follow-up telephone call twelve months after the quit day. To elucidate factors associated with long-term smoking cessation and reduction, Cox regression analysis and Weighted Generalized Equation Models were used. Results Of the 478 who participated in smoking-cessation courses, 45.4% declared themselves non-smokers at one-year follow-up. This quit rate is higher than that achieved during the preliminary evaluation of the program involving 61 participants (37.7%). Predictors of long-term smoking cessation were course length (eight vs. six sessions) (95% CI = 1.04–1.36, p = .01), adherence to the course (95% CI = 0.98–0.99, p &lt;0.01), use of pharmacotherapy or nicotine replacement therapy products (95% CI = 0.74–0.98, p = .02), and time passed in the morning until the first cigarette is smoked (95% CI 5min = 1.17–1.77, p &lt;0.001; 95% CI 30min = 1.09–1.65, p &lt;0.01). Predictors of change in cigarettes smoked per day among smokers were—the time passed until the first cigarette in the morning (5min p &lt; .001; 30min p &lt; .001; 60min p &lt; .01)-, gender ( p &lt; .001), and level of motivation to quit at baseline ( p = .04). Conclusions Our findings are consistent with existing evidence supporting adapted smoking cessation interventions to reduce health inequity in migrant populations. However, achieving harm reduction in smokers with higher dependence scores remains challenging."
https://openalex.org/W3139120626,"Taxi order demand prediction is of tremendous importance for continuous upgrading of an intelligent transportation system to realise city-scale and personalised services. An accurate short-term taxi demand prediction model in both spatial and temporal relations can assist a city pre-allocate its resources and facilitate city-scale taxi operation management in a megacity. To address problems similar to the above, in this study, we proposed a multi-zone order demand prediction model to predict short-term taxi order demand in different zones at city-scale. A two-step methodology was developed, including order zone division and multi-zone order prediction. For the zone division step, the K-means++ spatial clustering algorithm was used, and its parameter k was estimated by the between–within proportion index. For the prediction step, six methods (backpropagation neural network, support vector regression, random forest, average fusion-based method, weighted fusion-based method, and k-nearest neighbour fusion-based method) were used for comparison. To demonstrate the performance, three multi-zone weighted accuracy indictors were proposed to evaluate the order prediction ability at city-scale. These models were implemented and validated on real-world taxi order demand data from a three-month consecutive collection in Shenzhen, China. Experiment on the city-scale taxi demand data demonstrated the superior prediction performance of the multi-zone order demand prediction model with the k-nearest neighbour fusion-based method based on the proposed accuracy indicator."
https://openalex.org/W3139467672,"Introduction In 2016, under its new National Adherence Guidelines (AGL), South Africa formalized an existing model of fast-track HIV treatment initiation counselling (FTIC). Rollout of the AGL included an evaluation study at 24 clinics, with staggered AGL implementation. Using routinely collected data extracted as part of the evaluation study, we estimated and compared the costs of HIV care and treatment from the provider’s perspective at the 12 clinics implementing the new, formalized model (AGL-FTIC) to costs at the 12 clinics continuing to implement some earlier, less formalized, model that likely varied across clinics (denoted here as early-FTIC). Methods This was a cost-outcome analysis using standard methods and a composite outcome defined as initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 30 days of treatment eligibility and retained in care at 9 months. Using patient-level, bottom-up resource-utilization data and local unit costs, we estimated patient-level costs of care and treatment in 2017 U.S. dollars over the 9-month evaluation follow-up period for the two models of care. Resource use and costs, disaggregated by antiretroviral medications, laboratory tests, and clinic visits, are reported by model of care and stratified by the composite outcome. Results A total of 350/343 patients in the early-FTIC/AGL-FTIC models of care are included in this analysis. Mean/median costs were similar for both models of care ($135/$153 for early-FTIC, $130/$151 for AGL-FTIC). For the subset achieving the composite outcome, resource use and therefore mean/median costs were similar but slightly higher, reflecting care consistent with treatment guidelines ($163/$166 for early-FTIC, $168/$170 for AGL-FTIC). Not surprisingly, costs for patients not achieving the composite outcome were substantially less, mainly because they only had two or fewer follow-up visits and, therefore, received substantially less ART than patients who achieved the composite outcome. Conclusion The 2016 adherence guidelines clarified expectations for the content and timing of adherence counseling sessions in relation to ART initiation. Because clinics were already initiating patients on ART quickly by 2016, little room existed for the new model of fast-track initiation counseling to reduce the number of pre-ART clinic visits at the study sites and therefore to reduce costs of care and treatment.

https://openalex.org/W3136603067,"The Dendrocephalus brasiliensis , a native species from South America, is a freshwater crustacean well explored in conservational and productive activities. Its main characteristics are its rusticity and resistance cysts production, in which the hatching requires a period of dehydration. Independent of the species utilization nature, it is essential to manipulate its cysts, such as the counting using microscopes. Manually counting is a difficult task, prone to errors, and that also very time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automatized approach for the detection and counting of Dendrocephalus brasiliensis cysts from images captured by a digital microscope. For this purpose, we built the DBrasiliensis dataset, a repository with 246 images containing 5141 cysts of Dendrocephalus brasiliensis . Then, we trained two state-of-the-art object detection methods, YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks), on DBrasiliensis dataset in order to compare them under both cyst detection and counting tasks. Experiments showed evidence that YOLOv3 is superior to Faster R-CNN, achieving an accuracy rate of 83,74%, R 2 of 0.88, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 3.49, and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 2.24 on cyst detection and counting. Moreover, we showed that is possible to infer the number of cysts of a substrate, with known weight, by performing the automated counting of some of its samples. In conclusion, the proposed approach using YOLOv3 is adequate to detect and count Dendrocephalus brasiliensis cysts. The DBrasiliensis dataset can be accessed at: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13073240 ."
https://openalex.org/W3137618241,"In Ethiopia, stunting is a common public health problem among school-age children. Even though several studies were conducted in different parts of the country, the national pooled prevalence of stunting and its determinants not estimated. Therefore, this study intends to determine the pooled prevalence and determinants of stunting among school-age children in Ethiopia.This review protocol is registered at PROSPERO with Registration number: CRD42020160625. Online databases (Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Science direct), Google, Google Scholar, and other grey literature will be used to search articles until June 2020. The quality assessment will be performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. The analysis will be organized and presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. The presence of heterogeneity among studies will be examined using a chi-squared test on Cochran's Q statistic with a 5% level of statistical significance, subgroup analyses, and meta-regression will be performed to investigate sources of heterogeneity. To identify influential studies, sensitivity analysis will be conducted. Presence publication bias will be examined by observing funnel plots. The presence of a statistical association will be declared at a p-value <0.05 with the 95% CI.Stunting is a major public health problem in Ethiopia, which affects the health of children. So, designing and implementing different nutritional strategies and promoting healthcare services is extremely mandatory to overcome stunting problems in the country. To understand this, estimating the prevalence of stunting at the national level and determining the pertinent common determinants using high-level evidence is fairly imperative. Therefore, this study will offer a summarizing finding."
https://openalex.org/W3138134866,"Objectives To determine the optimal utility of the open mouth maneuver and Metal Artifact Reduction for the Orthopedic Implants (O-MAR) technique for CT of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Methods Between July 2017 and May 2019, 59 subjects who underwent both conventional and open mouth head and neck CT scans were included in this retrospective study. All images were reconstructed using the O-MAR algorithm. With conventional CT with/without the O-MAR (CTc_O/CTc) and open mouth CT with/without O-MAR (CTo_O/CTo), one reader measured the noise level in multiple anatomic regions of the oral cavity and oropharynx. Visual scores for the streak artifact and overall subjective image quality were assessed by two independent readers. Results For the mobile tongue, retromolar trigone, and palatine tonsil, the mean noise was significantly lower, and the mean visual scores were significantly higher, with CTo than with CTc or CTc_O (all, P &lt; 0.001). The mean visual scores were higher with CTo_O than with CTo for the mobile tongue and palatine tonsil (all, P &lt; 0.001). Contrarily, for the mouth floor and tongue base, the mean noise was significantly higher with CTo_O than with CTc or CTc_O, and the mean visual scores were significantly higher with CTc than with CTo or CTo_O (all, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions The open mouth maneuver and O-MAR technique can have different influences on the CT image quality according to the anatomical subsites of the oral cavity and oropharynx."
