Although, quantitatively, branched chain fatty acids are not important lipid constituents, ~.~g.~a~e-~el~-rttecte~i~--v~~~in~n~~nn~s-in--~-wid~-vasiety. of natural products. Methymycin (3), neomethymycin (4), oleandomycin (5), pikromycin (6, 7), and other antibiotics of the macrolide group contain aglycons which are partially branched lactones similar to erythronolide. Mycolipenic and mycoceranic acids, present in large amounts in the lipids of tubercule bacilli (8, 9), are partially branched fatty acids again with the same type of repeating 3 carbon subunit. Other substances which may be considered to have at least one 3 carbon subunit are odd numbered straight chain fatty acids and a wide variety of fatty acids and other substances found to have one or more C-methyl group (cf. 10). Robinson has proposed that 3 carbon subunits like those in mycolipenic and mycoceranic acids could arise from propionate or its “biological equivalent” (11). Evidence exists which indicates that this concept may be true for some of the simpler fatty acids which contain 3 carbon units. For instance, n-valeric acid formed in the sheep rumen (12) or by Clostridium kluyveti (13) seems to be derived from propionate and acetate as does the @hydroxyvaleric acid produced by mouse liver slices (14). The perfused cow udder also incorporates propionate-l-Cl* extensively into the odd numbered and branched fatty acids of the milk fats (15). Of more relevance to the 3 carbon units in erythronolide is the recent observation that a-methylbutyric acid, formed by isolated muscle of Ascwis lumbricoides, is made from acetate and propionate with the branch methyl group arising from C-3 of the propionate and the carboxyl group coming from C-l (16)."

https://openalex.org/W2065452826,"ETHIDIUM bromide (3,8-diamino-5-ethyl-6-phenyl-phenanthridinium bromide) has been used to treat trypanosome infections of cattle in Africa for some time1,2. (This chemical was kindly supplied by Dr. M. R. Gurd, Boots Pure Drug Co., Ltd., Nottingham. Its alternative name is 2,7-diamino-9-phenyl-10-ethyl-phenanthridinium bromide.) Recently we have examined the biochemical effects of this compound on Ehrlich ascites tumour cells, and have found that it inhibits completely the incorporation of preformed purines (adenine, guanine and hypoxanthine) into nucleic acids3. The possible application of this biochemical effect to cancer chemotherapy was immediately considered. It was believed, however, that ethidium bromide, if used alone, would at best be only moderately carcinostatic because it does not appreciably impair the de novo pathway of purine biosynthesis3. Because the antibiotic azaserine is well known to inhibit completely the de novo synthesis of purines, it was therefore believed that if these two compounds could be used in combination without undue host toxicity, the conditions for a complete concurrent blockade4 of the purine nucleotide supply for nucleic acid synthesis could be effected. Because both drugs maintain their inhibitory effects for less than 24 hr.3,5, for more nearly maximal effect it was felt that both should be administered more often than in the daily treatment schedule usually used in tests of carcinostatic efficacy."

Despite an extensive search among other types of anæmia only very slight increases have been found, with the exception of quite large amounts present in acute leukæmia in children1 and in adolescents2."

https://openalex.org/W2067726259,"IN previous work1 we have shown that liver slices suspended in a medium free of sodium ions show a depressed turn-over of phosphoprotein phosphorus. This effect is reversed by addition of sodium. In these and the experiments shown here, the phosphoproteins have been identified by isolation of radioactive pbosphorylserine from acid hydrolysates of the crude proteins. We have found that the phosphoproteins sensitive to Na+ are non-mitochondrial1, the mitochondrial phosphoproteins appearing to have different properties2."
https://openalex.org/W2061842822,"QUANTITATIVE studies of the inhibition of histidine decarboxylase in vivo are now feasible with the introduction of two methods of assessing the rate of endogenous histamine formation in the rat. One method, devised by Schayer, measures the amount of 14C-histamine excreted in the urine following the injection of a known amount of 14C-histidine. The other method depends on the demonstration that in the female rat the urinary excretion of free histamine parallels the endogenous formation of the amine1,2. Using both these methods, it was found that omitting pyridoxine from the diet for a week causes a reduction in histamine formation to about half normal, and that the rate of formation can be reduced further by superimposing injections of semicarbazide on the pyridoxine-deficient diet3."

https://openalex.org/W2018059383,A technique utilizing iodine-131 was developed to study the movements of Microtus pennsylvanicus in the field. Iodine-131 ((1/2) mc) was placed in a polyethylene capsule and inserted beneath the animal's skin. Movements of the animal were then followed for periods of up to 2 weeks by means of a Geiger-Müller counter attached to an aluminum pole.
