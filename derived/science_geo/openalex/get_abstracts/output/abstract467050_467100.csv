https://openalex.org/W2115807273,"Schizophrenia is an idiopathic mental disorder with a heritable component and a substantial public health impact. We conducted a multi-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) for schizophrenia beginning with a Swedish national sample (5,001 cases and 6,243 controls) followed by meta-analysis with previous schizophrenia GWAS (8,832 cases and 12,067 controls) and finally by replication of SNPs in 168 genomic regions in independent samples (7,413 cases, 19,762 controls and 581 parent-offspring trios). We identified 22 loci associated at genome-wide significance; 13 of these are new, and 1 was previously implicated in bipolar disorder. Examination of candidate genes at these loci suggests the involvement of neuronal calcium signaling. We estimate that 8,300 independent, mostly common SNPs (95% credible interval of 6,300-10,200 SNPs) contribute to risk for schizophrenia and that these collectively account for at least 32% of the variance in liability. Common genetic variation has an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia, and larger studies will allow more detailed understanding of this disorder."

In rural communities that rely on groundwater for drinking water, the risk from exposure may pose a public health threat, especially when groundwater pumping can increase arsenic solubility. In an effort to provide a focused assessment of risk to arsenic exposure from groundwater, Rodríguez-Lado et al. (p. 866 ; see the Perspective by Michael ) constructed a geostatistical model that incorporates a number of factors that control arsenic solubility across China. Most of the risk centers in a few provinces—Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu—but the total population exposed to arsenic levels above 10 micrograms per liter could be upwards of 19 million people."

Next-generation optical atomic clocks can extend the capability of these timekeepers, where researchers have long aspired toward measurement precision at 1 part in $\bm{10^{18}}$. This milestone will enable a second revolution of new timing applications such as relativistic geodesy, enhanced Earth- and space-based navigation and telescopy, and new tests on physics beyond the Standard Model.

Several resting-state functional connectivity MRI reports have implicated regions of the default mode system as brain hubs; we demonstrate that previous degree-based approaches to hub identification may have identified portions of large brain systems rather than critical nodes of brain networks. We utilize two methods to identify hub-like brain regions: (1) finding network nodes that participate in multiple subnetworks of the brain, and (2) finding spatial locations in which several systems are represented within a small volume. These methods converge on a distributed set of regions that differ from previous reports on hubs.

Hubs are intuitively important features of networks: high-volume airports are more important than smaller airfields in facilitating air travel, and people with many acquaintances are more powerful distributors of information than people with few acquaintances. Hubs, in an intuitive sense, are nodes with special importance in a network by virtue of their many, often diverse, connections. The quantitative importance of hubs has been demonstrated in a series of graph theoretic studies (Albert et al., 1999Albert R. Jeong H. Barabasi A.-L.

Graphs are mathematical models of complex systems (e.g., air traffic) in which the items in a system become a set of nodes (e.g., airports) and the relationships in the system become a set of edges (e.g., flights). Hubs are defined as nodes with many edges or with edges that place them in central positions for facilitating traffic over a network. The number of edges on a node is called the node’s degree, and degree is the simplest and most commonly used means of identifying hubs in graphs. Over the past decade it has become clear that many real-world networks contain nodes that vary by many orders of magnitude in their degree such that a handful of nodes have very powerful roles in networks (e.g., Google in the World Wide Web) (Albert et al., 1999Albert R.

The loss of such well-connected hubs can be particularly devastating to network function (Albert et al., 2000Albert R. Jeong H. Barabasi A.L.

Given the role of hubs and their importance to networks, the locations and functions of hubs in the brain are of clear interest to neuroscientists. Over the past 15 years, advances in MRI techniques have enabled comprehensive estimates of structural and functional connectivity in the living human brain, leading to the first estimates of hub locations in human brain networks. In an influential study, Buckner and colleagues (Buckner et al., 2009Buckner R.L. Sepulcre J. Talukdar T. Krienen F.M. Liu H. Hedden T. Andrews-Hanna J.R. Sperling R.A. Johnson K.A. Cortical hubs revealed by intrinsic functional connectivity: mapping, assessment of stability, and relation to Alzheimer’s disease.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 1860-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar) examined voxelwise resting-state functional connectivity MRI (RSFC) networks, identifying hubs (high-degree nodes) in portions of the default mode system, as well as some regions of the anterior cingulate, anterior insula, and frontal and parietal cortex. Other investigations targeting “globally connected” regions in RSFC data have converged on similar sets of regions (Cole et al., 2010Cole M.W. Pathak S. Schneider W. Identifying the brain’s most globally connected regions.Neuroimage. 2010; 49: 3132-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, Tomasi and Volkow, 2011Tomasi D. Volkow N.D. Functional connectivity hubs in the human brain.Neuroimage. 2011; 57: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These “hubs” have garnered much interest because they are principally located in the default mode system, a collection of brain regions that are implicated in various “high-level” cognitive processes and that often degenerate in Alzheimer disease, thereby seeming to fit ideas about information integration and vulnerability to attack. In this article we outline reasons to suspect that degree-based hubs reported in functional connectivity networks may not be hubs in the interesting and intuitive sense outlined at the beginning of this article, but rather that they might simply be members of the largest subnetwork(s) (systems) of the brain. We follow two separate lines of argumentation to this conclusion. The first argument demonstrates that in networks formed using Pearson correlations (RSFC graphs are commonly formed using Pearson correlations between BOLD time series, and unless otherwise specified, “correlation” signifies Pearson correlation in this paper), node degree is substantially explained by subnetwork size. The second argument is concerned with amplifications of the first argument that can occur when systems are not modeled at their inherent levels of organization, such as when brains (cortically organized at levels of columns, areas, and systems [Churchland and Sejnowski, 1988Churchland P.S. Sejnowski T.J. Perspectives on cognitive neuroscience.Science. 1988; 242: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J. Van Essen D.C. Distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1991; 1: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (5457) Google Scholar]) are modeled as voxels (an arbitrary volumetric element). Since some classic methods of hub identification are confounded in correlation networks, we develop two alternative methods for identifying hubs that are more suited to RSFC correlation networks. Both methods aim to identify regions of the brain that are well-situated to support and/or integrate multiple types of information. Both methods leverage the correspondence between functional brain systems (e.g., dorsal attention system) and graph subnetworks observed in recently described RSFC graphs (Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A. Church J.A. Vogel A.C. Laumann T.O. Miezin F.M. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E.

Polimeni J.R. et al.The organization of the human cerebral cortex estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 1125-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (4162) Google Scholar). First, using a model of the brain at the level of functional areas, we identify nodes that participate in many subnetworks of the brain (e.g., a node that has relationships with members of multiple brain systems, such as visual, default mode, or frontoparietal control systems). These nodes are candidate brain hubs. We identify these candidate hubs using the established measure of participation coefficients (Guimerà and Nunes Amaral, 2005Guimerà R. Nunes Amaral L.A. Functional cartography of complex metabolic networks.Nature. 2005; 433: 895-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (2552) Google Scholar). Second, we examine a high-resolution brain network to identify spatial locations where many subnetworks are present within a small volume (e.g., finding, within a small sphere, voxels representing the dorsal attention, visual, frontoparietal control, and default mode systems). We call these locations articulation points—they are not hubs in the traditional graph theoretic sense, but they are locations where such hubs might be situated. Both methods identify similar sets of brain regions in the anterior insula, anterior, middle and superior frontal cortex, medial superior frontal cortex, medial parietal cortex, inferior parietal, and temporo-occipital cortex. Notably, these regions do not emphasize the default mode system. Several influential reports have identified brain hubs in RSFC networks using (variations of) a measure called degree (or degree centrality), which is the number of edges on a node (Buckner et al., 2009Buckner R.L. Sepulcre J. Talukdar T. Krienen F.M. Liu H. Hedden T. Andrews-Hanna J.R. Sperling R.A. Johnson K.A.

Small-world and scale-free organization of voxel-based resting-state functional connectivity in the human brain.Neuroimage. 2008; 43: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Hubs, when identified by high degree, are nodes with many edges. In weighted networks, the analogous measure, strength, is defined as the sum of the weights of the edges on a node. Degree (or strength) is usually an appropriate measure for identifying hubs (e.g., an airport with 200 connections is almost certainly more important than an airport with 20 connections). In the computer network shown in Figure 1A, degree is an accurate means of identifying hubs. In correlation networks, however, degree is a problematic means of identifying hubs. We argue this point using conceptual networks and real RSFC data. Two comments preface the data. First, the conceptual correlation networks in Figure 1 are presented to illustrate how the meaning of degree can change in various situations; they are not intended to be full-fledged models of RSFC signal. Second, our argument is intended to apply to networks formed using Pearson correlations; our argument may be less relevant to other types of correlation networks. We return to this topic in the Discussion. Our argument is first demonstrated using networks of perfect correlations and then relaxed into a form that is more relevant to the imperfect correlations found in RSFC networks. Suppose there is a system composed of groups of nodes with perfectly covarying timecourses. An example is shown in Figure 1B, where a system of songbirds segregates into three flocks, each singing a different song. In this example, each flock sings a song with no similarity to the song of the other flock. Such a system is called a “block model” (see the matrix), and nodes within the blocks (here, flocks) are structurally equivalent, meaning they have identical sets of connections and are therefore interchangeable (Newman, 2010Newman M. Networks: An Introduction. Oxford University Press, New York2010Crossref Scopus (8173) Google Scholar). All nodes within a block have identical degree, and this degree is directly related to the size of the block. Thus, degree will identify hubs in the largest blocks of the graph. If blocks correlate to any extent, then degree will depend not only on the size of a node’s block but also on the sizes of related blocks (Figure 1C). If one relaxes “perfectly correlated” to “more correlated than average,” blocks become groups of nodes called communities, and degree will tend to identify hubs in the largest communities of a correlation network (Figure 1D). Degree thus has different meanings in different types of network. In many graphs, such as the computers of Figure 1A, high degree means that an individual node has many connections and is probably important. In others, such as the block model in Figure 1B, high degree means nothing more than that a node is part of a large block. In networks like RSFC networks, which are noisy and in which nodes may display individual temporal dynamics (Chang and Glover, 2010Chang C. Glover G.H. Time-frequency dynamics of resting-state brain connectivity measured with fMRI.Neuroimage. 2010; 50: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar), degree is probably somewhat driven by unique properties of individual nodes as in Figure 1A, but also somewhat driven by community size as in Figure 1B. The meaning of degree is thus ambiguous in RSFC networks. This ambiguity has critical implications for studies that have identified hubs in RSFC on the basis of degree, since such hubs may be identified due to community size rather than important roles in information processing. To determine whether these theoretical concerns are evident in reality, two versions of RSFC graphs were formed using data from 120 healthy young adults (60F, 24.7 ± 2.4 years old). The graphs were formed using methods consistent with the previous literature, and the relationship between community size and node strength was quantified for both graphs. Figure 2A shows the correlation matrix that defines a graph formed of 264 putative areas (Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A. Church J.A. Vogel A.C. Laumann T.O. Miezin F.M. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E. Functional network organization of the human brain.Neuron. 2011; 72: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar), the communities found within this graph, the sizes of these communities, and node strength at multiple thresholds. Linear fits of strength to community size are plotted. There is an evident relation between community size and node strength. Similar analyses performed in a voxelwise network in the same data set are shown in Figure 2B. In the voxelwise network the relationship between community size and node strength is considerably stronger. Because there is no “correct” threshold at which to analyze a graph, these analyses were performed at many thresholds (those used in Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A. Church J.A. Vogel A.C. Laumann T.O. Miezin F.M. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E. Functional network organization of the human brain.Neuron. 2011; 72: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Across thresholds, community size explained 11% ± 4% of the variance in strength in the areal network and 34% ± 5% of the variance in strength in the voxelwise network. It is possible that strong relationships between strength and community size are actually typical of real-world networks. To investigate this possibility, 17 other real-world data sets (3 correlation, 14 noncorrelation) were analyzed in the manner just described (see the Experimental Procedures, Figure 3, and Figure S1, online, for sources and details of the networks). Strong relationships between strength and community size were observed in real-world correlation networks but were generally absent in real-world noncorrelation networks, consistent with the theoretical considerations outlined above. If the meaning of degree is confounded by community size in correlation networks, one might wonder whether important nodes could still be identified as nodes with high degree relative to other nodes within their community. Guimera and Amaral have proposed a widely used classification scheme to identify node roles based on such a framework (Guimerà and Nunes Amaral, 2005Guimerà R. Nunes Amaral L.A. Functional cartography of complex metabolic networks.Nature. 2005; 433: 895-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (2552) Google Scholar). Their approach uses two measures to characterize nodes: within-module degree Z score and participation coefficient (Figure 4A). Within-module degree Z score is the Z score of a node’s within-module degree; Z scores greater than 2.5 denote hub status. Participation coefficients measure the distribution of a node’s edges among the communities of a graph. If a node’s edges are entirely restricted to its community, its participation coefficient is 0. If the node’s edges are evenly distributed among all communities, the participation coefficient is a maximal value that approaches 1 (the maximal value depends on the number of communities present). Hubs with low participation coefficients are called “provincial” hubs because their edges are not distributed widely among communities, whereas hubs with higher participation coefficients are called “connector” hubs. The node role approach indicates that the RSFC networks of Figure 2, relative to other networks such as communication or metabolic networks, are structured in ways such that they contain a very small number of hubs, all of which are quite weak by graph theoretic standards (Figure 4). In the areal network, a single node at a single threshold meets criteria for being a hub. This node, in the precuneus, is a provincial hub with few strong correlations outside of its community (the default mode system). In the voxelwise network, 90–199 voxels are identified as hubs across thresholds, mainly as part of a large cluster in the precuneus. Like the single areal node, these voxels are also provincial hubs—part of the largest community in the network (the default mode system), with few strong correlations to nodes outside of their community. This provincial quality of RSFC hubs is similar to the pattern found in other real-world correlation networks (e.g., the S&P 500 network in Figure 4B) but stands in contrast to the patterning of hubs found in many real-world noncorrelation networks, where hubs display a wide range of participation coefficients (Figure 4B). These findings are echoed in Figure S1, in which node strength correlates negatively with participation coefficients in the three real-world correlation networks (such that nodes with many edges are often isolated from other communities) but positively in most real-world noncorrelation networks (such that nodes with many edges often contact many communities). The RSFC networks have intermediate findings: weakly negative correlations of node strength and participation coefficients, consistent with our conceptual arguments above. Importantly, though the node role approach does identify a small number of provincial hubs in RSFC networks, it still uses degree as the basis of hub identification and does not address the fundamental uncertainty about what degree signifies in correlation networks. The essential points from this section are that (1) degree is normally a good indicator of a node’s importance in a noncorrelation network, (2) degree has an unclear meaning in Pearson correlation networks due to the influence of community size, and (3) degree-based RSFC hubs may, to a substantial extent, reflect community size rather than a privileged role in information processing. Having established that RSFC correlation networks entail strong (confounding) relationships between community size and node degree, we now discuss a second problem that can amplify this relationship. Estimates of degree-based hubs in functional connectivity networks have often used voxel-based networks or approximations of them (Buckner et al., 2009Buckner R.L. Sepulcre J. Talukdar T.

Small-world and scale-free organization of voxel-based resting-state functional connectivity in the human brain.Neuroimage. 2008; 43: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). On the face of it, these approaches are sensible because they maximize the resolution of the analysis and minimize the possibility of conflating unique signals in a single node (Fornito et al., 2010Fornito A. Zalesky A. Bullmore E.T. Network scaling effects in graph analytic studies of human resting-state FMRI data.Front. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 22PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are reasons to believe that such approaches introduce inaccuracies into representations of brain properties. Our second argument concerns the distortions that accompany volume-based models of brain organization. Complex systems, composed of items and their interrelationhips, are modeled as nodes and edges in graphs. For the properties of a graph to accurately reflect properties of the system it models, the nodes in the graph need to correspond to the items of the system (Butts, 2009Butts C.T. Revisiting the foundations of network analysis.Science. 2009; 325: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A.

Concepts and principles in the analysis of brain networks.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2011; 1224: 126-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Consider, for example, the set of interstate relationships shown in Figure 5A, in which California has relationships to Alaska, Washington, and Rhode Island. This spatially embedded system, organized at the level of states, can be represented using nodes of states or nodes of space. An item-based model (node = state) accurately represents this system, and identifies California as the hub of this simple network. If the same set of relationships is preserved but this system is instead represented by land area (node = square mile), the graph acquires a very different structure, and hubs are identified in Alaska. Analogous arguments apply to RSFC networks. The brain is a spatially embedded functional network: billions of neurons (in the cortex, at least) are spatially and functionally organized into columns, areas (e.g., primary visual cortex) and systems (e.g., visual system) (Churchland and Sejnowski, 1988Churchland P.S. Sejnowski T.J. Perspectives on cognitive neuroscience.Science. 1988; 242: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Areas have different sizes (Carmichael and Price, 1994Carmichael S.T. Price J.L. Architectonic subdivision of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex in the macaque monkey.J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 346: 366-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), as do systems (e.g., visual versus auditory systems). By representing the brain with voxels, a space-based model rather than an item-based model is adopted such that different areas (and systems) are represented by variable numbers of voxels. Since voxels within areas tend to have similar signals, and areas within systems have similar signals, nodes within large areas will tend to have many high correlations to other nodes within their area, and nodes within large systems will tend to have many moderate-to-high correlations to other nodes within their system. These considerations suggest that voxel degree is driven in substantial part by the physical size of a voxel’s area and system (Figure 5B). For example, V1 may comprise hundreds of voxels, whereas A1 may comprise only a few dozen voxels. The large number of strong within-area correlations in V1 will confer higher degree to voxels in this region than to voxels in A1. Similarly, the visual system spans many thousands of voxels, whereas the auditory system only includes a few hundred voxels. Voxels in the visual system will display more within-system correlations and therefore higher degree than voxels in the auditory system. Because the locations and sizes of areas in humans are presently unknown, this argument cannot be fully demonstrated. Note, however, that the variance in node strength explained by community size rose from 11% in the areal network to 34% in the voxelwise network, and also note that many communities correspond roughly to brain systems (Figure 2), all consistent with this line of argumentation. The essential point of this section is that using volumetric elements to form graphs results in network properties that may more closely represent volumetric properties of brain organization rather than the organization of information processing. We have highlighted two difficulties with degree-based hub identification in RSFC data: the influence of community size on degree in Pearson correlation networks and the susceptibility of degree to distortion in volume-based brain networks. The latter problem can be ameliorated by proper network definition, but the former problem suggests that degree has a fundamentally ambiguous interpretation in RSFC correlation networks. If degree-based methods of hub identification are confounded, can other methods identify hubs in RSFC correlation networks? Many other centrality measures based upon combinations of degree and path length exist to characterize hubs (e.g., betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, and PageRank centralities). Some of these measures have been used to identify RSFC hubs (Achard et al., 2006Achard S. Salvador R. Whitcher B. Suckling J. Bullmore E. A resilient, low-frequency, small-world human brain functional network with highly connected association cortical hubs.J. Neurosci. 2006;"

They determine that 128 of 160 CFTR variants with an allele frequency of >0.01% are causal for disease. Allelic heterogeneity in disease-causing genes presents a substantial challenge to the translation of genomic variation into clinical practice. Few of the almost 2,000 variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene CFTR have empirical evidence that they cause cystic fibrosis. To address this gap, we collected both genotype and phenotype data for 39,696 individuals with cystic fibrosis in registries and clinics in North America and Europe. In these individuals, 159 CFTR variants had an allele frequency of ł0.01%. These variants were evaluated for both clinical severity and functional consequence, with 127 (80%) meeting both clinical and functional criteria consistent with disease. Assessment of disease penetrance in 2,188 fathers of individuals with cystic fibrosis enabled assignment of 12 of the remaining 32 variants as neutral, whereas the other 20 variants remained of indeterminate effect. This study illustrates that sourcing data directly from well-phenotyped subjects can address the gap in our ability to interpret clinically relevant genomic variation."
https://openalex.org/W1997982013,"The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) have both been implicated in mediating anxiety-related behaviors, but the functional contribution of BLA inputs to the vHPC has never been directly investigated. Here we show that activation of BLA-vHPC synapses acutely and robustly increased anxiety-related behaviors, while inhibition of BLA-vHPC synapses decreased anxiety-related behaviors. We combined optogenetic approaches with in vivo pharmacological manipulations and ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to dissect the local circuit mechanisms, demonstrating that activation of BLA terminals in the vHPC provided monosynaptic, glutamatergic inputs to vHPC pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, BLA inputs exerted polysynaptic, inhibitory effects mediated by local interneurons in the vHPC that may serve to balance the circuit locally. These data establish a role for BLA-vHPC synapses in bidirectionally controlling anxiety-related behaviors in an immediate, yet reversible, manner and a model for the local circuit mechanism of BLA inputs in the vHPC."
https://openalex.org/W2018612157,Making Crystals The initial transition from a disordered solution to the formation of nuclei that grow into crystals continues to be a puzzle. Recent experiments suggested the formation of stable ordered clusters that appear prior to the formation of the first nuclei. Wallace et al. (p. 885 ; see the Perspective by Myerson and Trout ) used molecular dynamics to look at the potential structure and dynamics of these clusters and lattice gas simulations to explore the population dynamics of the cluster populations prior to nucleation. A liquid-liquid phase separation process was observed whereby one phase becomes more concentrated in ions and becomes the precursor for nuclei to form.
https://openalex.org/W2154700649,"Foraging animals have distinct exploration and exploitation behaviors that are organized into discrete behavioral states. Here, we characterize a neuromodulatory circuit that generates long-lasting roaming and dwelling states in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF), each initiate and extend one behavioral state. Serotonin promotes dwelling states through the MOD-1 serotonin-gated chloride channel. The spontaneous activity of serotonergic neurons correlates with dwelling behavior, and optogenetic modulation of the critical MOD-1-expressing targets induces prolonged dwelling states. PDF promotes roaming states through a Gαs-coupled PDF receptor; optogenetic activation of cAMP production in PDF receptor-expressing cells induces prolonged roaming states. The neurons that produce and respond to each neuromodulator form a distributed circuit orthogonal to the classical wiring diagram, with several essential neurons that express each molecule. The slow temporal dynamics of this neuromodulatory circuit supplement fast motor circuits to organize long-lasting behavioral states."
https://openalex.org/W2084589427,"Using millisecond-timescale voltage-sensitive dye imaging in lightly anesthetized or awake adult mice, we show that a palette of sensory-evoked and hemisphere-wide activity motifs are represented in spontaneous activity. These motifs can reflect multiple modes of sensory processing, including vision, audition and touch. We found similar cortical networks with direct cortical activation using channelrhodopsin-2. Regional analysis of activity spread indicated modality-specific sources, such as primary sensory areas, a common posterior-medial cortical sink where sensory activity was extinguished within the parietal association area and a secondary anterior medial sink within the cingulate and secondary motor cortices for visual stimuli. Correlation analysis between functional circuits and intracortical axonal projections indicated a common framework corresponding to long-range monosynaptic connections between cortical regions. Maps of intracortical monosynaptic structural connections predicted hemisphere-wide patterns of spontaneous and sensory-evoked depolarization. We suggest that an intracortical monosynaptic connectome shapes the ebb and flow of spontaneous cortical activity."

Enzymatic hyperactivity has been linked to aberrant repression of tumor suppressor genes in diverse cancers. Here, we report the development of stabilized α-helix of EZH2 (SAH-EZH2) peptides that selectively inhibit H3 Lys27 trimethylation by dose-responsively disrupting the EZH2-EED complex and reducing EZH2 protein levels, a mechanism distinct from that reported for small-molecule EZH2 inhibitors targeting the enzyme catalytic domain. MLL-AF9 leukemia cells, which are dependent on PRC2, undergo growth arrest and monocyte-macrophage differentiation upon treatment with SAH-EZH2, consistent with observed changes in expression of PRC2-regulated, lineage-specific marker genes. Thus, by dissociating the EZH2-EED complex, we pharmacologically modulate an epigenetic 'writer' and suppress PRC2-dependent cancer cell growth."

Here we describe a new syndrome featuring severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM syndrome) caused by homozygous mutations in DSG1. DSG1 encodes desmoglein 1, a major constituent of desmosomes, which connect the cell surface to the keratin cytoskeleton and have a crucial role in maintaining epidermal integrity and barrier function. Mutations causing SAM syndrome resulted in lack of membrane expression of DSG1, leading to loss of cell-cell adhesion. In addition, DSG1 deficiency was associated with increased expression of a number of genes encoding allergy-related cytokines. Our deciphering of the pathogenesis of SAM syndrome substantiates the notion that allergy may result from a primary structural epidermal defect."
https://openalex.org/W2095578236,"For effective information processing, two large-scale distributed neural networks appear to be critical: a multimodal executive system anchored on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and a salience system anchored on the anterior insula. Aberrant interaction among distributed networks is a feature of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. We used whole-brain Granger causal modeling using resting fMRI and observed a significant failure of both the feedforward and reciprocal influence between the insula and the DLPFC in schizophrenia. Further, a significant failure of directed influence from bilateral visual cortices to the insula was also seen in patients. These findings provide compelling evidence for a breakdown of the salience-execution loop in the clinical expression of psychosis. In addition, this offers a parsimonious explanation for the often-observed “frontal inefficiency,” the failure to recruit prefrontal system when salient or novel information becomes available in patients with schizophrenia."

Using a spectrophotometric method sensitive to Mn oxidation state, Madison et al.

The bud provides signals that regulate the survival, renewal and differentiation of these cells. Recent data suggest that Wnt9b, a ureteric-bud-derived factor, is sufficient for both progenitor cell renewal and differentiation. How the same molecule induces two seemingly contradictory processes is unknown. Here, we show that signals from the stromal fibroblasts cooperate with Wnt9b to promote differentiation of the progenitors. The atypical cadherin Fat4 encodes at least part of this stromal signal. Our data support a model whereby proper kidney size and function is regulated by balancing opposing signals from the ureteric bud and stroma to promote renewal and differentiation of the nephron progenitors. Carroll and colleagues show that the atypical cadherin Fat4 derived from stromal fibroblasts cooperates with Wnt9b produced by the ureteric bud to modulate self-renewal and differentiation of kidney progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W2051483319,"This study shows that associative reward learning produces dynamic experience-dependent alterations in DNA methylation and immediate-early gene expression in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons and that DNA methylation in the VTA is required for the formation of new reward-related memories. Reward-related memories are essential for adaptive behavior and evolutionary fitness, but they are also a core component of maladaptive brain diseases such as addiction. Reward learning requires dopamine neurons located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which encode relationships between predictive cues and future rewards. Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, are essential regulators of neuronal plasticity and experience-driven behavioral change. However, the role of epigenetic mechanisms in reward learning is poorly understood. Here we show that the formation of reward-related associative memories in rats upregulates key plasticity genes in the VTA, which are correlated with memory strength and associated with gene-specific changes in DNA methylation. Moreover, DNA methylation in the VTA is required for the formation of stimulus-reward associations. These results provide the first evidence that that activity-dependent methylation and demethylation of DNA is an essential substrate for the behavioral and neuronal plasticity driven by reward-related experiences."
https://openalex.org/W2018702088,"Animals often must decide whether or not to consume a diet that contains competing attractive and aversive compounds. Here, using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we describe a mechanism that influences this decision. Addition of bitter compounds to sucrose suppressed feeding behavior, and this inhibition depended on an odorant-binding protein (OBP) termed OBP49a. In wild-type flies, bitter compounds suppressed sucrose-induced action potentials, and the inhibition was impaired in Obp49a mutants. However, loss of OBP49a did not affect action potentials in sugar- or bitter-activated gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) when the GRNs were presented with just one type of tastant. OBP49a was expressed in accessory cells and acted non-cell-autonomously to attenuate nerve firings in sugar-activated GRNs when bitter compounds were combined with sucrose. These findings demonstrate an unexpected role for an OBP in taste and identify a molecular player involved in the integration of opposing attractive and aversive gustatory inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2059122356,"In this study, the authors show that overexpression/accumulation of the parkin substrate AIMP2 induces an age-dependent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and results in motor dysfunction. This effect is dependent on AIMP2-induced activation of PARP1, which, in turn, induces cell death via parthanatos. The defining pathogenic feature of Parkinson's disease is the age-dependent loss of dopaminergic neurons. Mutations and inactivation of parkin, an ubiquitin E3 ligase, induce Parkinson's disease through accumulation of pathogenic substrates. We found that transgenic overexpression of a parkin substrate, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex interacting multifunctional protein-2 (AIMP2), led to a selective, age-dependent, progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons via activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1). AIMP2 accumulation in vitro and in vivo resulted in PARP1 overactivation and dopaminergic cell toxicity via direct association of these proteins in the nucleus, providing a path to PARP1 activation other than DNA damage. Inhibition of PARP1 through gene deletion or drug inhibition reversed behavioral deficits and protected against dopamine neuron death in AIMP2 transgenic mice. These data indicate that brain-permeable PARP inhibitors could effectively delay or prevent disease progression in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2063856415,"Activity-dependent competition of synapses plays a key role in neural organization and is often promoted by GABA; however, its cellular bases are poorly understood. Excitatory synapses of cortical pyramidal neurons are formed on small protrusions known as dendritic spines, which exhibit structural plasticity. We used two-color uncaging of glutamate and GABA in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and found that spine shrinkage and elimination were markedly promoted by the activation of GABAA receptors shortly before action potentials. GABAergic inhibition suppressed bulk increases in cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations, whereas it preserved the Ca(2+) nanodomains generated by NMDA-type receptors, both of which were necessary for spine shrinkage. Unlike spine enlargement, spine shrinkage spread to neighboring spines (<15 μm) and competed with their enlargement, and this process involved the actin-depolymerizing factor ADF/cofilin. Thus, GABAergic inhibition directly suppresses local dendritic Ca(2+) transients and strongly promotes the competitive selection of dendritic spines."

For example, enzyme protein movements have been shown to optimize the active site, enable binding of substrate and cofactor, and facilitate product release. Whittier et al. (p. 899 ) now show that in two tyrosine phosphatases, the rate of cleavage is coupled to motion of a loop. The two phosphatases have different catalytic rates; however, in both, a loop containing a catalytic residue switches between an inactive open and a catalytically competent closed state. The rates of closure are equivalent to the cleavage rates, suggesting that the leaving group tyrosine is protonated simultaneously with loop closure. Thus, tuning of the loop motion plays a regulatory role in the catalytic cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2078340601,"Elevated LDL-cholesterol is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Thus, proper control of LDL-cholesterol homeostasis is critical for organismal health. Genetic analysis has identified PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) as a crucial gene in the regulation of LDL-cholesterol via control of LDL receptor degradation. Although biochemical characteristics and clinical implications of PCSK9 have been extensively investigated, epigenetic regulation of this gene is largely unknown. In this work we have discovered that Sirt6, an NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase, plays a critical role in the regulation of the Pcsk9 gene expression in mice. Hepatic Sirt6 deficiency leads to elevated Pcsk9 gene expression and LDL-cholesterol as well. Mechanistically, we have demonstrated that Sirt6 can be recruited by forkhead transcription factor FoxO3 to the proximal promoter region of the Pcsk9 gene and deacetylates histone H3 at lysines 9 and 56, thereby suppressing the gene expression. Also remarkably, overexpression of Sirt6 in high fat diet-fed mice lowers LDL-cholesterol. Overall, our data suggest that FoxO3 and Sirt6, two longevity genes, can reduce LDL-cholesterol levels through regulation of the Pcsk9 gene."

We recorded the concerted activity of the neuronal circuit elements of single direction-selective (DS) retinal ganglion cells at subcellular resolution by combining GCaMP3-functionalized transsynaptic viral tracing and two-photon imaging. While the visually evoked activity of the dendritic segments of the DS cells were direction selective, direction-selective activity was absent in the axon terminals of bipolar cells. Furthermore, the glutamate input to DS cells, recorded using a genetically encoded glutamate sensor, also lacked direction selectivity. Therefore, the first stage in which extraction of a cardinal motion direction occurs is the dendrites of DS cells."

However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the amplification of skin SCs remain unclear. Here we report an essential role for miR-205, one of the most highly expressed microRNAs in skin SCs, in promoting neonatal expansion of these cells. Unlike most mammalian miRNAs, genetic deletion of miR-205 causes neonatal lethality with severely compromised epidermal and hair follicle growth. In the miR-205 knockout skin SCs, phospho-Akt is significantly downregulated, and the SCs prematurely exit the cell cycle. In the hair follicle, this accelerates the transition of the neonatal SCs towards quiescence. We identify multiple miR-205-targeted negative regulators of PI(3)K signalling that mediate the repression of phospho-Akt and restrict the proliferation of SCs. Our findings reveal an essential role for miR-205 in maintaining the expansion of skin SCs by antagonizing negative regulators of PI(3)K signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2136921993,"Protein synthesis is critical for circadian clock function, but little is known of how translational regulation controls the master pacemaker in mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Here we demonstrate that the pivotal translational repressor, the eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), is rhythmically regulated via the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in the SCN and preferentially represses vasoactive intestinal peptide (Vip) mRNA translation. Knockout (KO) of Eif4ebp1 (gene encoding 4E-BP1) leads to upregulation of VIP and higher amplitude of molecular rhythms in the SCN. Consequently, the 4E-BP1 null mice exhibit accelerated re-entrainment to a shifted light/dark cycle and are more resistant to the rhythm-disruptive effects of constant light. Conversely, in Mtor(+/-) mice VIP expression is decreased and susceptibility to the effects of constant light is increased. These results reveal a key role for mTOR/4E-BP1-mediated translational control in regulating entrainment and synchrony of the master clock."

Two of these suppressors encode glutathione peroxidases (GPxs), which are conserved antioxidant enzymes that catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches in yeast, mammalian cells and Drosophila, we found that GPx activity robustly ameliorates Huntington's disease-relevant metrics and is more protective than other antioxidant approaches tested here. Notably, we found that GPx activity, unlike many antioxidant treatments, does not inhibit autophagy, which is an important mechanism for clearing mutant Htt. Because previous clinical trials have indicated that GPx mimetics are well tolerated in humans, this study may have important implications for treating Huntington's disease."

Pickpocket genes encode Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium channel subunits (DEG/ENaC). We demonstrate that ppk11 and ppk16 are necessary in presynaptic motoneurons for both the acute induction and long-term maintenance of synaptic homeostasis. We show that ppk11 and ppk16 are cotranscribed as a single mRNA that is upregulated during homeostatic plasticity. Acute pharmacological inhibition of a PPK11- and PPK16-containing channel abolishes the expression of short- and long-term homeostatic plasticity without altering baseline presynaptic neurotransmitter release, indicating remarkable specificity for homeostatic plasticity rather than NMJ development. Finally, presynaptic calcium imaging experiments support a model in which a PPK11- and PPK16-containing DEG/ENaC channel modulates presynaptic membrane voltage and, thereby, controls calcium channel activity to homeostatically regulate neurotransmitter release."

Therefore, the identification of molecules involved in CSC self-renewal is a necessary step toward more effective therapies. To this aim, through the transcription profiling of the murine ErbB2(+) tumor cell line TUBO vs. derived CSC-enriched mammospheres, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was identified as 2-fold overexpressed in CSCs, as confirmed by qPCR and cytofluorimetric analysis. TLR2 signaling inhibition impaired in vitro mammosphere generation in murine TUBO (60%) and 4T1 (30%) and human MDA-MB-231 (50%), HCC1806 (60%), and MCF7 (50%) cells. In CSC, TLR2 was activated by endogenous high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1), inducing IκBα phosphorylation, IL-6 and TGFβ secretion, and, consequently, STAT3 and Smad3 activation. In vivo TLR2 inhibition blocked TUBO tumor takes in 9/14 mice and induced a 2-fold reduction in lung metastases development by decreasing cell proliferation and vascularization and increasing apoptosis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that murine and human mammary CSCs express TLR2 and its ligand HMGB1; this autocrine loop plays a pivotal role in CSC self-renewal, tumorigenesis, and metastatic ability. These findings, while providing evidence against the controversial use of TLR2 agonists in antitumor therapy, lay out new paths toward the design of anticancer treatments."

New sulfonamide compounds inhibiting melanopsin (opsinamides) compete with retinal binding to melanopsin and inhibit its function without affecting rod- and cone-mediated responses. In vivo administration of opsinamides to mice specifically and reversibly modified melanopsin-dependent light responses, including the pupillary light reflex and light aversion.

https://openalex.org/W2033173663,"Binaural integration in the central nucleus of inferior colliculus (ICC) plays a critical role in sound localization. However, its arithmetic nature and underlying synaptic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we showed in mouse ICC neurons that the contralateral dominance is created by a “push-pull”-like mechanism, with contralaterally dominant excitation and more bilaterally balanced inhibition. Importantly, binaural spiking response is generated apparently from an ipsilaterally mediated scaling of contralateral response, leaving frequency tuning unchanged. This scaling effect is attributed to a divisive attenuation of contralaterally evoked synaptic excitation onto ICC neurons with their inhibition largely unaffected. Thus, a gain control mediates the linear transformation from monaural to binaural spike responses. The gain value is modulated by interaural level difference (ILD) primarily through scaling excitation to different levels. The ILD-dependent synaptic scaling and gain adjustment allow ICC neurons to dynamically encode interaural sound localization cues while maintaining an invariant representation of other independent sound attributes."

The architectural and functional integrity of the mammalian neocortex requires the tight regulation of neuron production, which is primarily determined by the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Perturbation of the proliferation or differentiation process results in either a reduced or excessive number of neurons, which leads to the formation of a smaller or larger brain (i.e., microcephaly or macrocephaly, respectively). In turn, this causes cortical malfunctions such as mental retardation.

RGs located in the ventricular zone (VZ) divide asymmetrically to self-renew and give rise to either a neuron or more commonly an IP. The newly generated IPs migrate to the subventricular zone (SVZ) and divide symmetrically to generate pairs of IPs for one to three cycles before differentiating into neurons (Pontious et al., 2008Pontious A. Kowalczyk T. Englund C. Hevner R.F. Role of intermediate progenitor cells in cerebral cortex development.Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 30: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, IPs are regarded as the major source of neurons (Pontious et al., 2008Pontious A. Kowalczyk T. Englund C. Hevner R.F. Role of intermediate progenitor cells in cerebral cortex development.Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 30: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and an increase in IPs relative to RGs may contribute to the expansion of the human cerebral cortex (Martínez-Cerdeño et al., 2006Martínez-Cerdeño V. Noctor S.C. Kriegstein A.R. The role of intermediate progenitor cells in the evolutionary expansion of the cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2006; 16: i152-i161Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Importantly, the processes of IP amplification and neuronal differentiation require spatial and temporal coordination to ensure proper neuron generation. The generation, proliferation, and neuronal differentiation of IPs are determined by both intrinsic regulators and extrinsic signals. The sequential expression of specific transcription factors, i.e., Pax6 → Ngn2 → Tbr2 → NeuroD → Tbr1, is temporally correlated with the RG-to-IP-to-neuron transition and probably contributes to the sequential differentiation of neurons (Englund et al., 2005Englund C. Fink A. Lau C. Pham D. Daza R.A. Bulfone A. Kowalczyk T. Hevner R.F. Pax6, Tbr2, and Tbr1 are expressed sequentially by radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, and postmitotic neurons in developing neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Cell-cycle regulation, such as lengthening of the G1 phase and shortening of the S phase, also underlies the sequential RG-to-IP-to-neuron differentiation (Arai et al., 2011Arai Y. Pulvers J.N. Haffner C. Schilling B. Nüsslein I. Calegari F. Huttner W.B. Neural stem and progenitor cells shorten S-phase on commitment to neuron production.Nat.

Selective lengthening of the cell cycle in the neurogenic subpopulation of neural progenitor cells during mouse brain development.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6533-6538Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), implying that cell-cycle regulators control IP amplification and neuronal differentiation. In particular, cyclinD1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) overexpression in RGs increases the generation and expansion of IPs (Lange et al., 2009Lange C. Huttner W.B. Calegari F.

Notably, extracellular cues including fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Notch ligands, sonic hedgehog (Shh), Wnt, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and retinoic acid (RA) are extensively involved in neurogenesis, probably through the regulation of transcription factors or cell-cycle regulators. While FGF (Kang et al., 2009Kang W. Wong L.C. Shi S.H. Hébert J.M. The transition from radial glial to intermediate progenitor cell is inhibited by FGF signaling during corticogenesis.J.

Furthermore, signaling cascades activated by TGF-β (Vogel et al., 2010Vogel T. Ahrens S. Büttner N. Krieglstein K.

Importantly, canonical Wnt signaling has been suggested to play multiple roles in neurogenesis, including IP suppression (Chenn and Walsh, 2002Chenn A. Walsh C.A.

Nonetheless, how these pathways are integrated and coordinated to ensure proper IP production and neuronal differentiation remains unclear. Identifying the molecular switch that governs the transition from the generation/amplification of IPs to neuronal differentiation is critical for understanding mammalian neurogenesis. In this study, we investigated whether the scaffold protein Axin (Axin1) is the key molecular control. Originally identified as a tumor suppressor, the multidomain protein Axin is well characterized as a “master” scaffold for various signaling proteins including Wnt, Notch, RA, TGF-β, p53, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)—all of which are known to control neurogenesis (Guo et al., 2008Guo X.

Importantly, the disruption of Axin or Axin-like proteins in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos leads to the development of small brains (Heisenberg et al., 2001Heisenberg C.P. Houart C. Take-Uchi M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), resembling human microcephaly. Furthermore, the human Axin gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 at position 13.3 (16p13.3), where an unidentified recessive gene that causes microcephaly is located (Brooks et al., 2006Brooks B.P. Meck J.M. Haddad B.R. Bendavid C. Blain D. Toretsky J.A.

These findings prompted us to determine whether and how Axin regulates embryonic neurogenesis during brain development. Here, we show that the level and subcellular localization of Axin in NPCs determine whether they undergo amplification or neuronal differentiation. The interaction between cytoplasmic Axin and GSK-3β is critical for the amplification of the IP pool, whereas the interaction between Axin and β-catenin in the nucleus promotes neuronal differentiation. Intriguingly, the phosphorylation of Axin at Thr485 by Cdk5 shifts the subcellular localization of Axin from the cytoplasm to nucleus upon NPC differentiation, thus acting as a molecular switch that causes IPs to switch from amplification to differentiation. Axin was strongly expressed in the developing mouse neocortex from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) to E15.5 (Figure S1A available online). Although Axin expression was prominent in neuron-residing intermediate zone/cortical plate (IZ/CP), the protein was also detected in the VZ/SVZ, where NPCs are predominantly located (Figures 1A–1C), and was expressed in cultured NPCs (Figure S1B). As a first step to investigate whether Axin plays an important role in embryonic neurogenesis, we examined the functional consequence of increasing the endogenous level of Axin in mouse cortices at E13.5 by in utero intraventricular microinjections of a tankyrase inhibitor, XAV939 (Huang et al., 2009Huang S.M. Mishina Y.M. Liu S. Cheung A. Stegmeier F. Michaud G.A. Charlat O. Wiellette E. Zhang Y. Wiessner S. et al.Tankyrase inhibition stabilizes axin and antagonizes Wnt signalling.Nature. 2009; 461: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar), which allows the transient stabilization of Axin protein (Figures S1C and S1D). After injection, Axin levels increased by 57.3% ± 5.3% at E14.5 and 29.6% ± 3.4% at E15.5 in mouse cortices (Figure S1D). Intriguingly, XAV939 injection enhanced the production of newly generated cells at E15.5 (labeled with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine [EdU]) incorporation at E13.5), with a greater percentage of EdU+ NPCs in the VZ/SVZ (Figure 1D; Control, 38.6% ± 3.7%; XAV939, 61.2% ± 4.3%). The enlarged NPC pool ultimately led to the generation of more upper-layer cortical neurons (Cux1+; labeled with EdU at E14.5) in the CP by E17.5 (Figures 1E–1G, S1E, and S1F), possibly at the expense of deeper-layer neurons (Ctip2+; Figures S1G and S1H). Robust cortical neuron production contributes to the expansion of cortical surface, which is critical for the evolutionary enlargement of the mammalian cerebral cortex (Rakic, 2009Rakic P. Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, XAV939-injected brains exhibited greater cortical surface area (Figures 1H and 1I) and thicker upper cortical layers (Cux1+; Figures 1J, 1K, and S1I–S1K) than the controls. Collectively, enhanced Axin protein levels expand the neural progenitor pool, which augments cortical neuron production, leading to tangential and radial expansion of the cerebral cortex during development. To further investigate the functional roles of Axin, we examined the effects of Axin overexpression or knockdown in the VZ/SVZ of the mouse cortex using in utero electroporation (Fang et al., 2011Fang W.Q. Ip J.P. Li R. Ng Y.P. Lin S.C. Chen Y. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of Axin directs axon formation during cerebral cortex development.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13613-13624Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Figures S1B and S1L). Axin overexpression increased the proportion of GFP+ NPCs in the VZ/SVZ at E15.5 (Figures 1L and 1M), further supporting a role of Axin in maintaining/amplifying NPCs. In contrast, Axin silencing at E13.5 resulted in a remarkable reduction of GFP+ cells in the VZ/SVZ at E15.5 with a concomitant increase in the proportion of GFP+ cells in the IZ/CP; this suggests premature depletion of NPCs and precocious neuronal differentiation (Figures 1L and 1M). Concordantly, Axin knockdown increased the percentage of cells with enhanced neuron-specific promoter activity (i.e., cells marked by GFP expression driven by the NeuroD promoter; Figures S1M and S1N). Premature neuronal differentiation is closely associated with early cell-cycle exit. Indeed, Axin-depleted cells underwent premature cell-cycle exit as shown by a significantly higher proportion of GFP+ EdU+ cells in the VZ/SVZ negative for the cell proliferation marker, Ki67 (arrows in Figures S1O and S1P), with no obvious cell death (Figure S1Q). The precocious or suppressed neuronal differentiation upon Axin knockdown and overexpression ultimately resulted in reduced and increased numbers of upper-layer cortical neurons at E18.5, respectively (Figures 1N, 1O, and S1R). Notably, a significant number of Axin-overexpressing neurons were stacked in the IZ, suggesting that Axin has an alternative function in neuronal migration probably through the regulation of neuronal polarization (Fang et al., 2011Fang W.Q. Ip J.P. Li R. Ng Y.P. Lin S.C. Chen Y. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of Axin directs axon formation during cerebral cortex development.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13613-13624Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate that the protein level of Axin is critical for regulating NPC neurogenesis, we used in vitro pair-cell analysis to follow the division of NPCs (Figures 1P–1S). Stabilization (Figures 1P and 1Q) and overexpression of Axin (Figures 1R and 1S) both resulted in the amplification of NPCs (Figures 1Q and 1S), whereas Axin knockdown increased the tendency of NPCs to divide and differentiate into two neurons (Figure 1S). Thus, the regulation of Axin protein levels in NPCs at midneurogenesis is critical for generating the proper number of neurons during brain development, probably through the control of NPC amplification and neuronal differentiation. There are two major cell types of NPCs: RGs and IPs. Although RGs are predominantly found in the mouse cortex for maintaining the NPC pools, IPs are transient, amplifying neurogenic progenitors that contribute to cortical neuron production. Intriguingly, although the number of Pax6+ RGs in the cortex of XAV939-injected embryos was not substantially different from that of the controls at E15.5 (Figure 2A), there were more Tbr2+ IPs in the XAV939-injected brains than the controls (Figure 2B). Given that XAV939 administration did not inhibit neuronal differentiation (Figures 1E–1G) or affect cell survival (data not shown), the increased number of IPs may be due to enhanced IP generation. Therefore, we labeled mitotic RGs with EdU 2 hr after XAV939 injection and traced the fates of their progenies at E15.5. XAV939-injected brains exhibited a markedly increased proportion of Tbr2+ EdU+ IPs (Figures 2C–2E), whereas the Pax6+ EdU+ RG pool remained relatively unchanged (Figures 2F–2H); this suggests that Axin upregulation enhances IP generation. Consistent with this finding, Axin overexpression at E13.5 resulted in a significant increase in the IP population (Figures 2I, 2K, and 2M) without affecting the RG pool at E15.5 (Figures 2J, 2L, and 2N). The expansion of IPs may be attributable to either increased proliferation of IPs or enhanced differentiation from RGs. The proportion of mitotic IPs (pH3+ Tbr2+) remained relatively unchanged when Axin was stabilized or overexpressed (Figures S2A–S2H), suggesting that Axin does not markedly affect IP proliferation. Furthermore, Axin overexpression at E12.5 led to an enlarged IP pool and concomitantly a reduced number of deeper-layer neurons (Figures S2I–S2O); this indicates that Axin expression causes a shift of neuronal differentiation from RGs toward IP generation. Collectively, Axin upregulation in midneurogenesis enhances IP amplification, which contributes to increased upper-layer neuron production (Cux1+; Figures 1E–1K). In addition, consistent with the observation that Axin knockdown resulted in premature neuronal differentiation (Figures 1L and 1M), shAxin-electroporated brains exhibited significant reductions in the populations of both RGs and IPs (Figures 2I–2N), suggesting that Axin is required for the maintenance/amplification of RGs and IPs. Furthermore, in vitro pair-cell analysis revealed that both stabilization (Figures 2O and 2P) and overexpression of Axin (Figures 2Q and 2R) in RGs increased the number of IP-IP progeny pairs, supporting a role of Axin in facilitating IP generation and amplification. Next, we investigated how increased Axin levels enhance IP generation. Axin was mainly localized to the cytoplasm of NPCs in the VZ/SVZ at E13.5 (Figure 3A), whereas the protein was gradually enriched in the nuclei of a subset of NPCs (E13.5–E15.5, Figures 3A and S3A–S3C). Therefore, we hypothesized that the subcellular localization of Axin is regulated differently in different types of NPCs. To further characterize the subcellular localization of Axin in NPCs, cultured NPCs were prepared from embryonic mouse cortices and stained for Axin. Although Axin was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm (83.2% ± 6.8% of total Axin) and was weakly detectable in the nuclei (16.8% ± 3.3% of total Axin) of RGs (nestin+), the protein became more enriched in the nuclei of Tbr2+ IPs (53.3% ± 3.1% of total Axin; Figure 3B). Furthermore, when NPCs were cultured in neuronal differentiation medium for 3 hr, Axin level increased significantly in the nucleus (3.8 ± 0.7-fold) and decreased significantly in the cytoplasm (by 60.4% ± 6.2%) in differentiating NPCs (Figure 3C). Therefore, these findings indicate that Axin accumulates in the nuclei of NPCs in response to differentiation signals. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Axin is tightly controlled by the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) of the protein (Cong and Varmus, 2004Cong F. Varmus H. Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of Axin regulates subcellular localization of beta-catenin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To elucidate the specific roles of cytoplasmic and nuclear Axin, we generated two point mutants of Axin, allowing the protein to be expressed specifically in the cytoplasm (Axin-NLSm) or nucleus (Axin-NESm) (Figure 3D). Like wild-type Axin, the overexpression of cytoplasmic Axin (Axin-NLSm) at E13.5 increased the proportion of GFP+ cells in the VZ/SVZ at E15.5 (Figures 3E and 3F), suggesting that cytoplasmic Axin enhances NPC expansion. Furthermore, the re-expression of Axin-NLSm in Axin-knockdown NPCs also led to NPC pool expansion (Figures 3G–3L) specifically through the enlargement of the IP population (Figures 3H, 3J, and 3L). In contrast, the expression of nuclear Axin (Axin-NESm) (Figures 3E and 3F) or re-expression of the protein in Axin-knockdown NPCs depleted the GFP+ NPCs in the VZ/SVZ and promoted the differentiation of NPCs into neurons (Figures 3G–3L). Together with the nuclear accumulation of Axin in cultured NPCs upon differentiation (Figures 3A–3C), these findings strongly suggest that Axin in different subcellular compartments of NPCs specifically regulates the amplification and differentiation of NPCs; cytoplasmic Axin in RGs enhances IP amplification, whereas Axin in the nucleus of IPs promotes neuronal differentiation of IPs. Next, we investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the trafficking of Axin between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Treating RGs with leptomycin B led to the nuclear accumulation of Axin (Cong and Varmus, 2004Cong F. Varmus H. Nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of Axin regulates subcellular localization of beta-catenin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Figure S4A), suggesting that the nuclear enrichment of Axin is regulated by nuclear export. It was noted that the Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation site (Thr485) is located close to the NES of Axin (amino acids 413–423) (Fang et al., 2011Fang W.Q. Ip J.P. Li R. Ng Y.P. Lin S.C. Chen Y. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of Axin directs axon formation during cerebral cortex development.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13613-13624Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Figure 4A). Although Axin phosphorylation at Thr485 (p-Axin) could be detected in wild-type mouse neocortices at E13.5, this specific phosphorylation was markedly reduced in cdk5−/− littermates (by 45.5% ± 4.3%; Figures 4B, S4B, and S4C), indicating that Cdk5 is a major kinase that phosphorylates Axin during neurogenesis in vivo. Importantly, the nuclear level of Axin was reduced in cdk5−/− neocortices (by 68.2% ± 5.1%) accompanied by an increased level of cytoplasmic Axin (2.0 ± 0.3-fold; Figure 4B). These results suggest that Cdk5-dependent Axin phosphorylation is critical for controlling the nuclear localization of Axin in the embryonic cerebral cortex. To explore the role of Cdk5-mediated Axin phosphorylation, we examined how Axin phosphorylation is regulated in NPCs. Although basal levels of p-Axin were detected in the nuclear compartments of cultured NPCs, protein phosphorylation was markedly upregulated upon neuronal differentiation (by 2.1 ± 0.3-fold; Figure 4C). Furthermore, in the developing cortex, p-Axin was prominently detected in the nuclei of a subset of NPCs, primarily the IPs (arrowheads in Figures 4D, S4E, and S4F). The proportion of p-Axin+ NPCs increased progressively from E13.5 to E15.5 (Figure 4E), and p-Axin was found in the VZ/SVZ of the mouse neocortex at a rostrolateral-high to caudomedial-low gradient (Figures S4G–S4N)—a spatial profile similar to the gradient of neurogenesis (Caviness et al., 2009Caviness Jr., V.S. Nowakowski R.S. Bhide P.G. Neocortical neurogenesis: morphogenetic gradients and beyond.Trends Neurosci. 2009; 32: 443-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that increased phosphorylation of Axin at Thr485 is associated with neurogenesis. Notably, the mitotic RGs lining the ventricular surface of the VZ were prominently labeled with p-Axin (Figure S4D); this phosphorylation was not substantially reduced in cdk5−/− cortices (Figure S4C), indicating that Axin phosphorylation in these mitotic cells is likely mediated by other kinase(s). Importantly, cdk5 knockout (Figure 4F) or blockade of Cdk5 activity by the overexpression of the dominant-negative Cdk5 mutant (Cdk5-DN) resulted in an expansion of the IP pool at E15.5 (Figures 4G–4J); this further supports a role of Cdk5 in the regulation of neuronal differentiation of IPs, probably through phosphorylation and hence the nuclear localization of Axin. Next, we investigated the role of the Cdk5-dependent Axin phosphorylation in neuronal differentiation by examining the effects of overexpressing phospho-mimetic (Axin-TE) and phospho-deficient Axin (Axin-TA) mutants in NPCs. Axin-TE mutant was concentrated in the nucleus, whereas Axin-TA mutant was exclusively detected in the cytoplasm (Figure 5A). Re-expression of the Axin-TE mutant in Axin-knockdown cortices promoted the neuronal differentiation of NPCs. Meanwhile, Axin-TA mutant inhibited neuronal differentiation and led to the amplification of NPCs (Figures 5B and 5C), mainly IPs (Figures 5D–5I). Furthermore, the impaired neurogenesis due to Cdk5-DN expression was partially rescued by the coelectroporation of either the Axin-TE or Axin-NESm mutant (Figures 4G–4J and S5A–S5D). These findings provide further evidence that Cdk5-dependent Axin phosphorylation and hence the phosphorylation"

However, due to sPMCA's enormous amplification power, whether an infectious prion can be formed de novo with bacterially expressed recombinant PrP (rPrP) remains to be satisfactorily resolved. To address this question, we performed unseeded sPMCA with rPrP in a laboratory that has never been exposed to any native prions. Two types of proteinase K (PK)-resistant and self-perpetuating recombinant PrP conformers (rPrP-res) with PK-resistant cores of 17 or 14 kDa were generated. A bioassay revealed that rPrP-res17kDa was highly infectious, causing prion disease in wild-type mice with an average survival time of about 172 d. In contrast, rPrP-res14kDa completely failed to induce any disease. Our findings reveal that sPMCA is sufficient to initiate various self-perpetuating PK-resistant rPrP conformers, but not all of them possess in vivo infectivity. Moreover, generating an infectious prion in a prion-free environment establishes that an infectious prion can be formed de novo with bacterially expressed rPrP.—Zhang, Z., Zhang, Y., Wang, F., Wang, X., Xu, Y., Yang, H., Yu, G., Yuan, C., Ma, J., De novo generation of infectious prions with bacterially expressed recombinant prion protein.

https://openalex.org/W2103525220,"Most action potentials are produced by the sequential activation of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) and potassium (Kv) channels. This is mainly achieved by the rapid conformational rearrangement of voltage-sensor (VS) modules in Nav channels, with activation kinetics up to 6-fold faster than Shaker-type Kv channels. Here, using mutagenesis and gating current measurements, we show that a 3-fold acceleration of the VS kinetics in Nav versus Shaker Kv channels is produced by the hydrophilicity of two ""speed-control"" residues located in the S2 and S4 segments in Nav domains I-III. An additional 2-fold acceleration of the Nav VS kinetics is provided by the coexpression of the β1 subunit, ubiquitously found in mammal tissues. This study uncovers the molecular bases responsible for the differential activation of Nav versus Kv channels, a fundamental prerequisite for the genesis of action potentials."

The molecular mechanism responsible for the adaptation, mutation, and evolution of prions observed in cloned cells and upon crossing the species barrier remains unsolved. Using biophysical techniques and conformation-dependent immunoassays in tandem, we isolated two distinct populations of PrP(Sc) particles with different conformational stabilities and aggregate sizes, which frequently co-exist in the most common human prion disease, sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The protein misfolding cyclic amplification replicates each of the PrP(Sc) particle types independently and leads to the competitive selection of those with lower initial conformational stability. In serial propagation with a nonglycosylated mutant PrP(C) substrate, the dominant PrP(Sc) conformers are subject to further evolution by natural selection of the subpopulation with the highest replication rate due to its lowest stability. Cumulatively, the data show that sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease PrP(Sc) is not a single conformational entity but a dynamic collection of two distinct populations of particles. This implies the co-existence of different prions, whose adaptation and evolution are governed by the selection of progressively less stable, faster replicating PrP(Sc) conformers."

https://openalex.org/W2094412021,"Escherichia coli RecN is an SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) family protein that is required for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Previous studies show that GFP-RecN forms nucleoid-associated foci in response to DNA damage, but the mechanism by which RecN is recruited to the nucleoid is unknown. Here, we show that the assembly of GFP-RecN foci on the nucleoid in response to DNA damage involves a functional interaction between RecN and RecA. A novel RecA allele identified in this work, recA(Q300R), is proficient in SOS induction and repair of UV-induced DNA damage, but is deficient in repair of mitomycin C (MMC)-induced DNA damage. Cells carrying recA(Q300R) fail to recruit RecN to DSBs and accumulate fragmented chromosomes after exposure to MMC. The ATPase-deficient RecN(K35A) binds and forms foci at MMC-induced DSBs, but is not released from the MMC-induced DNA lesions, resulting in a defect in homologous recombination-dependent DSB repair. These data suggest that RecN plays a crucial role in homologous recombination-dependent DSB repair and that it is required upstream of RecA-mediated strand exchange."

These proteins employ an accessory DNA-binding domain (γ) to dictate directionality of DNA transport. It remains unclear how the interaction of γ with specific recognition sequences coordinates directional DNA translocation. We demonstrate that the γ domain of SpoIIIE inhibits ATPase activity of the motor domain in the absence of DNA but stimulates ATPase activity through sequence-specific DNA recognition. Furthermore, we observe that communication between γ subunits is necessary for both regulatory roles. Consistent with these findings, the γ domain is necessary for robust DNA transport along the length of the chromosome in vivo. Together, our data reveal that directional activation involves allosteric regulation of ATP turnover through coordinated action of γ domains. Thus, we propose a coordinated stimulation model in which γ-γ communication is required to translate DNA sequence information from each γ to its respective motor domain."
https://openalex.org/W2150234591,"In previous studies, the oligo-acyl-lysyl (OAK) C12(ω7)K-β12 added to cultures of gram-positive bacteria exerted a bacteriostatic activity that was associated with membrane depolarization, even at high concentrations. Here, we report that multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, unlike other gram-positive species, have reverted to the sensitive phenotype when exposed to subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of the OAK, thereby increasing antibiotics potency by up to 3 orders of magnitude. Such chemosensitization was achieved using either cytoplasm or cell-wall targeting antibiotics. Moreover, eventual emergence of resistance to antibiotics was significantly delayed. Using the mouse peritonitis-sepsis model, we show that on single-dose administration of oxacillin and OAK combinations, death induced by a lethal staphylococcal infection was prevented in a synergistic manner, thereby supporting the likelihood for synergism to persist under in vivo conditions. Toward illuminating the molecular basis for these observations, we present data arguing that sub-MIC OAK interactions with the plasma membrane can inhibit proton-dependent signal transduction responsible for expression and export of resistance factors, as demonstrated for β-lactamase and PBP2a. Collectively, the data reveal a potentially useful approach for overcoming antibiotic resistance and for preventing resistance from emerging as readily as when bacteria are exposed to an antibiotic alone.—Kaneti, G., Sarig, H., Marjieh, I., Fadia, Z., Mor, A., Simultaneous breakdown of multiple antibiotic resistance mechanisms in S. aureus.

Though spared strong shaking, the megacities nevertheless lit up in small quakes, perhaps signaling an abrupt change in the condition for failure on the faults beneath the cities. To detect such changes in earthquake rate requires good seismic monitoring networks; to respond to such hazard increases with civic preparations requires good government."
