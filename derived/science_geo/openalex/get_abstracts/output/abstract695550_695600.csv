https://openalex.org/W4283359585,"The use of social media during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an ""infodemic"" of mis- and disinformation with potentially grave consequences. To explore means of counteracting disinformation, we analyzed tweets containing the hashtags #Scamdemic and #Plandemic.Using a Twitter scraping tool called twint, we collected 419,269 English-language tweets that contained ""#Scamdemic"" or ""#Plandemic"" posted in 2020. Using the Twitter application-programming interface, we extracted the same tweets (by tweet ID) with additional user metadata. We explored descriptive statistics of tweets including their content and user profiles, analyzed sentiments and emotions, performed topic modeling, and determined tweet availability in both datasets.After removal of retweets, replies, non-English tweets, or duplicate tweets, 40,081 users tweeted 227,067 times using our selected hashtags. The mean weekly sentiment was overall negative for both hashtags. One in five users who used these hashtags were suspended by Twitter by January 2021. Suspended accounts had an average of 610 followers and an average of 6.7 tweets per user, while active users had an average of 472 followers and an average of 5.4 tweets per user. The most frequent tweet topic was ""Complaints against mandates introduced during the pandemic"" (79,670 tweets), which included complaints against masks, social distancing, and closures.While social media has democratized speech, it also permits users to disseminate potentially unverified or misleading information that endangers people's lives and public health interventions. Characterizing tweets and users that use hashtags associated with COVID-19 pandemic denial allowed us to understand the extent of misinformation. With the preponderance of inaccessible original tweets, we concluded that posters were in denial of the COVID-19 pandemic and sought to disperse related mis- or disinformation resulting in suspension.Leveraging 227,067 tweets with the hashtags #scamdemic and #plandemic in 2020, we were able to elucidate important trends in public disinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4283161814,"Learning and memory rely on long-lasting, synapse-specific modifications. Although postsynaptic forms of plasticity typically require local protein synthesis, whether and how local protein synthesis contributes to presynaptic changes remain unclear. Here, we examined the mouse hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapse, which expresses both structural and functional presynaptic plasticity and contains presynaptic fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in postsynaptic protein-synthesis-dependent plasticity. We report that MF boutons contain ribosomes and synthesize protein locally. The long-term potentiation of MF-CA3 synaptic transmission (MF-LTP) was associated with the translation-dependent enlargement of MF boutons. Remarkably, increasing in vitro or in vivo MF activity enhanced the protein synthesis in MFs. Moreover, the deletion of presynaptic FMRP blocked structural and functional MF-LTP, suggesting that FMRP is a critical regulator of presynaptic MF plasticity. Thus, presynaptic FMRP and protein synthesis dynamically control presynaptic structure and function in the mature mammalian brain."

The prevalence of mental disorder is increasing among PCOS patients due to various physical, psychological, and social issues. Here we aimed to evaluate the mental health and associated factors among women suffering from PCOS in Bangladesh.We performed an online cross-sectional survey among 409 participants with PCOS using Google Forms. We used structured questionnaires to collect socio-demographic information and lifestyle-related factors. Also, we applied patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scale, and UCLA loneliness (UCLA-3) scale for psychometric assessment of the participants. Finally, we applied several statistical tools and performed data interpretations to evaluate the prevalence of mental health disorders and associated factors among patients with PCOS in Bangladesh.Prevalence of loneliness, generalized anxiety disorder and depressive illness among the women with PCOS were 71%, 88%, and 60%, respectively. Among the mental illness, mild, moderate, and severe cases were 39%, 18%, and 14% for loneliness; 39%, 23% and 26% for generalized anxiety disorder; and 35%, 18%, and 7% for depressive disorder. According to the present findings, obesity, financial condition, physical exercise, mealtime, food habit, daily water consumption, birth control method, and long-term oral contraceptive pills contribute to developing mental health disorders among females with PCOS in Bangladesh.According to present study results, high proportion of women suffering from PCOS experience several mental disorders in Bangladesh. Although several socio-demographic and lifestyle-related factors were found to be associated with the poor mental health of women with PCOS; however, PCOS itself is a condition that favors poor physical and psychological health. Therefore, we recommend proper treatment, public awareness, and a healthy lifestyle to promote the good mental health of women suffering from PCOS."

Yet, we lack a consensual definition of neuronal types/subtypes and clear distinction between cause and effect within interconnected networks."
https://openalex.org/W4283259626,"With the rise of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a severe negative impact on all aspects of life, whether it be a job, business, health, education, etc. As a result, institutions, schools, colleges and universities are being shut down globally to control the spread of Covid-19. Due to this reason, the mode of education has a dramatic shift from on-campus to online learning with virtual teaching using digital technologies. This sudden shift has elevated the stress level among the students because they were not mentally prepared for it, and hence their academic performance has been adversely affected. So, there needs to figure out the underlying process to make online learning more productive. Thus, to obtain this objective, the present study has integrated the modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Task Technology Fit Model (TTF), DeLone and McLean Model of Information Systems Success (DMISM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. A sample of 404 students was obtained, where 202 students were from the top ten public sector universities, and 202 were from the top ten private sector universities of Punjab. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to analyze the hypothesized framework using AMOS. The results reveal that institutional factors positively impact students’ performance mediated by user satisfaction and task technology fit. Similarly, institutional factors affect performance through mediation by user satisfaction and actual usage in sequence. Cognitive absorption was used as a moderator between institutional factors and user satisfaction. In the end, theoretical and practical inferences have also been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4283265645,"Improvement of patients’ oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) is the main goal of oral health care professionals. However, OHRQoL is not a homogenous construct and how to assess it is challenging because of the large number of currently available instruments. Investigating available instruments and what they have in common would be necessary for consolidation and standardization of these instruments into a smaller set of tools. If the OHRQoL dimensions including Oral Function , Orofacial Pain , Orofacial Appearance , and Psychosocial Impact are the fundamental building blocks of the dental patient’s oral health experience, then these dimensions should be measured by generic multi-item dPROMs. In this study, a panel of 11 international dentists use the Delphi consensus process to determine how well 20 of these instruments measured the four OHRQoL dimensions. All 20 dPROMs questionnaires assessed at least one OHRQoL dimension while all four OHRQoL dimensions were measured by at least one dPROM instrument, i.e., the four OHRQoL dimensions were essential components of the patient’s oral health experience. This shows that the currently available generic multi-item dPROMs have a lot in common, in that they share Oral Function , Orofacial Pain , Orofacial Appearance , and Psychosocial Impact as targeted dimensions. Based on these commonalities, it is plausible and desirable to move towards a single four-dimensional metric to assess oral health impact in all clinical, community-based, and research settings. This step is necessary to advance evidence-based dentistry and value-based oral health care."
https://openalex.org/W4283272653,"This quantitative study aimed to determine physical education teachers' (PETs) perceptions of online physical education (OLPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey.An OLPE teaching survey during the COVID-19 was used, comprising PETs' opinions on OLPE teaching as well as the advantages, disadvantages, difficulties, and suggestions for OLPE teaching.A significant difference by gender was identified in the individual approach to student learning, greater student independence, and ongoing monitoring of student results for teachers, parents, and students. In addition, a significant difference was found by gender in the difficulty in implementing the core curriculum content as well as by school type in the lack of proper home equipment, absence of or limited Internet access, and problems with connecting the computer, tablet, or smartphone to the Internet. Moreover, PETs stated that OLPE teaching is not only the best way to transfer basic information, but it also gives them an opportunity to learn digital technology by devoting time for research for self-improvement. However, they stated that students do not perceive OLPE as a lesson, as student participation is lacking. Moreover, there are deficiencies in students' social-emotional development. They also stated that the content of the lessons was insufficient, and they were unable to make the lesson interesting.PETs' suggested recommendations included enriching the course content, increasing the lesson time, developing a new curriculum, and creating a platform to access course resources."
https://openalex.org/W4283258818,"Calcium (Ca) is a macronutrient and works as a modulator to mitigate oxidative stress induced by heavy metals. In this study, we investigated the role of Ca to ameliorate the Cd toxicity in Zea mays L. by modulating the growth, physio-biochemical traits, and cellular antioxidant defense system. Maize genotype Sahiwal-2002 was grown under a controlled glasshouse environment with a day/night temperature of 24 ± 4°C/14 ± 2°C in a complete randomized design with three replications and two Cd levels as (0 and 150 μM) and six regimes of Ca (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mM). Maize seedlings exposed to Cd at 150 μM concentration showed a notable decrease in growth, biomass, anthocyanins, chlorophylls, and antioxidant enzymes activities. A higher level of Cd (150 μM) also caused an upsurge in oxidative damage observed as higher electrolyte leakage (increased membrane permeability), H2O2 production, and MDA accumulation. Supplementation of Ca notably improved growth traits, photosynthetic pigments, cellular antioxidants (APX, POD, and ascorbic acid), anthocyanins, and levels of osmolytes. The significant improvement in the osmolytes (proteins and amino acids), and enzymatic antioxidative defense system enhanced the membrane stability and mitigated the damaging effects of Cd. The present results concluded that exogenously applied Ca potentially improve growth by regulating antioxidants and enabling maize plants to withstand the Cd toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W4283263331,"Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy are socially aversive personality traits that are strongly linked to the propensity of violence. A central determinate of aggression and violence is parental rearing. Interestingly, while the origin of the development of Dark Triad is not yet entirely understood, next to genetic and environmental factors, literature points towards an influence of parenting styles to the development of dark traits. Therefore, in a sample of 1366 9th grade students (mean age 14.89,), we assessed the interplay between parental rearing, dark triad traits, observation of violence among peers and their propensity for violence. The sample has a good representativeness on school types. Results reveal a positive association between the experience of parental rejection by both parents and punishment as well as parental control and overprotection and Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy. Parental emotional warmth was associated negatively with Machiavellianism and psychopathy while no significant association with narcissism was seen. In a path model, parental rearing, dark triad traits and observation of violence among peers significantly contributed to the propensity of violence. However, differences between the experienced parenting behaviour of mothers and fathers should be noted. Both rejection and overly harsh punishments by fathers and emotional warmth by mothers have no significant influence on the dark triad. It is interesting that the effects regarding maternal parenting behaviour are stronger overall than the effects regarding paternal parenting behaviour. These results underline the importance of parental rearing on the development of Machiavellianism, narcissism and psychopathy and suggest a significant role of parental rearing and the dark triad traits on propensity for violence in adolescents. Parenting trainings and family interventions may be a promising starting point to prevent antisocial behavior linked to the dark triad and to prevent violent behavior in future generations."
https://openalex.org/W4283382614,"The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea is higher in women after menopause. This is suggested to be a result of an altered sex hormone balance but has so far not been confirmed in a population-based study.To investigate whether serum concentration of estrogens and progesterone are associated with the prevalence of sleep apnea symptoms in middle-aged women of the general population.We analyzed data from 774 women (40-67 years) from 15 study centers in seven countries participating in the second follow-up of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (2010-2012). Multiple logistic regression models were fitted with self-reported symptoms of sleep apnea as outcomes and serum concentrations of various estrogens and progesterone as predictors. All analyses were adjusted for relevant covariates including age, BMI, education, study center, smoking habits, and reproductive age.Among all included women, a doubling of serum concentrations of estrone and progesterone was associated with 19% respectively 9% decreased odds of snoring. Among snorers, a doubling of the concentrations of 17β-estradiol, estrone and estrone 3-sulfate was associated with 18%, 23% and 17% decreased odds of breathing irregularly, and a doubling of the progesterone concentration was further associated with 12% decreased odds of waking up suddenly with a chocking sensation. Other evaluated associations were not statistically significant.Middle-aged women with low serum estrogen and progesterone levels are more likely to snore and report symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea."
https://openalex.org/W4283119350,"Acetylated lysine residues (Kac) in histones are recognized by epigenetic reader proteins, such as Yaf9, ENL, AF9, Taf14, and Sas5 (YEATS) domain-containing proteins. Human YEATS domains bind to the acetylated N-terminal tail of histone H3; however, their Kac-binding preferences at the level of the nucleosome are unknown. Through genetic code reprogramming, here, we established a nucleosome core particle (NCP) array containing histones that were acetylated at specific residues and used it to compare the Kac-binding preferences of human YEATS domains. We found that AF9-YEATS showed basal binding to the unmodified NCP and that it bound stronger to the NCP containing a single acetylation at one of K4, K9, K14, or K27 of H3, or to histone H4 multi-acetylated between K5 and K16. Crystal structures of AF9-YEATS in complex with an H4 peptide diacetylated either at K5/K8 or K8/K12 revealed that the aromatic cage of the YEATS domain recognized the acetylated K8 residue. Interestingly, E57 and D103 of AF9, both located outside of the aromatic cage, were shown to interact with acetylated K5 and K12 of H4, respectively, consistent with the increase in AF9-YEATS binding to the H4K8-acetylated NCP upon additional acetylation at K5 or K12. Finally, we show that a mutation of E57 to alanine in AF9-YEATS reduced the binding affinity for H4 multiacetylated NCPs containing H4K5ac. Our data suggest that the Kac-binding affinity of AF9-YEATS increases additively with the number of Kac in the histone tail."
https://openalex.org/W4283260530,"Los Angeles, California became a warzone of COVID-19 infections with up to one death every 10 minutes at the end of 2020. As resources thinned, and ICU beds and ventilators became scarce, physicians began agonizing over potentially rationing medical care. In this study, we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 7,429 confirmed COVID-19 positive patients from two community hospitals in Los Angeles, California between March 16, 2020 and June 9, 2021. We applied the Cox proportional hazards regression model to determine the risk factors most strongly associated with in-hospital mortality. Using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, there was a higher hazard ratio (HR) for mortality in patients who were older (age ≥60 years) [HR 2.189, 95% CI 1.991-2.407, p<0.001], had low triage oxygenation < 90% [HR 1.439, 95% CI 1.339-1.546, p<0.001], had chronic kidney disease (CKD) [HR 1.348, 95% CI 1.234-1.496, p = 0.001)], and who were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2) [HR 1.221, 95% CI 1.155-1.340, p = 0.003)]. Overall, our study concluded that age ≥ 60 years, low triage oxygenation less than 90%, chronic kidney disease, and obesity were the top patient characteristics associated with increased mortality for both the univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analyses. Furthermore, by separating our data set into a development and validation set, we created a novel prediction tool to forecast in-hospital mortality and achieved 86% accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4283267303,"Taking data of tourism attractions in international cultural tourism demonstration region in South Anhui in China, this study summarized the distribution characteristics of tourism attractions in region by applying GIS spatial analysis method such as nearest neighbor distance index and kernel density estimation method, and explored how natural conditions, urban infrastructure, social and economic development affect the distribution in order to better understand the distribution of regional tourism resources and serve the direction of tourism development. The study found that the tourist attractions in the demonstration area have a significant agglomeration on the whole, with Huangshan City as the main center and other districts and counties as the sub centers, presenting the trend of hierarchical development. In different kinds of tourism attractions, the distribution of natural tourism attractions and rural pastoral tourism attractions highly related to the topography. And the distribution of modern recreational tourism attractions and humanistic tourism attractions is closely related to hydrology. In terms of urban infrastructure, modern recreational tourism attractions hold the best accessibility with transportation. The core area of the demonstration region include Huangshan City, Chizhou city and Xuancheng city has better tourist industry development. Tourist attractions in other areas are relatively scarce, but the hold great potential for development in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4283268015,"Adolescence is a complicated, full of challenges and explorations period in life on the way to adulthood. The behaviour of adolescents is considerably re-configuring under the pressure of biological, psychological, and social transformations, and the internalization of community rules and values, as well as the adoption of desirable behaviours, is not always easy or successful. During adolescence, anomie can easily become an attractive status quo , but it can also evolve, however, relatively easy, to delinquency. This exploratory study, part of the Planet Youth project, is based on an analysis of 17 items from a questionnaire applied to a sample of 2,694 young people in Bucharest, Romania, in 2018, high schoolers in grades 9–11. The main objective of this approach was to assess the impact of some socio-cultural factors regarding school, family, peer group, and neighbourhood on the adoption of deviant and delinquent behaviours among Bucharest teenagers. For data analysis, two dependent variables were built by aggregating items in the questionnaire: the level of anomie (composed of 8 items) and deviant behaviour (composed of 17 items). As independent variables, 17 predictors composed from 67 questions from the questionnaire were used. The main results reflect a high level of anomie among the adolescents of Bucharest and a low level of deviance, and a weak link between these two variables. On the other hand, adolescent anomie and deviance are favoured by anger management, perceived peer attitudes to substance use and digital leisure, together with low parental surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W4283384414,"The phenomenon of “publish-or-perish” in academia, spurred on by limited funding and academic positions, has led to increased competition and pressure on academics to publish. Publication pressure has been linked with multiple negative outcomes, including increased academic misconduct and researcher burnout. COVID-19 has disrupted research worldwide, leading to lost research time and increased anxiety amongst researchers. The objective of this study was to examine how COVID-19 has impacted perceived publication pressure amongst academic researchers in Canada. We used the revised Publication Pressure Questionnaire, in addition to Likert-type questions to discern respondents’ beliefs and concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on academic publishing. We found that publication pressure increased across academic researchers in Canada following the pandemic, with respondents reporting increased stress, increased pessimism, and decreased access to support related to publishing. Doctoral students reported the highest levels of stress and pessimism, while principal investigators had the most access to publication support. There were no significant differences in publication pressure reported between different research disciplines. Women and non-binary or genderfluid respondents reported higher stress and pessimism than men. We also identified differences in perceived publication pressure based on respondents’ publication frequency and other demographic factors, including disability and citizenship status. Overall, we document a snapshot of perceived publication pressure in Canada across researchers of different academic career stages and disciplines. This information can be used to guide the creation of researcher supports, as well as identify groups of researchers who may benefit from targeted resources."
https://openalex.org/W4283398936,"The main aim of this study was to compare the effects of ankle plantar flexors fatigue on postural control between healthy young adult males and females. The secondary aim was to determine the effects of vision on the fatigue-induced postural changes. Ten healthy young males and nine females were asked to perform quiet standing (QS) and standing forward lean (FL) tasks with eyes open (EO) and closed (EC) before and immediately following exercise, and throughout a 15-min recovery period. A sustained isometric exercise of ankle plantar flexors was performed until participants were no longer able to maintain a target torque of 50% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). Mean anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) positions of the center of pressure (COP), mean COP sway velocity, and 95% ellipse area of COP sway were measured. Ankle plantar flexors fatigue had significant effects on all dependent variables, except for sway area. A fatigue X sex interaction was found for sway velocity with the most challenging task condition (FL-EC), where males showed a significant increase in sway velocity up to 15 min following exercise, whereas females did not. Fatigue X vision interactions for AP position were also found, with the withdrawal of vision leading to a greater backward shift during recovery for both the QS (5 to 15 min) and FL (5 to 10 min) tasks. Our findings suggest the use of different postural control strategies with ankle fatigue between males and females, and also a contribution of vision to compensate for fatigue-induced instability that is not dependent on task difficulty."
https://openalex.org/W4283160383,"Remdesivir and molnupiravir have gained considerable interest because of their demonstrated activity against SARS-CoV-2. These antivirals are converted intracellularly to their active triphosphate forms remdesivir-TP and molnupiravir-TP. Cellular hydrolysis of these active metabolites would consequently decrease the efficiency of these drugs; however, whether endogenous enzymes that can catalyze this hydrolysis exist is unknown. Here, we tested remdesivir-TP as a substrate against a panel of human hydrolases and found that only Nudix hydrolase (NUDT) 18 catalyzed the hydrolysis of remdesivir-TP with notable activity. The kcat/Km value of NUDT18 for remdesivir-TP was determined to be 17,700 s−1M−1, suggesting that NUDT18-catalyzed hydrolysis of remdesivir-TP may occur in cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that the triphosphates of the antivirals ribavirin and molnupiravir are also hydrolyzed by NUDT18, albeit with lower efficiency than Remdesivir-TP. Low activity was also observed with the triphosphate forms of sofosbuvir and aciclovir. This is the first report showing that NUDT18 hydrolyzes triphosphates of nucleoside analogs of exogenous origin, suggesting that NUDT18 can act as a cellular sanitizer of modified nucleotides and may influence the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir, molnupiravir, and ribavirin. As NUDT18 is expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, it may limit the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir and molnupiravir against SARS-CoV-2 replication by decreasing the intracellular concentration of their active metabolites at their intended site of action.

The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with its fast worldwide spread and high mortality rate led to put major efforts to repurpose already approved antiviral drugs in order to quickly control the outbreak and thereby save lives. Remdesivir (GS-5734) was originally developed for the treatment of Ebola but is a broad-acting antiviral which has been found to reduce the replication of coronaviruses both in cell culture and animal models (1de Wit E. Feldmann F. Cronin J. Jordan R. Okumura A. Thomas T. et al.Prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir (GS-5734) treatment in the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 6771-6776Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Remdesivir treatment was shown to decrease the severity of disease after MERS-CoV infection via decreasing virus replication and thereby reducing damage to the lungs when administered both before and after infection in a rhesus macaque model (1de Wit E.

Remdesivir was shown to shorten the recovery time of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 as well as reducing the mortality rate (2Beigel J.H. Tomashek K.M. Dodd L.E. Mehta A.K. Zingman B.S.

Remdesivir is a prodrug in the form of a protected phosphate that upon cell entry (Fig. 1, step 1) is metabolized by cellular enzymes to the corresponding monophosphate (GS-441524, Fig. 1, step 2). The monophosphate is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to its active triphosphate form (remdesivir-TP, aka GS-443902, Fig. 1, step 3). The antiviral effect of remdesivir-TP is mediated through its incorporation into the growing virus RNA chain by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Fig. 1, step 4). Incorporation of the remdesivir metabolite causes the polymerase to stall and RNA replication to be terminated (Fig. 1, step 5), leading to a decrease in the production of viral RNA (7Agostini M.L.

Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801) was, in November 2021, given a temporary authorization by the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults at risk for severe disease and one month later, an emergency use authorization was issued by the Food and Drug Administration agency. Administration of this orally active drug led to a clear reduction of SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as a quicker recovery time (9Fischer W. Eron J. Holman W. Cohen M.S. Fang L.

The incorporation of β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine triphosphate, hereafter called molnupiravir-TP, by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase into viral RNA causes a drastic increase in the mutation frequency, resulting in a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 replication (14Kabinger F.

Ribavirin has, since the 1970s, been known to act as a broad-spectrum antiviral for both DNA and RNA viruses (15Sidwell R.W. Huffman J.H. Khare G.P. Allen L.B. Witkowski J.T. Robins R.K.

It has been used in combination with Interferon-α–based therapy to treat hepatitis C (16Reichard O. Norkrans G. Fryden A. Braconier J.H. Sonnerborg A. Weiland O.

Ribavirin in combination with Interferon-β was shown to synergistically inhibit SARS-associated coronavirus replication in animal and human cell lines (21Morgenstern B. Michaelis M. Baer P.C. Doerr H.W. Cinatl J. Ribavirin and interferon-beta synergistically inhibit SARS-associated coronavirus replication in animal and human cell lines.Biochem. Biophys Res. Commun. 2005; 326: 905-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggesting that ribavirin could be a potential treatment option for SARS-CoV-2. The precise mode of action of ribavirin is not completely understood and its metabolites have been suggested to target several processes, of which the antiviral impact may depend on their intracellular concentrations (22Nystrom K. Wanrooij P.H. Waldenstrom J. Adamek L. Brunet S. Said J. et al.Inosine triphosphate Pyrophosphatase dephosphorylates ribavirin triphosphate and reduced enzymatic activity Potentiates mutagenesis in hepatitis C virus.J. Virol. 2018; 92e01087-18Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, it is known that ribavirin-MP inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, leading to GTP depletion with effects on many cellular processes. Ribavirin-TP has been hypothesized to directly inhibit viral RNA-dependent polymerase and may at higher concentrations, also cause mutations in the viral genome. Ribavirin-TP is hydrolyzed by the inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase), and patients carrying alleles encoding low activity ITPase variants display a reduced risk of hepatitis C relapse, suggesting that these patients have higher concentrations of the active ribavirin metabolite. Furthermore, low activity ITPase alleles have been shown to protect against anemia acquired upon INF-α and ribavirin therapy (22Nystrom K. Wanrooij P.H. Waldenstrom J. Adamek L. Brunet S.

The ITPase activity–dependent outcome of ribavirin treatment strongly emphasizes the impact of cellular metabolism on drug efficacy. Similar to ITPase, several NUDIX enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of modified nucleoside triphosphates (24Jemth A.S. Gustafsson R. Brautigam L. Henriksson L. Vallin K.S.A. Sarno A. et al.MutT homologue 1 (MTH1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of mutagenic O6-methyl-dGTP.Nucl. Acids Res. 2018; 46: 10888-10904PubMed Google Scholar, 25Scaletti E.R. Vallin K.S. Brautigam L.

Hagenkort A. Page B.D. Masuyer G. Rehling D.

Rehling D. Jemth A.S. Throup A. Landazuri N. Almlof I. et al.NUDT15-mediated hydrolysis limits the efficacy of anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir.Cell Chem. Biol. 2021; 28: 1693-1702.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An example is Nudix hydrolase (NUDT) 15, which we recently reported catalyzes the hydrolysis of ganciclovir-TP (27Zhang S.M. Rehling D. Jemth A.S. Throup A. Landazuri N. Almlof I. et al.NUDT15-mediated hydrolysis limits the efficacy of anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir.Cell Chem. Biol. 2021; 28: 1693-1702.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar way, hydrolysis of remdesivir-TP into remdesivir-MP, catalyzed by a human nucleotide hydrolase (Fig. 1, Step 6), would reduce the cellular concentration of the active metabolite. Moreover, conversion of remdesivir-MP to the corresponding nucleoside through the action of 5′-nucleotidase would enable its transport out of the cell (Fig. 1, Step 7) and further decrease the antiviral potency of remdesivir. In order to investigate if such a hydrolase could be found within the NUDIX family of enzymes, we tested remdesivir-TP as a substrate for a panel of human NUDIX hydrolases and found that NUDT18 catalyzed the hydrolysis of remdesivir-TP. Encouraged by this, we tested NUDT18 for activity toward several antiviral triphosphates and found NUDT18 to also be an efficient catalyst of ribavirin-TP and molnupiravir-TP hydrolysis. NUDT18 has, to date, only been described to display activity toward 8-oxo-dGDP and has therefore been suggested to cleanse the nucleotide pool from oxidatively damaged nucleotides, preventing their incorporation into DNA (28Takagi Y. Setoyama D. Ito R. Kamiya H. Yamagata Y. Sekiguchi M. Human MTH3 (NUDT18) protein hydrolyzes oxidized forms of guanosine and deoxyguanosine diphosphates: comparison with MTH1 and MTH2.J. Biol.

The roles of human MTH1, MTH2 and MTH3 proteins in maintaining genome stability under oxidative stress.Mutat. Res. 2018; 808: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The results of this study suggest that NUDT18 acts as a cellular sanitizer in a broader sense and contributes to removing modified nucleotides of both endogenous and exogenous origin and potentially modulates the efficiency of the antiviral drugs remdesivir, molnupiravir, and ribavirin. In order to investigate if human NUDIX enzymes can modulate the cellular concentration of the active metabolite of remdesivir and thereby reduce its efficacy as an antiviral drug, we tested human MutT Homolog 1 (MTH1), NUDT5, NUDT9, NUDT15, and NUDT18 for hydrolysis activity with remdesivir-TP. This selection of NUDIX enzymes was chosen based on previous observations showing that MTH1, NUDT15, and NUDT18 have the capacity to hydrolyze nucleotide triphosphates or diphosphates (30Carreras-Puigvert J. Zitnik M. Jemth A.-S. Carter M. Unterlass J.E. Hallström B. et al.A comprehensive structural, biochemical and biological profiling of the human NUDIX hydrolase family.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). NUDT5 and NUDT9, which are the most closely related NUDIX enzymes to the NUDIX enzyme subgroup to which MTH1, NUDT15, and NUDT18 belong, catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphate sugars (30Carreras-Puigvert J. Zitnik M. Jemth A.-S. Carter M. Unterlass J.E. Hallström B. et al.A comprehensive structural, biochemical and biological profiling of the human NUDIX hydrolase family.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and were added to the panel as NUDIX enzyme controls to assess NUDIX enzyme selectivity toward remdesivir-TP. Among these NUDIX hydrolases, only NUDT18 was found to catalyze the hydrolysis of remdesivir-TP (Fig. 2A). NUDT18 was shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of both the bonds between the α- and β-phosphate groups, generating PPi, as well as the bonds between the β- and γ-phosphate groups, generating Pi (Fig. 2, A and B). This was evidenced by an increase in the amount of Pi formed in the presence of pyrophosphatase (PPase), which hydrolyzes PPi. Of note, no general 5′-nucleotidase or PPase activity is present in the NUDT18 preparation used (30Carreras-Puigvert J. Zitnik M. Jemth A.-S. Carter M. Unterlass J.E. Hallström B. et al.A comprehensive structural, biochemical and biological profiling of the human NUDIX hydrolase family.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Based on the described activity of ITPase with ribavirin-TP, which constitutes one of the active metabolites of the antiviral ribavirin, we argued that ITPase may also hydrolyze other antiviral triphosphates. We therefore tested human ITPase as well as the human hydrolases dCTPase and dUTPase for activity with remdesivir-TP. Human dCTPase displayed low but measurable activity with remdesivir-TP while no activity was detected with dUTPase or ITPase (Fig. 2C). Comparison with NUDT18 activity toward 8-oxo-dGDP showed an approximately 2-fold higher specific activity than remdesivir-TP at 100 μM substrate concentration (Fig. 2C). The observed activity of NUDT18 with remdesivir-TP prompted us to test other antiviral triphosphates as substrates for NUDT18. We found that ribavirin-TP is also hydrolyzed by NUDT18, albeit not to the same extent as remdesivir-TP (Fig. 3A). Similar to remdesivir-TP, NUDT18-catalyzed ribavirin-TP hydrolysis results in the production of both ribavirin diphosphate and monophosphate, as shown by an increase in the signal when PPase was included in the assay buffer (Fig. 3A). NUDT18 was also shown to hydrolyze molnupiravir-TP. As evidenced by a 5-fold higher production of Pi in the presence of PPase (Fig. 3B), molnupiravir-TP hydrolysis of the bond between the α- and β-phosphate groups appears to be preferred. In addition, NUDT15, previously shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of ganciclovir-TP (27Zhang S.M. Rehling D. Jemth A.S. Throup A. Landazuri N. Almlof I. et al.NUDT15-mediated hydrolysis limits the efficacy of anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir.Cell Chem. Biol. 2021; 28: 1693-1702.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was found to catalyze the hydrolysis of molnupiravir-TP producing pyrophosphate, albeit with considerably lower efficiency than NUDT18, while MTH1 did not display any detectable activity with this substrate (Fig. 3B). To investigate the activity of NUDT18 with these substrates in more detail and for comparison with 8-oxo-dGDP, we performed kinetic analyses of the NUDT18-catalyzed hydrolysis of remdesivir-TP, ribavirin-TP, and molnupiravir-TP. Enzyme activities were assayed under identical conditions and enzyme saturation curves using these substrates were produced (Fig. 4, A–D) and kinetic parameters were determined (Table 1). The Km value for NUDT18 was determined to be 16.5 μM for 8-oxo-dGDP, which is in agreement with a previously published Km value of 12 μM (28Takagi Y. Setoyama D. Ito R. Kamiya H. Yamagata Y. Sekiguchi M. Human MTH3 (NUDT18) protein hydrolyzes oxidized forms of guanosine and deoxyguanosine diphosphates: comparison with MTH1 and MTH2.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 21541-21549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The kcat value for 8-oxo-dGDP at 22 °C was determined to be 1.8 s−1 and the calculated kcat/Km value was 109,800 M−1s−1. The Km value for remdesivir-TP was determined to be 156 μM (n = 2) and the kcat value was 2.6 s−1 resulting in a kcat/Km value of 17,700 M−1s−1. The approximately 6-fold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km value) of NUDT18 for 8-oxo-dGDP means that 8-oxo-dGDP would be the preferred substrate over remdesivir-TP at the same concentration. However, the cellular remdesivir-TP concentration is likely in the order of 1000-fold higher than the concentration of 8-oxo-dGDP based on an estimation of the intracellular 8-oxo-dGTP concentration of 2 nM in U2OS cells (31Ting Wang J.F. Schwartz Karen Fan Peidong Ports Michael O. Kashishian Adam Notte Gregory T. et al.Direct measurement of the intracellular concentration of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate by LC-MS/MS.J. Bioanal. Biomed. 2020; https://doi.org/10.37421/Jbabm.2020.12.237Crossref Google Scholar), and the assumption that the cellular concentration of 8-oxo-dGDP is likely in a similar range or lower. This suggests that the activity of NUDT18 with remdesivir-TP may be of relevance for modulating the remdesivir-TP concentration in cells. The maximal plasma concentration of remdesivir in humans after treatment with a dose of 225 mg was reported to be around 7 μM and the concentration of remdesivir-TP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined to be 6 μM after administration of 150 mg remdesivir (32Tempestilli M. Caputi P. Avataneo V. Notari S. Forini O. Scorzolini L. et al.Pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and GS-441524 in two critically ill patients who recovered from COVID-19.J. Antimicrob.

Chng E. et al.Safety, tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of remdesivir, an antiviral for treatment of COVID-19, in healthy subjects.Clin. Transl. Sci. 2020; 13: 896-906PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of remdesivir-TP in cells seems to be higher than the remdesivir concentration in plasma, presumably due to the triphosphate formed in the cell not being cell membrane permeable. By applying the rule of thumb stating that an increase in temperature by 10 °C doubles the reaction rate, the catalytic efficiency of NUDT18 at 37 °C is estimated to be around 53,000 M−1s−1. Assuming a concentration of remdesivir-TP in the cell of 10 μM means that approximately one remdesivir triphosphate molecule will be turned over per NUDT18 enzyme every 2 sec, further supporting that remdesivir-TP is hydrolyzed by NUDT18 in the cell.Figure 4Kinetic analysis of NUDT18 with triphosphates of antiviral drugs.

When comparing remdesivir-TP, ribavirin-TP, and molnupiravir-TP as substrates for NUDT18, remdesivir-TP appears to be the preferred substrate. NUDT18 displays a kcat value for ribavirin-TP hydrolysis that is approximately 1 s−1 and a Km value of 111 μM, resulting in a catalytic efficiency value of 8800 s−1M−1, which is approximately half of the corresponding value for remdesivir-TP (Table 1). The catalytic efficiency of NUDT18 for molnupiravir-TP was determined to 8800 s−1M−1, which is very close to the corresponding value for ribavirin-TP. However, both the Km value (57 μM) and turnover number (0.49 s−1) are approximately 2-fold lower for molnupiravir-TP. Comparison of the kinetic parameters of remdesivir-TP and ribavirin-TP with those of 8-oxo-dGDP shows that the difference primarily lies in the Km value, suggesting a better fit of 8-oxo-dGDP in the active site of NUDT18. In order to investigate if NUDT18 can catalyze the hydrolysis of other antiviral triphosphates, we expanded the substrate screen of NUDT18 and found that sofosbuvir-TP, aciclovir-TP, ganciclovir-TP, as well as gemcitabine-TP are hydrolyzed by NUDT18 to some extent. Similar to the NUDT18-catalyzed hydrolysis of remdesivir-TP and ribavirin-TP, hydrolysis takes place at both the β–γ and the α–β phosphate bonds in these substrates with approximately 50% of the hydrolysis taking place at each of these positions (Fig. 4E). However, kinetic analysis revealed that the activity with aciclovir-TP, the best substrate in this panel, is much lower than the activity with remdesivir-TP, with a kcat/Km value approximately 5 times lower (Fig. 4, F and G). However, the kcat/Km value was 2.2 times higher than the corresponding kcat/Km value for dGTP. The fact that aciclovir contains a guanine moiety–like dGTP indicates that the higher activity of NUDT18 with aciclovir-TP than dGTP lies in NUDT18, being able to better accommodate the nucleobase and the modified sugar part of aciclovir-TP in the active site. This in turn enables a more productive positioning of the phosphate groups for hydrolysis. This is reflected by a 2.6 times higher turnover number (kcat) for aciclovir-TP than that of dGTP, while the Km values are comparable (Fig. 4F). However, whether the activity of NUDT18 with these antiviral triphosphates bears clinical relevance for modulating the potency of these antivirals needs further investigation. Remdesivir-TP contains a nitrile group on the C1 atom of th"
https://openalex.org/W4283258960,"Tourism and outdoor leisure is an important economic sector for many countries, and has a substantial reliance on natural capital. Natural capital may be the primary purpose for tourism, or it may be a secondary factor, where the choice of location for a leisure activity is influenced by natural capital. Typically, when valuing tourism and outdoor leisure, all expenditure associated with the activity is assigned to the ecosystem it occurs in. However, this value illustrates the dependency on natural capital, rather than the contribution of natural capital. In natural capital accounting, a major challenge is to separately identify the contribution of natural capital from that of other forms of capital. In this study we develop a transparent and repeatable method that is able to attribute the contribution of natural capital (here defined as ecosystems) to the output of multiple tourism and outdoor leisure activities. Using national statistics from Great Britain, we calculate the natural capital contribution to tourism spend by activity at a national and regional scale, and for a case study map and value the contributing ecosystems. We estimated that, out of a total £36 billion spent on tourism and leisure activities in 2017, £22.5 billion was attributable to natural capital. This equates to 0.9% of the UK GDP. The Gross Value Added component of this attributable was £10.5 billion, equivalent to 0.4% of the UK GDP. Regions with the highest natural capital contribution in Great Britain were Scotland and Wales, with the lowest being Greater London and the West Midlands in England. For the case study, the ecosystems with the greatest contribution to terrestrial activities were marine and enclosed farmland. These methods can be applied worldwide for anywhere with aggregate economic statistics on expenditure associated with tourism and outdoor leisure, with the aid of open source GIS datasets."
https://openalex.org/W4283259975,"Sarcopenic obesity is a condition characterised by the coexistence of low muscle mass and function (sarcopenia) and excessive fat mass (obesity). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of this condition in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery by gender and type of orthopaedic surgery. In addition, this study investigated the suitability of a waist circumference-based anthropometric measure, body shape index (ABSI), for predicting sarcopenic obesity and the predictive power of ABSI for fat-free mass index (FFMI), a surrogate marker of lean body mass.A cross-sectional study of overweight and obese orthopaedic patients undergoing knee or hip and spine surgery was conducted between October 2019 and March 2020 in Orthopaedic Hospital Valdoltra, Slovenia. General anthropometric parameters body mass index (BMI) and ABSI = (WC/(BMI2/3x height½) as well as body composition data (fat mass FM, fat-free mass FFM, FFMI, and the ratio FM/FFM as an index of sarcopenic obesity) were determined in 120 women (aged 66.5 ± 9.6 years) and 89 men (aged 65.5 ± 7.8 years) with overweight (25 kg/m2 ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Sarcopenic obesity phenotypes based on FM/FFM ratio > 0.80 was present in 15.3% of patients, mainly in female patients undergoing knee surgery. ABSI was significantly associated with age in all women and obese men and with waist circumference (WC) in all patients. ABSI did not correlate with BMI in women and men; however, multiple linear regression analysis showed that BMI independently predicted FFMI (R = 0.83 and 0.70, respectively, p < 0.001) in women and men (β-coefficients: 0.801 and 0.686, respectively) and ABSI in women only (β-coefficient: -0.104). Women with a lower ABSI had a significantly higher FFMI than the group with a higher ABSI.Sarcopenic obesity was most prevalent in obese women scheduled for knee surgery. In addition, ABSI, independently predicted FFMI in women and represents a significant predictor of sarcopenic obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4283265607,"This study analyses the bycatch composition of an artisanal shrimp trawl fleet operating between Cabo Blanco and Máncora in Northern Peru between April 2019 and March 2020. A total of 300 hauls were analysed with respect to target catch and bycatch (consisting of other commercial species, discards, and macroalgae). A total of 277 species were recorded including 111 species of fish, 65 species of molluscs, 51 species of crustaceans, 22 species of algae, 12 species of cnidarian, 9 species of echinoderms, 4 species of Bryozoa and 3 species of polychaeta. Capture per unit effort (CPUE, kg.h-1) was highest for fish, followed by crustaceans, algae and molluscs. The target species Penaeus californiensis coffee shrimp constituted 17.8% of the overall catch,82.2% represented bycatch, and 50.6% represented discards. Coffee shrimps were more abundant in June and November 2019 and in January and February 2020. Highest bycatch CPUE occurred in May, June and December 2019. The most abundant species in the bycatch throughout the study period were sand perch (Diplectrum conceptione, 16% weight of the total catch), the macroalgae caulerpa (Caulerpa filiformis, 13%), sole flounder (Etropus ectenes, 6.4%), Pacific drum (Larimus pacificus, 5.7%), and lumptail searobin (Prionotus stephanophrys, 5.1%). Overall, the contribution of sand perch and flounder, exceeded the weight of coffee shrimp, therefore the interpretation that shrimp is the sole target species needs to be revised. The number of discarded species per month increased towards the spring months with the highest value in November. This study represents the first characterisation of bycatch in the artisanal trawling fishery in the Piura region in northern Peru and reveals a high proportion of bycatch in the fishery but also hints at potential temporal management measures that could be imposed to reduce the levels of bycatch. For example, the months of May and December had the greatest bycatch to shrimp ratios and the fishery could potentially be closed to avoid high bycatch risk, however, longer term information is needed to assess if the trends observed in bycatch are similar over longer periods of time. The species characterisation of bycatch also provides information for the design of modified nets which would target the reduction of small fish present in the catch."

To ensure successful and socially acceptable implementation of this final disposal process, it is essential to have a good understanding of what is considered important by the public. We used a choice-based conjoint analysis in the form of a web-based questionnaire to examine the relative importance of several factors in the choice of the final disposal sites of the removed soil and incinerated ash of the wastes. The questionnaires covered four attributes and 12 levels, namely the distance between the disposal site and a person's residential area, procedural fairness (decision process), distributive fairness (direct mitigation of inequity through multiple siting locations), and the volume and radioactivity of the substances to be disposed. Responses were received from 4000 people nationwide, excluding Fukushima residents. The results showed that the respondents gave high importance to choosing sites that were far from residential areas and to the two types of fairness, especially distributive fairness. The respondents showed no preference for the volume and radioactivity. This indicates that the public cares about the fairness of the siting for the final disposal sites and feels uncomfortable with plans for a final disposal site located close to them. Distributive fairness is necessary to pursue consensus in addition to procedural fairness."
https://openalex.org/W4283272327,"Introduction Prevalence of tobacco smoking among adults in substance misuse treatment is much higher than the wider population, yet limited research is available, and residential treatment services have been overlooked as a potential setting for cessation interventions. Exploring the perceptions of service users about smoking cessation in residential rehabilitation is important to gain better understanding of this issue and identify ways to inform future intervention development. Methods Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted in the Northwest of England in 2017 with adults (7 male, 3 female) who were currently or had previously been in residential treatment for substance misuse. Five participants were current smokers, three had never smoked, and two were former smokers. Participants were asked about their smoking behaviours, factors relating to smoking and smoking cessation and the relationship between smoking and substance use. All interviews were transcribed and data was analysed thematically. Results Study findings highlighted a general consensus amongst participants that residential treatment services offered an ideal opportunity for cessation but there were concerns that doing so might jeopardise recovery. Smoking in substance use treatment services is still the norm and factors such as perceived social and psychological benefits, normative behaviours and lack of perceived risk or prioritisation pose challenges for implementing smoking cessation within this setting, although facilitators such as motivation to change and appropriateness of the setting were also identified. Conclusions This study suggests that service users perceive residential treatment services as suitable environments to introduce smoking cessation. To address the needs of adults who smoke and are in recovery from substance use, further research and cooperation from treatment organisations is needed to integrate substance misuse and smoking cessation services. More conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of tackling both issues at the same time is also required."
https://openalex.org/W4283272932,"Ethiopia is frequently identified as a country that is highly vulnerable to climate variability and change. The study was aimed to examine agro-ecological based smallholder farmers' livelihood vulnerability to climate variability and change in Oromo Nationality Administration (ONA), North East Ethiopia. Data were collected from a survey of 335 sampled households, focus group discussion, and interview from three different agro-ecologies in the study area and secondary sources. Count, percentage, mean, standard deviation, Chi-square test (test of independence), ANOVA, Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and LVI-IPCC were used for analysis. LVI and LVI-IPCC results revealed that Kolla is the most vulnerable (0.18) because of its highest exposure (0.74) and sensitivity (0.71) values and lowest adaptive capacity (0.49) while Daga is least vulnerable (0.08) because of its lowest exposure (0.61) and sensitivity (0.42). Overall, results suggest that the two methods resulted in similar degrees of vulnerability and identified Kolla agro-ecological zone as the most vulnerable while the Dega agro-ecological zone is the least vulnerable of the three agro-ecological zones. The researchers conclude that development strategies and plans should be prepared considering local-specific issues and/or situation."

Ultrasound scans with normal nuchal translucency were used as controls. The dataset was partitioned with 75% of images used for model training and 25% used for model validation. Images were analyzed using a DenseNet model and the accuracy of the trained model to correctly identify cases of cystic hygroma was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Gradient class activation heat maps (Grad-CAM) were generated to assess model interpretability.The dataset included 289 sagittal fetal ultrasound images;129 cystic hygroma cases and 160 normal NT controls. Overall model accuracy was 93% (95% CI: 88-98%), sensitivity 92% (95% CI: 79-100%), specificity 94% (95% CI: 91-96%), and the area under the ROC curve 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89-1.0). Grad-CAM heat maps demonstrated that the model predictions were driven primarily by the fetal posterior cervical area.Our findings demonstrate that deep-learning algorithms can achieve high accuracy in diagnostic interpretation of cystic hygroma in the first trimester, validated against expert clinical assessment."
https://openalex.org/W4283389110,"Chapman's Love Languages hypothesis claims that (1) people vary in the ways they prefer to receive and express affection and (2) romantic partners who communicate their feelings congruent with their partner's preferences experience greater relationship quality. The author proposes five distinct preferences and tendencies for expressing love, including: Acts of Service, Physical Touch, Words of Affirmation, Quality Time and Gifts. In the present study partners (N = 100 heterosexual couples) completed measures assessing their preferences and behavioral tendencies for a) expressions of love and b) reception of signs of affection, for each of the five proposed ""love languages"". Relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction and empathy were also assessed. The degree of the within-couple mismatch was calculated separately for each individual based on the discrepancies between the person's felt (preferred) and their partner's expressed love language. The joint mismatch indicator was a sum of discrepancies across the five love languages. Matching on love languages was associated with both relationship and sexual satisfaction. In particular, people who expressed their affection in the way their partners preferred to receive it, experienced greater satisfaction with their relationships and were more sexually satisfied compared to those who met their partner's needs to lesser extent. Empathy was expected to be a critical factor for better understanding of and responding to the partner's needs. Results provided some support for this hypothesis among male but not female participants."

https://openalex.org/W4283397695,"Although grit is predictive of wellbeing, educational achievement, and success in life, it has been conceptualized as largely distinct from cognitive ability. The present study investigated the link between grit and executive functions since regulation abilities might underlie the expression of grit. A hundred thirty-four people were administered personality questionnaires (grit, impulsiveness, and mindfulness) and four experimental tasks tapping into Miyake’s and Braver’s models of executive functioning (including measures of flexibility, inhibition, working memory, and control mode dimensions). Multivariate analyses showed that two composite scores (trait and executive functioning) were reliably predictive of grit, although it was the trait composite (characterized by low impulsivity and high mindfulness) that explained more variance. Importantly, gritty participants did not demonstrate enhanced executive functioning. Instead, they exhibited a different pattern of performance that might be reflecting a cautious profile of control, characterized by paying attention to all available information, less reliance on previous contextual cues but sensitive to conflicting information of the current context. These findings converge with Duckworth’s idea that high grit people do not necessarily have a greater cognitive capacity. Rather, they use it in a different way."
https://openalex.org/W4283261629,"Drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are necessary to successfully mitigate climate change. Individual environmental behavior is central to this change. Given that environmental behavior necessitates 1) effortful individual self-control and 2) cooperation by others, public policy may constitute an attractive instrument for regulating one’s own as well as others’ environmental behavior. Framing climate change mitigation as a cooperative self-control problem, we explore the incremental predictive power of self-control and beliefs surrounding others’ cooperation beyond established predictors of policy support in study 1 using machine-learning ( N = 610). In study 2, we systematically test and confirm the effects of self-control and beliefs surrounding others’ cooperation ( N = 270). Both studies showed that personal importance of climate change mitigation and perceived insufficiency of others’ environmental behavior predict policy support, while there was no strong evidence for a negative association between own-self control success and policy support. These results emerge beyond the effects of established predictors, such as environmental attitudes and beliefs, risk perception (study 1), and social norms (study 2). Results are discussed in terms of leveraging policy as a behavioral enactment constraint to control others’ but not own environmental behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4283261961,"The adaptation of living environments can preserve functional independence among older people. A few studies have suggested that this would only benefit the most impaired. But conceptual models theorize that environmental pressure gradually increases with functional decline.We examined (1) how far different environmental barriers increased difficulties and favoured resort to assistance; (2) at what stage in functional decline environmental barriers begin to matter.We used the French cross-sectional survey CARE (2015), including 7,451 participants (60+) with at least one severe functional limitation (FL). Multinomial logistic regressions models were used to compare predicted probabilities for outdoor activities of daily living (OADL) difficulties (no OADL difficulties; difficulties but without assistance; use of assistance) among individuals with and without environmental barriers (self-reported or objective), in relation to the number of FLs.Poor-quality pedestrian areas and lack of places to rest were associated with a higher probability of experiencing OADL difficulties, whatever the number of FLs; the association increased with the number of FLs. Up to 6 FLs, individuals with these barriers were more likely to report difficulties without resorting to assistance, with a decreasing association. Living in cities/towns with high diversity of food outlets was associated with a lower probability of reporting assistance, whatever the number of FLs, but with a decreasing association.Overall, the results suggest that environmental barriers increasingly contribute to OADL difficulties with the number of FLs. Conclusions differed as to whether they tended to favour resort to assistance, but there was a clear association with food outlets, which decreased with impairment severity. The adaptation of living environments could reduce difficulties in performing activities from the early stages of decline to the most severe impairment. However, the most deteriorated functional impairments seem to generate resort to assistance whatever the quality of the environment."

https://openalex.org/W4283272130,"A wealth of research indicates that emotions play an instrumental role in creative problem-solving. However, most of these studies have relied primarily on diary studies and self-report scales when measuring emotions during the creative processes. There has been a need to capture in-the-moment emotional experiences of individuals during the creative process using an automated emotion recognition tool. The experiment in this study examined the process-related difference between the creative problem solving (CPS) and simple problem solving (SPS) processes using protocol analysis and Markov’s chains. Further, this experiment introduced a novel method for measuring in-the-moment emotional experiences of individuals during the CPS and SPS processes using facial expressions and machine learning algorithms. The experiment described in this study employed 64 participants to solve different tasks while wearing camera-mounted headgear. Using retrospective analysis, the participants verbally reported their thoughts using video-stimulated recall. Our results indicate differences in the cognitive efforts spent at different stages during the CPS and SPS processes. We also found that most of the creative stages were associated with ambivalent emotions whereas the stage of block was associated with negative emotions."
https://openalex.org/W4283273099,"The technology of modern power systems is revolutionizing as renewable energy sources are being integrated with electric power grids. In the form of inverters, power electronic converters are becoming an integral part of power systems due to their massive demand for grid integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems. Existing multilevel inverter topologies either require an output filter to get a sinusoidal voltage or generate a higher number of output voltage levels at the expense of many hardware resources. This paper presents a new single-phase 81-level inverter configuration with the name given as 'Modified W-Type Multilevel Inverter'. The proposed inverter configuration uses only eighteen power switches and four DC voltage sources to generate an 81-level output voltage approaching a sinusoidal waveform without an output filter. The general design equations are developed to calculate the number of switches, the number of voltage levels, and the number of DC sources for the proposed configuration. Loss and efficiency analysis is carried out that verifies a good practical efficiency of the proposed inverter configuration during the dynamic operation. A comparative analysis with the existing MLI topologies is also carried out that validates the effectiveness and novelty in reducing parts count and higher number of voltage levels. The proposed topology offers 1.04% total harmonic distortion of the output voltage which is within the benchmarks specified for grid integration without any filter requirements. The proposed inverter configuration is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are validated by the design and development of a hardware prototype."
https://openalex.org/W4283273292,"Considerable confusion and uncertainty persist on the cultural and chronological contexts of Holocene microlithic assemblages reported from South Asia. The paucity of securely dated sites with microlithic remains has compounded the confusion. Evidence from sites securely attributed to the Mesolithic based on a holistic approach (including direct evidence of plant and animal exploitation strategies) is needed to provide a better understanding of Mesolithic lithic tool-kits. This study uses morphometric and statistical methods to assess the nature of the Holocene hunter-gatherer microlithic tools-kit from a radiometrically secured chronological context at Vaharvo Timbo, a recently excavated Mesolithic site in North Gujarat (India). The assemblage is further compared with the nearby contemporary site of Loteshwar to highlight similarities and differences within hunter-gatherer lithic assemblages, understanding which can provide detailed information about subsistence strategies as well as patterns of settlement and mobility. The results show general standardisation between these two sites regarding raw materials and manufacturing technique but variation in the relative abundance of tool types between these two sites, despite their close proximity, indicating diverse strategies of resource exploitation by the Holocene hunter-gatherer groups in western India."
https://openalex.org/W4283275405,"We have examined the impact of changes in modifiable risk factors on CVD mortality in 26 Brazilian states from 2005 to 2017.Data were acquired from the Global Burden of Diseases study (GBD) and official sources of the Brazilian government, totalling 312 state-year observations. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated to determine the number of deaths attributed to changes in each risk factor. Fixed-effects multivariable linear regression models were performed, adjusting for income, income inequality, poverty and access to healthcare.Between 2005 and 2017, CVD deaths reduced by 21.42%, accompanied by a decrease in smoking (-33%) and increases in hyperglycaemia (+9.5%), obesity (+31%) and dyslipidaemia (+5.2%). Reduction in smoking prevented or postponed almost 20,000 CVD deaths in this period, while increased hyperglycaemia exposure resulted in more than 6,000 CVD deaths. The association between hyperglycaemia and CVD mortality was 5 to 10 times higher than those found for other risk factors, especially in women (11; 95%CI 7 to 14, deaths per 1-point increase in hyperglycaemia exposure). Importantly, the association between hyperglycaemia and CVD mortality was independent of socioeconomic status and access to healthcare, while associations for other risk factors after the same adjustments.Reduction in smoking was the risk factor that led to the highest number of CVD deaths prevented or postponed, while hyperglycaemia showed the most deleterious association with CVD mortality. Health policies should aim to directly reduce the prevalence of hyperglycaemia to mitigate the population burden of CVD in Brazil in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4283276606,"Purchasing and consumption behaviour is a factor with an important impact on sustainable development. In this regard, the clothing category plays a key role due to the high volume of products that are manufactured in countries with poor environmental and social conditions. While some research has investigated personal, social and cultural conditions that influence these behaviours, little is currently known about the influence of the attributes of sustainable clothing selection on the frequency of sustainable purchase and post-purchase actions in this category. This research seeks to evaluate this effect by comparing the results among genders and age/generation and measuring sustainable consumption using the Young Consumers' Sustainable Consumption Behaviour method, which has two dimensions: purchase choices and sufficient and frugal consumption. Responses to online surveys of 240 university students in Chile are analysed using descriptive statistics, the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test and ologit regressions. The findings show significant differences between the groups analysed with respect to the influence of attributes for sustainable clothing selection and highlight the negative effect of the search for quality in men and in older people. The evidence highlights the need to inform the population about the characteristics of sustainable clothing that positively affect purchase and post-purchase actions such as buying secondhand clothing, repairing, exchanging and donating clothing. This study also suggests that it is important to strengthen the relationship between sustainability and clothing quality among older generations and men."
https://openalex.org/W4283378124,"Fighting has been part of the fabric of the NHL for nearly a century. Recent sharp declines in the frequency of fighting and increased understanding of the long-term consequences of traumatic brain injuries have led many to question whether fighting still has a place in the modern NHL. League commissioner Gary Bettman as recently as 2019 testified before Canadian Parliament that fighting has a deterrent effect, reducing the overall level of violent and dangerous plays within the game. This study empirically examines this claim and tests whether fighting indeed serves as a deterrent to undesirable behaviors in the NHL. I examine data on all regular season penalties from 2010–2019 to determine whether fighting and the threat of fighting is empirically related the level of violence in NHL games. Using a mix of descriptive and quasi-experimental approaches, I find no quantifiable evidence that fighting serves as a deterrent to undesirable violent behaviors in the NHL. To the contrary, I find that teams and players who fight are responsible for a disproportionate amount of the violent penalties that happen across the league. These results have implications for player safety in the many professional—and especially junior—hockey leagues around the world that sanction in-game fighting."
https://openalex.org/W4283387482,"Objective Robust evidence exists for the health-enhancing benefits of social support in adults. Inflammatory processes are thought to be an important mechanism linking social support and health risk. Less is known about the relation between social support and chronic inflammation during childhood and adolescence, or when the association emerges during the lifespan. Method Data from the population-representative 1999 Quebec Child and Adolescent Health and Social (QCAHS) survey were analyzed. Youth aged 9, 13, and 16 years ( N = 3613) and their parents answered questions about social support. A subsample ( n = 2186) completed a fasting blood draw that was assayed for C-reactive protein (CRP). Findings Higher social support was significantly associated with lower hs-CRP log , after controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI Z-score), medication use, puberty, ethnoracial status (French-Canadian), smoking, household income, and parental education ( F = 25.88, p = &lt; .001, Total R 2 adj = 10.2%). The association was largely similar for boys and girls, and strengthened with age. Conclusion Greater social support was linked to lower chronic low-grade inflammation in a large sample of children and adolescents. Effect sizes were small and consistent with prior findings in the adult literature. Importantly, these findings provide evidence that the relation between social support and inflammation emerges early in the lifespan. Future work should consider broader, more encompassing conceptualizations of social support, the role of social media, and prospective trajectories of social support and inflammatory markers."
https://openalex.org/W4283397733,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of experimental data on performance of a developed Bayesian algorithm tailored for orphan source search, estimating which parameters affect the accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm can estimate the position and activity of a gamma-ray point source from experimental mobile gamma spectrometry data. Bayesian estimates were made for source position and activity using mobile gamma spectrometry data obtained from one 123% HPGe detector and two 4-l NaI(Tl) detectors, considering angular variations in counting efficiency for each detector. The data were obtained while driving at 50 km/h speed past the sources using 1 s acquisition interval in the detectors. It was found that deviations in the recorded coordinates of the measurements can potentially increase the uncertainty in the position of the source 2 to 3 times and slightly decrease the activity estimations by about 7%. Due to the various sources of uncertainty affecting the experimental data, the maximum predicted relative deviations of the activity and position of the source remained about 30% regardless of the signal-to-noise ratio of the data. It was also found for the used vehicle speed of 50 km/h and 1 s acquisition time, that if the distance to the source is greater than the distance travelled by the detector during the acquisition time, it is possible to use point approximations of the count-rate function in the Bayesian likelihood with minimal deviations from the integrated estimates of the count-rate function. This approximation reduces the computational demands of the algorithm increasing the potential for applying this method in real-time orphan source search missions."

https://openalex.org/W4283260340,"Excessive rainfall in the soybean preharvest period can make mechanized crop harvesting technically and economically unfeasible, causing 100% losses in soybean grain yield. An alternative to reduce the economic losses of farmers would be using unharvested soybean crop residues as a source of nitrogen (N) for the subsequent corn crop. However, a question that still needs to be understood is whether the amount of N released from unharvested soybean residues (straw and grains) is sufficient to meet all the nutritional demand for this nutrient in the off-season corn. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of unharvested soybean crop residue persistence on the yield response of off-season corn crop (Zea mays L.) to the application of N fertilizer rates when grown in tropical Cerrado soils of medium and high fertility. Four simple corn hybrids (SYN7G17 TL, 30F53VYHR, B2433PWU, and AG 8700 PRO3) were grown in soils of medium fertility and medium acidity level (UFMS 1) and high fertility and low acidity level (UFMS 2) and fertilized with five of N fertilizer rates (0, 40, 80, 120, and 160 kg ha-1 of N) applied at 30 days after emergence (DAE). Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used to investigate the interrelationships between the groups of independent (agricultural production areas, corn cultivars, and N application rates) and dependent (corn agronomic traits) variables. Crop residues remaining on the soil surface from soybeans not harvested and inoculated with Bradyrhizobium spp. can supply most of the nitrogen requirement of off-season corn grown in succession, especially in tropical soils of medium fertility. However, in high-fertility tropical soils, the maximum grain yield potential of off-season corn cultivars can be obtained with the application of mineral N fertilizer in supplement the amount of nitrogen released from unharvested soybean residues. Therefore, the N requirement depends on the corn cultivar and the agricultural production area. However, our results show that when off-season corn is grown on unharvested soybean residues, nitrogen fertilization in topdressing can be dispensed. The agricultural area with high fertility soil (UFMS 2) enhances the grain yield of the off-season corn crop. The corn cultivar AG 8700 PRO3 has a higher thousand-grain mass and high grain yield potential under Brazilian Cerrado conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4283264139,"Objectives While depression and anxiety are common in women and men of reproductive age, preconception interventions to optimize the health of individuals with mental illness before pregnancy is limited and focuses primarily on psychotropic medication management. Comparing individuals with depression, anxiety, and comorbidity to those with neither condition, we identified areas of preconception care optimization related to psychosocial risk factors, general physical health, medication use, and uptake of high-risk health behaviours. We also investigated differences in preconception health care use, attitudes, and knowledge. Method We conducted a nationwide survey of 621 women (n = 529) and men (n = 92) across Canada who were planning a pregnancy within five years, including those with lifetime or current depression (n = 38), anxiety (n = 55), and comorbidity (n = 104) and those without mental illness (n = 413). Individuals with depression, anxiety, and comorbidity were compared to individuals without mental illness using logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, and education level. Results Individuals with a lifetime or current mental illness were significantly more likely to have several risk factors for suboptimal reproductive and perinatal outcomes, including increased rates of obesity, stress, fatigue, loneliness, number of chronic health conditions, and medication use. Further, they were more likely to have high-risk health behaviours including increased substance use, internet addiction, poorer eating habits, and decreased physical activity. By assessing depression, anxiety, or both separately, we also determined there was variation in risk factors by mental illness type. Conclusion Our nationwide study is one of the first and largest to examine the preconception care needs of women and men with a lifetime or current mental illness who are pregnancy-planning. We found this population has many important reproductive and perinatal risk factors that are modifiable via preconception interventions which could have a significant positive impact on their health trajectories and those of their future children."
https://openalex.org/W4283266409,"The aim of this cross-sectional study was to measure the effect of dual tasks on gait stability in ambulant children with cerebral palsy (CP) compared to typically developing (TD) children.The children of the CP (n = 20) and TD groups (n = 20) walked first without a dual task, then while counting forward and finally while alternatively naming fruits and animals (DTf/a). They then completed the same cognitive exercises while sitting comfortably. We calculated the distance between the foot placement estimator (FPE) and the real foot placement in the anterior direction (DFPEAP) and in the mediolateral direction (DFPEML) as a measure of gait stability, in a gait laboratory using an optoelectronic system. Cognitive scores were computed. Comparisons within and between groups were analysed with linear mixed models.The dual task had a significant effect on the CP group in DFPEAP and DFPEML. The CP group was more affected than the TD group during dual task in the DFPEML. Children in both groups showed significant changes in gait stability during dual tasks.The impact of dual task on gait stability is possibly due to the sharing of attention between gait and the cognitive task. All children favoured a 'posture second' strategy during the dual task of alternatively naming animals and fruits. Children with CP increased their mediolateral stability during dual task."
https://openalex.org/W4283267583,"Aims To evaluate provider perspectives on the use of a point-of-care nucleic acid test (POC NAT) and preferential opinions for motivational interviewing (MI) or problem-solving counseling (PSC) as an ultra-brief intervention for patients experiencing challenges to antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. Methods A qualitative study was conducted among providers at an HIV care clinic in Seattle, Washington. Ten in-depth interviews with HIV care providers were completed, which explored determinants of acceptability, feasibility and preferences for a combined adherence counseling and POC NAT intervention for patients living with HIV. Interviews were analyzed through consensus coding and the Five A’s Framework to inform thematic analysis. Results Providers favored the use of a combined adherence counseling technique and POC NAT for their non-adherent patients living with HIV. Providers believed the intervention was an improvement on current assessment and advising practices. However, concerns about extended wait times for the POC NAT results influenced perceptions about feasibility around clinic flow and incorporation into clinic practice. Providers believed that acceptability of POC NAT implementation would be enhanced by including a subset of patient populations whom tend to be in the clinic for longer periods, and in tandem face greater ART adherence challenges. Conclusion The GAIN Study will be the first project to evaluate the implementation of POC NAT in the U.S. Continued formative work is ongoing and may illustrate how best to address feasibility and concern around the two-hour time to result. The planned GAIN study will incorporate some of the findings found in this qualitative study and pilot this intervention, including a time-in-motion analyses of clinic flow, which may help reduce perceived wide-scale adaptation of POC NAT and ART adherence counselling among PLHW. Future work, including a shorter time to results and/or lower limit detection could make a significant improvement in the provision of HIV care."
https://openalex.org/W4283268813,"Mammary epithelial stem cells differentiate to create the basal and luminal layers of the gland. Inducing the number of differentiating bovine mammary stem cells may provide compensating populations for the milk-producing cells that die during lactation. Inhibition of mTOR activity by rapamycin signals self-renewal of intestinal stem cells, with similar consequences in the mouse mammary gland and in bovine mammary implants maintained in mice. The implementation of these results in farm animals for better mammary development and production was studied in 3-month-old calves. mTOR activity decreased by ~50% in mammary epithelial cells subjected to 3-week rapamycin administration, with no negative consequences on mammary morphology or β-casein expression. Subsequently, stem cell self-renewal was induced, reflected by a higher propagation rate of cultures from rapamycin-treated glands compared to respective controls and higher expression of selected markers. Followed by 4-day estrogen and progesterone administration, rapamycin significantly induced proliferation rate. Higher numbers of basal and luminal PCNA + cells were detected in small ducts near the elongating sites as compared to large ducts, in which only luminal cells were affected. Rapamycin administration resulted in induction of individual milk protein genes’ expression, which was negatively correlated to their endogenous levels. The inductive effect of rapamycin on luminal cell number was confirmed in organoid cultures, but milk protein expression decreased, probably due to lack of oscillation in rapamycin levels. In conclusion, intramammary rapamycin administration is an effective methodology to reduce mTOR activity in bovine mammary epithelial cells and consequently, induce stem cell self-renewal. The latent positive effect of rapamycin on epithelial cell proliferation and its potential to improve milk protein expression in calves may have beneficial implications for mature cows."
https://openalex.org/W4283269113,"Improved teamwork and communication have been associated with improved quality of care. Early Warning Scores (EWS) and rapid response algorithms are a way of identifying deteriorating patients and providing a common framework for communication and response between physicians and nurses. The impact of EWS implementation on interprofessional collaboration (IPC) has been minimally studied, especially in resource-limited settings.The study took place in the Pediatric Department of the main academic referral hospital in Rwanda between April 2019 and January 2020. Pediatric nurses and residents were trained on the use of the Pediatric Warning Score for Resource-Limited Settings (PEWS-RL) and a rapid response algorithm. Training included vital sign collection, PEWS-RL calculation, IPC and rapid response algorithm implementation. Prior to training, participants completed surveys on IPC with Likert scale responses (from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree""). Follow-up surveys were then administered nine months later and also included an open-response question on the impact of the PEWS-RL implementation on IPC.Sixty-five (96%) nurses were trained and completed the pre-survey and thirty-seven (54%) of the trained nurses completed the post-survey. Twenty-two (59%) pediatric residents were trained in the workshop and completed the pre-survey and twenty-four physicians (4 pediatricians (40%) and 20 pediatric residents (53%)) completed the post-implementation survey. There was a statistically significant increase in the percent of nurses indicating strong agreement across all domains of communication and collaboration from the pre- to the post-survey. Although the percent of physicians indicating strong agreement increased in the post-survey for all items, only the ""share information"" item was statistically significant.Training and implementation of a PEWS-RL and a rapid response algorithm at a tertiary hospital in Rwanda resulted in significant improvement of nurse and physician ratings of IPC nine months later."

In this paper, we apply LDA, a mainstream topic model, to analyze the risk factor section from SEC filings (10-K and 10-Q), and describe risk structure change over the past two years. The results show that Covid-19 has transformed the risk structures U.S. companies face in the short run, exerting excessive stress on international interactions, operations, and supply chains. However, this shock has been waning since the second quarter of 2020. Our model shows that risk structure change (measured by topic distribution) from Covid-19 is a significant predictor of lower performance, but smaller companies tend to be stricken harder."

The choice between external and internal research and development (R&D) has become a significant challenge for S&T development. To provide scientific suggestions for companies to choose an R&D strategy and enhance S&T development, we analyzed and compared the impacts of two R&D strategies on S&T output.We selected the data related to China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry from 2000 to 2019, established regression equations by the E-G two-step method, and used the VAR model for impulse responses and variance decompositions to research the relationship between two R&D strategies and S&T output.There is a stable long-term equilibrium relationship between two R&D strategies, including external and internal R&D, and S&T output in China's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. When internal R&D increases by 1%, S&T output increases by 0.7382% with a 5-year lag. When S&T output increases by 1%, external R&D increases by 2.0749% with a 2-year lag.Compared with external R&D, internal R&D can boost S&T output."

https://openalex.org/W4283359502,"Deformation measurement is a key process in traction force microscopy (TFM). Conventionally, particle image velocimetry (PIV) or correlation-based particle tracking velocimetry (cPTV) have been used for such a purpose. Using simulated bead images, we show that those methods fail to capture large displacement vectors and that it is due to a poor cross-correlation. Here, to redeem the potential large vectors, we propose a two-step deformation tracking algorithm that combines cPTV, which performs better for small displacements than PIV methods, and newly-designed retracking algorithm that exploits statistically confident vectors from the initial cPTV to guide the selection of correlation peak which are not necessarily the global maximum. As a result, the new method, named 'cPTV-Retracking', or cPTVR, was able to track more than 92% of large vectors whereas conventional methods could track 43-77% of those. Correspondingly, traction force reconstructed from cPTVR showed better recovery of large traction than the old methods. cPTVR applied on the experimental bead images has shown a better resolving power of the traction with different-sized cell-matrix adhesions than conventional methods. Altogether, cPTVR method enhances the accuracy of TFM in the case of large deformations present in soft substrates. We share this advance via our TFMPackage software."
