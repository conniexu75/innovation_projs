https://openalex.org/W1980332250,"Inconsistent with the view that hair follicle stem cells reside in the matrix area of the hair bulb, we found that label-retaining cells exist exclusively in the bulge area of the mouse hair follicle. The bulge consists of a subpopulation of outer root sheath cells located in the midportion of the tollicle at the arrector pili muscle attachment site. Keratinocytes in the bulge area are relatively undifferentiated ultrastructurally. They are normally slow cycling, but can be stimulated to proliferate transiently by TPA. Located in a well-protected and nourished environment, these cells mark the lower end of the “permanent” portion of the follicle. Our findings, plus a reevaluation of the literature, suggest that follicular stem cells reside in the bulge region, instead of the lower bulb. This new view provides insights into hair cycle control and the possible involvement of hair follicle stem cells in skin carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2068012172,"The vast repertoire of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors is generated, in part, by V(D)J recombination, a series of genomic rearrangements that occur specifically in developing lymphocytes. The recombination activating gene, RAG-1, which is a gene expressed exclusively in maturing lymphoid cells, was previously isolated. RAG-1 inefficiently induced V(D)J recombinase activity when transfected into fibroblasts, but cotransfection with an adjacent gene, RAG-2, has resulted in at least a 1000-fold increase in the frequency of recombination. The 2.1-kilobase RAG-2 complementary DNA encodes a putative protein of 527 amino acids whose sequence is unrelated to that of RAG-1. Like RAG-1, RAG-2 is conserved between species that carry out V(D)J recombination, and its expression pattern correlates precisely with that of V(D)J recombinase activity. In addition to being located just 8 kilobases apart, these convergently transcribed genes are unusual in that most, if not all, of their coding and 3′ untranslated sequences are contained in single exons. RAG-1 and RAG-2 might activate the expression of the V(D)J recombinase but, more likely, they directly participate in the recombination reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2014870330,"Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow of normal subjects, while they were discriminating different attributes (shape, color, and velocity) of the same set of visual stimuli. Psychophysical evidence indicated that the sensitivity for discriminating subtle stimulus changes was higher when subjects focused attention on one attribute than when they divided attention among several attributes. Correspondingly, attention enhanced the activity of different regions of extrastriate visual cortex that appear to be specialized for processing information related to the selected attribute."

https://openalex.org/W1999745373,"The TATA binding protein, TFIID, plays a central role in the initiation of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis. Here, we present a human cDNA clone for this factor. Comparison of its predicted protein sequence with those from Drosophila and yeast reveals a highly conserved carboxyl-terminal 180 amino acids. By contrast, the amino-terminal region of TFIID has diverged in both sequence and length. A striking feature of the human protein is a stretch of 38 glutamine residues in the NH2-terminal region. Expression of human TFIID in both Escherichia coli and HeLa cells produces a protein that binds specifically to a TATA box and promotes basal transcription; the conserved COOH-terminal portion of the protein is sufficient for both of these activities. Recombinant TFIID forms a stable complex on a TATA box either alone or in combination with either of the general transcription factors, TFIIA or TFIIB. Full-length recombinant TFIID is able to support Sp1 activated transcription in a TFIID-depleted nuclear extract, while a deletion of the NH2-terminal half of the protein is not. These results indicate the importance of the NH2-terminal region for upstream activation functions and suggest that additional factors (co-activators) are required for mediating interactions with specific regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2014791263,"SF2 is a 33 kd protein factor required for 5' splice site cleavage and lariat formation during pre-mRNA splicing in HeLa cell extracts. In addition to its essential role in constitutive splicing, SF2 can strongly influence 5' splice site selection. When pre-mRNAs containing multiple cis-competing 5' splice sites are spliced in vitro, high concentrations of purified SF2 promote the use of the 5' splice site closest to the 3' splice site. However, SF2 discriminates properly between authentic and cryptic splice sites. These effects of SF2 on splice site selection may reflect the cellular mechanisms that prevent exon skipping and ensure the accuracy of splicing. In addition, alterations in the concentration or activity of SF2, and of other general splicing factors, may serve to regulate alternative splicing in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1963722963,"During the course of whooping cough, Bordetella pertussis interacts with alveolar macrophages and other leukocytes on the respiratory epithelium. We report here mechanisms by which these bacteria adhere to human macrophages in vitro. Whole bacteria adhere by means of two proteins, filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertussis toxin, either of which is sufficient to mediate adherence. FHA interacts with two classes of molecules on macrophages, galactose-containing glycoconjugates and the integrin CR3 (alpha M beta 2, CD11b/CD18). The interaction between CR3 and FHA involves recognition of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence at positions 1097-1099 in FHA. This study demonstrates that bacterial adherence can be based on the interaction of a bacterial adhesin RGD sequence with an integrin and that bacterial adhesins can have multiple binding sites characteristic of eukaryotic extracellular matrix proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2020700449,"U1 and ACH-2 cells are subclones of HIV-1-infected monocyte/macrophage-like and T lymphocyte cell lines, respectively, which express the HIV-1 genome at very low levels. We have examined whether they might provide a model of HIV-1 latency. The patterns of HIV-1-specific RNA expressed in these cells consisted of singly and multiply spliced RNA species, with little or no full-length genomic RNA. Upon stimulation with agents that activate the HIV-1 long terminal repeat in these cells, a marked rise in the amount of small mRNAs, encoding the viral regulatory proteins, preceded the increase in the unspliced RNA. Thus, U1 and ACH-2 cells maintain HIV-1 in a state equivalent to the early phase of a lytic infection and, after stimulation, recapitulate the events of a single cycle infection of highly susceptible target cells."

https://openalex.org/W2086679033,"Cellular interactions in neural development are influenced by various extracellular proteins, many of which bind glycosaminoglycans or proteoglycans. Precise functions of nervous system proteoglycans remain unknown, in part because neural proteoglycan composition is poorly understood. In this study, 25 putative proteoglycan core proteins were identified in subcellular fractions of rat brain. Levels of many of these varied considerably during development. Membrane-associated proteoglycans included two heparan sulfate proteoglycans (cores of 50 and 59 kd) that are covalently linked to glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol lipid, as well as several that appear to aggregate either with themselves or with copurifying proteins. These data indicate that brain proteoglycans exhibit the abundance, structural diversity, and developmental regulation that would be anticipated for molecules with diverse developmental functions."
https://openalex.org/W2062376481,"We have purified extrachromosomal circular DNAs from adult mouse spleen cells, and cloned into a phage vector the BamHl fragments hybridizing with C mu and S gamma 1 probes. We obtained 52 S mu+S gamma 1+ clones by screening 1.4 million phage clones derived from spleen cells stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interleukin 4. We have identified the breakpoints of six clones that contain S gamma 1 and S mu sequences fused in the 5' to 3' orientation. All these switch recombination sites were assigned to the central repetitive sequences of the S mu and S gamma 1 regions. Since the common S mu-S gamma 1 sequences at the recombination sites are at most 2 bases long, typical homologous recombination cannot account for their joining. These findings provide direct evidence that mu-gamma 1 class switching can occur by the looping out and excision of chromosomal DNA, with formation of a circle."
https://openalex.org/W2063329377,"A peptide having enzyme-like catalytic activity has been designed and synthesized. Computer modeling was used to design a bundle of four short parallel amphipathic helical peptides bearing the serine protease catalytic site residues serine, histidine, and aspartic acid at the amino end of the bundle in the same spatial arrangement as in chymotrypsin (ChTr). The necessary ""oxyanion hole"" and substrate binding pocket for acetyltyrosine ethyl ester, a classical ChTr substrate, were included in the design. The four chains were linked covalently at their carboxyl ends. The peptide has affinity for ChTr ester substrates similar to that of ChTr and hydrolyzes them at rates ∼0.01 that of ChTr; total turnovers > 100 have been observed. The peptide is inhibited by ChTr specific inhibitors and is inactive toward benzoyl arginine ethyl ester, a trypsin substrate. The peptide is inactivated by heating above 60°C, but recovers full catalytic activity upon cooling and lyophilization from acetic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2067006395,"Retrograde fluorescent tracers were used to demonstrate a previously unknown but sizable direct gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing neuronal pathway from the zona incerta to the neocortex in rats. This incertocortical pathway was found to project bilaterally to the entire neocortex and exhibited a rough corticotopic organization. Many of the zona incerta neurons projecting to the parietal and occipital cortices could also be immunohistochemically stained with antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase and GABA. Few of these neurons were immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase antibodies, which identify dopamine-containing neurons. Injections in the frontal and entorhinal cortices labeled many neurons near or within the dopaminergic A13 subdivision of the zona incerta. In addition, the incertocortical system was found to be significantly larger during early postnatal (2 to 3 weeks) development. The projection pattern of this newly discovered pathway resembles that of the monoaminergic and cholinergic systems, arising from the brainstem and forebrain, suggesting possible similarities of function."
https://openalex.org/W1538474427,"Three species of denitrifying bacteria, Paracoccus denitrificans, Pseudomonas stutzeri strain JM300, and Achromobacter cycloclastes, were allowed to reduce nitrate or nitrite in anaerobic, closed vials while the equilibration of gases between aqueous and gas phases was facilitated by vigorous stirring. The gas phase was sampled and analyzed for NO with use of a chemiluminescence detector calibrated against bottled NO standards or against NO produced by the nitrite-iodide reaction. [NOaq] was inferred from [NOg] and the solubility of NO. NO was detected only during denitrification in amounts that, once established, did not change with time, were independent of the initial concentration of nitrate or nitrite, and were largely independent of cell concentration, at least when nitrate was the oxidant. The usual level of NO was promptly re-established following the addition of exogenous NO or following the loss of NO by sparging. The aforementioned properties are expected for a steady-state intermediate in denitrification. Steady-state [NOaq] ranged between 1 and 65 nM depending on species and conditions. Similar results were also obtained in a related experiment in which P. stutzeri strain ZoBell respired nitrite under growth conditions. The very low steady-state [NOaq] observed during denitrification imply that the maximum activity of nitric oxide reductase in vivo, if it could be realized, would be large relative to that for nitrite reductase. This circumstance allows NO to be an intermediate without reaching toxic steady-state levels."
https://openalex.org/W2100025889,"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, is a highly inducible protein whose expression involves a complex and variable array of regulatory mechanisms. We investigated the influence of the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of the rat ODC mRNA on translation of the mRNA in a cell-free system and in cultured mammalian cells. ODC mRNA containing the full-length 5'UTR was translated in reticulocyte lysates at approximately 5% of the rate of mRNA containing no ODC 5' leader sequences. The complete 5'UTR inhibited expression of a heterologous gene product, human growth hormone, to the same extent in cultured mammalian cells. Furthermore, the 5'-most 130 bases of the rat ODC 5'UTR, a conserved G/C-rich region predicted to form a stable stem-loop structure (delta G = -68 kcal/mol), repressed translation to the same extent as the entire 5'UTR, both in the lysates and in intact cells. The 3'-most 160 bases of the 5'UTR, containing a small upstream open reading frame, decreased expression by 50-65% both in vitro and in intact cells, compared with controls lacking any ODC 5'UTR sequences. Mutation of the initiation codon AUG beginning this upstream open reading frame to GCG restored expression to rates equivalent to those seen in constructions containing no ODC 5'UTR sequences. We conclude that the rat ODC mRNA 5'UTR can inhibit translation of ODC mRNA both in vitro and in vivo, and that the predicted stem-loop structure at the 5' end of the 5'UTR is both necessary and sufficient for this inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1604461344,"We have determined the roles of the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTR) of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA in the post-transcriptional regulation of this enzyme. A series of expression vectors were constructed in which portions of the ODC 5' and/or 3' UTRs were placed flanking a reporter gene coding sequence, either firefly luciferase or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, so as to generate a hybrid transcript. Translation of these chimeric genes in transient expression assays in wild type and ODC-deficient hamster cells was examined in the presence of normal or depleted polyamine pools. The ODC 5' UTR suppresses translation of the coding sequence it precedes irrespective of polyamine levels, and this effect is shown to be due to the GC-rich 5' segment of the UTR. The same effect is observed in vivo and in a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translation system. The GC-rich region has the potential to form a very stable hairpin structure and inhibits translation in a position-dependent but orientation-independent manner. Insertion of the 3' UTR of ODC downstream of the translation termination codon of the reporter gene but prior to the polyadenylation signal partially relieves the suppression of translation imposed by the 5' UTR; the overall translatability of the message improves 30-50-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1519882367,"In animal cells, unliganded steroid receptors are complexed with a 90-kDa heat shock protein, HSP90; hormone binding by the receptor leads to the release of HSP90. We found that the 795-amino acid rat glucocorticoid receptor protein formed oligomeric complexes in vitro upon synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates; these oligomers also dissociated in the presence of hormone. Similar complexes formed when X795, a receptor derivative containing only the C-terminal half (amino acids 407-795) of the protein, was translated in vitro. Moreover, X795 was co-immunoadsorbed from the reticulocyte lysates together with HSP90 by three different anti-HSP90 monoclonal antibodies, indicating that the in vitro translated receptor binds HSP90 and that the interaction occurs within the C-terminal half of the receptor. To localize the HSP90 binding region in greater detail, various deletion mutants of X795 were translated in vitro and assayed for oligomer formation and for co-immunoadsorption with HSP90. The results indicated that HSP90 interacted with the receptor within a subregion of the hormone binding domain, between amino acids 568 and 616. These findings are consistent with the proposal that HSP90 may participate in the mechanism of signal transduction by steroid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2032807824,"We induced and characterized a recessive lethal mutation, nic-1, in zebrafish that blocks the function of muscle acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. Homozygous nic-1 embryos are nonmotile and fail to respond to exogenous application of cholinergic agonists, although their muscles contract in response to direct electrical stimulation. Moreover, we do not detect cell surface labeling by α-bungarotoxin or monoclonal antibodies that recognize the other three subunits of ACh receptors. Motoneurons, however, establish morphologically normal patterns of innervation and normal neuromuscular junctions. We suggest that neither transmitter-mediated nerve signaling nor any other aspect of ACh receptor function is required for the formation of appropriate nerve connections in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2045466989,"To test the hypothesis that cortical neurons undergo massive sprouting in Alzheimer's disease brain, we investigated whether neurofibrillary tangles contain fetal antigens. Two monoclonal antibodies to tangles specifically labeled an ∼300 kd protein in the neonatal brain homogenate, which was subsequently identified as MAP5 (MAP1B). Conversely, two monoclonal antibodies to MAP5 were found to stain tangles. All four reacted with only a phosphorylated species of MAP5. By careful immunochemical analysis, at least three independent phosphorylated epitopes that should have distinct conformations were shown to be shared by tangles and MAP5. However, several monoclonal antibodies to non-phosphorylated MAP5 did not stain tangles. From these observations, we conclude that fragments of phosphorylated MAP5 are bound to tangles. Since MAP5, in particular, a phosphorylated species, is known to be involved in neurite outgrowth, this result supports the sprouting hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1696991296,"The cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (SCC) catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in the synthesis of steroid hormones. The mouse gene encoding SCC was cloned and the nucleotide sequence of its 5'-flanking region determined. This sequence includes an AP-1 motif at -319 and two motifs, AGGTCA at -70 and AGCCTTG at -40, that match elements proposed to be important in the expression of steroid 21-hydroxylase. When transfected into mouse Y1 adrenocortical tumor cells, 1.5 kilobase pairs of 5'-flanking region of the SCC gene directed high levels of expression of a growth hormone reporter gene; treatment of the transfected Y1 cells with 8-bromo-cAMP increased this expression by 5-fold. In contrast, transfected mouse MA-10 Leydig cells showed appreciably lower expression, suggesting that SCC expression in Leydig cells requires additional elements not contained in the 5'-flanking region of the SCC gene used in these experiments. Deletion experiments showed that 424 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequences were sufficient for regulated expression in Y1 cells and mapped two regulatory regions: one from -424 to -327 and a second from -219 to -77. DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift analyses of these 424 base pairs defined several interactions between nuclear proteins and the SCC promoter, including footprints centered over the AP-1 motif, over a sequence at -120, and over the sequences (-70 and -40) that resemble 21-hydroxylase promoter elements. Finally, site-selected mutagenesis of the potential elements at -40, -70, or -120 decreased SCC promoter activity in transfected Y1 adrenocortical cells, thus establishing their importance in SCC expression."
https://openalex.org/W1522175398,"Multiple AMP deaminase (AMP-D) isoforms have been found in vertebrates, and tissue-specific inherited deficiencies of AMP-D have been described in two unrelated clinical syndromes suggesting there may be more than one AMP-D gene in higher eukaryotes. Using a newly isolated cDNA cloned from an adult rat brain library and a previously reported cDNA cloned from adult rat skeletal muscle, two linked AMP-D genes have been identified in rat and man. ampd1 is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle of the adult rat. ampd2 is the predominant gene expressed in non-muscle tissues and smooth muscle of the adult rat, and it is also the predominant gene expressed in embryonic muscle and undifferentiated myoblasts. Both genes are expressed in cardiac muscle of the adult rat. The peptides encoded by these two genes have distinct immunological properties. The conservation of nucleotide sequence and exon/intron boundaries in these two genes suggests they arose by duplication of a common primordial gene around 150 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2012506650,"During macronuclear development in ciliates, precise deletion events eliminate thousands of specific DNA segments. Each segment is bounded by a unique pair of short direct repeats, but no other common feature has been reported. To determine the critical cis-acting sequences, we developed an in vivo system for analyzing this process in Tetrahymena. We show that sequences essential for recognition and excision of one such region are located within the 70 bp of DNA flanking either side of it. Three authentic splice sites and one cryptic site are each adjacent to an unusual polypurine tract (5′-A5G5) situated 40–50 bp distal to each terminal repeat. Removal of this tract or substitution of 3 bp within it abolishes splicing to the adjacent site. The normal chromosomal environment and the integrity of the eliminated sequence are not required for its removal. We believe the polypurine tract is a signal essential for excision of this sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1491813101,"In the present report we describe the platelet-binding characteristics of applaggin and echistatin, potent inhibitors of fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation derived from Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus and Echis carinatus snake venoms, respectively. Both molecules bound to unstimulated platelets in a specific and saturable manner. At saturation there were 37,100 +/- 3,150 (mean, +/- S.D.) molecules of applaggin and 27,200 +/- 2,816 molecules of echistatin bound/platelet, with dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.4 +/- 0.6 x 10(-7) M and 4.9 +/- 1.2 x 10(-7) M, respectively. Stimulation of platelets with ADP (10 microM) + epinephrine (2 microM) resulted in an increase in the number of molecules bound at saturation to 42,300 +/- 2,105 for applaggin and 32,185 +/- 3,180 for echistatin, with a Kd of 5.6 +/- 0.3 x 10(-8) M and 1.8 +/- 0.6 x 10(-7) M, respectively. The synthetic peptide (Arg)8-Gly-Asp-Val was a competitive antagonist of applaggin and echistatin binding to unstimulated platelets (Ki = 25 and 36 microM, respectively). Applaggin and echistatin inhibited the binding of fibrinogen to stimulated platelets in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 9 and 25 nM, respectively. In concert with inhibition of platelet aggregation, applaggin and echistatin inhibited platelet secretion and synthesis of thromboxane A2 induced by ADP, collagen, and human gamma-thrombin. The monclonal antibody, LJ-CP3, which inhibits the binding of Arg-Gly-Asp containing ligands to platelet GPIIb.IIIa, also inhibited applaggin binding to unstimulated platelets in a competitive manner (Ki = 4.5 microM). Thus, applaggin and echistatin bind to the platelet GPIIb.IIIa complex, and the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence plays a central role in mediating this interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2049445954,"Drosophila rdgC (retinal degeneration-C) mutants show normal retinal morphology and photoreceptor physiology at young ages. Dark-reared rdgC flies retain this wild-type phenotype, but light-reared mutants undergo retinal degeneration. rdgC photoreceptors with low levels of rhodopsin as a result of vitamin A deprivation or a mutant rhodopsin (ninaE) gene fail to show rdgC-induced degeneration even after prolonged light treatment, demonstrating that degeneration occurs as a result of light stimulation of rhodopsin. Analysis of norpA; rdgC flies shows that the norpA-encoded phospholipase C, the target enzyme of the G protein activated by rhodopsin, is not required for rdgC-induced degeneration. Thus the rdgC+ gene product is required to prevent retinal degeneration that results from a previously unrecognized consequence of rhodopsin stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1999259470,"Rat skeletal muscle contains a 22 kd polypeptide that increases the level of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in cultures of embryonic rat spinal cord neurons and has been purified to homogeneity. The application of this factor, ChAT development factor or CDF, to developing chick embryos during the period of naturally occurring motoneuron cell death significantly increased the survival of motoneurons but did not affect the survival of dorsal root ganglion neurons or sympathetic preganglionic neurons (column of Terni). These results provide the first demonstration that an isolated, skeletal muscle-derived molecule can selectively enhance the survival of motoneurons in vivo and suggest that CDF may function in vivo to regulate the survival and development of motoneurons."

https://openalex.org/W1572164131,"The kinetics of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was studied with the detergent-solubilized enzyme from rat brain. Mn2(+)-activated adenylyl cyclase exhibited typical noncompetitive inhibition by 2'-d3'-AMP or 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine (2',5'-ddAdo). However, enzyme that was preactivated with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) or proteolytically with ninhibin (+ GTP gamma S) exhibited apparently uncompetitive inhibition with either 2'-d3'-AMP or 2',5'-ddAdo and with either MgATP or MgApp(NH)p (adenosine 5'-(beta gamma-imino)triphosphate) as substrate. Inhibition increased with increasing substrate concentration, consistent with distinct domains for catalysis and the P-site and the formation of a 2'-d3'-AMP.C.MgATP complex. This conclusion was supported by the kinetics of product inhibition. For both cAMP and inorganic pyrophosphate (MgPPi) inhibition was mixed, suggesting that product release is likely random sequential. Although MgPPi enhanced inhibition in the presence of P-site agonist, it did not affect the dissociation constant for P-site agonist. The uncompetitive character of P-site-mediated inhibition and the independence of inhibition by MgPPi and P-site agonist imply that the P-site binding domain is distinct from the substrate binding domain. Given the structural requirements for catalysis and for P-site-mediated inhibition, these domains would be expected to be homologous. Sensitivity to P-site-mediated inhibition was also dependent on the structure of ATP, with the following IC50 values for 2'-d3'-AMP: ATP approximately 2'-dATP (approximately 1 microM); adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (approximately 5 microM); App(NH)p (approximately 30 microM); adenosine 5'-(beta gamma-methylene)triphosphate (approximately 300 microM). The differing effectiveness of the ATP analogs to support P-site inhibition was not due to their binding at the P-site. This effect of substrate was also observed with the platelet enzyme and was independent of the means by which the enzyme was activated, whether by Mn2+ or proteolytically by ninhibin/GTP gamma S, suggesting it is a general characteristic of P-site-mediated inhibition. The data suggest a structure for activated adenylyl cyclase such that one nucleotide binding domain, selective for ATP vis-a-vis other ATP analogs, allosterically modulates a proximate P-site domain."
https://openalex.org/W1548651527,"Pasteurella multocida toxin, either native or recombinant (rPMT), is an extremely effective mitogen for Swiss 3T3 cells and acts at picomolar concentrations (Rozengurt, E., Higgins, T. E., Chanter, N., Lax, A. J., and Staddon, J. M. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 123-127). Here, we show that similar concentrations of rPMT markedly stimulated the phosphorylation of an acidic 80-kDa protein in [32P]Pi-labeled Swiss 3T3 cells. Co-migration on one- and two-dimensional gels and phosphopeptide analysis indicated that this phosphoprotein was indistinguishable from 80K, a known protein kinase C substrate. In parallel cultures, the stimulation of 80K phosphorylation by rPMT (5-10-fold) was comparable to that induced by bombesin or phorbol dibutyrate (PBt2). However, the increase in phosphorylation by rPMT occurred after a pronounced lag period (1-3 h, depending upon the concentration of rPMT) in contrast to the relatively immediate stimulation by PBt2 or bombesin. Early, but not late, addition of either PMT antiserum or the lysosomotrophic agent methylamine selectively inhibited 80K phosphorylation in response to rPMT. 80K phosphorylation persisted after removal of free toxin and was not inhibited by cycloheximide. It appears that rPMT enters the cells via an endocytotic pathway to initiate and perpetuate events leading to 80K phosphorylation. rPMT, like PBt2, also stimulated the phosphorylation of 87-kDa and 33-kDa proteins in Swiss 3T3 cells. Phosphorylation of the 80K and 87-kDa proteins by rPMT or PBt2 were greatly attenuated in cells depleted of protein kinase C. In contrast, phosphorylation of the 33-kDa protein by rPMT, but not by PBt2, persisted in the absence of protein kinase C. rPMT, like bombesin, caused a translocation of protein kinase C to the cellular particulate fraction. The toxin enhanced the cellular content of diacylglycerol. rPMT also caused a time- and dose-dependent decrease in the binding of 125I-epidermal growth factor to its receptor which was blocked by methylamine and dependent only in part upon the presence of protein kinase C. We conclude that rPMT stimulates protein kinase C-dependent and -independent protein phosphorylation in Swiss 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1481617035,"The mechanism of phenylalanine regulation of rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase was studied. We show that phenylalanine activates phenylalanine hydroxylase, converting it from an inactive to active form, by binding at a true allosteric regulatory site. One phenylalanine molecule binds per enzyme subunit; it remains at this site during catalytic turnover and, while there, cannot be hydroxylated. Loss of phenylalanine from the site causes a loss of enzymatic activity. The rate of loss of activation is dramatically slowed by phenylalanine, which kinetically traps activated enzyme during relaxation from the activated to unactivated state. An empirical equation is presented which allows calculation of relaxation rates over a wide range of temperatures and phenylalanine concentrations. Kinetic trapping by phenylalanine is a novel effect. It was analyzed in detail, and its magnitude implied that phenylalanine activation involves cooperativity among all four subunits of the enzyme tetramer. A regulatory model is presented, accounting for the properties of the phenylalanine activation reaction in the forward and reverse directions and at equilibrium. Fluorescence quenching studies confirmed that activation increases the solvent accessibility of the enzyme's tryptophan residues. Physical and kinetic properties of purified phenylalanine hydroxylase from rat, rabbit, baboon, and goose liver were compared. All enzymes were remarkably alike in catalytic and regulatory properties, suggesting that control of this enzyme is similar in mammals and birds."
https://openalex.org/W1727060527,"Stimulation of many nonexcitable cells by Ca2(+)-mobilizing receptor agonists causes oscillating elevations of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ((Ca2+]i), rather than a continuous increase. It has been proposed that the frequency at which [Ca2+]i oscillates determines the biological response. Because the occurrence of [Ca2+] oscillations is observed together with endogenous inositol polyphosphate (InsPs) production or following InsPs application, we injected Xenopus laevis oocytes with InsPs and monitored Ca2(+)-activated Cl- currents as an assay of [Ca2+]i. Microinjection of the poorly metabolizable inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) derivatives inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(2,4,5)P3) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphorothioate (Ins(1,4,5) P3S3) induced [Ca2+]i oscillations. The frequency at which [Ca2+]i oscillated increased with the injected dose, indicating that the frequency-generating mechanism lies distal to InsP3 production and that generation of oscillations does not require either oscillation of InsP3 levels or InsP3 metabolism. Injections of high doses of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or Ins(2,4,5)P3 inhibited ongoing oscillations, whereas Ca2+ injections decreased the amplitude of Ins(2,4,5)P3-induced oscillations without altering their frequency. Injections of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 metabolite inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate also caused oscillations whose frequency was related to the injected dose, although inositol tetrakisphosphate injection induced an increase in the cellular level of Ins(1,4,5)P3. The results suggest a multicomponent oscillatory system that includes the InsP3 target as well as a Ca2(+)-sensitive step that modulates amplitude."
https://openalex.org/W1531537321,"A binding protein specific for major neuronal gangliosides was detected on rat brain membranes using a synthetic ganglioside-protein conjugate, 125I-(GT1b)4BSA (bovine serum albumin derivatized with 4 mol of ganglioside GT1b/mol of protein), as a radioligand. Specific binding of the ligand displayed marked regional variation within the brain, with white matter-enriched regions demonstrating the highest binding activity. Autoradiographic localization of 125I-(GT1b)4BSA binding to tissue sections revealed selective association with myelinated pathways throughout the brain. The ligand also bound preferentially to brain subcellular fractions enriched in myelin, even after removal of axolemma. In contrast, peripheral nerve myelin had little binding activity. The myelin-associated ganglioside receptor detected by 125I-(GT1b)4BSA binding appears to be a novel oligodendroglial membrane protein which preferentially recognizes neuronal gangliosides."
https://openalex.org/W1586489547,"Peptides were derived from the large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan from chick cartilage by clostripain digestion. Using differential chondroitinase ABC and keratanase treatment and direct carbohydrate analysis, three major peptides of 86, 75, and 27 kDa were shown to bear only chondroitin sulfate chains. Another major peptide of 65 kDa was shown to contain both chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate chains, allowing it to be separated from the peptides derived from the chondroitin sulfate domain by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. An additional new peptide (100 kDa) containing keratan sulfate chains was found only in clostripain digests of proteoglycan-hyaluronate-link protein aggregates. Unlike any of the other peptides derived from clostripain digestion of proteoglycan monomer or aggregate, this peptide had the properties of a functional hyaluronate binding region. All of these peptides were purified to apparent homogeneity by preparative electroelution from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and deglycosylated with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Automated Edman degradation of the two largest chondroitin sulfate peptides revealed that they had unique N termini and several unrecognized residues, which were all subsequently revealed to be modified serine residues following deglycosylation. The keratan sulfate-bearing peptide also had a unique N terminus, which contained a single unrecognized residue, even after HF deglycosylation. Finally, the N terminus of the hyaluronate binding region was blocked. These studies allow estimates of core peptide masses in the absence of carbohydrate as well as provide primary amino acid sequence for O-xylosylated serine residues in the multiply substituted proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1481094350,"The human transferrin receptor is post-translationally modified by the addition of a fatty acyl moiety. In earlier studies, transient expression in Cos cells of human transferrin receptors in which Cys62 or Cys67 was altered to serine provided evidence that Cys62 is the major acylation site of the receptor (Jing, S., and Trowbridge, I. S. (1987) EMBO J. 6, 327-331). To determine whether acylation of the receptor is required for high efficiency endocytosis and iron uptake, wild type and mutant human transferrin receptors have been stably expressed in chick embryo fibroblasts using a helper-independent retroviral vector. In marked contrast to Cos cells, both Cys62 and Cys67 of the wild type human transferrin receptor were acylated in chick embryo fibroblasts. Moreover, their modification to serine did not abolish palmitate labeling, implying that one or both of these serine residues could serve as alternative lipid attachment sites in these cells. The relative labeling of mutant receptors with palmitate and the susceptibility of their lipid moieties to cleavage by hydroxylamine were consistent with Ser67 but not Ser62 serving as a lipid attachment site. Consequently, to obtain human transferrin receptors lacking covalently bound lipid in the chick embryo fibroblasts, it was necessary to alter Cys62 and Cys67 to alanine. Functional studies indicated that these non-acylated mutant receptors were internalized efficiently and mediated iron uptake from human transferrin at a similar rate to that of wild type receptors. We conclude, therefore, that acylation of the human transferrin receptor is not essential for endocytosis and recycling."
https://openalex.org/W2019199162,"T cell glycoprotein CD4 binds to class II major histocompatibility molecules and to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope protein gp120. Recombinant CD4 (rCD4) bound to polyclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) and 39 of 50 (78%) human myeloma proteins. This binding depended on the Fab and not the Fc portion of Ig and was independent of the light chain. Soluble rCD4, HIV gp120, and sulfated dextrans inhibited the CD4-Ig interaction. With the use of a panel of synthetic peptides, the region critical for binding to Ig was localized to amino acids 21 to 38 of the first extracellular domain of CD4. CD4-bound antibody (Ab) complexed with antigen approximately 100 times better than Ab alone. This activity may contribute to the Ab-mediated enhancement of cellular HIV interaction that appears to depend on a trimolecular complex of HIV, antibodies to gp120, and CD4."
https://openalex.org/W1502725291,"Differentiating 3T3-L1 cells have been used to investigate the process of fatty acid uptake, its cellular specificity, and the involvement of cytoplasmic carrier proteins. The profile of fatty acid uptake in both differentiated and undifferentiated cells was biphasic, consisting of an initial rapid phase (0-20 s) followed by a second slower phase (60-480 s). In both cell types the initial phase of fatty acid (FA) uptake was temperature-insensitive whereas the rate of uptake during the second phase decreased 4-fold when measurements were made at 4 degrees C. The rate of [9,10-3H]oleate uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was 10-fold greater than in the fibroblastic precursor cells. The acquisition of a differentially expressed cytoplasmic fatty acid binding protein (adipocyte lipid binding protein (ALBP] occurs coincident with the increased ability of these cells to take up FAs. Uptake experiments with 3-[125I]iodo-4-azido-N-hexadecylsalicylamide demonstrated that this photoactivatable FA analogue accumulated intracellularly in a time-, temperature-, and cell-specific fashion. Moreover, when 3T3-L1 adipocytes were presented with 3-[125I]iodo-4-azido-N-hexadecylsalicylamide and then irradiated, a single cytoplasmic 15-kDa protein was labeled. The in situ-labeled 15-kDa protein was identified as ALBP by its ability to be immunoprecipitated with anti-ALBP antisera. Taken together these results indicate that fatty acids traverse the plasma membrane and are bound by ALBP in the cytoplasmic compartment. It is likely that lipid uptake in other cell systems, such as liver, heart, intestine, and nerve tissue, proceeds by a similar process and that this represents a general mechanism for cell-specific FA uptake and utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1590814265,"Ten fragments of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were tested for reactivity with a human catalytic autoantibody that cleaves full-length VIP(1-28) at the Gln16-Met17 peptide bond. A large COOH-terminal subsequence, VIP(15-28), was bound by the autoantibody with high affinity (Ki 1.25 nM), suggesting that it is the antibody binding epitope. VIP(22-28), a short subsequence distant from the scissile bond, inhibited the binding (Ki 242 microM) and hydrolysis (Ki 260 microM) of full-length VIP by the catalytic autoantibody in a competitive fashion. The autoantibody did not show detectable binding of short VIP subsequences that encompass the scissile bond (VIP(15-21), VIP(11-17), and VIP(13-20]. These data show that residues 22-28, located four amino acids distant from the scissile bond, contribute in recognition of VIP by the catalytic autoantibody."
https://openalex.org/W1607298303,"A catalytic fragment preparation of rabbit muscle phosphorylase kinase produced by limited chymotryptic digestion was isolated and identified as the NH2-terminal region of the gamma subunit by Edman degradation. Mass spectral analysis, gas phase sequence analysis, and amino acid analysis of the active fragment carboxyl-terminal peptides revealed multiple COOH termini generated at residues Tyr290, Arg296, and Phe298 in the gamma subunit sequence. These active fragment species are about 24% smaller than the gamma subunit (Mr 44,673) and range in size from Mr 33,279 to Mr 34,275. The active fragment preparation exhibits a specific activity about 6-fold higher than that of the gamma subunit-calmodulin complex. Calmodulin confers calcium sensitivity to the gamma subunit but has no effect on the enzymatic properties of active fragment. Affinity measurements demonstrated a dissociation constant of 0.7 microM for active fragment binding to dansylcalmodulin, a value about 28-fold weaker than reported for the gamma subunit. These data support the presence of a calmodulin binding domain in the COOH-terminal region of the gamma subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1602183663,"9 alpha,11 beta-prostaglandin F2 was formed from prostaglandin D2 by its 11-ketoreductases in 100,000 x g supernatants of various bovine tissues in the presence of an NADPH-generating system. The reductase activities were high in liver (51.09 nmol/h/mg of protein), lung (24.99), and spleen (14.20); moderate in heart and pancreas (3.09-3.61); weak in stomach, intestine, colon, kidney, uterus, adrenal gland, and thymus (0.11-2.63); and undetectable in brain, retina, carotid artery, and blood (less than 0.10). No formation of prostaglandin F2 alpha from prostaglandin D2 was detected in all tissues. In immunotitration analyses with a polyclonal antibody specific for prostaglandin F synthetase, the reductase activities in lung and spleen showed identical titration curves to that of the purified synthetase and decreased to less than 15% of the initial activity under the condition of antibody excess. Prostaglandin F synthetase-immunoreactive protein in these two tissues showed peptide fingerprints identical to that of the purified enzyme after partial digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The antibody was partially cross-reactive to the reductase in liver (about 20% of that to the synthetase) but not to the reductase(s) in other tissues. The Km value for prostaglandin D2 of the reductase activity was the same in lung and spleen as that of the purified prostaglandin F synthetase (120 microM) but differed in liver (6 microM), heart, and pancreas (15 microM). The predominant distribution of prostaglandin F synthetase in lung and spleen was confirmed by radioimmunoassay (2.8 and 1.0 micrograms/mg protein, respectively) and Northern blot analyses. In immunoperoxidase staining, this enzyme was localized in alveolar interstitial cells and nonciliated epithelial cells in lung, histiocytes and/or dendritic cells in spleen, and a few interstitial cells in kidney and adrenal cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1534872489,"The sugar-specific binding of N-dansylgalactosamine to WBA II (n = 2; Ka = 5.6 x 10(3) M-1; delta H = -21 kJ.mol-1; delta S = -21.3 J.mol-1.K-1) was utilized in substitution titrations for evaluating the association constants for the interaction of sugars with the lectin. An axial hydroxyl at C-4 and equatorial hydroxyls at C-3 and C-6 as in D-galacto configuration are crucial for binding. Both axial and equatorial hydroxyls are tolerated at C-2. Conformationally akin disaccharides such as lactose, N-acetyllactosamine, Gal beta 1-3GlcNAc, and Gal beta 1-3GalNAc show similar affinities. 2'-Fucosyllactose and H-disaccharide display 146 and 13 times stronger affinity over lactose and galactose, yet fucose by itself is devoid of activity. An interesting feature, noted for the first time, in protein-sugar interactions is the positive entropy change for the binding of 2'-fucosyllactose, suggesting that nonpolar interactions play an important role in stabilization of the lectin-sugar complex. 3-Fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose, lacto-N-fucopentaose II and III are inactive, whereas lacto-N-fucopentaose I has 14-fold lower affinity as compared with 2'-fucosyllactose. Conformational analysis indicates that the substitution at subterminal glucose or GlcNAc by L-fucose in either alpha 1-3 or alpha 1-4 linkage leads to its projection so as to sterically hinder the access of 3'-fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose, and lacto-N-fucopentaose II and III to the binding site of winged bean agglutinin II. Similarly the projection of alpha 1-3 linked Gal/GalNAc also leads to steric hindrance and hence prevents the binding of blood group A and B reactive sugars. Considering its unique specificity winged bean agglutinin II should be useful in the isolation and characterization of terminally monofucosylated H-reactive oligosaccharides from those that are difucosylated or internally fucosylated."
https://openalex.org/W1490796728,"Hydrogen peroxide produces all of the effects on glucocorticoid receptors that are produced by molybdate, including stabilization of the receptor 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90) complex (Tienrungroj, W., Meshinchi, S., Sanchez, E. R., Pratt, S. E., Grippo, J. F., Holmgren, A., and Pratt, W. B. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6992-7000). When the glucocorticoid receptor is exposed simultaneously to molybdate and peroxide at concentrations that are optimal for receptor stabilization if each agent is present alone, there is an irreversible loss of steroid binding activity. The effect is accompanied by a covalent modification of the receptor, which is demonstrated by an increase in its apparent Mr on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Preincubation of the receptor with the sulfhydryl-modifying reagents methyl methanethiosulfonate or N-ethylmaleimide prevents covalent modification, suggesting that cysteine moieties are the site of attack. The covalently modified receptor can still bind to DNA. Molybdate-peroxide treatment does not covalently modify the 15-kDa tryptic fragment containing the DNA-binding domain and 11 of the 20 cysteine moieties in the receptor. However, the 27-kDa tryptic fragment, which contains the steroid-binding domain and 5 cysteines, is covalently modified. The 27-kDa tryptic fragment is covalently modified by the molybdate-peroxide combination when [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate is covalently bound to Cys-644. This leaves some combination of 4 cysteines in the steroid-binding domain (628, 649, 671, and 742) as the modified groups. These modifications occur in a region of the receptor that is known to contain its sites of interaction with both hsp90 and molybdate, with the latter having a well-established avidity for sulfur. These observations raise the possibility that the covalent modification caused by the molybdate-peroxide combination represents a modification of sulfur ligands involved in molybdate stabilization of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1584814201,"Human platelets exhibit an extremely rapid increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations ((Ca2+]in) and a dose-dependent cytoplasmic pH change ((pH]in) upon thrombin stimulation. A cytoplasmic alkalinization, maximal by 60 s, is preceded by a very rapid acidification, which is masked by the alkalinization when saturating thrombin doses are used. Using the pH probe 2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein we report here the kinetics of simultaneous cytoplasmic pH and Ca2+ changes in thrombin-stimulated platelets, measured in single cells by flow cytometry. This permits analysis of the responding subpopulation. Maximal thrombin stimulation (greater than or equal to 4.5 nM) induces a dose-dependent increase in pHin from approximately 7.0 to 7.30 and a maximal [Ca2+]in transient of up to 800 nM. The Ca2+ transient coincides temporally with the rapid initial acidification, while the alkalinization is maximal considerably later. The Ca2+ transients occur maximally in each responding cell, but occur only in a subpopulation of the platelets at subsaturating (less than 4.5 nM) thrombin doses; in contrast, the dose-dependent cytoplasmic acidification appears to occur uniformly in all platelets. The rapid increase in [Ca2+]in is not dependent on the alkalinization, and the former occurs maximally in amiloride treated, Na+/H+ exchange inhibited human platelets. These results indicate that the acidification and the rise in [Ca2+]in may be interrelated, whereas the cytoplasmic alkalinization (maximal considerably later than either the acidification or the [Ca2+]in rise) may be independent of these earlier, temporally correlated increases in H+ and Ca2+ concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1529076014,"Stereospecificities are reported for seven dehydrogenases from Acholeplasma laidlawii, an organism from an evolutionarily distinct branch of life which has not previously been studied from a stereochemical point of view. Three of the activities examined (alcohol dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and alanine dehydrogenase) catalyze the transfer of the pro-R (A) hydrogen from NADH. Four other activities (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and NADH oxidase) catalyze the transfer of the pro-S (B) hydrogen from NAD(P)H. The stereospecificity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase is notable because it is the opposite of that of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases from yeast and rat. These data are used to derive the simplest historical model capable of explaining available experimental facts."
https://openalex.org/W1563922302,"The mRNA for cytochrome oxidase subunit II (CoII) from bovine mitochondria binds to the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome in the absence of auxiliary factors. The synthetic polymer poly(U) is effective in competing with CoII mRNA for binding, although the polymer poly(A,U,G) competes very weakly. The effects of mRNA length on the interaction between the 28 S ribosomal subunit and mRNA have been examined using truncated derivatives of CoII mRNA. These results indicate that there is a minimum length of approximately 400 nucleotides required for the efficient binding of the mRNA to the small subunit. Shorter mRNAs will bind, but do so with much lower association constants. mRNAs of various lengths but with reduced secondary structure were prepared by substituting ITP for GTP during in vitro transcription reactions. These derivatives show the same effects of length as do the normal mRNA, indicating that RNA secondary structure is not a critical factor in subunit-mRNA interaction. The binding of the mRNA to the 28 S subunit is not influenced by the presence of guanine nucleotides or by the presence of a triphosphate at the 5' end of the RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2031353829,"We investigated retinal axon morphology and eye-specific afferent termination zones in the optic tectum of three-eyed tadpoles that were chronically treated with protein kinase inhibitors. The kinase inhibitors sphingosine, H-7, and phorbol ester, which down-regulates protein kinase C with chronic exposure, were applied to the tecta in a slow release plastic, Elvax. In vivo protein phosphorylation assays in drug-treated tadpoles indicated that the treatments decreased 32P incorporation into some protein bands by as much as 60%. Although the drugs did not cause a desegregation of the eye-specific stripes, treated retinal axon arbors covered about half the area covered by untreated arbors or arbors treated with inactive analogs of the drugs. We conclude that eye-specific segregation can be maintained under conditions that markedly alter retinal ganglion cell axon arbor size and that significantly perturb protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, we conclude that the protein kinase(s) that we blocked with these treatments is involved in the growth of axon arbors."

https://openalex.org/W1500963670,"From a population of wild type S49 cells, a clone, DTB6, was isolated in a single step from selective medium containing thymidine and dibutyryl cyclic AMP that exhibited a 60% deficiency in AMP deaminase (AMP-D) activity. The AMP-D deficiency conferred to the DTB6 cells a striking susceptibility to killing by low concentrations of either adenine or adenosine, the latter in the presence of an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase activity. This growth supersensitivity of DTB6 cells toward adenine could be ameliorated by the addition of hypoxanthine to the culture medium. Immunoprecipitation of AMP-D from wild type and mutant cells revealed that the DTB6 cell line contained markedly diminished amounts of the AMP-D isozyme which reacts with antisera to the predominant isoform expressed in adult kidney. The quantities of the AMP-D isozyme immunoprecipitated by antisera raised to the predominant isoform prepared from adult heart were equivalent in the two cell lines. Although Northern blot analyses revealed no alterations in mRNA sizes or levels encoded by either of the AMP-D genes, Southern blots of genomic DNA hybridized to a cDNA specific for the ampd2 gene revealed the presence of a new BamHI restriction fragment in the DNA of DTB6 cells. These data suggested that a point mutation has occurred in the ampd2 gene of DTB6 cells which encodes the AMP-D isozyme recognized by the kidney antisera. The DTB6 cells also possessed a virtual complete deficiency in thymidine kinase activity. The two enzyme deficiencies were distinguishable. The ability to isolate single step mutants with two seemingly independent biochemical abnormalities raises the speculation that there may be some link between cellular functions responsible for purine nucleotide and thymidine metabolism."
