https://openalex.org/W2029761525,Drone attraction to ether extracts of virgin queens (Apis mellifera L.) demonstrated that chemical communication enables the drones to orient themselves to queens during mating flights. The primary source of queen mating attractants is the mandibular glands. Fractionation of mandibular gland lipids yielded several attractive fractions that may act jointly. One fraction was queen substance (9-oxodec-2-enoic acid).

A quantitative and qualitative study of their distribution has not yet been made. The organisms were isolated in unialgal cultures, and very rapid growth rates were observed. Environmental and experimental implications are pointed out. A new species, Chaetoceros galvestonensis, 1.5 by 3.0 microns in broad view, is described and figured."

https://openalex.org/W1985420062,A theory has been developed for the response of the pore-water pressure uw to pressure applied isotropically to unsaturated soil. The results indicate that the response is determined by two shrinkage characteristics of the soil.
