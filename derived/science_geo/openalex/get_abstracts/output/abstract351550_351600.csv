https://openalex.org/W2154699417,"Establishment and maintenance of the blood system relies on self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that normally reside in small numbers in the bone marrow niche of adult mammals. This Review describes the developmental origins of HSCs and the molecular mechanisms that regulate lineage-specific differentiation. Studies of hematopoiesis provide critical insights of general relevance to other areas of stem cell biology including the role of cellular interactions in development and tissue homeostasis, lineage programming and reprogramming by transcription factors, and stage- and age-specific differences in cellular phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2102714321,"Human genetic diversity is shaped by both demographic and biological factors and has fundamental implications for understanding the genetic basis of diseases. We studied 938 unrelated individuals from 51 populations of the Human Genome Diversity Panel at 650,000 common single-nucleotide polymorphism loci. Individual ancestry and population substructure were detectable with very high resolution. The relationship between haplotype heterozygosity and geography was consistent with the hypothesis of a serial founder effect with a single origin in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, we observed a pattern of ancestral allele frequency distributions that reflects variation in population dynamics among geographic regions. This data set allows the most comprehensive characterization to date of human genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W1985140771,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in development, and dysregulation of miRNA expression has been observed in human malignancies. Recent evidence suggests that the processing of several primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) is blocked posttranscriptionally in embryonic stem cells, embryonal carcinoma cells, and primary tumors. Here we show that Lin28, a developmentally regulated RNA binding protein, selectively blocks the processing of pri-let-7 miRNAs in embryonic cells. Using in vitro and in vivo studies, we found that Lin28 is necessary and sufficient for blocking Microprocessor-mediated cleavage of pri-let-7 miRNAs. Our results identify Lin28 as a negative regulator of miRNA biogenesis and suggest that Lin28 may play a central role in blocking miRNA-mediated differentiation in stem cells and in certain cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2032544789,"Although strong and stiff human-made composites have long been developed, the microstructure of today's most advanced composites has yet to achieve the order and sophisticated hierarchy of hybrid materials built up by living organisms in nature. Clay-based nanocomposites with layered structure can reach notable stiffness and strength, but these properties are usually not accompanied by the ductility and flaw tolerance found in the structures generated by natural hybrid materials. By using principles found in natural composites, we showed that layered hybrid films combining high tensile strength and ductile behavior can be obtained through the bottom-up colloidal assembly of strong submicrometer-thick ceramic platelets within a ductile polymer matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2024942419,"The psychosis associated with schizophrenia is characterized by alterations in sensory processing and perception. Some antipsychotic drugs were identified by their high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (2AR). Drugs that interact with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) also have potential for the treatment of schizophrenia. The effects of hallucinogenic drugs, such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide, require the 2AR and resemble some of the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Here we show that the mGluR2 interacts through specific transmembrane helix domains with the 2AR, a member of an unrelated G-protein-coupled receptor family, to form functional complexes in brain cortex. The 2AR-mGluR2 complex triggers unique cellular responses when targeted by hallucinogenic drugs, and activation of mGluR2 abolishes hallucinogen-specific signalling and behavioural responses. In post-mortem human brain from untreated schizophrenic subjects, the 2AR is upregulated and the mGluR2 is downregulated, a pattern that could predispose to psychosis. These regulatory changes indicate that the 2AR-mGluR2 complex may be involved in the altered cortical processes of schizophrenia, and this complex is therefore a promising new target for the treatment of psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W2013669507,"We present video-rate (28 frames per second) far-field optical imaging with a focal spot size of 62 nanometers in living cells. Fluorescently labeled synaptic vesicles inside the axons of cultured neurons were recorded with stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy in a 2.5-micrometer by 1.8-micrometer field of view. By reducing the cross-sectional area of the focal spot by about a factor of 18 below the diffraction limit (260 nanometers), STED allowed us to map and describe the vesicle mobility within the highly confined space of synaptic boutons. Although restricted within boutons, the vesicle movement was substantially faster in nonbouton areas, consistent with the observation that a sizable vesicle pool continuously transits through the axons. Our study demonstrates the emerging ability of optical microscopy to investigate intracellular physiological processes on the nanoscale in real time."
https://openalex.org/W1964793477,"Beyond traditional nonlinear optics with large numbers of atoms and photons, qualitatively new phenomena arise in a quantum regime of strong interactions between single atoms and photons. By using a microscopic optical resonator, we achieved such interactions and demonstrated a robust, efficient mechanism for the regulated transport of photons one by one. With critical coupling of the input light, a single atom within the resonator dynamically controls the cavity output conditioned on the photon number at the input, thereby functioning as a photon turnstile. We verified the transformation from a Poissonian to a sub-Poissonian photon stream by photon counting measurements of the input and output fields. The results have applications in quantum information science, including for controlled interactions of single light quanta and for scalable quantum processing on atom chips."
https://openalex.org/W2127388521,"Natural vision is a highly dynamic process. Frequent body, head, and eye movements constantly bring new images onto the retina for brief periods, challenging our understanding of the neural code for vision. We report that certain retinal ganglion cells encode the spatial structure of a briefly presented image in the relative timing of their first spikes. This code is found to be largely invariant to stimulus contrast and robust to noisy fluctuations in response latencies. Mechanistically, the observed response characteristics result from different kinetics in two retinal pathways (“ON” and “OFF”) that converge onto ganglion cells. This mechanism allows the retina to rapidly and reliably transmit new spatial information with the very first spikes emitted by a neural population."
https://openalex.org/W1987832809,"Manipulation of individual atoms and molecules by scanning probe microscopy offers the ability of controlled assembly at the single-atom scale. However, the driving forces behind atomic manipulation have not yet been measured. We used an atomic force microscope to measure the vertical and lateral forces exerted on individual adsorbed atoms or molecules by the probe tip. We found that the force that it takes to move an atom depends strongly on the adsorbate and the surface. Our results indicate that for moving metal atoms on metal surfaces, the lateral force component plays the dominant role. Furthermore, measuring spatial maps of the forces during manipulation yielded the full potential energy landscape of the tip-sample interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4236316592,"In this Essay, we argue that pluripotent epiblast founder cells in the embryo and embryonic stem (ES) cells in culture represent the ground state for a mammalian cell, signified by freedom from developmental specification or epigenetic restriction and capacity for autonomous self-replication. We speculate that cell-to-cell variation may be integral to the ES cell condition, safe-guarding self-renewal while continually presenting opportunities for lineage specification."
https://openalex.org/W2090408264,"The carboxysome is a bacterial microcompartment that functions as a simple organelle by sequestering enzymes involved in carbon fixation. The carboxysome shell is roughly 800 to 1400 angstroms in diameter and is assembled from several thousand protein subunits. Previous studies have revealed the three-dimensional structures of hexameric carboxysome shell proteins, which self-assemble into molecular layers that most likely constitute the facets of the polyhedral shell. Here, we report the three-dimensional structures of two proteins of previously unknown function, CcmL and OrfA (or CsoS4A), from the two known classes of carboxysomes, at resolutions of 2.4 and 2.15 angstroms. Both proteins assemble to form pentameric structures whose size and shape are compatible with formation of vertices in an icosahedral shell. Combining these pentamers with the hexamers previously elucidated gives two plausible, preliminary atomic models for the carboxysome shell."
https://openalex.org/W2071778976,"Earthquakes, whatever their size, can trigger other earthquakes. Mainshocks cause aftershocks to occur, which in turn activate their own local aftershock sequences, resulting in a cascade of triggering that extends the reach of the initial mainshock. A long-lasting difficulty is to determine which earthquakes are connected, either directly or indirectly. Here we show that this causal structure can be found probabilistically, with no a priori model nor parameterization. Large regional earthquakes are found to have a short direct influence in comparison to the overall aftershock sequence duration. Relative to these large mainshocks, small earthquakes collectively have a greater effect on triggering. Hence, cascade triggering is a key component in earthquake interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2010188939,"The recent derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines from a number of different sources, including reprogrammed adult somatic cells, raises the issue of the developmental equivalence of these different pluripotent states. At least two different states representing the epiblast progenitors in the blastocyst and the pluripotent progenitors of the later gastrulating embryo have been recognized. Understanding the initial developmental status of the different pluripotent lines is critical for defining starting conditions for differentiation toward therapeutically relevant cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2017043267,"Resident pools of somatic stem cells in many organs are responsible for tissue maintenance and repair. The goal of regenerative medicine is to exploit these cells either by transplanting them from an exogenous source or by activating endogenous stem cells pharmacologically. For diseases caused by mutations in a single gene, the therapeutic goal is tissue replacement using stem cells engineered to correct the genetic defect. However, a number of technical hurdles must be overcome before therapies based on pluripotent human stem cells can enter the clinic. Resident pools of somatic stem cells in many organs are responsible for tissue maintenance and repair. The goal of regenerative medicine is to exploit these cells either by transplanting them from an exogenous source or by activating endogenous stem cells pharmacologically. For diseases caused by mutations in a single gene, the therapeutic goal is tissue replacement using stem cells engineered to correct the genetic defect. However, a number of technical hurdles must be overcome before therapies based on pluripotent human stem cells can enter the clinic. Our aging human population is increasingly burdened by degenerative diseases that are largely treated by surgery and drugs designed to mitigate symptoms. Given their role in maintaining and replenishing tissues, stem cells represent a potential means of restoring tissue function and thereby treating the root cause of degenerative disease. Gene therapy for genetic diseases might also prove feasible when coupled to ex vivo repair of the patient's stem cells prior to autologous transplantation. The pharmaceutical industry is adept at medicinal chemistry and the manufacture of protein therapeutics with the same degree of precision as the manufacture of small molecules. However, industry has yet to master the production of pharmaceutical grade cells, and a business model whereby cells can be manufactured as products that can be purchased “off-the-shelf” has proven elusive (see Analysis by A. Parson in this issue of Cell). This raises central questions for the future of cell-based therapies, especially those based on stem cells. Must cell therapies always be customized for specific patients and thus remain a labor-intensive, individualized form of medical treatment? Or can cells be produced in bulk from master stocks of cells and be delivered directly from cell banks to patients in response to a physician's prescription? What are the prospects for delivering drugs that augment endogenous stem cell pools? The answers to these questions will dictate the manner in which stem cells impact regenerative medicine. Stem cells can be used to restore tissue function either as integrated participants in the target tissue or as vehicles that deliver complex signals to a target tissue without actually integrating into the tissue itself. Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is the gold standard for restoring tissue function by engraftment of the stem cells directly into target tissue. In contrast, mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) appear to work by the second mechanism to improve damaged heart tissue. MSCs offer a strategy for using stem cells as a platform to deliver drug-like effects as they do not appear to be incorporated into tissues in settings such as ischemic cardiac injury. This lack of incorporation and the complexity of measuring improved cardiac tissue performance have engendered controversy about their use, yet the number of studies that indicate at least a short-term beneficial effect is hard to dismiss. MSCs appear to provide some paracrine trophic effect that may in part be mediated by modulators of Wnt signaling such as secreted frizzled related protein-2 (Mirotsou et al., 2007Mirotsou M. Zhang Z. Deb A. Zhang L. Gnecchi M. Noiseux N. Mu H. Pachori A. Dzau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Studies of other tissue injury models such as graft-versus-host disease or bleomycin-induced mouse lung injury also note amelioration of damage with infusions of MSCs, which they propose is due to anti-inflammatory effects (in the latter case through the release of IL-1 receptor antagonist; Ortiz et al., 2007Ortiz L.A. Dutreil M. Fattman C. Pandey A.C. Torres G. Go K. Phinney D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 11002-11007Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Although the immunologic or tissue trophic effects of MSCs are being elucidated, their real therapeutic potential remains unclear. If somatic stem cells are to serve as factor delivery vehicles or be incorporated into tissue, we need to know how they traffic to their targeted sites. All somatic stem cells migrate during development. Notably and of great therapeutic consequence, HSCs continue to migrate in the mature mammal and therefore hematologists/oncologists can collect HSCs for transplantation by pheresis. However, large numbers of HSCs must still be collected because we do not know the most efficient way to deliver them to their sites of action. There is ample evidence that molecules such as α4- and α6β1-integrins, PSGL-1, and E- and L-selectin ligands participate in the interaction of HSCs with endothelium (see Review by D.J. Laird et al. in this issue). Also, the CXC chemokine, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) or CXCL12, has been implicated in transmigration of HSCs to the bone marrow during development. However, SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 are not essential for bone marrow engraftment, suggesting that there is much to learn about the localization and engraftment of HSCs even though they are the best understood and clinically applied of all stem cell types. Localization is even murkier with other stem cell types such as MSCs. Reportedly, MSCs have been isolated from the circulation and, along with other tissue stem cells, are believed to migrate to sites of injury (Palumbo et al., 2007Palumbo R. Galvez B.G. Pusterla T. De Marchis F. Cossu G. Marcu K.B. Bianchi M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2003Wu G.D. Nolta J.A. Jin Y.S. Barr M.L. Yu H. Starnes V.A. Cramer D.V. Transplantation. 2003; 75: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). MSC migration appears to depend on molecules involved in immune cell localization such as the CC chemokine MCP-3 (Schenk et al., 2007Schenk S. Mal N. Finan A. Zhang M. Kiedrowski M. Popovic Z. McCarthy P.M. Penn M.S. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and β1 integrins (Ip et al., 2007Ip J.E. Wu Y. Huang J. Zhang L. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2873-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Whether SDF-1 or CXCR4 participate in localizing MSCs is controversial. A deeper investigation into homing has led to a new strategy for applying MSCs therapeutically. Ex vivo modification of the glycans on CD44, which is expressed by MSCs, modulates their interaction with receptors known to be expressed by the bone marrow microvasculature, dramatically increasing the efficiency of MSC delivery to bone (Sackstein et al., 2008Sackstein R. Merzaban J.S. Cain D.W. Dagia N.M. Spencer J.A. Lin C.P. Wohlgemuth R. Nat. Med. 2008; (Published online January 13, 2008)https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Alternative strategies that target the site of desired localization are also being tested in the hopes of enriching the bed into which stem cells are recruited. Protease-resistant chemokines tethered to self-assembling peptides injected into a desired site of recruitment in the damaged heart led to improvements not only in cell localization but also functional outcomes (Segers et al., 2007Segers V.F. Tokunou T. Higgins L.J. MacGillivray C. Gannon J. Lee R.T. Circulation. 2007; 116: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). HSCs face the lowest hurdles for stem cell delivery because the liquid nature of hematopoiesis permits ready engagement of the bone marrow. Clearly, there are very different requirements for the replacement of cardiac or neural tissue. Replaying morphogenic programs to drive complex tissue relationships is a daunting prospect, casting doubt on these efforts. Recent evidence, however, suggests that recapitulating tissue structure may be possible. For example, vascular cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can self-assemble into blood-carrying conduits in vivo and spontaneously enact anastamoses with the host vasculature (Levenberg et al., 2002Levenberg S. Golub J.S. Amit M. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 4391-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Thus, there may be some degree of intrinsic morphogenic capability that will assist efforts to use cell replacement therapy or to create tissue constructs. This capability may be assisted by engineered scaffolds. For example, cardiomyocytes assemble into functional units that coordinate synchronous impulse propagation on biocompatible thin films in vitro and can be shaped into 3D structures (Feinberg et al., 2007Feinberg A.W. Feigel A. Shevkoplyas S.S. Sheehy S. Whitesides G.M. Parker K.K. Science. 2007; 317: 1366-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Also, matrices can be generated with graded concentrations of signaling and tethering molecules that enable heterologous cells to assemble in an organized manner. Combining cell-intrinsic morphogenic properties and engineered scaffolds to assist them offers the potential for more complex tissue reconstruction in the future. However, we need to better understand organ morphogenesis to fully exploit this possibility. The interface of developmental and stem cell biology with tissue engineering ultimately promises to transform regenerative medicine. Cell transplantation is but one of several ways in which somatic stem cells may contribute clinically. With the burgeoning awareness of immature cell populations in many tissues that participate in maintenance and, under particular conditions, also repair damaged tissue, activating endogenous stem cells in situ has broad applications. The key is to identify which signals guide the behavior of these cells and to determine whether those signals can be pharmacologically modulated to induce a more vigorous reparative response. This requires a deeper understanding of the stem cell microenvironment or niche (see Review by S.J. Morrison and A.C. Spradling in this issue). Defining the components of that niche and how the niche translates tissue state into stem cell behavior will provide a rational basis for developing drugs to target endogenous stem cells. One such example is the recognition that osteoblasts—a type of mesenchymal cell in the bone marrow niche—regulate the number of HSCs. However, the molecules involved, the requirement for physical interaction, and whether all or just a subset of osteoblasts participate remain to be determined (Calvi et al., 2003Calvi L.M. Adams G.B. Weibrecht K.W. Weber J.M. Olson D.P. Knight M.C. Martin R.P. Schipani E. Divieti P. Bringhurst F.R. et al.Nature. 2003; 425: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar, Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J.

Feng J.Q. et al.Nature. 2003; 425: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). But what has been shown is that activation of the parathyroid receptor on the osteoblast can change HSC behavior resulting in increased stem cell numbers, enhanced tolerance to cytotoxic injury, and improved engraftment efficiency in animal models (Adams et al., 2007Adams G.B. Martin R.P. Alley I.R. Chabner K.T. Cohen K.S. Calvi L.M. Kronenberg H.M. Scadden D.T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). These studies have now entered the clinical arena to determine whether parathyroid hormone can improve the outcome of patients receiving umbilical cord blood transplants. Direct pharmacologic targeting of stem cells in vivo has some experimental support. For example, prostaglandin E2 was shown to increase zebrafish and mouse HSCs and improve the outcome of mouse bone marrow transplantation (North et al., 2007North T.E. Goessling W. Walkley C.R. Lengerke C. Kopani K.R. Lord A.M. Weber G.J. Bowman T.V. Jang I.H. Grosser T. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Also, proteasome inhibitors were shown to prompt increased MSC production of osteoblasts, in part by upregulating the transcription factor Runx-2 (Mukherjee et al., 2008Mukherjee S. Raje N. Schoonmaker J.A. Liu J.C. Hideshima T. Wein M.N. Jones D.C. Vallet S. Bouxsein M.L. Pozzi S. et al.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 491-504PubMed Google Scholar). This strategy has been applied to a mouse model of osteoporosis to improve bone density. The potential for modifying stem cells in situ is best illustrated by a bold set of experiments pairing animals of different ages by surgical connection of their circulatory systems. This parabiosis model was used to test whether material in the circulation might alter the aged phenotype (Conboy et al., 2005Conboy I.M. Conboy M.J. Wagers A.J. Girma E.R. Weissman I.L. Rando T.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). Comingling the circulatory systems of an aged mouse and a young mouse reverted impaired muscle stem cell activity in the older animal to a younger phenotype. The improved phenotype was observed in molecular terms (increased Notch signaling) and in repair of muscle injury. Wnt regulating factors in serum have been implicated in the improved phenotype as increased Wnt signaling in aged animals favors a fibrotic rather than a myogenic response (Brack et al., 2007Brack A.S. Conboy M.J. Roy S. Lee M. Kuo C.J. Keller C. Rando T.A. Science. 2007; 317: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). These studies have clear implications for drug-based enhancement of stem cell function and tissue repair. Like organ transplants, stem cell transplants confront an immune barrier, which requires either that transplants be autologous (derived from “self-tissues”) or that patients take immunosuppressive drugs if the transplants are allogeneic (that is, from unrelated donors). To provide wider access to cell therapies and to avoid the need for immune suppression, one of the ambitions of regenerative medicine is to produce genetically equivalent (isogenic) cells. This can be achieved by producing pluripotent ESCs from adult somatic cells by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT; in which an adult somatic cell nucleus is injected into an enucleated oocyte) or by direct reprogramming of the adult somatic cells back to a pluripotent state using a transcription factor cocktail. Pluripotent ESCs created by SCNT (so-called ntESCs) can be used both to model diseases and as rejection-proof “autologous” tissues for cell replacement therapies. This theoretical approach has been reduced to practice in mouse models to treat genetic immunodeficiency with HSCs (Rideout et al., 2001Rideout 3rd, W.M. Eggan K. Jaenisch R. Science. 2001; 293: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and to treat a Parkinson's-like syndrome with dopaminergic neurons (Barberi et al., 2003Barberi T. Klivenyi P. Calingasan N.Y. Lee H. Kawamata H. Loonam K. Perrier A.L. Bruses J. Rubio M.E. Topf N. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1200-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Although cloned organisms resulting from SCNT have health defects due to faulty reprogramming, ntESCs seem to be equivalent to ESCs derived from naturally fertilized embryos (Brambrink et al., 2006Brambrink T. Hochedlinger K. Bell G. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Apparently the process of establishing ESCs in culture entails a winnowing of incompletely reprogrammed clones and selection for those clones that have sustained effective reprogramming and pluripotency. Although ntESCs can be readily generated from the mouse, only recently have two ntESC lines been derived from rhesus macaques (Byrne et al., 2007Byrne J.A. Pedersen D.A. Clepper L.L. Nelson M. Sanger W.G. Gokhale S. Wolf D.P. Mitalipov S.M. Nature. 2007; 450: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). This report suggests that SCNT might indeed be feasible in humans, and as long as healthy oocytes are available for research, it is only a matter of time before cloned human blastocysts and human ntESC lines are generated by SCNT (French et al., 2008French A.J. Adams C.A. Anderson L.S. Kitchen J.R. Hughes M.R. Wood S.H. Stem Cells. 2008; (Published online January 17, 2008)https://doi.org/10.1634/stemcells.2007–0252Crossref Google Scholar). Given the hardships involved in donating oocytes, alternatives that avoid the need for oocytes altogether are ultimately preferable but depend on being able to recapitulate the reprogramming process in vitro. The groundbreaking work of Shinya Yamanaka has shown that retroviral transduction of only four genes encoding the transcription factors c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4, and Sox2 is sufficient to induce a state of pluripotency in adult murine and human fibroblasts (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K.

Sridharan R. Xie W. Utikal J. Eminli S. Arnold K. Stadtfeld M. Yachechko R. Tcheiu J.

Nie J. Jonsdottir G.A. Ruotti V. Stewart R. et al.Science. 2007; 318: 1917-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (7585) Google Scholar) systems. The four transcription factors are introduced by retroviral infection and appear to mediate the reprogramming process over several weeks in culture, resulting in induced pluripotent (iPS) cells that closely resemble ESCs (see Review by R. Jaenisch and R. Young in this issue). In all cases, the retroviruses are silenced, and the pluripotent state of the reprogrammed cells ultimately hinges upon the activity of endogenous genes. Unraveling the mechanisms of reprogramming should identify ways to make this process more efficient. However, there are challenges if iPS cells are to be used therapeutically because three of the reprogramming factors—Myc, Klf4, and Lin28 (or close relatives)—have been linked with oncogenesis, and although Myc is not essential for reprogramming, retroviral insertion alone can cause deleterious and cancer-causing mutations. Indeed, the reversion of mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts) to iPS colonies expressing cadherins mimics the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition characteristic of malignant transformation in some tissues, suggesting that reprogramming and tumorigenesis may entail a similar dedifferentiation process. By reprogramming adult somatic cells from patients to iPS cells that can then be differentiated into a variety of tissues in vitro, the goal is to generate patient-specific tissues for regenerative medicine. An important next step will be to evaluate whether methods for transient expression of the three or four factor reprogramming cocktail might be sufficient to induce iPS cell formation, and whether small molecules can replace these transcription factors. It is appealing to imagine that therapeutic reprogramming strategies might ultimately be aimed at diverting one adult somatic cell type directly into another, without reverting all the way back to a pluripotent state. Single-gene disorders may be the best targets for combined gene repair and cell replacement therapy using pluripotent stem cells. Such cells are immortal in culture, which facilitates precise gene repair and characterization of the cells for safety. A recent study demonstrates the feasibility of this approach (Hanna et al., 2007Hanna J. Wernig M. Markoulaki S. Sun C.W. Meissner A. Cassady J.P. Beard C. Brambrink T. Wu L.C. Townes T.M. Jaenisch R. Science. 2007; 318: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). These investigators reported amelioration of symptoms in a mouse model of sickle cell anemia after transplant of HSCs derived from iPS cells (prepared from skin cells of these mice) in which the genetic defect had been repaired. Although promising, both direct reprogramming and reprogramming by SCNT remain highly cumbersome, labor-intensive, and inefficient processes and present enormous practical barriers to their widespread use to treat disease. We assume that tissue histocompatability is a prerequisite for cell replacement therapy, but there is a remarkable vacuum of knowledge about the immune responses directed against most classes of stem cells. Some data suggest that human ESCs may be less susceptible to immune attack either because of low-level expression of class I HLA molecules or active suppression of the immune response through uncertain mechanisms (Drukker et al., 2006Drukker M.

Study of the host immune response to transplanted stem cells needs to be given more prominence in the stem cell field. Because of the cost and inconvenience of customized patient-specific therapies, an appealing strategy is to engineer a pluripotent cell line that is invisible to the immune system and can thereby serve as a universal donor. Such a cell might have to be rendered deficient in class I and II HLA genes and ligands that activate cytotoxicity receptors on natural killer (NK) cells, to express class I mimics such as HLA-G (Mandelboim et al., 1997Mandelboim O. Pazmany L. Davis D.M. Vales-Gomez M. Reyburn H.T. Rybalov B. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 14666-14670Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and to engage inhibitory NK cell receptors. Generating such a cell is daunting given that it might entail genetic manipulation of scores of loci. An alternative strategy might be to express proteins in transplanted cells that would actively antagonize invading immune cells. Expression of indoleamine dioxygenase, an enzyme that degrades tryptophan, an essential amino acid necessary for T cell function, is believed to be an important feature of the immune privilege of the invading trophoblast tissue of the developing embryo (Munn et al., 1998Munn D.H. Zhou M. Attwood J.T. Bondarev I. Conway S.J. Marshall B. Brown C. Mellor A.L. Science. 1998; 281: 1191-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar; see Essay by J. Rossant in this issue). Indeed, a better understanding of the immune mechanisms operating at the maternal-fetal interface may help to define ways to achieve universal donor capability from a single or very limited number of human pluripotent cell lines. International registries of bone marrow donors and public cord blood banks enable the transplantation of allogeneic HSCs to treat a variety of blood cancers and genetic diseases, but will such registries and banks be required for the widespread application of stem cell transplants? Interestingly, computer simulations that match individuals in transplant donor registries with potential recipients have shown that a large but feasible number of carefully selected cell lines could be banked and could provide a productive tissue match for large segments of the population (if we accept the need for immunosuppressive medication). In a study to identify histocompatibility between 10,000 potential donors and some 6500 renal allograft recipients, only 150 donors were needed to identify a perfect 6/6 antigen match for nearly 20% of the recipients; when the criteria were loosened to allow a single antigen match only, the same number of donors matched nearly 85% of recipients (Taylor et al., 2005Taylor C.J. Bolton E.M. Pocock S. Sharples L.D. Pedersen R.A. Bradley J.A. Lancet. 2005; 366: 2019-2025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Importantly, donors with homozygosity, which present only 3 rather than 6 distinct histocompatiblity antigens, were far more likely to yield productive matches with recipients. Indeed, as few as 10 donors produced perfect matches for nearly 38% of recipients and productive single antigen matches for 67% of recipients. A simulation performed within a Japanese cohort concluded that 100 homozygous donors could match 80% of the recipients (Nakajima et al., 2007Nakajima F. Tokunaga K. Nakatsuji N. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both of these studies highlight the feasibility of creating banks of stem cell lines for tissue transplantation. Humans with homozygous HLA haplotypes are rare in the population but might be identified from transplant registries and approached to donate tissue for generating pluripotent stem cells. Alternatively, pluripotent stem cells with homozygous HLA might be generated from parthenogenetic embryos (pESCs; Kim et al., 2007aKim K. Lerou P. Yabuuchi A. Lengerke C. Ng K. West J. Kirby A.

Primate pESCs have been derived from cynomolgous monkeys (Cibelli et al., 2002Cibelli J.B. Grant K.A. Chapman K.B. Cunniff K. Worst T. Green H.L. Walker S.J. Gutin P.H. Vilner L. Tabar V. et al.Science. 2002; 295: 819Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and the first human ESC line purportedly made by SCNT has actually proven to be the first human pESC line (Kim et al., 2007bKim K. Ng K. Rugg-Gunn P.J. Shieh J.-H. Kirak O. Jaenisch R. Wakayama T. Moore M.A. Pederson R.A. Daley G.Q. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 1-7Google Scholar). Recently, an independent group has confirmed the isolation of 10 human pESCs at robust efficiency, including 4 that show HLA homozygosity (Revazova et al., 2007Revazova E.S. Turovets N.A. Kochetkova O.D. Agapova L.S. Sebastian J.L. Pryzhkova M.V. Smolnikova V.I. Kuzmichev L.N. Janus J.D. Cloning Stem Cells. 2007; (Published online December 19, 2007)https://doi.org/10.1089/clo.2007.0063Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Generating pESCs from even modest numbers of human oocytes appears practical and could be the basis for building banks of stem cells that could provide a source of tissues for transplantation. Because of aberrant imprinting, tissues from pESCs might not grow or function properly, but stable and functional hematopoietic engraftment has been reported from parthenogenetic cells in mice (Eckardt et al., 2007Eckardt S. Leu N.A. Bradley H.L. Kato H. Bunting K.D. McLaughlin K.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and in a rare human parthenogenetic chimera (Strain et al., 1995Strain L. Warner J.P. Johnston T. Bonthron D.T. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). If pESC-derived tissues prove safe and effective after careful functional analyses, then pESCs might represent a favorable resource for stem cell banking and “off-the-shelf” tissue replacement therapies. Unanticipated challenges in safety or efficacy might render stem cells or their progeny less than ideal for cell replacement therapies. Nevertheless, insights gleaned from stem cell biology may facilitate classical drug development and will no doubt accelerate progress in affiliated fields like tissue engineering, physiology, systems biology, and developmental biology. Even in the unlikely case that stem cells fail to realize their promise for tissue replacement therapy, their value for in vitro discovery will forever remain unchallenged."
https://openalex.org/W2106278873,"Much current experimental research on transport in molecular junctions focuses on finite voltages, where substantial polarization-induced nonlinearities may result in technologically relevant device-type responses. Because molecules have strong polarization responses to changing charge state or external field, molecules isolated between electrodes can show strongly nonlinear current-voltage responses. For small applied voltages (up to ∼0.3 volt), weak interaction between transporting electrons and molecular vibrations provides the basis for inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. At higher voltages and for certain time scale regimes, strong coupling effects occur, including Coulomb blockade, negative differential resistance, dynamical switching and switching noise, current hysteresis, heating, and chemical reactions. We discuss a general picture for such phenomena that arise from charging, strong correlation, and polarization (electronic and vibrational) effects in the molecule and at the interface."

How can proteins, synthesized in the soma, act on specific synapses that participate in a given memory? We studied the dynamics of newly synthesized AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) induced with learning using transgenic mice expressing the GluR1 subunit fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP-GluR1) under control of the c-fos promoter. We found learning-associated recruitment of newly synthesized GFP-GluR1 selectively to mushroom-type spines in adult hippocampal CA1 neurons 24 hours after fear conditioning. Our results are consistent with a “synaptic tagging” model to allow activated synapses to subsequently capture newly synthesized receptor and also demonstrate a critical functional distinction in the mushroom spines with learning."

IL-6 is also known to modulate the differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. IL-6 is believed to play a positive regulatory role in osteoclast differentiation by inducing the expression of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) on the surface of osteoblasts: RANKL then interacts with RANK expressed on osteoclast progenitors, inducing osteoclast differentiation via the RANK signaling pathway, which involves NF-κB, JNK, and p38.

Bone tissue is continuously remodeled under physiological conditions (1Wagner E.F. Karsenty G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), but dysregulation of the balance between bone formation and resorption induces pathological conditions, including osteoporosis and osteosclerosis. Bone remodeling is maintained by two key cell populations, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, which are regulated by cytokines, hormones, and growth factors (2Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L.

IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine produced by various cell types that regulates hematopoiesis, acute phase reactions, immune responses, and bone homeostasis (6Ishihara K. Hirano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Ishihara K. Hirano T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 8Itoh S. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Yoshitake F. Narita H. Ebisu S. Ishihara K. Bone. 2006; 39: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The receptor for IL-6 consists of a ligand-binding subunit and a common signal-transducing subunit, gp130 (9Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). gp130 contains a number of tyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic region, as well as four copies of the YXXQ motif, which is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. Activated STAT3 dimerizes, enters the nucleus, and regulates the transcription of various genes that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation in a cell-specific manner (6Ishihara K. Hirano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Itoh S. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Yoshitake F. Narita H. Ebisu S. Ishihara K. Bone. 2006; 39: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Tyr-759 of gp130 is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-2, which activates the MAPK ERK via a complex comprising SHP2, Gab1/2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 (10Nishida K.

It has been reported that IL-6 together with soluble IL-6 receptor acts to induce the expression of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) on the surface of osteoblasts. RANKL interacts with RANK, which is expressed on the surface of osteoclast progenitors. Coculture experiments have demonstrated that this interaction is indispensable for the differentiation of osteoclast progenitors into mature osteoclasts (13Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Katagiri T. Tamura T. Wada S. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Hirota H. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Suda T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1461-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Induction of RANKL expression on the surface of an osteoblastic cell line via the IL-6-gp130-STAT3 signaling pathway was demonstrated in vitro (14O'Brien C.A. Gubrij I. Lin S.C. Saylors R.L. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19301-19308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although these in vitro data suggested that IL-6-gp130-STAT3 signaling stimulates osteoblasts and supports osteoclastogenesis, IL-6 transgenic mice showed decreased osteoclast numbers and bone resorption (15Kitamura H. Kawata H. Takahashi F. Higuchi Y. Furuichi T. Ohkawa H. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1682-1692PubMed Google Scholar). One critical difference in vivo might be the lack of soluble IL-6 receptor under physiological steady-state conditions. The complexity of the in vivo situation is further underscored by a report showing that gp130 signaling has opposing effects in terms of bone formation in osteoblasts versus osteoclasts; gp130 signaling up-regulates the expression of RANKL on osteoblasts but down-regulates RANK expression on osteoclast progenitors (16Palmqvist P. Persson E. Conaway H.H. Lerner U.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 3353-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). These results have made it difficult to interpret the phenotypes of mutant mouse lines in which genes expressed in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts are manipulated and suggest that the in vivo roles of IL-6-gp130-STAT3 signaling in osteoblasts and osteoclasts should be examined separately. To this end, we disrupted the STAT3 gene in an osteoblast-specific manner. The resulting osteoporotic phenotype clearly demonstrated that STAT3 signaling in osteoblasts in vivo has a positive regulatory role in the differentiation of this cell type, leading to bone formation but not osteoclastogenesis (8Itoh S. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Yoshitake F. Narita H. Ebisu S. Ishihara K. Bone. 2006; 39: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). On the other hand, other groups have reported that hematopoietic cell-specific STAT3-deficient mice also display an osteoporotic phenotype but due to the augmentation of osteoclast differentiation (17Zhang Z. Welte T. Troiano N. Maher S.E. Fu X.Y. Bothwell A.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The latter phenotype, which is reciprocally compatible with the phenotype observed in IL-6 transgenic mice, implies that IL-6/STAT3 plays a negative regulatory role in the differentiation of osteoclast progenitors. The mechanism underlying this negative regulatory role, however, has not yet been clarified, prompting us to reevaluate the in vitro effects of IL-6 on osteoclast progenitors. We now report that IL-6 acts directly on osteoclast progenitors to suppress their differentiation. Furthermore, we found that the suppressive effect of IL-6 on osteoclastic cells is mediated through a reduction in both JNK activation and IκB degradation. Microarray analyses revealed reduced expression of Senp2 and Cul4A, which are involved in the ubiquitination pathway, and increased expression of MKP1 and MKP7, which encode MAPK phosphatases. We thus demonstrate that IL-6 inhibits osteoclast differentiation by specifically suppressing the RANK signaling pathways. Osteoclast Cultures—Bone marrow cells obtained from the femurs of ddY mice (4–6-week-old adults) were cultured for 16 h in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/ml M-CSF. Nonadherent hematopoietic cells were harvested and further cultured with 10 ng/ml M-CSF for 2 days. Adherent cells were used as bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) and were incubated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml IL-6 in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 100 ng/ml RANKL. After 24 h, the adherent cells were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells was counted. Resorption Pit Assay—BMMs were plated onto dentine slices and cultured with or without 100 ng/ml IL-6 in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 100 ng/ml RANKL for 7 or 14 days. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing these reagents every 3 days. At culture termination, the slices were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (-) and left overnight in 1 m ammonium hydroxide to remove all attached cells. The slices were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (-) and stained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). MTT Assay—Cell proliferation was measured using the MTT assay. The BMMs (1 × 106 cells) were cultured in 100 μl of medium containing fetal calf serum and M-CSF (10 ng/ml) with or without IL-6 (100 ng/ml). For the last 4 h of culture, 10 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml diluted in phosphate-buffered saline) was added. Finally, 100 μl of 0.04 n HCl in isopropanol was added and mixed by pipetting, and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a plate reader. Western Blotting—After the osteoclast progenitors were stimulated with IL-6 family cytokines, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 500 μm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were diluted with 20 μl of 3× Laemmli SDS loading buffer, separated on a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Dai-ichi Kagaku, Tokyo), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% gelatin and incubated with rabbit anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-p38, anti-JNK, anti-IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-ubiquitin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed three times with TBST for 10 min each and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:10,000 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The membranes were then washed three times with TBST. Immune complexes were visualized using a chemiluminescence system (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Molecular Characterization of Osteoclast Maturation Using Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—RNA was isolated from BMMs incubated for 24 h with or without 100 ng/ml IL-6 in the presence of 50 ng/ml M-CSF and 100 ng/ml RANKL using Sepasol-RNA I (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and reverse transcribed. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis was conducted as described previously (11Itoh S. Itoh M. Nishida K. Yamasaki S. Yoshida Y. Narimatsu M. Park S.J. Hibi M. Ishihara K. Hirano T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5110-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used were the following: TRAP forward, 5′-AAATCACTCTTCAAGACCAG-3′; TRAP reverse, 5′-TTATTGAACAGCAGTGACAG-3′; calcitonin receptor (CTR) forward, 5′-ACCGACGAGCAACGCCTACGC-3′; CTR reverse, 5′-GCCTTCACAGCCTTCAGGTAC-3′; HPRT forward, 5′-AGCGATGATGAACCAGGT-3′; and HPRT reverse, 5′-GGCTGTACTGCTTAACCA-3′. Microarray Analysis—A comparison of GeneChip array data was obtained using the KURABO custom analysis services (KURABO Industries, Osaka, Japan, an authorized service provider for Affymetrix Japan K.K. (Tokyo)). Total RNA was isolated from BMMs incubated for 24 h with or without 100 ng/ml IL-6 in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF and 100 ng/ml RANKL using Sepasol-RNA I. Total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using T7 oligo(dT) primer (Affymetrix). The cDNA products were used in an in vitro transcription reaction containing T7 RNA polymerase and biotinylated nucleotide analogs (pseudouridine base). Next, the labeled cDNA products were fragmented, loaded onto GeneChip(R) Mouse Genome 430 A2.0 arrays (Affymetrix), and hybridized according to the manufacturer's protocols. Streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as a fluorescent conjugate to detect the hybridized target sequences. Raw intensity data from the GeneChip array were analyzed with GeneChip operating software (Affymetrix). Real-time PCR—Quantitative real-time PCRs were performed using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). TaqMan probes were also purchased from Applied Biosystems. All quantitative reverse transcription-PCRs were performed using an ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), and all samples were run in triplicate. The ABI 7500 Fast Sequence detector was programmed with the following PCR amplification conditions: 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s and 60 °C for 30 s. All quantitation was normalized to the housekeeping gene HPRT, an endogenous control that accounted for variability in the initial concentrations of RNA and in the conversion efficiency of the reverse transcription reactions. Analysis of the relative quantitation required calculations based on the threshold cycle, i.e. the cycle number at which the amplification plot crosses a fixed threshold above the baseline (Ct). Relative quantitation was performed using the comparative ΔΔCt method according to the manufacturer's instructions. IL-6 Has a Suppressive Effect on Osteoclast Differentiation—IL-6 induces the surface expression of RANKL on osteoblasts, which supports osteoclast differentiation via a direct interaction between RANKL and RANK. To examine the direct effect of IL-6 on osteoclasts, a culture system was used in which BMMs differentiate into TRAP-positive multinuclear cells upon stimulation with M-CSF and RANKL. In this culture system, the addition of IL-6 strongly suppressed the differentiation of BMMs, as evaluated by the number of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells (Fig. 1, A–C). To determine the resorption activity of the differentiated osteoclasts, we employed pit assays. Resorption pits were observed on dentin slices when the BMMs were cultured with M-CSF and RANKL (Fig. 1, D and F). When IL-6 was added, however, the resorption activity was almost completely suppressed (Fig. 1, E and G). These results imply that IL-6 has a suppressive effect on the differentiation of BMMs into osteoclasts. Moreover, we confirmed the suppressive effect of IL-6 on osteoclast differentiation by analyzing marker gene expression. BMMs cultured with M-CSF and RANKL showed high expression levels of TRAP mRNA after 24 h and cathepsin K mRNA after 48 h. The expression of CTR mRNA was induced at 24 h, and the level of expression increased during the subsequent 24 h (Fig. 2A). The addition of IL-6 strongly suppressed the expression of all these marker genes. The suppressive effects of IL-6 on the expression of these genes were confirmed with quantitative real-time PCR analyses (Fig. 2B). IL-6 suppressed the mRNA expression of TRAP, CTR, and cathepsin K by 71% (at 24 h), 99% (at 48 h), and 99% (at 48 h), respectively. On the other hand, IL-6 augmented the proliferation activity of BMMs (Fig. 3). These results clearly demonstrated that IL-6 acted on the BMMs to strongly suppress osteoclast differentiation.FIGURE 2Molecular characterization of osteoclast differentiation. BMMs were cultured with M-CSF (10 ng/ml), M-CSF plus sRANKL (100 ng/ml), or M-CSF plus sRANKL plus IL-6 (100 ng/ml). After 24 and 48 h, RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed in three independent experiments. A, cDNA was amplified using primers specific for TRAP, CTR, cathepsin K, and HPRT. B, samples were subjected to quantitative real-time PCRs using probes specific for TRAP, CTR, cathepsin K, and HPRT.

TRAF6 expression levels in BMMs stimulated by RANKL and IL-6 were similar to those in BMMs stimulated by RANKL alone (Fig. 4). We next analyzed the effect of IL-6 on three other downstream signaling pathways. Although RANKL stimulation alone induced IκB degradation, IκB degradation was not observed in BMMs stimulated by both RANKL and IL-6 (Fig. 5). IL-6 also suppressed the tyrosine phosphorylation of JNK but not of p38 (Fig. 5). These results demonstrated that IL-6 specifically suppresses IκB degradation and the activation of JNK.FIGURE 5The effects of IL-6 on the NF-κB, JNK, and p38 signaling pathways in BMMs. BMMs were stimulated by sRANKL alone or sRANKL plus IL-6 at the indicated time points. Phosphorylation and the expression of the indicated signaling molecules were determined by Western blotting. ERK2 is shown as a loading control. All data are representative of three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Comprehensive Detection of Changes in Gene Expression following RANKL Stimulation or Costimulation with RANKL and IL-6—Of the signaling molecules activated by the RANKL-RANK interaction, IL-6 stimulation specifically suppressed JNK activation and IκB degradation (Fig. 5). To clarify the mechanism underlying the suppressive effects of IL-6 on these two signaling pathways, we compared the gene expression profiles of BMMs stimulated by RANKL with those of BMMs costimulated with both RANKL and IL-6. The identified genes were grouped into categories according to their ascribed functions (Table 1), including signal transduction (19 genes), metabolism (22 genes), transcription (25 genes), protein synthesis (8 genes), transport (11 genes), cell cycle (7 genes), development (6 genes), immune responses (9 genes), apoptosis (1 gene), chemotaxis (4 genes), angiogenesis (1 gene), and expressed sequence tags or genes of unknown function (70 genes). Among these genes, we identified four genes that could be involved in the IL-6-mediated modulation of RANKL signaling. The expression levels of Senp2 and Cul4A, both of which are related to the ubiquitin pathway, were markedly suppressed by the addition of IL-6. The reduced expression levels of these genes were confirmed using quantitative real-time PCRs (Fig. 6A). The expression levels of both Senp2 and Cul4A increased by 5.0- and 5.6-fold, respectively, in BMMs stimulated with RANKL, whereas they were close to basal levels following costimulation with IL-6. The expression levels of MKP1 and MKP7 were up-regulated by the addition of IL-6; the phosphatases encoded by these genes are known to induce the dephosphorylation of JNK. We also confirmed the expression levels of MKP1 and MKP7 using quantitative real-time PCRs (Fig. 6B). Although the expression levels of MKP1 and MKP7 did not increase following RANKL stimulation, costimulation with RANKL and IL-6 significantly augmented the expression levels of MKP1 and MKP7 by 28- and 80-fold, respectively.TABLE 1Functional classification of the genes with increased or decreased expression levels in osteoclast progenitors Microarray data were obtained from BMMs cultured in the presence of M-CSF (10 ng/ml), M-CSF plus sRANKL (100 ng/ml), or M-CSF plus sRANKL plus IL-6 (100 ng/ml) for 24 h.IncreasedDecreasedTotalSignal transduction16319Metabolism15722Transcription16925Protein synthesis538Transport5611Cell cycle257Development426Immune responses729Apoptosis101Chemotaxis404Angiogenesis101ESTs373370Total11370183 Open table in a new tab We have demonstrated here that IL-6 directly suppresses the differentiation and facilitates the proliferation of osteoclast progenitors. Thus, we propose that IL-6 provides a direct inhibitory signal, through up-regulation of RANKL in osteoblasts, for the differentiation of osteoclast progenitors depending on the microenvironmental conditions. This implies that, in the steady-state interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts in vivo, IL-6 affects only the osteoclast progenitors to suppress their differentiation. When soluble IL-6 receptor is available, IL-6 additionally acts on osteoblasts to induce their differentiation and to facilitate the osteoclast-inducing activity (7Ishihara K. Hirano T.

In other words, IL-6 usually suppresses bone resorption by inhibiting the differentiation of osteoclast progenitors without affecting osteoblasts, whereas under specific conditions, such as inflammation, IL-6 provides discordant signals to osteoclasts and osteoblasts (Fig. 7A) (7Ishihara K.

Effects of IL-6 on bone formation in vivo are determined by the concentrations and combination of IL-6 family cytokines and soluble IL-6 receptor that are present in the areas around the sites of interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclast progenitors (7Ishihara K. Hirano T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 18Kotake S. Sato K. Kim K.J. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Nakamura I. Yamaguchi A. Kishimoto T. Suda T.

It is possible that the simultaneous inhibition of differentiation and stimulation of osteoclast progenitor proliferation results in a temporary suppression of bone resorption that will begin again after proliferation cases. Although all of the analyses described in this report were performed in vitro, we have clearly demonstrated that IL-6 directly suppresses the differentiation of osteoclast progenitors. Our results also suggest that IL-6 plays roles in preventing excessive bone resorption during steady-state bone remodeling (Fig. 7A). Analyses of RANK signaling in osteoclast progenitors revealed that the suppressive effect of IL-6 on differentiation was caused by the suppression of IκB degradation and JNK activation. GeneChip analysis of osteoclast progenitors stimulated with RANKL in the presence or absence of IL-6 allowed us to identify four candidate genes related to JNK and NF-κB signaling: MKP1 and MKP7 code for MAP kinase phosphatases, whereas Senp2 and Cul4A are related to the ubiquitin pathway (Fig. 7B). The MAPK phosphatases are a family of dual-specificity protein phosphatases that can dephosphorylate both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues, which results in the inactivation of MAP kinase (21Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 22Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This family includes MKP1 and MKP7, which are known to inhibit JNK activity (23Katagiri C. Masuda K. Urano T. Yamashita K. Araki Y. Kikuchi K. Shima H. J. Biol.

In our real-time PCR analysis, the expression of MKP1 and MKP7 was reduced by RANKL stimulation, suggesting that the reduced levels of MKP1 and MKP7 efficiently facilitated JNK activation. On the other hand, costimulation with IL-6 and RANKL augmented the expression of MKP1 and MKP7. Thus, MKP1 and MKP7 are likely to be involved in the IL-6-mediated suppression of JNK activation (23Katagiri C. Masuda K. Urano T. Yamashita K. Araki Y. Kikuchi K. Shima H. J. Biol.

Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the activation of NF-κB is achieved via the ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of IκB. When IκB is conjugated with the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1, it becomes resistant to signal-induced degradation (26Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Senp2, which belongs to the Senp family, contains a conserved catalytic domain in the C terminus and SUMO protease activity (27Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The reduction in the Senp2 transcription levels might induce the stabilization of IκB-NFκB complexes due to excess IκB sumoylation, leading to diminished NFκB signaling and decreased osteoclast differentiation (25Yamamoto A. Miyazaki T. Kadono Y. Takayanagi H. Miura T. Nishina H. Katada T. Wakabayashi K. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cul4A, which belongs to the cullin family, is an ubiquitin ligase complex (28Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Although it is still unclear whether the Cul4A complex is associated with IκB ubiquitination, the targets of each cullin family member are now being determined. Taken together, our data indicate the need for further analysis of the IL-6/gp130/STAT3-mediated suppression of the differentiation of osteoclast progenitors and provide clues as to important pathways and mediators for additional study.

This pulsar, long thought to be exclusively rotation-powered, has an inferred surface dipolar magnetic field of 4.9 × 10 13 gauss, which is higher than those of the vast majority of rotation-powered pulsars, but lower than those of the approximately 12 previously identified magnetars. The bursts were accompanied by a sudden flux increase and an unprecedented change in timing behavior. These phenomena lower the magnetic and rotational thresholds associated with magnetar-like behavior and suggest that in neutron stars there exists a continuum of magnetic activity that increases with inferred magnetic field strength."

To target dendritic cells, we enveloped the lentivector with a viral glycoprotein from Sindbis virus engineered to be DC-SIGN–specific. In vitro, this lentivector specifically transduced dendritic cells and induced dendritic cell maturation. A high frequency (up to 12%) of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD8+ T cells and a significant antibody response were observed 2 weeks after injection of a targeted lentiviral vector encoding an OVA transgene into naive mice. This approach also protected against the growth of OVA-expressing E.G7 tumors and induced regression of established tumors. Thus, lentiviral vectors targeting dendritic cells provide a simple method of producing effective immunity and may provide an alternative route for immunization with protein antigens."

Mining the resulting compendium revealed, first, that protein synthesis inhibitors can decouple coordination of nuclear and mtDNA transcription; second, that a subset of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, combined with propranolol, can cause mitochondrial toxicity, yielding potential clues about the etiology of statin myopathy; and, third, that structurally diverse microtubule inhibitors stimulate OXPHOS transcription while suppressing reactive oxygen species, via a transcriptional mechanism involving PGC-1α and ERRα, and thus may be useful in treating age-associated degenerative disorders.

Since CSCs are thought to play an important role in tumorigenesis and tumor recurrence, effective cancer treatments should be targeted at eliminating this population. The CD133 has been identified as a marker of neural stem cells in the adult central nervous system as well as of brain CSCs (7Singh S.K. Clarke I.D. Terasaki M. Bonn V.E. Hawkins C. Squire J.

Although the biological function of CD133 is not well understood, this molecule currently serves as a useful marker for the isolation of CSCs. The CD133-positive cells could be potential targets for cancer therapy. Therefore, recent research is attempting to elucidate the nature and role in tumorigenesis of CSCs. The proliferation and differentiation potential of neural stem cells can be modulated by endogenous and environmental factors (15Reynolds B.A. Tetzlaff W. Weiss S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4565-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A combination of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) promotes their proliferation and differentiation (16Doetsch F. Petreanu L. Caille I. Garcia-Verdugo J.M.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are also classified as neurotrophic factors, which play essential roles in the development, maintenance, and regeneration of the central nervous system (19Andrae J.

These growth factors and their receptors should also be implicated in glioma tumorigenesis and the acquisition of malignancy (22Dai C. Celestino J.C. Okada Y. Louis D.N. Fuller G.N. Holland E.C.

However, it remains unknown which of these growth factors play(s) a pivotal role in the proliferation and differentiation of CSCs. In the present study, we have established CSC lines from three brain tumor patients and examined the growth factor dependence of these CSCs. The data obtained indicate that among the growth factors (EGF, FGF-2, PDGF, VEGF, and HGF) tested, only EGF promoted sphere formation and enhanced the self-renewal capacities of CSCs, including the CD133-positive subpopulations. The ability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors selective for EGF receptor (EGFR) kinase to block CSC self-renewal was also tested. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa; AstraZeneca) and AG1478 quite efficiently inhibited EGF-dependent sphere formation. Gefitinib also significantly decreased the CD133 populations by flow cytometric analysis. Autophosphorylation of EGFR was inhibited by gefitinib in a concentration-dependent manner. Among EGFR downstream signaling molecules (25Woodburn J.R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 26Kari C. Chan T.O. de Quadros M.R. Rodeck U. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Akt kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), but not STAT3, was suppressed by gefitinib. Blockage of both ERK and Akt pathways by selective inhibitors, PD98059 and LY294002, respectively, resulted in considerable inhibition of EGF-dependent sphere formation. These findings indicate that EGF signaling cascade is essential for the maintenance of brain tumor stem cells.

Iwama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 361: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The final cell dilutions ranged from 1 to 1000 cells/well. Cultures were fed 20 μl of medium every 2 days until day 7. The percentage of wells not containing spheres for each cell plating density was calculated and plotted against the number of cells/well. Immunofluorescent Staining—Immunocytochemistry of tumor spheres and differentiated spheres were performed as described (11Oka N. Soeda A. Inagaki A. Onodera M. Maruyama H. Hara A. Kunisada T. Mori H.

Antibodies used were as follows: anti-EGFR (mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), 1:100; Upstate, Temecula, CA), anti-phospho-EGFR (mouse mAb, 1:200; Upstate), human anti-nestin (rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:200; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and CD133 (mouse mAb, 1:10; Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) for the detection of neural stem and progenitor cells, anti-βIII-tubulin (Tuj1) (mouse mAb, 1:200; Chemicon) for neurons, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:500; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) for astrocytes, anti-galactocerebroside (mouse mAb, 1:200; Chemicon) for oligodendrocytes, and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) for the apoptosis assay. Visualization was performed with Alexa fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were simultaneously stained with Hoechst 33342 for identifying nuclei. Transplantation into Immunodeficient Mice—Our experimental procedures involving animals followed the guidelines of the Animal Experimental Committee of Gifu University. Tumorigenicity was determined by injecting brain tumor-derived CSCs orthotopically into nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice. After 8-12 weeks in primary culture, 2 μl of a cell suspension (1 × 108 cells/ml) in proliferation medium was injected stereotactically into the right striatum (0.2 μl/min) of anesthetized NOD-SCID mice using a Hamilton syringe. The injection coordinates were 3 mm to the right of the midline and 2 mm anterior to the coronal suture at a depth of 3 mm. The mice were sacrificed at 4-14 weeks postinjection depending on the injected cell line (11Oka N. Soeda A. Inagaki A. Onodera M. Maruyama H. Hara A. Kunisada T. Mori H. Iwama T. Biochem. Biophys.

Histochemical Analysis of Brain Tissues—Tumor samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. 4-μm sections were cut from paraffinized tissue blocks. They were mounted on silanized slides, dried, deparaffinized with xylene, hydrated with decreasing concentrations of ethanol, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. For hematoxylin-eosin staining, slides were first stained with Harris hematoxylin (2 min) and then counterstained with alcoholic eosin. For immunohistochemical studies, endogenous peroxidase was neutralized with 3% H2O2 in methanol (15 min). The sections were stained with the Histofine mouse stain kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) and then with primary antibodies: anti-human nestin (mouse mAb, 5 μg/ml; R&D Systems) for neural stem cells, anti-human Ki-67 (mouse mAb, 1:50; DAKO) for proliferation indices, anti-GFAP (mouse mAb, 1:500; DAKO) for astrocytes, and anti-human βIII-tubulin (mouse mAb, 1:500; Chemicon) for neurons. After treatment with the secondary antibody and MAX-PO (Nichirei), color reactions were performed with peroxidase-substrate 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAKO). All tissue sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Growth Factor Stimulation—Cultures were initiated in medium containing a combination of EGF and FGF-2 (4Galli R. Binda E.

They were transferred to medium containing human recombinant FGF-2, EGF, PDGF, VEGF, or HGF alone (all factors were added at 20 ng/ml) and cultured for 7-14 days. Upon sphere formation, we assessed the effects of the growth factors by plating 500 cells/well in 96-well plates and adding various concentrations of a growth factor. After sphere formation, the percentage of wells containing spheres was calculated. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was purified from cultures, using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared from RNA templates (5 μg) using oligo(dT) primers and Super Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA product (1 μg) was subjected to PCR with rTaq polymerase (TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Each PCR product was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Forward and reverse primer sequences for the specific amplification of EGFR and a constitutively active EGFR mutant (EGFRvIII) were 5′-CTT CGG GGA GCA GCG ATG CGA C-3′/5′-ACC AAT ACC TAT TCC GTT ACA C-3′. These primers generate a 1044-bp PCR product for the wild-type EGFR transcript compared with a 243-bp PCR product for the EGFRvIII transcript (27Mellinghoff I.K. Wang M.Y. Vivanco I. Haas-Kogan D.A.

The sequences of the gene-specific primers (sense and antisense) were 5′-GCA CCA CAC CTT CTA CAA TGA GC-3′/5′-TTG AAG GTA GTT TCG TGG ATG CC-3′ for β-actin. The amplification conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 42 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56.5 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 80 s for (EGFR/EGFRvIII) and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for β-actin. Antiproliferative Assays—AG1478 (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), a highly selective inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase, was dissolved in Me2SO to obtain final concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μm. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib, a synthetic anilinoquinazoline that targets EGFR, was acquired by dissolving Iressa tablets (250 mg; AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) in the above concentrations of Me2SO. For antiproliferative assays, the tumor spheres were washed and dissociated into single cells with phosphate-buffered saline. They were plated at 500 cells/well in 96-well plates in the medium containing Me2SO, AG1478, or gefitinib (0-10.0 μm) in the presence of EGF (20 ng/ml). After sphere formation, the percentage of wells containing spheres was calculated. For functional analysis of EGFR downstream signals, a selective inhibitor of the ERK pathway, PD98059 (28Janmaat M.L. Kruyt F.A.E. Rodfiguez J.A. Giaccone G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2316-2326PubMed Google Scholar) (EMD Biosciences), and LY294002 (29Gibso S. Tu S. Oyer R. Anderson S.M. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17612-17618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) (EMD Biosciences) for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway were used. 1000 cells were plated in 24-well plates in the medium containing EGF (20 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of PD98059 (10 μm) and/or LY294002 (10 μm). The number of formed spheres was counted. Western Blotting—Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (30Yoshimura S. Sakai H. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Shinoda J. Sakai N. Yamada H. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Inhibition of EGFR signaling by increasing concentrations of gefitinib was assessed by Western blotting for detecting EGFR autophosphorylation with antibodies against EGFR (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and phospho-EGFR (phospho-Tyr1068; Cell Signaling Technology). The activation of EGFR downstream signaling molecules was determined by detecting their phosphorylation. The following antibodies were used: Akt (Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-Akt (phospho-Ser473; Cell Signaling Technology), STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-STAT3 (phospho-Ser727; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), and phospho-ERK1/2 (phospho-Thr202/Tyr204; Cell Signaling Technology). Tumor spheres were lysed in lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After brief sonication, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein content in the supernatant was measured according to the Bradford method. An aliquot (30-50 μg of protein/lane) of total protein was separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to nitrocellulose transfer membranes (0.2 μm; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with TBS-T, the membrane was further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:1,000) in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was performed using enhanced chemilumi-nescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Flow Cytometry—To assess the effects of the EGF and gefitinib on the population of the CD133-positive cells within tumor spheres, 1 × 106 cells were placed in proliferation medium containing growth factors. Different EGF and gefitinib concentrations were added every 2 days; control cells were grown in medium containing an equal concentration of Me2SO. After 7 days, aliquots of CD133-positive and -negative cells were evaluated by flow cytometry with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Aria (BD Biosciences), using anti-CD133/2 (293C3)-allophycocyanin-conjugated antibody (mouse mAb; Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell Colony Formation Assay—Overall survival of the CD133-positive cells in response to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib, was assessed by colony formation. In a colony formation assay, CD133-positive cells dissociated by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter were seeded (5 × 104) in 6-well dishes in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with or without gefitinib and cultured for 5 days. Cell colonies were fixed and stained with 0.04% Crystal Violet in 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Statistical Analysis—Parametric comparisons used analysis of variance. The analyses of variance were followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference adjustment for multiple comparisons. Isolation of Tumorigenic CSCs from Human Gliomas—We analyzed fresh samples from three human brain tumors (two glioblastomas (X01GB and X02GB) and one anaplastic oligoas-trocytoma (X03AOA)) (12Inagaki A. Soeda A. Oka N. Kitajima H. Nakagawa J. Motohashi T. Kunisada T. Iwama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 361: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Dissociated tumor cells, mostly in single-cell suspension, formed neuronal spherelike aggregates within 7 days of culture. The sphere-forming cells resembled previously reported cells from tumor-derived spheres (Fig. 1A) (4Galli R. Binda E. Orfanelli U. Cipelletti B. Gritti A. de Vitis S. Fiocco R. Foroni C. Dimeco F.

The spheres from three CSC lines continuously proliferated, and all lines could be maintained for more than 100 weeks by refeeding fresh medium twice a week (Fig. 2A). X03AOA cells manifested higher proliferative capacity than X01GB and X02GB cells derived from high grade gliomas. The proliferative activity of these cells increased during the late subculture stages compared with earlier passages (data not shown). This phenomenon was previously reported by Galli et al. (4Galli R. Binda E. Orfanelli U. Cipelletti B. Gritti A. de Vitis S. Fiocco R. Foroni C. Dimeco F. Vescovi A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7011-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). Limiting dilution analysis revealed that the number of cells required to form at least 1 tumor sphere/well was significantly less in X03AOA compared with both X01GB and X02GB (Fig. 2B), indicating that X03AOA had the highest clonogenic sphere-forming capacity. X03AOA cells displayed higher proliferative and self-renewal capacity than X01GB and X02GB cells.FIGURE 2Proliferation of cultured brain tumor stem cells.

Cells were cultured in medium containing FGF-2 (20 ng/ml), EGF (20 ng/ml), and leukemia inhibitory factor (1000 units/ml). B, limiting dilution analysis. Sphere cells were dissociated and plated in 96-well culture dishes. The final cell dilutions ranged from 1 to 1000 cells/well.

https://openalex.org/W2127860658,"Epidemiological studies correlate moderate red wine consumption to reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease. Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound in red wine that has cardioprotective effects in rodents. Although endothelial cell (EC) studies indicate that micromolar resveratrol has diverse biological activities, these concentrations are not physiologically relevant because human oral ingestion provides only brief exposure to nanomolar plasma levels. Previously, we reported that nanomolar resveratrol activated ERK1/2 signaling in bovine aortic ECs (BAECs). The goal of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which nanomolar resveratrol rapidly activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). We report for the first time that resveratrol increased interaction between estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and c-Src, and increased phosphorylation of Cav-1, c-Src, and eNOS. Pretreatment with the lipid raft disruptor beta-methyl cyclodextrin or G alpha inhibitor pertussis toxin blocked resveratrol- and E(2)-induced eNOS activation and NO production. Depletion of endogenous ER alpha, not ERbeta, by siRNA attenuated resveratrol- and E(2)-induced ERK1/2, Src, and eNOS phosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that nanomolar resveratrol induces ER alpha-Cav-1-c-SRC interaction, resulting in NO production through a G alpha-protein-coupled mechanism. This study provides important new insights into mechanisms for the beneficial effects of resveratrol in ECs."

Much of the attention focused on stem cells relates to their use in cell replacement therapy; however, stem cells may also transform the way in which therapeutics are discovered and validated. The attrition rate of drugs is staggeringly high: more than 90% of the drugs tested in clinical trials fail to be approved. This places a significant burden on the health care system. Famously, compounds fail late in clinical testing or even after approval either because of a lack of sufficient efficacy or unanticipated toxicity; many more compounds fail early in the discovery process. How much of this inefficient and expensive pharmaceutical pipeline problem can be rectified by having disease models that will more faithfully represent the actual human diseases so that underlying mechanisms can be better understood and effective and safe medicines derived and validated? In principle, human embryonic stem (ES) cells can be used for just that purpose. ES cells can be derived from patients with specific diseases and protocols can be established to direct the disease-specific ES cells to become the very types of cells affected in the disease. Such disease-relevant cells should be able to drive more predictive drug discovery and toxicity studies. There are many ways in which human ES cells or the progenitor cells generated from them can be used in drug screening (Figure 1). The first step is isolation of ES cells, which is straightforward in the case of the mouse but has been difficult and controversial for human cells. Viable techniques for deriving human ES cells include somatic cell nuclear transfer from human skin biopsies and using embryos from preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, the recent creation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has made the production of human ES cells much simpler (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13805) Google Scholar; see Review by R. Jaenisch and R. Young in this issue), and it is now seemingly quite feasible to make ES cell lines from large numbers of patients with particular diseases. From a screening perspective, lingering concerns over the use of oncogenes and viral vectors to produce the iPS cells will undoubtedly mean that replacement factors will be sought, either small molecules or proteins that can fully or partially reprogram differentiated human cells. There is a considerable body of research on dedifferentiation (which can be viewed as partial reprogramming of adult cells) primarily in urodele amphibians, which have the ability to regenerate limbs through blastema formation at the site of injury (K.D. Birnbaum and A. Sánchez Alvarado in this issue of Cell). This occurs, in part, by cellularization, that is, the fission of multinucleated myotubes into multipotential mononucleated cells (Duckmanton et al., 2005Duckmanton A. Kumar A. Chang Y.-T. Brockes J.P. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 1117-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Understanding dedifferentiation mechanisms in amphibians might help in designing screens to reprogram adult mammalian cells. For example, screening a library containing tens of thousands of diverse compounds culminated in the identification of a microtubule-disrupting molecule, now known as myoseverin (Rosania et al., 2000Rosania G.R. Chang Y.T. Perez O. Sutherlin D. Dong H. Lockhart D.J. Schultz P.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This molecule causes mouse C2C12 myotubes to fragment into single cells that apparently continue to retain some of the differentiated properties of the parent cells, such as the expression of myosin heavy chain (Duckmanton et al., 2005Duckmanton A. Kumar A. Chang Y.-T. Brockes J.P. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 1117-1126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A second round of screening yielded another compound, called reversine, which is able to reprogram the myoblasts to become more like mesenchymal stem cells with the ability to forward differentiate into bone and adipose cells. Interestingly, additional chemical modification and affinity chromatography with immobilized compounds suggested that reversine might have more than one essential intracellular target, including the structurally dissimilar MEK1 kinase and nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain (Chen et al., 2007Chen S. Takanashi S. Zhang Q. Xiong W. Zhu S. Peters E.C. Ding S. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10482-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A self-renewal screen carried out with mouse ES cells by the same lab produced a hit, SC1, which also seemed to have the unusual property of binding to two structurally different intracellular targets (Chen et al., 2006Chen S. Do J.T. Zhang Q. Yao S. Yan F. Peters E.C. Schöler H.R. Schultz P.G. Ding S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17266-17271Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It will be important to understand whether the success of these screens actually depends on having library compounds that are not absolutely specific for single targets. Dedifferentiation or reprogramming screens start with differentiated cells and attempt to identify factors that make them less differentiated. However, one of the greatest challenges in creating large numbers of different kinds of disease-relevant cells is controlling differentiation, that is, inducing stem or progenitor cells to become more differentiated. The stem cell literature has many descriptions of “home run” experiments in which ES cells were treated with a concoction of factors, with the hope that large numbers of cells would undergo multiple steps of differentiation to produce the desired end product. Recently, research has focused on the more rational approach of inducing cells to undergo sequential stages of differentiation in a tissue culture environment, thereby recapitulating aspects of normal embryonic development (see Review by C.E. Murry and G. Keller in this issue). For example, working on mouse spinal cord development, Tom Jessell's group and others (reviewed in Briscoe and Ericson, 2001Briscoe J. Ericson J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) showed that specification of neural cells during development was achieved in stages by controlling the expression of particular sets of transcription factors in response to precise gradients of extracellular factors. Each type of spinal cord progenitor cell that appeared was defined by a particular set of transcription factors. Wichterle et al., 2002Wichterle H. Lieberam I. Porter J.A. Jessell T.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar managed to successfully reproduce these observations in cell culture. They used mouse ES cells, expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of a motor neuron-specific promoter, and grew them as embryoid bodies (EBs). When the EBs were treated with two factors known to be important in motor neuron development, first retinoic acid and then with an activator of sonic Hedgehog signaling (Frank-Kamenetsky et al., 2002Frank-Kamenetsky M. Zhang X.M. Bottega S. Guicherit O. Wichterle H. Dudek H. Bumcrot H. Wang F.Y. Jones S. Shulok J. et al.J. Biol. 2002; 1: 10.1-10.19Crossref Scopus (403) Google Scholar), functional motor neurons that expressed GFP appeared. Numerous groups have tried to carry out equivalent studies, starting with ES cells or progenitor cells. For example, the laboratories of McKay (Lee et al., 2000Lee S.H. Lumelsky N. Studer L. Auerbach J.M. McKay R.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), Sasai (Watanabe et al., 2005Watanabe K. Kamiya D. Nishiyama A. Katayama T. Nozaki S.

However, this systematic approach has not always worked. Andersson et al., 2006Andersson E. Tryggvason U. Deng Q. Friling S. Alekseenko Z. Robert B. Perlmann T. Ericson J.

Importantly, they were able to produce these cells by transiently expressing the homeobox transcription factor Lmx1a in mouse ES cells and then adding the relevant extracellular factors. The key issue is how to find a general approach for directing ES cell differentiation. Certainly, it makes sense to reproduce the steps in the process of making a fully differentiated cell, with each step along the differentiation pathway achieved using a separate chemical screen. So, for example, mouse ES cells could be differentiated into DA neurons by biasing them first toward a neural progenitor fate (Sox2+), then early DA neural progenitor (Raldh+, Otx2+), followed by late DA neuron progenitor (Lmx1a+, Nurr1+), and finally DA neuron (TH+, AADC+). Or, ES cells could be directed to become pancreatic β cells with initial endodermal induction (Sox17+), then early pancreas (Pdx-1+), pancreatic endocrine (Ngn3+), and then mature β cells secreting insulin (insulin+). What is required is knowledge of the set of transcription factors or other cell-specific markers for each stage of development and a way of identifying molecules that will stimulate each step of the differentiation process. This type of sequential differentiation model has not yet been carried out from beginning to end. In other words, no one has yet used a series of screens to identify sets of small molecules (for example) that will generate fully differentiated cells from ES cells with high efficiency. However, various labs have identified factors that stimulate at least partial differentiation. For example, Ding et al., 2003Ding S. Wu T.Y. Brinker A. Peters E.C. Hur W. Gray N.S. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 7632-7637Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar used mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells expressing tubulin α1-luciferase as a reporter of neural differentiation to screen a large library of diverse small molecules. There was one hit, a pyrrolopyrimidine, and analogs of this molecule were prepared; a more active compound, TSW119, was identified and an effective affinity ligand synthesized. This culminated in the identification of GSK-3β as a specific binding partner for this class of neuron-inducing molecule. Of course, it could easily be the case that TSW119 inhibits other kinases and it is those other kinases, or perhaps GSK-3β in combination with one or more other kinases, that regulate the appearance of neural cells. However, given that GSK-3β is a well-known negative regulator of Wnt signaling, this result raises the possibility that the Wnt pathway, which is one (but not the only) regulator of GSK-3β activity, controls neural differentiation. Several studies have implicated the Wnt signaling pathway in aspects of self-renewal and differentiation, not always with consistent results (for instance, see Sato et al., 2004Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). A number of conceptually similar screens have been prosecuted. For example, a diverse library of 100,000 compounds was screened against P19 embryonal carcinoma cells expressing luciferase downstream of the atrial natriuretic factor promoter to look for inducers of cardiac myocytes (Wu et al., 2004aWu X. Ding S. Ding Q. Gray N.S. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 1590-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A diaminopyrimidine, cardiogenol, scored in this screen and was shown to induce expression of multiple markers of the cardiac lineage. The target of this small molecule has not yet been identified. A bone differentiation screen of a small molecule diversity library looked for increased alkaline phosphatase activity in multipotent 10T1/2 fibroblasts. This was followed by chemistry to produce analogs of the hits in the screen, yielding a molecule termed purmorphamine (Wu et al., 2002Wu X. Ding S. Ding Q. Gray N.S. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14520-14521Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) that was shown subsequently to be a Hedgehog pathway agonist (Wu et al., 2004bWu X. Walker J. Zhang J. Ding S. Schultz P.G. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1229-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These screens all involve fairly large-scale testing of small molecule diversity libraries and use enzyme reporter readouts. The compound collections resemble those commonly used by pharmaceutical companies. Although these and similar studies have provided useful reagents and observations, hits from these compound screens often do not provide immediate information relating to compound target or mechanism of action, and so follow-up chemistry is required. This presents a problem for many investigators who have access neither to high-quality diversity sets nor to the type of chemistry expertise that may be needed to pursue hits from the primary screens. Other types of compound libraries can be considered for finding molecules that induce cell differentiation. For example, many academic labs have taken to screening so-called “bioactive” collections comprised mainly of known drugs and pharmacologically active agents. These small sets of 1500–5000 compounds have become widely used for several reasons. One is the relatively new interest in repurposing drugs (finding new uses for old drugs) among academic groups interested in translational research because this can accelerate the identification of therapeutics for orphan diseases (see, for example, North et al., 2007North T.E. Goessling W. Walkley C.R. Lengerke C. Kopani K.R. Lord A.M. Weber G.J. Bowman T.V. Jang I.H. Grosser T. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). However, there are other advantages to using these libraries for differentiation screens. The collections are readily available and, under favorable circumstances, hits may provide useful reagents for inducing cell differentiation in the laboratory without the need for further chemistry. In addition, classes of molecules that induce a specific differentiation step may provide mechanistic information. For example, if a number of different calcium channel blockers score in a particular cell differentiation assay, this would suggest several avenues of additional experimentation. Saxe et al., 2007Saxe J.P. Wu H. Kelly T.K. Phelps M.E. Sun Y.E. Kornblum H.I. Huang J. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1019-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar screened bioactives in a neurogenesis assay, starting with primary neurospheres prepared from embryonic rat brain and using a chemiluminescence assay to measure compounds that increased the total amount of βIII tubulin, a neuronal marker. One hit was the orphan ligand L-serine-O-phosphate, which may stimulate differentiation by binding to metabotropic glutamate receptors. Diamandis et al., 2007Diamandis P. Wildenhain J. Clarke I.D. Sacher A.G. Graham J. Bellows D.S. Ling E.K. Ward R.J. Jamieson L.G. Tyers M. Dirks P.B. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar tested a somewhat different small collection of bioactives searching for inhibitors of neural stem cell proliferation, which they detected, again indirectly, using a standard MTT assay. These investigators observed that agonists and antagonists of several different neurotransmitter receptors were antiproliferative agents (and, interestingly, exerted similar antimitotic effects on brain tumor stem cells). Another set of “perturbagens” worthy of consideration for differentiation assays include morphogens or other protein inducers and substrate- or cell-associated factors. Embryonic development is regulated largely by a small number of ligand-activated signaling pathways, including those of TGF-β/BMP, FGF, Wnt, Notch, and Hedgehog. Investigators developing small-scale (nonrobotic) differentiation protocols usually test several of these protein factors, whereas those designing robotic screening protocols routinely focus on small molecules and not on proteins. This is curious because, although the number of active signaling pathways may turn out to be small, the embryonic signaling environment is defined by having each relevant ligand present at the correct time, in the proper amount, and in appropriate combinations with other factors in order to have cell fate accurately specified. It may be that dialing in the correct concentrations and combinations of these ligands could increase the efficiency of cell differentiation substantially. Such a problem could ideally be solved by robotic screening, which can test suitably large combinations of these factors. Similarly, several investigators have explored growing undifferentiated cells on small numbers of inducer or feeder cell lines or on extracellular matrices to good effect, but only recently has attention been drawn to the advantages of combinatorial testing of substrate-associated and soluble factors. Flaim et al., 2005Flaim C.J. Chien S. Bhatia S.N. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar measured the effects of combinations of extracellular matrices (in this case, all in the same cell culture medium) on the ability of mouse ES cells to differentiate toward hepatocytes and found some striking differences among the various combinations. Soen et al., 2006Soen Y. Mori A. Palmer T.D. Brown P.O. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 37Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar looked at microarrays of human primary neural precursor cells grown on substrates containing various combinations of matrix components with bound morphogens. They also found significant variation in the biasing of cells toward neuronal or glial lineages under the different conditions. Thus, it seems an excellent idea to comprehensively probe these types of protein factors along with some of the small molecules in sequential differentiation assays. Other types of assays such as siRNA assays or screening ORFeome libraries will become more popular once suitable reagents become available, but the usefulness of screening these types of libraries has already been demonstrated (Pritsker et al., 2006Pritsker M. Ford N.R. Jenq H.T. Lemischka I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 6946-6951Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, Ivanova et al., 2006Ivanova N. Dobrin R. Lu R. Kotenko I. Levorse J. DeCoste C. Schafer X. Lun Y. Lemischka I.R. Nature. 2006; 442: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Another item worthy of discussion concerns the way in which cell differentiation is measured. Most differentiation assays conducted to date have been population studies in that they measured the total amount of luciferase activity or of individual protein markers in each test well. In a sense, these studies are conceptually similar to the industry standard high-throughput assays, which are often conducted in cell-free form (e.g., enzyme assays) but are meant to accommodate the large number of assays and impressive number of compounds that are generally tested in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. A different approach, gaining in popularity in both academia and industry, is high content analysis or microscope-based analysis. This kind of assay, which can be automated, provides information concerning multiple properties of individual cells and is well suited to studies of differentiation where the cell populations tend to be nonhomogeneous. For example, even weak hits in a differentiation screen can be detected by counting the number of individual cells expressing a relevant marker, often by means of a fluorescent protein or antibody label. In addition, multiple markers can be used, and quantitative data on a per cell basis can be obtained. High content analysis also reveals whether or not particular compounds are toxic or induce changes in cell shape, such as the extension of processes from neuronal cells or even false positives that occur due to cell shrinkage. Thus, high content screening seems likely to play a very important role in attempts to regulate cell differentiation. Perhaps this approach, especially when combined with biologically or medically relevant cells, will provide a greater number of new therapeutics. When it becomes possible to produce all differentiated cell types from mouse or human ES cells, many avenues of experimentation become possible. For instance, in many diseases, certain cell types are affected more than others: in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), motor neurons degenerate; in Huntington's disease, striatal medium spiny neurons die; and in Parkinson's disease, a subset of DA neurons in the substantia nigra are lost. However, even a global neurodegenerative disorder such as Alzheimer's disease affects certain populations of cells, such as entorhinal cortical neurons, more than others. This differential susceptibility is particularly perplexing in the case of SMA and Huntington's disease, which are genetic disorders, as all cells carry the same mutation. Having access to appropriately differentiated neurons should help in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the selective cell death that accompanies these diseases even in cases, such as ALS, that are predominantly sporadic, rather than familial. It is already possible to make large numbers of motor neurons from ES cells and studies of disease mechanism are underway. Di Giorgio et al., 2007Di Giorgio F.P. Carrasco M.A. Siao M.C. Maniatis T. Eggan K. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar cultured motor neurons generated from mouse ES cells isolated from an ALS mouse model and showed that their rate of death is faster than that of ES cell-derived motor neurons from normal mice and that the death rate can be accelerated further by coculturing them with astrocytes obtained from the same mice. Astrocyte-induced death of mutant ES cell-derived motor neurons is readily amenable to even a large-scale screening campaign aimed at finding survival-enhancing compounds. My lab has isolated ES cells from a mouse SMA model (Sinor and L.L.R., unpublished data) and induced them to differentiate into large numbers of motor neurons and is currently conducting a high content screening campaign to identify drugs that will prolong the survival of the motor neurons. Until now, most SMA studies have been conducted on fibroblasts, which are phenotypically normal, and it will be important to determine if screening in motor neurons produces better therapeutic candidates. The overall goal of this type of approach is to study the pathogenic mechanisms of these degenerative diseases in the cells that are actually affected in the disease. Most pharmaceutical scientists view the lack of adequately predictive toxicology during preclinical testing as a huge problem in effective development of new drugs. Eliminating lead compounds with true hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity is of special concern. The ability to derive ES cells from a wide and representative spectrum of the human population and having valid protocols to differentiate them into hepatocytes and cardiac myocytes should provide straightforward assays for analyzing certain aspects of drug metabolism and for assessing probable side effects. A key question is how mature the differentiated cells need to be before they can faithfully represent their adult counterparts (see, for example, Khetani and Bhatia, 2007Khetani S.R. Bhatia S.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 26: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). It is now realistic to imagine creating disease-specific human ES cell lines from large numbers of patients. Applying fundamental principles of developmental biology should enable screens to be designed using a wide variety of ES cell-derived cell types at different stages of differentiation, allowing diseases to be modeled more faithfully. These stem cell-based screens may well provide more efficient and predictive methods for discovering and testing different classes of therapeutics.

Recent work using computer modeling and live imaging is helping to elucidate some of the mechanisms responsible for the specification and maintenance of stem cells in the root and shoot. Similar to animal stem cells, plant stem cells require special niche microenvironments to continuously generate the tissues that constitute the plant body. Recent work using computer modeling and live imaging is helping to elucidate some of the mechanisms responsible for the specification and maintenance of stem cells in the root and shoot. Plants have nowhere to run when times get tough, so they must rely on an indeterminate body plan (that is, one in which the number of organs is not predefined) to generate developmental responses to environmental changes. Specialized proliferative tissues termed meristems present at the growing tips of roots and shoots continuously generate new cells for the plant (see Review by K.D. Birnbaum and A. Sánchez Alvarado in this issue of Cell). In the shoot, these cells follow different paths depending on whether they will form lateral organs such as leaves or become part of the stem. The root meristem plays a more dedicated role, generating cells that enable continued growth of the root. Both populations of developmentally flexible and actively dividing cells are maintained through smaller collections of stem cells located at the heart of the meristem (Figures 1A and 1B) (Laux, 2003Laux T. Cell. 2003; 113: 281-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Weigel and Jürgens, 2002Weigel D. Jürgens G. Nature. 2002; 415: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Organizing centers maintain these stem cell populations in a highly regulated microenvironment termed the stem cell niche, which displays remarkable longevity allowing some plants to grow for hundreds of years. Although variable in exact structure, the shoot and root stem cell niches show common characteristics that define equivalent populations of cells in animals. The root stem cell niche is morphologically well defined and thus can be used to clearly address the role of the organizing center in regulating the function of stem cells that generate specific tissue layers. In the roots of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the organizing center is composed of four quiescent center cells that rarely undergo cell division and constitute the quiescent center (Figure 1A) (Laux, 2003Laux T. Cell. 2003; 113: 281-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Weigel and Jürgens, 2002Weigel D. Jürgens G. Nature. 2002; 415: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These cells are surrounded by a single layer of stem cells that divide to produce two daughter cells: one daughter cell renews the stem cell and the other daughter cell will contribute to the formation of the mature tissues of the root. Work from Ben Scheres' group has defined the signaling roles of the quiescent center in the niche through laser-assisted ablation experiments. An important finding of this work is that the quiescent center maintains stem cell identity in the immediately surrounding cell layer through direct cell-cell contacts (van den Berg et al., 1997van den Berg C. Willemsen V. Hendriks G. Weisbeek P. Scheres B. Nature. 1997; 390: 287-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). This short-range signaling ensures that stem cell numbers are restrained and stem cell populations do not become displaced from the growing root tip. This mechanism for controlling the size of the stem cell population is very similar to that found in the Drosophila germarium where direct contact of the germline stem cell with a supporting cap cell is required to maintain stem cell identity (Spradling et al., 2001Spradling A. Drummond-Barbosa D. Kai T. Nature. 2001; 414: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar; see Review by S.J. Morrison and A.C. Spradling in this issue). The daughter of the germline stem cells lacks such connections and goes on to differentiate into an egg chamber. The other major finding of these studies is that positional information defines the quiescent center: these cells are not inherently unique but instead maintain their specialized function through external signaling that defines cells in that position as an organizing center (van den Berg et al., 1995van den Berg C. Willemsen V. Hage W. Weisbeek P. Scheres B. Nature. 1995; 378: 62-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). By ablating all quiescent center cells, van den Berg et al., 1995van den Berg C. Willemsen V. Hage W. Weisbeek P. Scheres B. Nature. 1995; 378: 62-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar found that cells, which had begun to assume vascular identity, instead dedifferentiated and became quiescent center cells. Thus, a long-distance signaling system must exist that can define the position and identity of the stem cell niche independent of the quiescent center. This long-range signal appears to be the plant growth hormone auxin. The shoot stem cell niche is more spread out than that of the root and is composed of several layers of cells that overlay a smaller pool of cells comprising the organizing center (Figure 1B) (Laux, 2003Laux T. Cell. 2003; 113: 281-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Weigel and Jürgens, 2002Weigel D. Jürgens G. Nature. 2002; 415: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, direct contact with the organizing center is not required to acquire or maintain stem cell identity as it is in the root. The WUSCHEL (WUS) transcription factor is exclusively expressed in the organizing center and is required for induction of stem cell identity in overlying tissue layers (Figure 1C) (Mayer et al., 1998Mayer K.F. Schoof H. Haecker A. Lenhard M. Jurgens G. Laux T. Cell. 1998; 95: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). WUS, in part, performs this function by directly repressing the expression of the ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR), a two-component factor that suppresses signaling by the plant hormone cytokinin (Leibfried et al., 2005Leibfried A. To J.P. Busch W. Stehling S. Kehle A. Demar M. Kieber J.J. Lohmann J.U. Nature. 2005; 438: 1172-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar and references therein). Many classic studies have demonstrated the important role that this plant hormone plays in promoting cell-cycle activity, growth, and shoot identity. In plants that constitutively express a hyperactive version of ARR7, the stem cell population is depleted (Leibfried et al., 2005Leibfried A. To J.P. Busch W. Stehling S. Kehle A. Demar M. Kieber J.J. Lohmann J.U. Nature. 2005; 438: 1172-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), whereas mutations in the maize ARR homolog, ABPH1, lead to an increase in meristem size (Giulini et al., 2004Giulini A. Wang J. Jackson D. Nature. 2004; 430: 1031-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Just as animals need to keep stem cells in check to prevent the formation of tumors, careful maintenance of stem cell populations in plants is necessary to avoid overproliferation. In the shoot, a second important function of WUS is to achieve this by activating the expression of a signaling network that forms a negative feedback loop repressing WUS expression (Figure 1C) (Brand et al., 2000Brand U. Fletcher J.C. Hobe M. Meyerowitz E.M. Simon R. Science. 2000; 289: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, Schoof et al., 2000Schoof H. Lenhard M. Haecker A. Mayer K.F. Jurgens G. Laux T. Cell. 2000; 100: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar and references therein). WUS promotes the expression of a small secreted ligand, CLAVATA3 (CLV3), in a region of the meristem termed the central zone. The CLAVATA1/2 receptor complex—which is expressed in a region that overlaps with the organizing center—directly perceives this stem cell-dependent signal, which ultimately leads to the downregulation of WUS expression. Loss of function in any CLV component results in an enlarged meristem comprising extra stem cells in the central zone, although the underlying mechanism that results in this mutant phenotype remained unclear. For example, increased cell division rates, prolonged stem cell maintenance, or the expansion of signals that confer stem cell identity could all lead to the same outcome. To mechanistically understand the effects of perturbing CLV signaling, Reddy and Meyerowitz used live imaging to track changes in meristem structure over time (Reddy and Meyerowitz, 2005Reddy G.V. Meyerowitz E.M. Science. 2005; 310: 663-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Using a chemically inducible RNA interference system and a CLV3 reporter line, these authors were able to suppress CLV3 expression in a timecourse experiment and hence track the effects of this suppression on stem cell identity. Interestingly, expansion of stem cell identity occurred prior to any changes in meristem size in response to the inhibition of CLV3 expression (Figure 1D). The investigators then used a surface marker to track cell division rates and found that CLV3 suppression also led to an increase in cell division rates outside of the stem cell population, but at a later time point. Thus, the timecourse analysis allowed Reddy and Meyerowitz to distinguish between the immediate and late effects of CLV3 signaling. The observation that the region in which CLV3 is expressed is more limited than the region of the meristem affected by reductions in CLV3 activity suggests that CLV3 may suppress the production of a diffusible signal that promotes stem cell identity in the central zone as opposed to suppressing the response to such a signal. It will be interesting to determine in future live-imaging studies whether this signal is dependent upon WUS activity. In roots, a direct relationship between regulation of the size of the root stem cell niche and control of cell differentiation in animal models has been established with the characterization of the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED (RBR) gene in Arabidopsis (Wildwater et al., 2005Wildwater M. Campilho A. Perez-Perez J.M. Heidstra R. Blilou I. Korthout H. Chatterjee J. Mariconti L. Gruissem W. Scheres B. Cell. 2005; 123: 1337-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar and references therein). The retinoblastoma gene (Rb) is an oncogene first characterized in animals as a cell-cycle regulator that suppresses the transition from G1 to S phase. In the root meristem, reductions in RBR expression weaken the requirement for stem cells to be in direct contact with the quiescent center, leading to multiple tiers of stem cells surrounding the quiescent center. In addition to the expanded expression of stem cell marker genes and lack of differentiation markers in these cells, live imaging revealed that these ectopic layers maintained their ability to undergo cell division. Thus, in both plant and animal systems, RETINOBLASTOMA-related genes limit the proliferative nature of tissues. Interestingly, these ectopic stem cells maintain their requirement for signaling from the quiescent center because ablation of the quiescent center leads to their immediate differentiation. These data suggest that the quiescent center is not simply repressing RBR activity in the stem cells, and future work should reveal the interplay between RBR action and quiescent center signaling. Although the pathways that maintain pools of stem cells at the root and shoot apex are well characterized, less is known about how a stem cell niche is generated. Primary shoot and root stem cell niches are initiated at opposite poles during early embryogenesis (Weigel and Jürgens, 2002Weigel D. Jürgens G. Nature. 2002; 415: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Formation of the shoot organizing center coincides with the expression of WUS in a subapical tier of cells in the early embryo (Mayer et al., 1998Mayer K.F. Schoof H. Haecker A. Lenhard M. Jurgens G. Laux T. Cell. 1998; 95: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar); however little is understood about the upstream regulation of this event. The mechanisms that lead to the specification of the root meristem, on the other hand, are better characterized and we will focus on these events. Two independent pathways converge to specify the identity of the quiescent center and regulate the functions of the associated stem cells in the root. The SCARECROW/SHORTROOT (SCR/SHR) signaling pathway provides positional information along the radial axis, whereas the plant hormone auxin provides longitudinal information. Auxin is a natural candidate for regulating patterning in plants as auxin transport proteins enable the formation of information-rich concentration gradients. The PIN-FORMED (PIN) genes encode plasma membrane-bound transporters that facilitate the export of auxin out of cells (references in Friml et al., 2003Friml J. Vieten A. Sauer M. Weijers D. Schwarz H. Hamann T. Offringa R. Jurgens G. Nature. 2003; 426: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar, Grieneisen et al., 2007Grieneisen V.A. Xu J. Maree A.F. Hogeweg P. Scheres B. Nature. 2007; 449: 1008-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Because PIN transporters are often localized in a polar fashion in the cell, auxin can be readily transported from one cell to the next. Each PIN isoform displays a unique expression pattern and localizes to different surfaces of the cell depending on the cell type. These differences produce complex routes by which auxin can travel and accumulate within an organ. Adding to this complexity, the auxin “superhighway” can be remodeled during development allowing auxin to control different patterning events in the same organ. Unequal auxin accumulation is evident just after the first division of the zygote into a smaller apical cell and a larger basal cell (Friml et al., 2003Friml J. Vieten A. Sauer M. Weijers D. Schwarz H. Hamann T. Offringa R. Jurgens G. Nature. 2003; 426: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Using a reporter that marks cells with a peak auxin response, Friml et al., 2003Friml J. Vieten A. Sauer M. Weijers D. Schwarz H. Hamann T. Offringa R. Jurgens G. Nature. 2003; 426: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar found that the apical cell displays a higher auxin response, which correlates with the apical localization of PIN7 in the basal cell. The apical cell of the embryo will eventually generate all cells of the shoot, hypocotyl, and embryonic root, whereas the basal cell will form the quiescent center, the columella root cap, and extraembryonic tissue. An important subsequent step during embryogenesis appears to be the relocalization of PIN transporters in the provasculature cells from the apical to the basal surface, which focuses auxin to a specific daughter of the basal cell lineage termed the hypophysis. The hypophysis subsequently divides to generate the quiescent center and root cap stem cells. Loss of function in the PIN genes that drive basal auxin transport or disruption of vesicular trafficking that is important for PIN localization to the plasma membrane leads to defects in hypophyseal auxin accumulation and in specification of the quiescent center. Recent work modeling auxin flux in the root has led to a clearer understanding of how polar auxin transport generates an auxin maximum at the root tip to specify the quiescent center (Grieneisen et al., 2007Grieneisen V.A.

Nature. 2007; 449: 1008-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar created a mesoscopic model (a scale at which individual molecules do not need to be considered) for auxin transport that uses a simplified root layout composed of different cell types endowed with specific diffusion and permeability parameters for auxin (Figures 2A and 2B). Auxin influx is primarily attributed to free diffusion into the cell whereas efflux is attributed to localized PIN-transporter activity because internal stores of auxin are deprotonated and do not readily diffuse outside of the cell. The cellular nature of the model enabled Grieneisen et al. to design unique PIN localization patterns for cells in different regions of the root. (A, B, and C) Modeling polar auxin transport in the root can predict the position of the quiescent center (QC). Grieneisen et al., 2007Grieneisen V.A. Xu J. Maree A.F. Hogeweg P. Scheres B. Nature. 2007; 449: 1008-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar built a model of polar auxin transport based on the organization of cell types in the root (A). In this model the localization of the auxin transporter PIN is modeled for different tissue zones and the effect of transporter activity on the direction of auxin flow is modeled (B). The model is sufficient to predict the presence of an auxin maximum in the root tip at the approximate position of the quiescent center (C). (D) Two pathways converge at the root tip to promote the identity of the quiescent center. The SHR/SCR pathway provides the radial position of the quiescent center, whereas the PLT pathway provides the longitudinal position. (E) Regulatory network controlling the identity of the quiescent center and root stem cells (C/E, cortex-endodermal). The model shows that an auxin maximum is quickly localized to a small population of cells near the root tip (Figure 2C). This maximum is generated by a combination of flux events. First, auxin is funneled to the root tip through the vascular cells; it is then redistributed in the columella region at the tip. Auxin then flows basipetally (from the tip to the more mature regions of the root) through the outer tissue layers. Very importantly, auxin is subsequently recycled back into the vascular cells through the border cells (ground tissue and pericycle). This “reverse fountain” system effectively enables the root to (1) build up and store high levels of auxin, (2) create an auxin maximum at the approximate position of the quiescent center, and (3) generate a basipetal auxin gradient. Using an auxin reporter, Grieneisen et al., 2007Grieneisen V.A. Xu J. Maree A.F. Hogeweg P. Scheres B. Nature. 2007; 449: 1008-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar found a similar distribution of auxin activity to that predicted by the model. Overall, the model was found to be highly robust to changes in the origin of auxin. For example, simulating ubiquitous auxin production or a loss of shoot-supplied auxin had little effect on the position of the auxin maximum. This predicted robustness to changes in auxin supply was tested in plants by cutting off the shoot, which supplies most of the auxin to the root, as well as exogenously supplying auxin. Despite these dramatic perturbations, the auxin reporter maintained peak activity at the quiescent center. Thus, PIN-mediated auxin transport in combination with topological aspects of the root and specific auxin permeability and transportation rates are sufficient to provide a plausible mechanism for the role that auxin plays in specification of the quiescent center. Likhoshvai et al. also generated a model describing auxin distribution in a line of cells along the longitudinal axis of the root (Likhoshvai et al., 2007Likhoshvai V.A. Omel'yanchuk N.A. Mironova V.V. Fadeev S.I. Mjolsness E.D. Kolchanov N.V. Russ. J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 38: 374-382Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar and references therein). Auxin transport was modeled as a function of passive diffusion and active transport toward the tip of the root and included the ability of auxin to inhibit polar transport at high concentrations. Interestingly, although cell specialization is not considered, their model is able to replicate a peak of auxin concentration at the approximate position of the quiescent center, which can be regenerated after a simulated loss of the quiescent center. This suggests that certain aspects of auxin distribution are fundamentally encoded by simple basipetal transport with negative feedback. Notably, several studies have also modeled regulated auxin transport in the shoot focusing on the specification of lateral organ primordia and providing important examples for the use of modeling to understand patterning events (de Reuille et al., 2006de Reuille P.B.

The PLETHORA (PLT) class of AP2/ERF-type transcription factors plays an important role in mediating the developmental response to auxin in the root (Figures 2D and 2E) (Aida et al., 2004Aida M. Beis D. Heidstra R. Willemsen V. Blilou I. Galinha C. Nussaume L. Noh Y.S. Amasino R. Scheres B.

Nature. 2007; 449: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The strong overlap in expression between PLT genes and auxin reporters and their dependence on multiple PIN genes suggest that they may act downstream of auxin signaling (Aida et al., 2004Aida M. Beis D. Heidstra R. Willemsen V. Blilou I. Galinha C. Nussaume L. Noh Y.S. Amasino R. Scheres B.

Palme K. Scheres B. Nature. 2005; 433: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Indeed, prolonged exposure of roots to auxin results in enhanced PLT1/2 expression, and PLT1/2 are dependent upon two auxin response factor-type transcription factors, MONOPTEROS (MP) and NON-PHOTOTROPIC HYPOCOTYL4 (NPH4), to activate and maintain expression in the embryonic root tip (Aida et al., 2004Aida M.

Consistent with the expression pattern of PLT genes, which peaks at the quiescent center and is dependent on auxin, loss of PLT1/2 gene function results in reduction or loss of quiescent center identity and expansion of differentiation markers into the stem cell population. Furthermore, abrogation of PLT-class gene activity leads to a complete loss of all basal structures including the entire embryonic root and part of the embryonic stem (hypocotyl). In contrast, ectopic expression of PLT1 or PLT2 results in the proliferation of basal cell identities as well as the formation of ectopic stem cell niches. Interestingly, these ectopic stem cell populations are not marked by high auxin levels, as determined using an auxin reporter, indicating that ectopic PLT activity can separate auxin responses from the specification of the stem cell niche. Together these data show that PLT genes are both necessary and, when expressed at high levels, sufficient to specify the quiescent center and associated stem cell niche. Interestingly, four related transcription factors, PLT1,2,3 and BABYBOOM (BBM), display graded patterns of expression that extend beyond the quiescent center. Although high levels of expression of these genes are required for stem cell maintenance, lower levels also provide important patterning information and determine the size of the transit-amplifying daughter cells that make up the meristem (Galinha et al., 2007Galinha C. Hofhuis H. Luijten M. Willemsen V. Blilou I. Heidstra R. Scheres B. Nature. 2007; 449: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The regulatory relationship between auxin signaling and PLT gene expression may not be linear as the expression of several PIN transporters is dependent upon PLT activity. Thus, as temporal analysis of shoot meristem growth clarified the role of CLV3 in stem cell maintenance, temporal analysis may also be needed to distinguish between the pathways that regulate auxin distribution in the root and the pathways that are responsive to auxin. A positive feedback loop between these two components may tighten auxin transport routes at the root tip, where they are most critical. Parallel to the auxin/PLT signaling pathway, specification of the quiescent center and stem cell functions are also regulated by two related transcription factors, SCARECROW (SCR) and SHORTROOT (SHR) (Cui et al., 2007Cui H. Levesque M.P. Vernoux T. Jung J.W. Paquette A.J. Gallagher K.L. Wang J.Y. Blilou I. Scheres B. Benfey P.N. Science. 2007; 316: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, Levesque et al., 2006Levesque M.P. Vernoux T. Busch W. Cui H. Wang J.Y. Blilou I. Hassan H. Nakajima K. Matsumoto N.

SHR acts at the top of the hierarchy and is expressed in the central stele tissue where the vasculature is housed. The SHR protein subsequently moves into the surrounding tissue layer to directly activate SCR expression. SCR forms a heterodimer with SHR and is itself necessary for SHR to bind to the SCR promoter and activate expression (Cui et al., 2007Cui H. Levesque M.P. Vernoux T. Jung J.W. Paquette A.J. Gallagher K.L. Wang J.Y. Blilou I. Scheres B. Benfey P.N. Science. 2007; 316: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, Levesque et al., 2006Levesque M.P. Vernoux T. Busch W. Cui H.

This feedback loop is thought to enable the rapid upregulation of SCR expression and sequester the SHR protein in the nucleus, which limits movement to a single cell layer adjacent to the stele. Interestingly, this is accompanied by the differential activity of two zinc-finger proteins, MAGPIE (MGP) and JACKDAW (JKD), that either activate or restrain the activity of SHR and SCR (Welch et al., 2007Welch D. Hassan H. Blilou I. Immink R. Heidstra R. Scheres B. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2196-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The tissue layer to which the SHR protein moves and activates SCR expression forms several different cell types. In combination with peak PLT activity centered at the root tip, SCR and SHR promote quiescent center identity (Aida et al., 2004Aida M. Beis D. Heidstra R. Willemsen V. Blilou I. Galinha C. Nussaume L. Noh Y.S. Amasino R. Scheres B. Cell. 2004; 119: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Immediately adjacent to the quiescent center, SCR and SHR promote an asymmetric cell division in the ground tissue stem cell daughter to generate the cortex and endodermal cell layers. SHR plays an additional role in specifying endodermal cell identity as well. SHR may also play an important role in other stem cells in the stele as vascular patterning is disrupted in shr mutants. In studying developmental processes, the common themes that arise in diverse organs or organisms are striking. Sometimes these similarities are based on a common evolutionary origin. If, as the evidence suggests, the root was derived from a shoot-like progenitor during the evolution of land plants, then some of the molecular components controlling shoot development may control similar processes in the root. Recently, such a connection has been discovered through the characterization of a close relative of WUS, called WOX5 (Sarkar et al., 2007Sarkar A.K. Luijten M. Miyashima S. Lenhard M. Hashimoto T. Nakajima K. Scheres B. Heidstra R. Laux T. Nature. 2007; 446: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Similar to the specific expression of WUS in the organizing center, WOX5 is exclusively expressed in the root quiescent center. Consistently, Sarkar et al., 2007Sarkar A.K. Luijten M. Miyashima S. Lenhard M. Hashimoto T. Nakajima K. Scheres B. Heidstra R. Laux T. Nature. 2007; 446: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar found that WOX5 is necessary and sufficient to promote stem cell identity in the root cap. Expression analysis of WOX5 places it downstream of SCR/SHR, MP/BODENLOS pathways and potentially of PLT genes (Figure 2E). Genetic analyses, however, indicate that it may have functions independent of these pathways as well. Interestingly, Sarkar et al. found that WOX5 and WUS are functionally interchangeable, suggesting that their roles in the root and shoot stem cell niche may be distinguished primarily on the basis of expression pattern. Although WOX5/WUS represent the first pair of related root/shoot transcriptional regulators, previous studies have suggested that components of the CLV signaling complex are also involved in regulating meristem size and cell-fate decisions in the root (Fiers et al., 2005Fiers M. Golemiec E. Xu J. van der Geest L. Heidstra R. Stiekema W. Liu C.M. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2542-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Thus, an ancestral WUS/CLV pathway may have been adapted to regulate stem cell proliferation during root evolution. It will be fascinating to determine how deeply the homology runs between the root and shoot pathways; such studies will provide a model for how stem cell regulation evolves to suit new functions. Similarities between developmental systems may also represent the outcome of convergent evolution. Plants and animals are thought to have evolved multicellularity independently, thus stem cell niches are likely to be controlled in these two systems by analogous processes (see Review by K.D. Birnbaum and A. Sánchez Alvarado). Nevertheless, observed commonalities may represent the effects of constraints common to all cellular organisms. The maintenance of stem cells in highly regulated microenvironments combined with the necessity of non-stem cells to generate the niche environment ensures that stem cell organizing centers do not autonomously proliferate. The maintenance of stem cell identity in the Drosophila ovariole, for example, depends on signaling mediated by the morphogen decapentaplegic (Dpp); however, Dpp expression is limited to several somatic cell types near the stem cells (Spradling et al., 2001Spradling A. Drummond-Barbosa D. Kai T. Nature. 2001; 414: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). In the same way, auxin transport driven by the PIN transporters ensures the accumulation of sufficient levels of auxin to promote the formation of the stem cell niche without the necessity that the stem cells contribute to such a signal. It will be interesting in the future to determine if the shoot organizing center is patterned and maintained by similar nonautonomous mechanisms. Plants come in many sizes, from the smallest flowering plant, duckweed, to the largest living organism on earth, the giant sequoia. An important future direction in understanding plant stem cells will be to determine what mechanisms lead to differences in the longevity of the niche microenvironment. A greater understanding of this process may enable researchers to improve plant biomass production for the generation of biofuels. We thank B. Scheres, A. Roeder, S.

Lysine 20 of histone H4 is mono-, di-, or trimethylated in vivo, but the regulation and significance of these methylations is poorly understood. The SET domain proteins PR-Set7 and Suv4-20 have been implicated in mono- and trimethylation, respectively; however, enzymes that dimethylate lysine 20 have not been identified. Here we report that Drosophila Suv4-20 is a mixed product specificity methyltransferase that dimethylates ∼90% and trimethylates less than 5% of total H4 at lysine 20 in S2 cells. Trimethylation, but not dimethylation, is reduced in Drosophila larvae lacking HP1, suggesting that an interaction with HP1 regulates the product specificity of Suv4-20 and enrichment of trimethyllysine 20 within heterochromatin. Similar to the Drosophila enzyme, human Suv4-20h1/h2 enzymes generate di- and trimethyllysine 20. PR-Set7 and Suv4-20 are both required for normal levels of methylation, suggesting they have non-redundant functions. Alterations in the level of lysine 20 methylation following knock-down or overexpression of Suv4-20 did not affect lysine 16 acetylation, revealing that these two modifications are not competitive in vivo. Depletion of Suv4-20h1/h2 in HeLa cells impaired the formation of 53BP1 foci, suggesting dimethyllysine 20 is required for a proper DNA damage response.

Lysine residues targeted by methyltransferases (and demethylases) afford the greatest potential combinatorial and functional complexity among histone PTMs because the identity of the site, whether it is unmodified (0m) or mono- (1m), di- (2m), or trimethylated (3m), and the presence of additional PTMs at nearby sites can potentiate the binding of site-specific regulatory factors (5Martin C.

A single SET domain-containing protein, Set9, forms all 1m, 2m, and 3mK20-H4 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and the function of Lys-20 methylation seems to be limited to DNA damage responses in this organism (9Sanders S.L.

Recent evidence suggests that 1m, 2m, and 3mK20-H4 are functionally distinct in higher eukaryotes although several contradictory findings have yet to be resolved.

In contrast, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showing preferential association of 1mK20-H4 with transcriptionally active genes imply a role in transcriptional regulation (25Talasz H.

Similarly, preferential localization of 3mK20-H4 to constitutive heterochromatin in mammals and dominant suppression of position effect variegation by Suv4-20 in Drosophila suggest that Lys-20 trimethylation is involved in gene silencing (11Schotta G.

To better understand the regulation of H4-K20 methylation, we have used Top Down mass spectrometry (TDMS) for direct identification and relative quantification of singly and multiply modified forms of intact H4. We show here that nearly all H4 in asynchronous Drosophila S2 cells is methylated at Lys-20 with dimethylation present on ∼90% of the molecules. To identify the enzyme responsible for this abundant dimethylation, we performed an RNAi screen targeting SET domain protein-encoding genes in Drosophila. Depletion of Suv4-20 led to a marked reduction in the level of 2mK20-H4, revealing that Drosophila Suv4-20 is a dual product specificity methyltransferase which forms most, if not all, of the abundant 2mK20-H4 and forms only small amounts of 3mK20-H4 by comparison in vivo. Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) is required for normal levels of 3mK20-H4 in Drosophila larvae, suggesting that the product specificity of Suv4-20 may be modulated by interactions with HP1. Depletion of PR-Set7 led to increased levels of 0mK20-H4, suggesting that PR-Set7 methylates 0mK20-H4 to form 1mK20-H4 in vivo. Comparisons of the results obtained for depletion of PR-Set7 and Suv4-20 individually and in combination suggest that PR-Set7 mediates most Lys-20 monomethylation in vivo and that the majority of 1mK20-H4 formed by PR-Set7 subsequently serves as the physiological substrate for Suv4-20. However, 0mK20-H4 can also serve as a substrate for Suv4-20 in the absence of PR-Set7. We show that Lys-20 methylation is regulated similarly in human cells and that Lys-20 dimethylation mediated by Suv4-20h1/h2 is required for efficient 53BP1 foci formation following DNA damage. Drosophila S2 Cell Culture and RNAi—S2 cells were grown in Schneider's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin at 26 °C. RNAi was performed as described previously (30Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) with some modifications. 6-well plates were seeded with 1 ml of S2 cells per well (2 × 106 cells per ml in medium lacking serum and antibiotics), and then 30 μg of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) were added to each well. After 1 h, 2 ml of complete medium containing 15% FBS was added to each well. On day 4, cells were harvested and portions processed for molecular analysis or resuspended as above in medium lacking serum and antibiotics and a second dsRNA addition performed for analysis on day 8. Aliquots of cells (∼106) treated in parallel were harvested at regular intervals to monitor cell cycle progression by flow cytometry as described previously (31Juan G. Darzynkiewicz Z. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 91: 67-75PubMed Google Scholar). Templates representing 400–700-bp portions of the 31 known or potential Drosophila SET domain-containing genes listed in supplemental Table S1 were amplified using gene-specific primers fused to T7 promoters. Double-stranded RNAs were synthesized from these templates using the T7 MEGA-script Kit (Ambion). Double-stranded RNA targeting bases 773–1368 of the coding region of the firefly luciferase gene was used as a negative control. The concentration and quality of dsRNA was assessed using absorbance at 260 nm and electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. HeLa S3 Cell Culture and siRNA—HeLa or HeLa S3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS at 37 °C. siRNA was performed using 21-bp siRNA as described previously (32Julien E. Herr W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6-well plates were seeded with 1 × 105 Hela or 3 × 105 Hela S3 cells/2 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS per well. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 10 μl of 20 μm Suv4-20 siGENOME siRNA (Dharmacon) mixed with 5 μl of oligofectamine (Invitrogen). This treatment was repeated after a further 24 h and subsequently at 4-day intervals as required. siRNA targeting the sequence 5′-CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGA-3′ in the firefly luciferase gene was used as a negative control. Cell cycle progression of cells treated in parallel was monitored by flow cytometry. Generation of Larvae Lacking HP1—Drosophila HP1 is encoded by the Su(var)2–5 gene. To examine the levels of K20-H4 methylation in flies lacking HP1, a cross was performed between y,w67c23; Su(var)2–504/Cy0, GFP and y,w67c23; Su(var)2–505/Cy, GFP flies. The resulting non-GFP progeny are trans-heterozygous for two null mutations in Su(var)2–5. Non-GFP third instar larvae were collected, homogenized in SDS sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and the clarified supernatant was used for immunoblot analysis. Similar stage y,w67c23 larvae with wild-type levels of HP1 were used as a control. FLAG-Suv4-20h2-expressing HeLa Stable Cell Lines—HeLa S3 cells were transfected with a pcDNA3 plasmid containing FLAG-Suv4-20h2 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were selected with G418 (1 mg/ml). Clones with high expression were selected and maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and G418 (500 μg/ml). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—FLAG-Suv4-20h2-expressing cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5 containing 4% sucrose for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 15 min. Coverslips were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, 2% newborn calf serum, 0.1% Tween-20 in TBS, and then incubated with mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma, 1:5000) or rabbit anti-3mK20-H4 (Abcam, 1:2000) at room temperature for 2 h. Coverslips were then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated or Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno-Research, 1:800). Extensive washes with TBS-0.1% Tween-20 were performed between incubations. DAPI (0.1 μg/ml final) was included in the last wash solution to stain DNA. Images were captured with Leica DM RXA2 microscope and analyzed using Openlab software. Cells treated with bleocin (1 μg/ml for 1 h in normal medium) were fixed and permeabilized simultaneously with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 2.5 mm MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline and then stained with mouse anti-53BP1 (Upstate, 1:250) and modified histone antibodies as above. Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. The average number of 53P1 foci per cell was determined from 6 randomly selected fields each containing 30–100 cells from two separate experiments. RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using a First Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT primers. Specific cDNAs were then PCR-amplified with gene-specific primers (supplemental Table S2). Immunoblotting—Cultured cells were washed twice with TBS, lysed in SDS sample buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes. The antisera to 1mK20-H4 (Abcam), 2mK20-H4 (Upstate), and 3mK20-H4 (Abcam) were diluted 1:3000. Antisera to individual acetylation sites in H4 (Upstate) were diluted 1:2000. Antisera to α-tubulin (Sigma) were used at 1:5000. Antisera to Drosophila PR-Set7 were raised against residues 1–100 expressed in bacteria as a C-terminal His tag fusion, affinity-purified using antigen coupled to N-hydroxysuccinamide-activated agarose beads, and the purified preparation diluted 1:1500. Monoclonal antibody to Drosophila HP1 was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa) and used diluted 1:5000. Histone Purification and Mass Spectrometry—Drosophila S2 cell nuclei were isolated using DNIB buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) freshly supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 5 nm microcystin LR, 0.5 mm aminoethyl benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). Cells were lysed in cold DNIB buffer for 5 min on ice and nuclei collected by low speed centrifugation. Nuclei were washed with DNIB buffer lacking Nonidet P-40, and then histones were extracted out with 0.4 n H2SO4. Nuclei were isolated from HeLa S3 cells and histones extracted by a similar procedure using NIB buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) supplemented as above. Histones were recovered by 20% trichloroacetic acid precipitation followed by washes with acetone/0.1% HCl and acetone. Crude histone was resuspended in H2O and oxidized in 3% H2O2 and 3% formic acid for 4 h at room temperature prior to reverse phase (RP) HPLC to facilitate analysis of Lys-20 methylation by mass spectrometry (33Pesavento J.J.

Drosophila and human histones were separated on a Vydac C18 column (2.1 mm inner diameter × 250 mm, Grace Discovery Sciences) with a multistep gradient from buffer A (5% CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) to buffer B (90% CH3CN, 0.094% trifluoroacetic acid) and pooled fractions representing the entire single peak obtained for H4 recovered by drying in a SpeedVac. Purified H4 was resuspended in electrospray solvent and mass spectrometry performed as described previously (33Pesavento J.J. Garcia B.A. Streeky J.A. Kelleher N.L. Mizzen C.A. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58751) Google Scholar) with relaxed restrictions identified 32 candidate SET domain-containing genes in Drosophila melanogaster, and we performed RNAi for 31 of these candidates in S2 cells (supplemental Table S1). However, only depletion of PR-Set7 or Suv4-20 affected Lys-20 methylation in immunoblots performed as an initial assay for the effects of RNAi (supplemental Fig. S1). To confirm and extend these findings, we used TDMS to characterize the modification of H4 recovered from cultures on days 4 and 8 of dsRNA treatment targeting firefly luciferase (control), PR-Set7 alone, Suv4-20 alone, or PR-Set7 and Suv4-20 in combination (Fig. 1). A major advantage of using TDMS over immunochemical or other approaches for histone modification analysis is that the relative abundance of differently modified forms can be assessed without bias because of the nature or number of modifications present on individual molecules (36Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 4271-4280Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Direct TDMS analysis of H4 prepared from luciferase dsRNA-treated S2 cells resolved six components differing in molecular mass by multiples of 14 Da because of either methylation or acetylation. Gas phase isolation of individual components followed by fragmentation and tandem MS enabled modifications to be assigned to each form as shown in Fig. 1. All molecules were α-N-acetylated at Thr-1, a co-translational modification, and molecules bearing only this modification are considered to be unmodified. The most abundant form was dimethylated at Lys-20 without additional PTMs (2mK20-H4). The next most abundant form was dimethylated at Lys-20 and acetylated at Lys-16 (aK16, 2mK20-H4). Together, these forms accounted for ∼90% of all H4 in untreated asynchronous S2 cells, and this was not altered by treatment with luciferase dsRNA (Table 1). The remaining four components: 0mK20-H4, 1mK20-H4, aK16,1mK20-H4, and a mixture containing the nearly isobaric 3mK20-H4 and aK16-H4 forms each accounted for less than 5% percent of the sample in both untreated asynchronous and luciferase dsRNA-treated cells (Table 1). We estimate that 3mK20-H4 represented ∼1% of total H4 in these control samples, slightly lower than we typically find in mammalian cells (Table 2) (8Pesavento J.J. Yang H. Kelleher N.L. Mizzen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 468-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and just below our threshold for precise direct quantitation from mixtures (36Pesavento J.J. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L.

Open table in a new tab Depletion of PR-Set7 led to a readily apparent increase in the level of 0mK20-H4 (Fig. 1 and Table 1), suggesting that PR-Set7 is responsible for forming at least a portion of 1mK20-H4 in vivo even though the global levels of 1mK20-H4 did not change appreciably (see below). In contrast, depletion of Suv4-20 caused the levels of 1mK20-H4 to increase, and those of 2mK20-H4 to decrease markedly, providing dramatic evidence that Suv4-20 forms most, if not all, 2mK20-H4 in vivo. Immunoblotting with antisera to 3mK20-H4 confirmed that depletion of Suv4-20 also led to decreased levels of 3mK20-H4 (supplemental Fig. S1). Combined RNAi against mRNAs encoding PR-Set7 and Suv4-20 appeared to prevent the majority of Lys-20 methylation such that 0mK20-H4 ultimately became the predominant form (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The persistence of 1mK20-H4 following PR-Set7 depletion suggested the possibility that other enzymes might contribute to Lys-20 monomethylation. However, depletion of Ash1 or NSD1 did not affect global levels of 1m, 2m, or 3mK20-H4 assessed by immunoblotting (data not shown) or by TDMS (supplemental Fig. S2). Moreover, combined RNAi targeting mRNAs encoding Ash1 or NSD1 in conjunction with PR-Set7 resulted in H4 modification profiles that were essentially identical to those obtained following RNAi for PR-Set7 alone (compare Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that neither factor is redundant with PR-Set7 at the global level. Our finding that 0mK20-H4 predominated when PR-Set7 and Suv4-20 were depleted together, whereas 1mK20-H4 predominated when only Suv4-20 was depleted, clearly suggests that PR-Set7 forms most 1mK20-H4 in vivo. Thus, the apparent perduration of 1mK20-H4 and limited decrease in 2mK20-H4 levels following depletion of PR-Set7 alone indicates that 0mK20-H4 serves as a substrate for Suv4-20 in the absence of PR-Set7, forming detectable amounts of 1mK20-H4 as an intermediate in the formation of 2m/3mK20-H4. This is consistent with the ability of the murine Suv4-20h1/h2 SET domains to methylate bacterially expressed H4 in recombinant nucleosomes in vitro (11Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results in Fig. 1 suggest that PR-Set7 is the major activity responsible for forming 1mK20-H4, most of which is methylated further by Suv4-20 to fo"
https://openalex.org/W2049436291,"Eisosomes are recently described fungal structures that play roles in the organization of the plasma membrane and endocytosis. Their major protein components are Pil1 and Lsp1, and previous studies showed that these proteins are phosphorylated by the sphingolipid long-chain base-activated Pkh1 and Pkh2 protein kinases in vitro. We show that Pkh1 and Pkh2 phosphorylate Pil1 and Lsp1 in vivo to produce species B, and that heat stress, which activates Pkh1 and Pkh2, generates a more highly phosphorylated species, C. Cells with low Pkh activity lack species B and C and contain abnormally organized eisosomes. To verify that Pil1 phosphorylation is essential for correct eisosome organization, phosphorylated serine and threonine residues were identified and changed to alanines. A variant Pil1 protein lacking five phosphorylation sites did not form eisosomes during log phase growth, indicating that phosphorylation is critical for eisosome organization. We also found that eisosomes are dynamic structures and disassemble when the Ypk protein kinases, which are activated by the sphingolipid-Pkh signaling pathway, are inactivated or when the sphingolipid signal is pharmacologically blocked with myriocin. We conclude that eisosome formation and turnover are regulated by the sphingolipid-Pkh1/2-Ypk1/2 signaling pathway. These data and previous data showing that endocytosis is regulated by the sphingolipid-Pkh1/2-Ypk1/2 signaling pathway suggest that Pkh1 and -2 respond to changes in membrane sphingolipids and transmit this information to eisosomes via Pil1 phosphorylation. Eisosomes then control endocytosis to align the composition and function of the plasma membrane to match demand.

Eisosomes then control endocytosis to align the composition and function of the plasma membrane to match demand. The plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells is a dynamic assembly of lipids and proteins that modulates and integrates a complex spectrum of cellular processes in ways that remain unclear. Recently, two related Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins, Pil1 and Lsp1, were shown to comprise novel structures on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane termed eisosomes (1Walther T.C. Brickner J.H. Aguilar P.S. Bernales S. Pantoja C. Walter P. Nature. 2006; 439: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Eisosomes mark sites for endocytosis of proteins and lipids, and they are sequestered on patches in the plasma membrane rich in sterols and specific protein transporters (2Grossmann G. Opekarova M. Malinsky J. Weig-Meckl I. Tanner W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We showed previously that Pil1 and Lsp1 are phosphorylated in vitro by the Pkh1 and Pkh2 protein kinases (3Zhang X. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation by Pkh1/2 suggests that some function of Pil1, Lsp1, and eisosomes is regulated by phosphorylation.

Heat stress was examined, because heat induces a transient increase in sphingolipid long-chain bases (LCBs), 6The abbreviations used are: LCB, long-chain base; ESI, electrospray ionization; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LC, liquid chromatography; LTQ-FT, ion trap-Fourier transform; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; QTOF, quadrupole time of flight; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; YPD, yeast extract, peptone, dextrose; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MS/MS, tandem MS; MS3, MS/MS/MS. 6The abbreviations used are: LCB, long-chain base; ESI, electrospray ionization; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LC, liquid chromatography; LTQ-FT, ion trap-Fourier transform; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; QTOF, quadrupole time of flight; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; YPD, yeast extract, peptone, dextrose; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MS/MS, tandem MS; MS3, MS/MS/MS. the only known activators of Pkh1/2 (3Zhang X.

Deletion of either PIL1 or LSP1 led to an increase in the level of activated Slt2 during a heat stress, suggesting that Pil1 and Lsp1 play a role in regulating the Pkc1-mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (3Zhang X.

In addition, both deletion strains were more resistant to heat stress. Several other results implied that Pil1 and Lsp1 regulate the activity of Ypk1. Together these data suggested that Pil1 and Lsp1 modulate Pkh1/2 and downstream kinases to control cell wall integrity during non-stressful and stressful circumstances. Pkh1 and Pkh2 have partially overlapping functions that play incompletely characterized roles in endocytosis (8Friant S. Lombardi R. Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Riezman H.

Biol. 2007; 27: 633-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, Pkh1, but not Pkh2, has been implicated in the regulation of yeast life-span (18Powers 3rd, R.W. Kaeberlein M. Caldwell S.D. Kennedy B.K. Fields S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). To further understand how Pil1 and Lsp1 regulate cell wall integrity, we examined their phosphorylation in vivo and now show that there are two species, A and B, of each protein in unstressed, log phase cells and that these species differ in their level of phosphorylation. Heat stress generates a third, more highly phosphorylated species, C. Phosphorylation of species B and C is mediated by Pkh1/2, and these kinases may also be responsible for phosphorylation of species A. In cells with reduced Pkh activity, phosphorylation of Pil1 and Lsp1 is reduced, there are fewer eisosomes, the eisosomes are not spaced as evenly on the plasma membrane as in wild-type cells, and eisosomes are less homogeneous in size, suggesting that phosphorylation plays roles in eisosome organization. In addition, we find that the Ypk1/2 kinases, which are regulated by the LCB-Pkh1/2 pathway, are necessary for maintaining eisosomes. Together our data suggest that phosphorylation of Pil1 is important both for assembly and for disassembly of eisosomes, which have not previously been recognized as dynamic structures whose number, size, and spatial organization changes. Given that eisosomes mark sites of endocytosis, we speculate that Pil1 phosphorylation plays roles in regulating endocytosis thereby modulating the composition and functions of the plasma membrane. Strains, Plasmids, and Media—Yeast strains used in these studies are described in Table 1. For heat shock experiments, cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), and for overproducing Pil1 they were grown in a defined medium (19Fabrizio P. Liou L.L. Moy V.N. Diaspro A. SelverstoneValentine J. Gralla E.B. Longo V.D. Genetics. 2003; 163: 35-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic medium lacking uracil (0.34% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 1% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, 30 mg/liter each of adenine, isoleucine, and tyrosine, and 20 mg/liter each of histidine, leucine, lysine, methionine, and tryptophan) was used to grow cells for fluorescence microscopy and for selecting cells transformed with a plasmid carrying URA3. Solid media contained 2% agar. For microscopy cells were grown in YPD supplemented with 150 mg/liter of adenine sulfate (YPAD).TABLE 1Strains used in this workStrainGenotypeReference15 DauMATa ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 trp1Δ his2Δ ade1Δ(5Inagaki M.

PKH1, PKH2, and wild-type or mutant forms of PIL1 were transformed into yeast cells by using pRS316 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A wild-type allele of PKH1 containing 197 bp upstream of start codon and an added BamH1 site, and 298 bp downstream of stop codon plus an added SalI site, was synthesized by PCR and cloned into the corresponding sites of pRS316 to give pRS316-PKH1. The same strategy was used to clone a wild-type allele of PKH2 containing 698 bp upstream of start codon and 380 bp downstream of stop codon into pRS316 to give pRS316-PKH2. A wild-type allele of PIL1 containing 520 bp upstream of start codon and 458 bp downstream of stop codon was cloned into pRS316 in an identical manner to give pRS316-PIL1, which served as a template for site-directed mutagenesis (GeneEditor, Promega, Madison, WI). Protein Extraction and Analysis—Cell-free yeast extracts were prepared by using glass beads and vortexing as described previously (5Inagaki M. Schmelzle T. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Hall M.N. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8344-8352Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The published Hot-SDS protein extraction protocol was modified slightly (21Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Ten A600 units of yeast cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with water, and then suspended in 400 μl of cold distilled water, followed by the addition of 400 μl of 0.2 m NaOH. Samples were mixed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were concentrated by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, suspended in 200 μl of SDS sample buffer (0.06 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 5% glycerol, 1% SDS, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and boiled for 3–5 min. Samples were centrifuged, and the protein concentration of the supernatant fluid was determined by using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Species A, B, and C of Pil1 were prepared for mass spectrometry (MS) by growing DBY746 cells transformed with pYES2/NTA-PIL1 in 1 liter of defined medium lacking uracil and containing 2% sucrose and 0.1% glucose to an A600 of 0.3 at 30 °C. Powdered galactose (2%, w/v), peptone (1%), and yeast extract (1%) were added to induce production of His6-Pil1, and the culture was incubated for 10 h (A and B species) or for 48 h (C species). The A and B species were isolated by nickel affinity chromatography as described previous (10Liu K. Zhang X. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22679-22987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) except that Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate were omitted from the lysis buffer, the concentration of EDTA was reduced to 0.02 mm, and 0.5% glycerol and 0.033 mm dithiothreitol were included. After lysis with glass beads, n-octyl-β-glucoside (0.5% w/v) and NaCl (final concentration 300 mm) were added to the lysate, which was vortexed for 10 s and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C before centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 0.5-ml nickel affinity column and washed with 30 ml of buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, ph7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.05% n-octyl-β-glucoside) followed by washing with 50 ml of buffer II (same as buffer I except 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole). Following another wash with 10 ml of buffer III (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole), His6-Pil1 was eluted with 15 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm imidazole). Fractions were analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and the Coomassie Blue-stained A and B bands were excised from the gel and stored at –80 °C. The C species of Pil1 was prepared from 30–40 A600 units of cells by scaling up the Hot-SDS procedure. The extract was diluted 10-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate) and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0.1 ml of a 50% solution of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich), which had been washed with and suspended in immunoprecipitation buffer. Agarose-bound His6-Pil1 was washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, suspended in SDS sample buffer, heated 5 min at 95 °C, and run on a 9% SDS-PAGE (20 cm long gel). The C band was excised from a Coomassie Blue-stained gel and stored at –80 °C. Samples were treated with lambda protein phosphatase as described by the supplier (New England BioLabs) with small modifications. For analysis of Pil1 (100 μg of cell-free extract) the total reaction volume was 0.6 ml and for analysis of Lsp1 (50 μg cell-free extract) the reaction volume was 0.3 ml. EDTA, final concentration of 50 mm, and sodium orthovanadate, final concentration of 5 mm, were used to inhibit phosphatase activity. Proteins were concentrated by acetone precipitation, 7Pierce Chemicals Technical Resource brochure Acetone Precipitation of Proteins. and the pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of 1× SDS sample loading buffer and immunoblotted. Immunoblotting—Protein extracts were electrophoresed on a 9% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred (transfer buffer: 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol) for 1 h at 12 V to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked in 2% nonfat milk for 1 h, washed with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) for 10 min, and incubated 1 h with anti-Vma2 mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, diluted 1:1,000) and polyclonal rabbit antibody against Lsp1 or Pil1 (diluted 1:2,500) diluted in TBS buffer. The membrane was washed twice with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), twice with TBS and then incubated 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-rabbit antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, diluted 1:3,000 in TBS) and anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:5,000, Sigma). The membrane was washed with TBS-T three times and exposed to an ECF substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescent signals were analyzed by using a PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuaNT software. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against the C terminus of Pil1 (CVGHQQSESLPQQTTA) and Lsp1 (CHHVSQNGHTSGSENI, Genemed Synthesis Inc., San Francisco, CA). Microscopy—A Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Plan Apo 100×, 1.40 oil immersion objective was used for fluorescence microscopy. Room temperature samples were photographed with a SPOT RT 9.0 Monochrome-6 camera using the MetaMorph (Version 6.3.0) acquisition software. A Leica TSC SP5 broadband microscope with an HCX PL Apo, 100×, 1.40 oil immersion objective was used for confocal microscopy. Photographs were taken at room temperature using LAS AF 1.5.1 acquisition software. Images were processed by using Adobe Photoshop (version 7.0). Mass Spectrometry—Coomassie-stained bands containing Pil1 were excised from SDS-PAGE gels and cut in small cubes. Gel pieces were destained by alternating washes with H2O and 50% acetonitrile. Reduction and alkylation was not performed, because Pil1 does not contain any cysteines. Gel pieces were incubated with acetonitrile for 10 min, which was then removed. Proteases were dissolved in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at a concentration of 12.5 ng/μl. Gel pieces were covered with protease solution and incubated for 30 min on ice. Remaining protease solution was removed, 30 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 was added, and samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Proteolysis was stopped by making the samples 0.2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. For MALDI-MS analysis, samples were prepared by the dried droplet method (22Karas M. Hillenkamp F. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 2299-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar), and 0.5–1 μl of sample was spotted on the target together with matrix, either α-cyano-hydroxy cinnemaic acid (10 mg/ml in 70% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid) or 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (in 50% acetonitrile, 1% phosphoric acid). Samples were measured either on Ultraflex (Bruker) or MALDI-Q-Tof (Micromass, Manchester, UK) mass spectrometers. LC-MS analysis was performed on a nano-LC system (Proxeon Biosystems) coupled to a LTQ-FT mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan). Digested protein samples were either loaded directly onto the high-performance liquid chromatograph or after concentration on C18 STAGE tips (23Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Peptides were loaded onto a 1.5-cm-long trapping column (75-μm inner diameter) and separated on a 9-cm-long analytical column (50-μm inner diameter). Both columns were prepared by pressure-packing ReproSil Pur C18-AQ 3-μm reversed-phase beads (Dr. Maisch, HPLC GmbH, Tuebingen, Germany) into fused silica capillaries containing Kasil frits (PQ Corp.). Peptides were eluted with a 30-min linear gradient of 4–32% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid at a flow of 250 nl/min. Analysis of peptides on the LTQ-FT was performed as described previously (24Gruhler A. Olsen J.V. Mohammed S. Mortensen P. Faergeman N.J. Mann M. Jensen O.N. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 310-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). For nano-ESI-MS, peptides were bound to a C18 STAGE tip and eluted with 2 μl of 50% MeOH and 0.5% acetic acid into a nano-electrospray emitter (Proxeon Biosystems). Peptides were measured on a Q-Tof Ultima (Micromass) without back pressure at ∼900 V in positive ion mode and fragmented with low energy collision-induced decomposition. Data analysis and MaxEnt3 processing was performed with MassLynx 4 (Micromass). All spectra were searched with MASCOT using the SGD data base of translated yeast open-reading frames, which also contained mammalian keratins and trypsin. The following search parameters were used. (a) For MALDI: mass accuracy, 50 ppm; modifications, carbamidomethyl (fixed), oxidation (M), and deamidation (NQ); two missed cleavages; cleavage specificity, either trypsin AspN or LysC. (b) For LC-MS: mass accuracy, 20 ppm (parent ion) and 0.8 Da (fragment ions); modifications, carbamidomethyl (fixed), oxidation (M), and deamidation (NQ); two missed cleavages; cleavage specificity, either trypsin AspN or LysC. Analysis of Species A Made in pkh1/2 Mutant Cells—Strains RCD520 (transformed with pYES2-NTA-LSP1), RCD521 (transformed with pYES2-NTA-LSP1), and 15 Dau (transformed with pYE2S-NTA-LSP1 or with pYES2-NTA-PIL1) were grown in defined medium lacking uracil and containing 2% galactose and 1% sucrose for 12 h at 25 °C to an A600 of 0.4. 50 A600 units of cells were lysed by using the Hot-SDS protein extraction protocol described above. His6-tagged proteins were purified by combining 60 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen), 200 μl of protein extract, and 4.5 ml of lysis buffer (Qiagen: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm imidazole) and incubating 3 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. The beads were washed twice with 0.5 ml of buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole) and once with wash buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Beads were treated with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins stained with Pro-Q Diamond (Molecular Probes) were analyzed on a Typhoon 9400 scanner with the following settings: Emission filter = 560 LP/Green, PMT = 400, Laser = Green 532 nm, Sensitivity = normal.

https://openalex.org/W2060990419,"Appropriate temporospatial expression of the transcription factor SOX9 is important for normal development of a wide range of organs. Here, we show that when SOX9 is expressed ectopically, target genes become expressed that are associated with disease. Histone deacetylase inhibitors in clinical trials for cancer therapy induced SOX9 expression via enhanced recruitment of nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) to CCAAT elements in the SOX9 proximal promoter. The effect of histone deacetylase inhibitors could be elicited in cells that normally lack SOX9, such as hepatocytes. In human fetal hepatocytes, this aberrant induction of SOX9 protein caused ectopic expression of COL2A1 and COMP1 that encode extracellular matrix (ECM) components normally associated with chondrogenesis. Previously, ectopic expression of this ""chondrogenic"" profile has been implicated in vascular calcification. More broadly, inappropriate ECM deposition is a hallmark of fibrosis. We demonstrated that induction of SOX9 expression also occurred during activation of fibrogenic cells from the adult liver when the transcription factor was responsible for expression of the major component of fibrotic ECM, type 1 collagen. These combined data identify new aspects in the regulation of SOX9 expression. They support a role for SOX9 beyond normal development as a transcriptional regulator in the pathology of fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1968226123,"The Notch signaling pathway plays a key role in a myriad of cellular processes, including cell fate determination. Despite extensive study of the downstream consequences of receptor activation, very little molecular data are available for the initial binding event between the Notch receptor and its ligands. In this study, we have expressed and purified a natively folded wild-type epidermal growth factor-like domain (EGF) 11-14 construct from human Notch-1 and have used flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance analysis to demonstrate a calcium-dependent interaction with the human ligand Delta-like-1. Site-directed mutagenesis of three of the calcium-binding sites within the Notch-(11-14) fragment indicated that only loss of calcium binding to EGF12, and not EGF11 or EGF13, abrogates ligand binding. Further mapping of the ligand-binding site within this region by limited proteolysis of Notch wild-type and mutant fragments suggested that EGF12 rather than EGF11 contains the major Delta-like-1-binding site. Analysis of an extended fragment EGF-(10-14), where EGF11 is placed in a native context, surprisingly demonstrated a reduction in ligand binding, suggesting that EGF10 modulates binding by limiting access of ligand. This inhibition could be overcome by the introduction of a calcium binding mutation in EGF11, which decouples the EGF-(10-11) module interface. This study therefore demonstrates that long range calcium-dependent structural perturbations can influence the affinity of Notch for its ligand, in the absence of any post-translational modifications."
https://openalex.org/W1972809823,"Much of human learning in a social context has an interactive nature: What an individual learns is affected by what other individuals are learning at the same time. Games represent a widely accepted paradigm for representing interactive decision-making. We explored the potential value of neural networks for modeling and predicting human interactive learning in repeated games. We found that even very simple learning networks, driven by regret-based feedback, accurately predict observed human behavior in different experiments on 21 games with unique equilibria in mixed strategies. Introducing regret in the feedback dramatically improved the performance of the neural network. We show that regret-based models provide better predictions of learning than established economic models."

The internalized MHC-I molecules are then sequestered in endosomal compartments by a process requiring Nef Met20. How Nef assembles the multikinase cascade to trigger the MHC-I down-regulation pathway is unknown. Here we report that EEEE65-dependent binding to the sorting protein PACS-2 targets Nef to the paranuclear region, enabling PXXP75 to bind and activate a trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized SFK. This SFK then phosphorylates ZAP-70 to recruit class I PI3K by interaction with the p85 C-terminal Src homology 2 domain. Using splenocytes and embryonic fibroblasts from PACS-2-/- mice, we confirm genetically that Nef requires PACS-2 to localize to the paranuclear region and assemble the multikinase cascade. Moreover, genetic loss of PACS-2 or inhibition of class I PI3K prevents Nef-mediated MHC-I down-regulation, demonstrating that short interfering RNA knockdown of PACS-2 phenocopies the gene knock-out. This PACS-2-dependent targeting pathway is not restricted to Nef, because PACS-2 is also required for trafficking of an endocytosed cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor reporter from early endosomes to the TGN.

Assembly of this multikinase complex is initiated by the EEEE65-dependent targeting of Nef to the paranuclear region, which enables the PXXP75 SH3 domain-binding motif to recruit a TGN-localized SFK.

The analysis of interfering mutants to dissect the interactions of PACS proteins with these regulatory proteins has provided new insights into how these specific interactions affect protein and membrane traffic. Identifying specific sorting steps mediated by PACS-1 or PACS-2 has, however, required genetic approaches. Accordingly, RNA interference knockdown of Caenorhabditis elegans PACS, which is expressed from a single gene and localizes to presynaptic endosomes, disrupted synaptic transmission and led to paralysis (34Sieburth D. Ch'ng Q. Dybbs M. Tavazoie M. Kennedy S. Wang D. Dupuy D. Rual J.F. Hill D.E. Vidal M. Ruvkun G. Kaplan J.M. Nature. 2005; 436: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Studies in human cells using antisense or siRNA knockdown reveal that PACS-1 is required for the TGN localization of the cellular proteins furin and CI-MPR, as well as viral envelope glycoproteins, such as human cytomegalovirus gB and the feline RD114 retrovirus envelope glycoprotein, to regulate virus assembly (22Bouard D.

PACS-1 has additional roles in late secretory trafficking steps, among them the recycling of internalized cargo from early endosomes to the cell surface (31Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Kamibayashi C.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1399-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and the trafficking of acidic cluster-containing cargo to the primary cilium in epithelial cells (35Schermer B. Hopker K.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4415-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Likewise, the recently identified PACS-2 is required for localizing profurin and the calcium-permeable ion channel polycystin-2 to the ER (26Kottgen M. Benzing T. Simmen T. Tauber R. Buchholz B.

PACS-2 also combines with PACS-1 to mediate the stepwise movement of polycystin-2 from the ER to the TGN and to the cell surface in cell types ranging from epithelial cells to Xenopus oocytes (26Kottgen M. Benzing T. Simmen T. Tauber R. Buchholz B. Feliciangeli S. Huber T.B. Schermer B. Kramer-Zucker A. Hopker K. Simmen K.C. Tschucke C.C. Sandford R. Kim E. Thomas G. Walz G.

Moreover, the roles of PACS-1 in late secretory pathway sorting do not exclude similar roles for PACS-2. Here we report that Nef requires PACS-1 and PACS-2 to down-regulate MHC-I but that their roles in Nef action are distinct. Whereas Nef requires PACS-1 distal to PI3K stimulation, studies using siRNA knockdown and cells from PACS-2-/- mice demonstrate that Nef requires PACS-2 for targeting to the late Golgi/TGN region, for assembly of the multikinase complex, and for down-regulation of MHC-I. Although Nef requires PACS-2 to target to the paranuclear region to assemble the multikinase complex, the itinerant cellular protein CI-MPR requires both PACS-1 and PACS-2 to localize to the TGN and to sort from early endosomal compartments. Together, these results suggest sequential roles for PACS-2 and PACS-1 in Nef-mediated MHC-I down-regulation and explain how the PACS proteins combine to mediate the trafficking of cellular cargo in the TGN/endosomal system.

https://openalex.org/W2124052674,"Adult mouse ventricular myocytes express S1P(1), S1P(2), and S1P(3) receptors. S1P activates Akt and ERK in adult mouse ventricular myocytes through a pertussis toxin-sensitive (G(i/o)-mediated) pathway. Akt and ERK activation by S1P are reduced approximately 30% in S1P(3) and 60% in S1P(2) receptor knock-out myocytes. With combined S1P(2,3) receptor deletion, activation of Akt is abolished and ERK activation is reduced by nearly 90%. Thus the S1P(1) receptor, while present in S1P(2,3) receptor knock-out myocytes, is unable to mediate Akt or ERK activation. In contrast, S1P induces pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in both WT and S1P(2,3) receptor knock-out myocytes demonstrating that the S1P(1) receptor can functionally couple to G(i). An S1P(1) receptor selective agonist, SEW2871, also decreased cAMP accumulation but failed to activate ERK or Akt. To determine whether localization of the S1P(1) receptor mediates this signaling specificity, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) treatment was used to disrupt caveolae. The S1P(1) receptor was concentrated in caveolar fractions, and associated with caveolin-3 and this localization was disrupted by MbetaCD. S1P-mediated activation of ERK or Akt was not diminished but inhibition of cAMP accumulation by S1P and SEW2871 was abolished by MbetaCD treatment. S1P inhibits the positive inotropic response to isoproterenol and this response is also mediated through the S1P(1) receptor and lost following caveolar disruption. Thus localization of S1P(1) receptors to caveolae is required for the ability of this receptor to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and contractility but compromises receptor coupling to Akt and ERK."
https://openalex.org/W1983162461,"Insect color patterns can be very diverse. This variation is also seen among many larval instar stages, which can take on vastly different phenotypes. Young caterpillars of the swallowtail butterfly, Papilio xuthus , are mimics of bird droppings, whereas the fifth larval instar is camouflaged among the leaves of host plants (cryptic pattern). We find that juvenile hormone (JH) titers decrease during the fourth larval instar. Furthermore, treatment with JH analog at the beginning of the fourth instar stage resulted in reproducing the mimetic pattern instead of the usual cryptic one and likewise altered gene expression patterns to that associated with the mimetic pattern. These findings suggest that JH regulates the progressive larval pattern switch of this insect."

In both elements, the superconducting energy gap extracted from these measurements was found to converge with sharp anomalies originating from Fermi-surface nesting (Kohn anomalies) at low temperatures. The results indicate electron many-body correlations beyond the standard theoretical framework for conventional superconductivity. A possible mechanism is the interplay between superconductivity and spin- or charge-density-wave fluctuations, which may induce dynamical nesting of the Fermi surface."

We, therefore, investigated the role of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, phospholipase D (PLD), and Rac in S1P-induced migration of human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs). S1P-induced migration was sensitive to S1P1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and pertussis toxin, demonstrating coupling of S1P1 to Gi. Overexpression of dominant negative (dn) PKC-ϵ or -ζ, but not PKC-α or -δ, blocked S1P-induced migration. Although S1P activated both PLD1 and PLD2, S1P-induced migration was attenuated by knocking down PLD2 or expressing dnPLD2 but not PLD1. Blocking PKC-ϵ, but not PKC-ζ, activity attenuated S1P-mediated PLD stimulation, demonstrating that PKC-ϵ, but not PKC-ζ, was upstream of PLD. Transfection of HPAECs with dnRac1 or Rac1 siRNA attenuated S1P-induced migration. Furthermore, transfection with PLD2 siRNA, infection of HPAECs with dnPKC-ζ, or treatment with myristoylated PKC-ζ peptide inhibitor abrogated S1P-induced Rac1 activation.

In ECs, very little is known regarding the role of S1P-induced PLD activation and generation of PA in cell migration, wound healing, and angiogenesis. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the role of S1P on human pulmonary artery endothelial cell (HPAEC) and established how the activation of the PKC isoform(s) is involved in upstream and downstream signaling of PLD1 and/or PLD2 in relation to the stimulation of cell migration. Our results show that physiologically relevant concentrations of S1P markedly stimulated HPAEC migration, which was sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTx) and a S1P1 antagonist. Furthermore, evidence is provided for the role of PKC-ϵ, but not PKC-ζ, in S1P-induced PLD activation and the PLD2-mediated stimulation of PKC-ζ, Rac1, and cell migration.

The cells (passage number 5-8) in 35- or 100-mm dishes or glass coverslips were used for all the experiments. Endothelial Cell Migration—HPAEC were cultured in 12- or 6-well plates to ∼95% confluence and then starved in the serum-free EGM-2 medium for 1-3 h or in EBM-2 medium containing 0.1% FBS for 18-24 h. The cell monolayer was wounded by scratching across the monolayer with a 10-μl standard sterile pipette tip. The scratched monolayer was rinsed twice with serum-free medium to remove cell debris and incubated with varying concentrations of S1P. The area (∼1 cm2 total) in a scratched area was recorded at 0 and 16-24 h using a Hamamatsu digital camera connected to the Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope with ×10 objective and MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Images were analyzed by the Image J software. The effect of S1P and other agents on cell migration/wound healing was quantified by calculating the percentage of the free area not occupied by cells compared with an area of the initial wound that was defined as closure of wounded area. Electrical Cell Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) Assay—HPAEC were cultured in 8-well ECIS electrode arrays (8W1E, Applied Biophysics, NY) to ∼95% confluence and starved in the serum-free EBM-2 medium for 1-3 h. An elevated field (3 V at 40,000 Hz for 10 s) was applied to wound the cells on the electrode. Either complete medium or medium containing S1P (100-1000 nm) was added, and wound healing was monitored for 10-20 h by measuring the transendothelial electrical resistance using the ECIS equipment (11Garcia J.G.

Infection of HPAECs with Adenoviral Vectors—cDNA for wild type and catalytically inactive mutants of PLD1, PLD2, and dominant negative Rac1 were subcloned into the pShuttle-CMV vector (32Wang L. Cummings R. Usatyuk P. Morris A. Irani K. Natarajan V. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid was linearized and transfected into HEK293 cells to generate replication-defective adenovirus. Generation of purified virus (1010 plaque-forming units/ml) was carried out by the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core. Purified adenovirus (1-10 m.o.i. or plaqueforming units/cell) in complete EGM-2 medium was added to HPAECs grown to ∼80% confluence in 6-well plates or 60- or 100-mm dishes. After 24 h, the virus-containing medium was replaced with complete EGM-2 medium. Vector control or infected cells were subjected to scratch and wound-healing ECIS assays, and immunoprecipitates or cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. Measurement of PLD Activation by S1P—HPAECs in 35-mm dishes were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (5 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free DMEM for 18-24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were then challenged with EBM-2 medium alone or EBM-2 containing S1P plus 0.1% BSA in the presence of 0.1% 1-butanol (22Cummings R.J. Parinandi N.L. Zaiman A. Wang L. Usatyuk P.V. Garcia J.G.

Incubations were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of methanol:HCl (100:1 v/v), cells were scraped into glass tubes, and lipids were extracted by the addition of 1 ml of methanol:HCl (100:1 v/v), 2 ml of chloroform, and 0.8 ml of 1 n HCl. [32P]Phosphatidylbutanol (PBt), formed as a result of PLD activation and transphosphatidylation of [32P]PA to 1-butanol, but not butan-3-ol, was separated from the total lipid extract by thin layer chromatography on 1% potassium oxalate plates with the upper phase of ethyl acetate:2,2,4-trimethyl pentane:glacial acetic acid:water (65:10:15:50 v/v) as the developing solvent system (22Cummings R.J.

Unlabeled PBt was added as carrier during separation of labeled lipids that were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor. Radioactivity associated with PBt was quantified by liquid scintillation counting, and all values were normalized to 106 dpm in total lipid extract. [32P]PBt formed in control and S1P-challenged samples was expressed as dpm/dish or percent control. Measurement of PKC-ϵ and PKC-ζ Activation—HPAECs were cultured in 100-mm dishes to ∼95% confluence, starved in EBM-2 medium containing 0.1% FBS for 3 h, stimulated with S1P for 5-10 min, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm vanadate, and lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and protease inhibitors from EDTA-free Complete tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cells were subsequently sonicated twice for 15 s and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were collected and incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-PKC-ϵ or anti-PKC-ζ antibody at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and 2 times with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in 100 μl of kinase buffer. The activity of PKC was measured in 100 μl of kinase buffer containing 25 μg of myelin basic protein as an exogenous substrate to which 10 μm ATP, 2 μg of dioleoylglycerol, 12 μg of phosphatidylserine, and 20-40 μl of immunoprecipitate were added. Incubations were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were then boiled for 5 min and analyzed for phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by Western blotting with anti-phosphoserine antibody. Rac1 Activation Assay—HPAECs were cultured in 100-mm dishes to ∼50% confluence for siRNA transfection or to ∼95% confluence for adenoviral infection or inhibitor treatment. Cells were starved in EBM-2 medium containing 0.1% FBS for 3 h before stimulation with S1P for 2-15 min, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with PAK-1 PBD, and Rac1 activation was evaluated using the Rac1 Activation assay kit as per the manufacturer's instruction (Upstate). Western Blot Analysis—HPAECs were cultured in 6-well plates or 60-mm dishes to ∼95% confluence and starved for 3 h in EBM-2 medium containing 0.1% FBS. Cells were stimulated with S1P (100-1000 nm) for 5-60 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with 100-300 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and protease inhibitors from EDTA-free Complete tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and boiled with the Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Cell lysates (20-30 μg protein) were separated on 10% or 4-20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blocked in TBST containing 5% BSA before incubation with primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) overnight. After blocking, washing, and incubation with appropriate secondary antibody, blots were developed using an ECL chemiluminescence kit. Western blots were scanned by densitometry, and integrated density of pixels in identified areas was quantified using Image-Quant Version 5.2 software (GE Healthcare). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HPAECs grown on coverslips (18 mm) or chamber slides were starved for 3 h in EBM-2 containing 0.1% FBS before treatment with S1P (100-1000 nm) for 5-60 min. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with methanol for 4 min at -20 °C, blocked with 2% BSA in TBST, incubated for 1 h with appropriate primary antibody (1:200 dilution), washed with TBST, and stained for 1 h with secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) in TBST containing 2% BSA. Cells were examined using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S immunofluorescence microscope and a Hamamatsu digital camera with ×60 oil immersion objective and Meta Vue software. RNA Isolation and Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HPAECs grown on 35-mm dishes using TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. iQ SYBR Green Supermix was used to do the real time measurements using iCycler by Bio-Rad. 18 S (sense, 5′-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3′) was used as a housekeeping gene to normalize expression. The reaction mixture consisted of 0.3 μg of total RNA (target gene) or 0.03 μg of total RNA (18 S rRNA), 12.5 μl of iQ SYBR Green, 2 μl of cDNA, 1.5 μm target primers, or 1 μm 18 S rRNA primers in a total volume of 25 μl. For all samples reverse transcription was carried out at 25 °C for 5 min followed by cycling to 42 °C for 30 min and 85 °C for 5 min with iScript cDNA synthesis kit. Amplicon expression in each sample was normalized to its 18 S rRNA content. The relative abundance of target mRNA in each sample was calculated as 2 raised to the negative of its threshold cycle value times 106 after being normalized to the abundance of its corresponding 18 S rRNA (housekeeping gene) (2-(primer threshold cycle)2-(18 S threshold cycle) × 106). All primers were designed by inspection of the genes of interest using Primer 3 software. Negative controls consisting of reaction mixtures containing all components except target RNA were included with each of the RT-PCR runs. To verify that amplified products were derived from mR"
https://openalex.org/W1991920768,"Transcriptional regulation of the galactose-metabolizing genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae depends on three core proteins: Gal4p, the transcriptional activator that binds to upstream activating DNA sequences (UAS GAL ); Gal80p, a repressor that binds to the carboxyl terminus of Gal4p and inhibits transcription; and Gal3p, a cytoplasmic transducer that, upon binding galactose and adenosine 5′-triphosphate, relieves Gal80p repression. The current model of induction relies on Gal3p sequestering Gal80p in the cytoplasm. However, the rapid induction of this system implies that there is a missing factor. Our structure of Gal80p in complex with a peptide from the carboxyl-terminal activation domain of Gal4p reveals the existence of a dinucleotide that mediates the interaction between the two. Biochemical and in vivo experiments suggests that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) plays a key role in the initial induction event."
https://openalex.org/W2084439619,"In early atherogenesis, subendothelial retention of lipidic droplets is associated with an inflammatory response-to-injury, culminating in the formation of foam cells and plaque. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) is the main constituent of subendothelial lipidic droplets. The process is believed to occur following LDL modification. Searching for a modified LDL in plasma, electronegative LDL [LDL(-)] was identified and found to be associated with major risk biomarkers. The apoprotein in LDL(-) is misfolded, and we show here that this modification primes the aggregation of native LDL, conforming to the typical pattern of protein amyloidogenesis. After a lag phase, whose length depends on LDL(-) concentration, light scattering and atomic force microscopy reveal early exponential growth of intermediate globules, which evolve into fibrils. These globules are remarkably similar to subendothelial droplets in atheromatous lesions and different from those produced by oxidation or biochemical manipulation. During aggregation, ellipticity and tryptophan fluorescence measurements reveal a domino-style spread of apoprotein misfolding from LDL(-) to all of the LDL. Computational analysis of the apoprotein primary sequence predicts an unstable, aggregation-prone domain in the regulatory alpha2 region. Apoprotein misfolding well represents an LDL modification able to transform this cholesterol carrier into a trigger for a response-to-injury in the artery wall."
https://openalex.org/W2076948136,"Maintaining cell shape and tone is crucial for the function and survival of cells and tissues. Mechanotransduction relies on the transformation of minuscule mechanical forces into high-fidelity electrical responses. When mechanoreceptors are stimulated, mechanically sensitive cation channels open and produce an inward transduction current that depolarizes the cell. For this process to operate effectively, the transduction machinery has to retain integrity and remain unfailingly independent of environmental changes. This is particularly challenging for poikilothermic organisms, where changes in temperature in the environment may impact the function of mechanoreceptor neurons. Thus, we wondered how insects whose habitat might quickly vary over several tens of degrees of temperature manage to maintain highly effective mechanical senses. We screened for Drosophila mutants with defective mechanical responses at elevated ambient temperatures, and identified a gene, spam, whose role is to protect the mechanosensory organ from massive cellular deformation caused by heat-induced osmotic imbalance. Here we show that Spam protein forms an extracellular shield that guards mechanosensory neurons from environmental insult. Remarkably, heterologously expressed Spam protein also endowed other cells with superb defence against physically and chemically induced deformation. We studied the mechanical impact of Spam coating and show that spam-coated cells are up to ten times stiffer than uncoated controls. Together, these results help explain how poikilothermic organisms preserve the architecture of critical cells during environmental stress, and illustrate an elegant and simple solution to such challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2140059341,"In prion diseases, the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) becomes misfolded into the pathogenic scrapie isoform (PrP(Sc)) responsible for prion infectivity. We show here that peptides derived from the prion protein N terminus have potent antiprion effects. These peptides are composed of a hydrophobic sequence followed by a basic segment. They are known to have cell-penetrating ability like regular cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), short peptides that can penetrate cellular membranes. Healthy (GT1-1) and scrapie-infected (ScGT1-1) mouse neuronal hypothalamic cells were treated with various CPPs, including the prion protein-derived CPPs. Lysates were analyzed for altered protein levels of PrP(C) or PrP(Sc). Treatment with the prion protein-derived CPPs mouse mPrP(1-28) or bovine bPrP(1-30) significantly reduced PrP(Sc) levels in prion-infected cells but had no effect on PrP(C) levels in noninfected cells. Further, presence of prion protein-derived CPPs significantly prolonged the time before infection was manifested when infecting GT1-1 cells with scrapie. Treatment with other CPPs (penetratin, transportan-10, or poly-L-arginine) or prion protein-derived peptides lacking CPP function (mPrP(23-28,) mPrP(19-30,) or mPrP(23-50)) had no effect on PrP(Sc) levels. The results suggest a mechanism by which the signal sequence guides the prion protein-derived CPP into a cellular compartment, where the basic segment binds specifically to PrP(Sc) and disables formation of prions."
https://openalex.org/W2167362634,"The protein serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (CN) is activated by calmodulin (CaM) in response to intracellular calcium mobilization. A widely accepted model for CN activation involves displacement of the CN autoinhibitory peptide (CN467–486) from the active site upon binding of CaM. However, CN activation requires calcium binding both to the low affinity sites of CNB and to CaM, and previous studies did not dissect the individual contributions of CNB and CaM to displacement of the autoinhibitory peptide from the active site. In this work we have produced separate CN fragments corresponding to the CNA regulatory region (CNRR381–521, residues 381–521), the CNA catalytic domain truncated at residue 341, and the CNA-CNB heterodimer with CNA truncated at residue 380 immediately after the CNB binding helix. We show that the separately expressed regulatory region retains its ability to inhibit CN phosphatase activity of the truncated CN341 and CN380 and that the inhibition can be reversed by calcium/CaM binding. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching measurements further indicate that the isolated regulatory region inhibits CN activity by occluding the catalytic site and that CaM binding exposes the catalytic site. The results provide new support for a model in which calcium binding to CNB enables CaM binding to the CNA regulatory region, and CaM binding then instructs an activating conformational change of the regulatory region that does not depend further on CNB. Moreover, the secondary structural content of the CNRR381–521 was tentatively addressed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results indicate that the secondary structure of CNRR381–521 fragment is predominantly random coil, but with significant amount of β-strand and α-helix structures.

CN is stimulated by the multifunctional protein, calmodulin (CaM), which ensures the coordinated regulation of CN protein phosphatase activity, together with the activities of many other enzymes, including a large number of protein kinases under Ca2+ and CaM control (7Kincaid R.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: l-25Google Scholar). CN has a wide range of physiological substrates (7Kincaid R.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: l-25Google Scholar). The complex regulation observed with CN is expected for an enzyme that is a major player in the regulation of many cellular processes. Various phosphoproteins such as inhibitor 1a, protein kinase A regulatory subunit RII, neurogranin, phosphorylase kinase a, neuromodulin, and small organic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate are all dephosphorylated by CN (7Kincaid R.L. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: l-25Google Scholar). Among CN substrates, the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors is arguably the best understood (2Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar, 9Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). NFAT is a phosphoprotein located in the cytoplasm of the resting cell. In response to physiological signals that elevate intracellular calcium, NFAT is rapidly dephosphorylated by CN, which triggers its import into cell nucleus and subsequent transcriptional activation of NFAT target genes (5Klee C.B.

However, CN residues 1–13 and residues comprising nearly the entire regulatory region (residues 374–468 and 487–521) are not visible in the electron density map of the reported structures (11Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Gastinel L.N. Habuka N. Chen X. Maldonado F. Barker J.E. Bacquet R. Villafranca J.E. Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Another gap in current knowledge is that the structure of the Ca2+-CaM·CN complex has not been solved.Despite the lack of detailed structural information, the regulation mechanism of CN has been inferred from biochemical studies (9Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar, 13Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B.

The enzymatic activity of CN is repressed in its inactive state but becomes fully activated when the regulatory region (residues 381–521) is removed by proteases (15Perrino B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The regulatory region contains two subregions of known function, a CaM-binding peptide and autoinhibitory peptide (14Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 273: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 15Perrino B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The accepted model is that, upon activation by Ca2+, CaM binds to its target sequence in CNA and induces a conformational change in CN that leads to the displacement of autoinhibitory peptide from the active site (Fig. 1). More detailed examination has shown that the Ca2+ dependence of the phosphatase activity of CN is controlled by the two structurally similar but functionally different Ca2+-binding proteins, CaM and CNB subunit. In the presence of less than 10-7 m Ca2+, CNB, with its high affinity Ca2+-binding sites occupied, remains bound to CNA subunit, but the enzyme is inactive. Occupancy of the low affinity sites of CNB (Kd in the low micromolar range) at elevated intracellular calcium concentrations causes a small increase in CN catalytic activity and a conformational change, detectable by limited proteolysis, which facilitates the subsequent binding of CaM (5Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 16Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 17Yang S.A. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16147-16154Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).There are many questions that need to be addressed regarding the mechanism of CN activation. The regulatory region extending from residues 381 to the C terminus of CNA is not visible in the electron density map, except for a small helical fragment at the active site. What structural features of the regulatory region render it a suitable mediator between Ca2+/CaM and CN enzymatic activity? What conformational changes are induced by Ca2+/CaM binding? The fact that the CNB-binding site (residues 341–372) and the CaM-binding site (residues 391–414) are distant from the autoinhibitory peptide (residues 467–486) in the linear sequence of CNA also raises a mechanistic question. Given the fact that Ca2+ binding to CNB causes both a detectable increase in enzyme activity and an increase in accessibility of the CaM binding segment of the CNA regulatory region, do CNB and CaM work at separate steps of CN activation, or do the two proteins work in concert to favor a single activated conformation of the enzyme? Here, we begin to address these questions using a combination of FT-IR spectroscopy, tryptophan fluorescence quenching, and functional studies of engineered CN fragments.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction, Protein Expression, and Purification—pETCNα, a plasmid encoding full-length CN (CNA and CNB), was a gift from Dr. Anjana Rao (Harvard Medical School). CN380 and CNA341 were cloned and amplified by PCR using pETCNα vector as a template. CaM gene was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cloned into pET-15b vector between the NcoI and XhoI sites. AI segment was PCR-amplified using pETCNα as a template and cloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector after the glutathione S-transferase coding sequence between the BamHI and XhoI sites. The plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells and grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin at 37 °C. When A600 reached 0.6, protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactopyranoside. The full-length CN, CN380, CNA341, and CNRR381–521-glutathione S-transferase were grown at 20 °C overnight after induction, and CaM was grown at 37 °C for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation.As for the purification of CN, CN380, and CN341, cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and passed through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Germany) (18Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1659-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), then washed with 20 times column volume of the lysis buffer without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The proteins were eluted with 400 mm imidazole and further purified with gel filtration column Sepharose S-200 (GE Healthcare). The purity of the proteins was greater than 95% based on the results of SDS-PAGE.For CaM, cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm Ca2+). After centrifugation the supernatant was loaded onto a high performance phenyl-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer at room temperature. The column was washed with the same buffer but with 0.2 mm Ca2+ added. The protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EGTA. The CaM-containing fractions were collected and dialyzed against buffer.For glutathione S-transferase-tagged CNRR381–521 segment, the cell lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose resin at 4 °C overnight. The resin was extensively washed with lysis buffer followed by 10 mm reduced glutathione in the same buffer. CNRR381–521 segment was cleaved from the fusion protein and purified using PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) as described in the protocol provided by the vendor. All purified proteins were stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad).FT-IR Spectroscopy and Secondary Structure of AI Segment—FT-IR spectra were measured with a Bomem MB series Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (ABB Bomem, Quebec, Canada) equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector and purged constantly with dry air. Frozen protein samples (∼6 mg/ml) were thawed at room temperature and loaded in an infrared liquid cell with CaF2 windows and a 7.5-μm spacer. For each spectrum, a 256-scan interferogram was collected in a single-beam mode with a 4-cm-1 resolution. Reference spectrum was recorded under identical conditions with only the corresponding buffer in the cell. Protein spectra were subtracted using a previously established protocol and criteria (19Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 20Dong A. Malecki J.M. Lee L. Carpenter J.F. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6660-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The second derivative spectrum was obtained with a 7-point Savitsky-Golay derivative function. Quantitative analysis was carried out by the curve-fittings of the base-line-corrected, invert second derivative spectrum as described previously (19Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). It was assumed that the fraction of residues composing each secondary structural element is proportional to the relative percent area of the associated vibrational band (20Dong A. Malecki J.M. Lee L. Carpenter J.F. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6660-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—The CN enzyme activity was measured by using pNPP (Sigma) and RII phosphopeptide (Biomol) as a substrates (18Li H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1659-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The reaction buffer contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine gamma-globulin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. For assay with pNPP, 20 mm pNPP stock solution was prepared by dissolving pNPP in the assay buffer, 90 μl of which was mixed with 10 μl of CN(reaction buffer in the presence of Ni2+) to give the desired final enzyme concentration (2 μm) and Ni2+ concentration (2 μm). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The release of p-nitrophenolate anion was measured at 405 nm by a SpectraMAX 340 PC microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For assay with RII phosphopeptide, 10 μl of RII phosphopeptide substrates were mixed with 40 μl of CN to give the desired final enzyme concentration (20 nm). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and Malachite green (100 μl, Calbiochem) was added at the end of incubation. The color was allowed to develop for 30 min, and absorption at 620 was monitored.Fluorescence Acrylamide Quenching—Fluorescence intensity was measured by a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) using a 1-cm quartz cuvette at 25 °C. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and 380 nm, respectively. Protein concentration was ∼5 μm. The reaction mixtures were titrated with 4.0 m acrylamide in the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at room temperature. Four cuvettes (designated as A, B, C, and D) containing different solutions were used in the measurement. Cuvettes A, B, and C contained 5 μm protein in buffer, and cuvette D contained buffer only. During the experiment no buffer or acrylamide was titrated into cuvette A, and the readings were used for validating instrument stability. Cuvettes B and C were titrated with the same volume of buffer and acrylamide, respectively. Aliquots of acrylamide were titrated into cuvette D. As a consequence of all the effects on the observed fluorescence intensity, the actual fluorescence intensity fraction can be described as F = (FC/FB) - FD, where FB, FC, and FD are the observed signal fractions of protein fluorescence in cuvettes B, C, and D. To increase the precision, slit widths (both ϵx and ϵm) were adjusted to make the initial values of FB and FC close to 950. For every point the fluorescence intensity was read at least 10 times to ensure that the result was not located at an extreme deviation region. Quenching data were plotted using the Stern-Volmer equation (21Chen R. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13235-13243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), F0/F = (1 + KSV(Q))(1 + V(Q)), where F0/F is the fractional decrease in fluorescence due to the quencher (Q), and Ksv and V are the collisional and static quenching constants, respectively.RESULTSFT-IR Spectra and Secondary Structure of the CN Regulatory Region—Fig. 2 shows the primary FT-IR spectrum of the isolated CN regulatory region, CNRR381–521 segment, in solution. The second derivative analysis provides a mathematic solution to the overlapping components under the amide I band contour (1700–1600 cm-1) and reveals basic band components assignable to various secondary structural elements (Fig. 3). The curve-fitting of the inverted secondary derivative spectrum provides additional quantitative information about the secondary structure of CNRR381–521 segment, which consists of 10% α-helices, 34% β-strands, 20% β-turns, and 36% random coils (Table 1).FIGURE 2FT-IR spectrum of CN CNRR381–521 segment in H2O.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Curve-fitting analysis of the inverted second derivative amide I spectrum of CNRR381–521 segment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Assignments of infrared amide I band components and their relative intensities NA, not applicable.FrequencyaFrequencies are rounded up to the nearest whole numbersAreaAssignmentcm–1%16912.3β-Sheet16818.0β-Turn166911.6β-Turn16589.9α-Helix165035.6Random coil163614.3β-Sheet162518.3β-Sheet1611NASide chainsa Frequencies are rounded up to the nearest whole numbers Open table in a new tab The spectral evidence does not imply, however, that the isolated regulatory region has a single static conformation, but it does suggest that the region possesses some intrinsic structure even in the absence of the CN catalytic domain. The finding motivated us to explore whether or not the isolated regulatory region can undergo conformation changes in a functionally relevant fashion.Calmodulin and the Function of Isolated CN Regulatory Region—To understand how the CN regulatory region responds to CaM and CN active site, we prepared three recombinant forms of CN; they are the wild-type heterodimer of CNA and CNB, a recombinant fragment of CNA truncated at residue 380, which contains the catalytic domain and the CNB binding helix expressed in complex with CNB, and a recombinant fragment of CNA truncated at residue 341, which contains only of the catalytic domain. The three proteins were designated as the full-length CN, CN380, and CN341, respectively. The full-length CN and the truncated forms CN380 and CN341 were all catalytically active in pNPP and RII phosphopeptide assay (data not shown). The phosphatase activity of the full-length CN was stimulated, as expected, by CaM binding in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4CN activity induced by Ca2+/CaM binding. CN was assayed by using pNPP (circles, 2 μm CN with 2 mm Ni2+,) and RII phosphopeptide (squares, 20 nm CN) as substrates with the indicated concentration of CaM. The data shown are the means ± S.D. from three experiments for pNPP assay and two experiments for RII phosphopeptide assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, the disjoint segments, CN380, and the regulatory region CNRR381–521 recapitulated the CaM-dependent regulation of the full-length enzyme. CNRR381–521 was able to inhibit the CN phosphatase activity of CN380 (Fig. 5A; due to the experimental error, RII phosphopeptide inhibition data were not shown here), which is consistent with the findings of other researchers and with the presence of the autoinhibitory peptide within the regulatory region (15Perrino B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The inhibition could be reversed by the addition of CaM. A full reversal could be achieved with only a modest excess of CaM over CN regulatory region (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5A, inhibition of CN380 (2 μm) phosphatase activity by CNRR381–521 segment. CN380 was assayed in the presence of 2 mm Ni2+, 1 mm Ca2+ by using pNPP as substrate with the indicated concentration of CNRR381–521. B, CN380 phosphatase activity induced by Ca2+/CaM binding. The assay was performed by using pNPP (circles, 2 μm CN380 with 2 mm Ni2+, 1 mm Ca2+, 20 μm CNRR381–521) and RII phosphopeptide (squares, 20 nm CN380 with 0.1 mm Ca2+, 100 nm CNRR381–521) as substrates with the indicated concentration of CaM. The data shown are the means ±S.D. from two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been reported in previous work (17Yang S.A. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16147-16154Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that the CN regulatory region folds against CNB and the CNB binding helix when CN is inactive at low Ca2+ concentrations. Thus, a plausible interpretation of the results is that CNB (in the absence of Ca2+) and the CNB binding helix may serve as a template to stabilize the inhibitory conformation of the regulatory region, the activated CNB (in the presence of Ca2+), and the CNB binding helix may stabilize the activated conformation or both. To test these possibilities, we repeated the experiment with CN341, which lacks CNB and the CNB binding helix. The phosphatase activity of CN341 was still inhibited by CN regulatory region CNRR381–521 (Fig. 6A, RII phosphopeptide inhibition data were not shown), and the inhibition was reversed by Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 6B). These findings rule out a direct requirement for CNB and the CNB binding helix in the conformational change that relieves autoinhibition and suggest that the primary locus of a CaM-dependent reorganization is the CN regulatory region, CNRR381–521.FIGURE 6A, inhibition of CN341 (2 μm) phosphatase activity by CNRR381–521 segment. CN341 was assayed in the presence of 2 mm Ni2+, 1 mm Ca2+ by using pNPP as substrate with the indicated concentrations of CNRR381–521. B, CN341 phosphatase activity induced by Ca2+/CaM binding. The assay was performed by using pNPP (circles, 2 μm CN341 with 2 mm Ni2+, 1 mm Ca2+, 20 μm CNRR381–521), and RII phosphopeptide (squares, 20 nm CN341 with 0.1 mm Ca2+, 100 nm CNRR381–521) as substrates with the indicated concentration of CaM. The data shown are the means ±S.D. from two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Solvent Accessibility of Tryptophan Residues—Tryptophan residues, with their intrinsic fluorescence, can report on protein conformational changes and protein-protein interactions. There are 4 tryptophan residues in CNA catalytic domain; Trp-134 is buried in the interior of the catalytic domain, Trp-232 is located at the catalytic site, and Trp-342 and Trp-352 are located in the hinge region that links the catalytic domain and CNB binding helix. There is no Trp residue in the CNA regulatory region, in CNB, or in CaM (Fig. 1).To probe conformational changes in CNA and interactions of CNA with separate regulatory domain fragment, the accessibility of tryptophan residues was quantitatively assessed using fluorescence collisional quenching by acrylamide (Figs. 7, 8, 9). A control comparison between full-length native CN and CN in a partially unfolded state (in 1 m GdnHCl and 1 mm EDTA) showed that tryptophan residues are substantially shielded from collisional quenching in the native protein. Tryptophans in the full-length protein are more accessible in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, 0.5 mm CaM than in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, as indicated by a steeper slope in Stern-Volmer plots in Fig. 7. This result is consistent with expected exposure of the catalytic cleft tryptophan Trp-232 upon displacement of the autoinhibitory peptide, although we have not directly demonstrated that the tryptophan residue being exposed to increased quenching is Trp-232.FIGURE 7Acrylamide quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of 5 μm full-length CN in buffer at 25 ± 2 °C.

Will it take a clinical bull's eye to bring venture capitalists and big pharma into the cell therapy arena? Venture capital groups and big pharma have largely held back from investing in biotech companies focused on regenerative medicine. Will it take a clinical bull's eye to bring venture capitalists and big pharma into the cell therapy arena? Four years ago, when Gregory Bonfiglio was writing a business plan for a venture capital group dedicated to companies pursuing stem cell therapies and regenerative medicine, “there were less than 100 that could be legitimately called regenerative or stem cell companies,” Bonfiglio notes. Today, the newly established Proteus Venture Partners, where Bonfiglio is the Managing Partner, is tracking about 1000 companies in over ten countries. While at least half of these, he acknowledges, are mid-sized to large pharma companies with multifold interests, “300 to 400 are focused solely on regenerative medicine.” Cell therapy companies range from those developing therapies using human embryonic stem (ES) cells, like Geron and Advanced Cell Technology (ACT), to companies like Mesoblast and Cytori that are pursuing treatments derived from adult stem cells and their precursors. There are also tissue engineering firms such as Tengion, which just announced a phase II trial for NeoBladder made from a patient's own bladder epithelial cells. Tool companies represent a third category. Some, like VistaGen, produce cells for drug discovery and toxicity testing, whereas others make the instruments and devices, “the picks and shovels,” as Bonfiglio calls them, that will help to manufacture cell therapies. Examples include StemCor Systems, which received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) several months ago to market its new device for extracting bone marrow, and Novathera, which has designed a bioreactor that allows the three-dimensional culture of stem and progenitor cells. Finally, there are companies that concentrate principally on bioaesthetics, such as Organogenesis and its skin rejuvenation and repair products and Intercytex, whose hair regeneration procedure depends on expanding cells from human hair follicles in culture. Chris Mason, Director of the Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Bioprocess Group at University College London, remarks how things have changed since the first wave of cell-and-tissue companies came and went between 1985 and 2002, an era he refers to as RegenMed 1.0. “We've seen this expansion before,” he notes, “but back then, companies were so busy doing basic science, they had no solid business plans.” About 70 tissue engineering companies failed to live up to their early promise including Advanced Tissue Sciences (ATS), which at one point had a market cap in excess of one billion dollars, with $600 million raised from venture capital and public markets. ATS and Organogenesis, another pioneer, stirred up excitement, only to eventually file Chapter 11 in late 2002. Curis, Ortec International, Genzyme Tissue Repair, and others similarly closed, reorganized, or merged, while regulatory and other problems kept most products of this era from reaching the marketplace. Now as we enter “RegenMed 2.0,” commercialization is much more of a priority for cell therapy businesses. “The universities are doing great research on regenerative medicine science, and this allows the companies to do great translation/commercialization. We're beginning to see innovative companies with strong business plans spring up all over the world, and this time around it's moved from being an American sport to being a global sport,” says Mason. The sobering reality is, however, that for many stem cell biotechs, the future will depend on making the leap from start-up funds to the large cash infusions that can propel their products through clinical trials. For this to happen, they will have to prove as best they can that their therapies are medically valuable and cost effective. “I think everyone is sitting on the fence waiting for something good to happen,” says Lutz Giebel, Managing Partner of SV Life Sciences Advisers and former cofounder and CEO of Cythera, now part of the stem cell engineering firm Novocell. “Quite frankly, every disease a mouse could possibly get has been cured by various stem cell biotechnologies, but the biggest problem is that little has materialized in the clinic that shows these approaches are successful.” Giebel compares it to the early days of monoclonal antibody translational research, which people knew eventually would make a difference in drug development. “Investors who invested early lost money. Investors who invested when the time was right made good money.” Ed Field, the President and COO of Aldagen, similarly believes that the biggest boost for regenerative medicine biotech companies would be a few significant clinical bull's eyes. “What my company needs most,” more than even money or technology, “is to show in well designed clinical trials that our products are efficacious in humans, and for others to show theirs are.” Such clinical successes might better earn the trust of venture capitalists and pharmaceutical companies, who largely have hung back from bankrolling stem cell companies, although in the case of Aldagen, the record shows that if you have what investors like, venture capital need not be elusive. Since its establishment in 2001, this Durham, North Carolina company has received $45 million from venture backers. Three Aldagen products comprising progenitor and adult stem cells derived from bone marrow and peripheral blood are currently in clinical trials for treating heart failure and limb ischemia and for improving cord-blood transplantation. Some contend that the field is getting close to scoring a winner. For example, Osiris, based in Columbia, Maryland, has three therapies based on a proprietary mesenchymal stem cell product derived from adult bone marrow. The product is formulated differently according to the disorder: Prochymal is delivered intravenously; OsteoCel, one of the field's earliest approved products, is for bone matrix; and Chondrogen is an injectible for treating knee injuries. Phase III trials have received fast-track status by the FDA for testing Prochymal in patients with acute Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) and the intestinal disorder Crohn's disease. And last month, the US Department of Defense awarded a $224.7 million contract to Osiris to advance Prochymal as a therapy for treating gastrointestinal injury due to radiation exposure. Meanwhile, Chris Mason points to the success of a tissue-engineered bilayered skin product called Apligraf, manufactured by Organogenesis. Comprising a layer of collagen and neonatal fibroblasts overlain with living keratinocytes, Apligraf has been used to treat venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers in 200,000 patients since it received FDA approval 9 years ago. “When Organogenesis emerged from Chapter 11, it came out very strongly, and has prospered by strongly focusing on its skin products,” Mason notes. Organogenesis, in Mason's opinion, exemplifies the three factors that will help ensure a company's success in this new era of commercialization: “expert business management, simpler but superior products, and scalability of manufacture.” In a similar vein, Advanced Tissue Sciences, after rescue from Chapter 11, was sold to Advanced BioHealing, which relaunched ATS's product Dermagraft, a wound-healing dermal substitute derived from newborn foreskin. Cell therapy companies have the twin hardships of showing that a cell therapy is efficacious in humans and demonstrating by phase III how the product will be produced according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations. Given this, it is not surprising that investors remain wary. Making a chemical drug as opposed to developing a cell therapy “is a lot easier because it's a chemical…and not a complex thing like a cell,” notes Giebel. Just how much of the biology has to be elucidated before a clinical trial can take place? The Investigational New Drug (IND) application that Geron expects to file this year to test neural stem cells for treating spinal-cord injury will be between 20,000 and 30,000 pages in length, testimony to the very high bar required for moving cell therapy products into clinical trials, especially those involving the nervous system. Despite the length of time it can take to prove that a particular cell therapy has a desired effect—and not just once but time after time—examples exist of biological advances being made and investments following. At Novocell in San Diego, years of experiments to efficiently differentiate human ES cells into pancreatic endocrine cells are starting to pay off, according to Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) Emmanuel Baetge. Complex culture conditions are required first to turn human ES cells into definitive endoderm (as opposed to extraembryonic endoderm), then posterior foregut (and not anterior foregut), then pancreatic endoderm (as opposed to gastric or intestinal endoderm), then endocrine precursor cells, then finally the pancreatic islet beta cells that produce insulin. As for multiplying a small batch of cells into billions, “No one has mastered that yet,” says Baetge. “While differentiation strategies are making good progress, scaling up the cells will depend on defining cell purification procedures for clinically relevant patient populations” to ensure safe transplants. A proprietary technology that coats islet cells and protects them from immune attack is one of two technologies in Novocell's portfolio that keeps the company pushing forward and attracting funding. Last July, Novocell raised another $25 million in venture capital, its total to date being $60 million, according to Baetge. For start-up companies, a diversity of funding sources in the $1 to $5 million range exists, especially in the United States. The funds come from university-sponsored start-up funds, state grants and bonds, patient advocacy groups, family foundations, individual angel donors and venture capital, DARPA and other federal agencies, as well as less traditional fare such as grants from the US Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program. A portion of the annual budgets of eleven federal departments and agencies are put aside for SBIR grants, which in turn go to small businesses with innovative and technical merit. Five federal groups similarly save funds for STTR programs, which are meant to kindle partnerships between small businesses and prominent research institutions. Administered by the US Small Business Administration, the SBIR program was launched in 1983, and the STTR program in 1992. Four-year-old Arteriocyte, which initially focused on using several types of stem cells to grow blood vessels for reestablishing cardiac function, started with $250,000 of venture seed funds from Case Western Reserve University; since then it has received federal, state, and local grants, including three SBIR-STTR grants. Consequently, this Cleveland, Ohio-based company has been able to expand to developing four cell-based products derived from adult bone marrow for treating ischemic diseases and acute and chronic wounds, thus enlarging its future chances for revenue. “Since the market rolled over in 2001, venture capitalists are delaying their investments until a technology is at phase II or later. There's more watchful waiting going on,” observes Arteriocyte CEO Donald Brown. “That's why non-dilutive grant mechanisms like SBIRs and STTRs are so valuable to start-ups.” StemCells, Inc., Athersys, MacroPore (now a division of Cytori Therapeutics), Osiris, and other stem cell businesses have also received these federal infusions of funds. State grants and venture funding helped to launch Cellular Dynamics International (CDI) and Stem Cell Products (SCP), started by James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin and colleagues in 2005 and 2006, respectively. CDI produces ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes for testing the effects of drugs on heart electrophysiology. The models routinely used “are Purkinje fibers from the heart of the dog or guinea pig,” says Nicholas Seay, COO of both companies. “We think cells from human would be a better model, because the animals don't have the same electrophysiological response as the human heart.” Meanwhile, SCP has the more complex goal of steering human ES cells down the hematopoietic differentiation pathway to form platelets and red blood cells, products that in the future could do away with the need for blood donations. “We're actually pretty good at making platelets and red blood cells,” says Thomson, although the company so far can turn out only very small quantities. The “non-trivial exercise” ahead, says Seay, is to ramp up the production process by several orders of magnitude while holding down costs. Seay sees an automated future where robots “would be culturing cells and automating a process to produce differentiated cells.” Generating immense numbers of cells for the eventual treatment of large patient populations is one of the toughest tasks that companies face. Most people working with adult stem cells “can generate only a limited amount of cells,” says John Sinden, CSO of ReNeuron, a UK-based cell therapy company. ReNeuron has the goal of using neural stem cells from fetal tissue to treat stroke patients with chronic disabilities. Because “we're a research and development engine and not ourselves geared up to do clinical manufacture,” notes Sinden, ReNeuron collaborates with the UK's two leading contract manufacturing organizations—Angel Biotechnology and BioReliance. Cells from the biotech's small cell bank are transferred to these processing facilities, where they are expanded and then stored in a master cell bank, ready for transplant. “We ourselves aren't big enough to do anything more than proof of concept in patients beyond Phase II,” points out Sinden. “We'd be looking for a larger biotech or pharma to carry this forward.” A make-it-or-break-it question for a biotech company focused on stem cell therapies is where, after receiving its initial millions, will the company's next billion come from? Douglas Fambrough, a general partner with the venture capital firm Oxford Bioscience Partners, suggests that public market investors are not likely to support earlier clinical stage research, nor are pharmaceutical companies, who “don't yet care about cell therapy” because no cell product has generated $500 million. That leaves venture capital “holding the bag,” he notes. Cell therapies that have come to market—Genzyme's Epicel and Carticel and Osiris's OsteoCel—are used by small patient populations and generate only modest revenues. OsteoCel's 2006 sales, for instance, were reportedly $8.3 million. Oxford Bioscience Partners has been actively scrutinizing stem cell companies but has yet to invest in one. What does it take to convince venture capitalists? Fambrough says that, along with a strong medical need, a savvy management team and intellectual property that lets you protect your position; “speaking personally, I need to see all the dots connected. I need to see that what you've got today can turn into a product used by physicians.” He feels that with ES cell companies, in particular, the dots are hard to connect, such as the ability to “reproducibly differentiate cells to precisely the mature cell you want, in an irreversible fashion.” With companies that are developing autologous therapies, neither does he grasp how cells can be efficiently extracted, expanded, differentiated in vitro, and then delivered back into the patient. “We don't have a commercial medical delivery infrastructure that does that.” Some investors maintain that autologous cell therapies will be less commercially viable than allogeneic therapies. “You have to bring in the patient and harvest the cells, expand them, and then bring the patient back in for transplantation,” notes Giebel. “For a pharmaceutical company and its profit margins, it would be much better if you can mass manufacture one product-fits-all.” But allogeneic therapies also have problems because transplanting cells from one person to another runs the risk of immune rejection of the cell transplant. Bonfiglio, meanwhile, takes a different view, predicting that “a substantial number of therapies developed will likely be autologous, which will require you have some sort of cell processing device at the point of care or cell-therapy centers.” Robert Lanza, CSO of ACT, believes that the field is closing in on solutions for allogeneic treatments and immune rejection. “If you look at tissue types in the U.S., you find that 100 lines would give you a complete haplotype match for fifty percent of the population.” Those cell lines could be produced through somatic cell nuclear transfer or by reprogramming adult somatic cells, but until such a bank of cell lines exists, immune rejection will continue to be a problem. ACT will soon file an IND to test its ES cell-derived retinal cells for treating macular degeneration; in this case, immune rejection is less likely because the eye is an immunoprivileged site. Although big pharma has not yet shown major interest in stem cell biotech companies, some onlookers believe there are increasing signs of partnering. AstraZeneca, for instance, has joined EpiStem to study how a physiological link between hair follicles and intestinal stem cells can be used to assess the side effects of certain cancer drugs. Meanwhile, Roche Venture Fund and Novartis Venture Fund entered a multi-million-dollar round of financing for Cellerix, a Spanish company that has clinical trials underway for cell therapies that treat fistulas and skin disorders; and Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation (the venture capital subsidiary of J&J) led Novocell's latest round of venture financing. Cytori has a joint venture with the Japanese medical device maker Olympus Corporation to commercialize its Celution System, a medical device that processes adipose tissue stem cells from patients for autologous transplant. And several months ago, Arteriocyte's medical systems division formed a partnership with Medtronic, acquiring its Magellan System, a technology for separating platelets from peripheral blood that will be “the ideal delivery vehicle for our stem cell therapies into damaged tissue,” according to Arteriocyte CEO Donald Brown. Some say that a confluence of forces is driving regenerative medicine forward, from the push of innovative technologies coming out of universities, to the pull of the marketplace brought on by big pharma's growing need for effective new treatments. Only time will tell if “RegenMed 2.0” will indeed prevail or whether it will go the way of RegenMed 1.0."
https://openalex.org/W1986914418,"Structural origin of substrate-enzyme recognition remains incompletely understood. In the model enzyme system of serine protease, canonical anti-parallel beta-structure substrate-enzyme complex is the predominant hypothesis for the substrate-enzyme interaction at the atomic level. We used factor Xa (fXa), a key serine protease of the coagulation system, as a model enzyme to test the canonical conformation hypothesis. More than 160 fXa-cleavable substrate phage variants were experimentally selected from three designed substrate phage display libraries. These substrate phage variants were sequenced and their specificities to the model enzyme were quantified with quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for substrate phage-enzyme reaction kinetics. At least three substrate-enzyme recognition modes emerged from the experimental data as necessary to account for the sequence-dependent specificity of the model enzyme. Computational molecular models were constructed, with both energetics and pharmacophore criteria, for the substrate-enzyme complexes of several of the representative substrate peptide sequences. In contrast to the canonical conformation hypothesis, the binding modes of the substrates to the model enzyme varied according to the substrate peptide sequence, indicating that an ensemble of binding modes underlay the observed specificity of the model serine protease."

Singapore is investing heavily in stem cell research. This investment is part of an ambitious biomedical science initiative designed to enhance its thriving economy. Science is a global enterprise. Nevertheless, postal codes tend to influence views about where it is possible to do good science. For example, following the announcement of the birth of Dolly the Sheep in Roslin, Scotland (Wilmut et al., 1997Wilmut I. Schneike A.E. McWhir J. Kind A.J. Campbell K.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar), many quipped “…but where is this place, Roslin?” In fact, Roslin was already notable for being a purported burial site of the Holy Grail (a fable embellished in the recent bestseller The Da Vinci Code). Singapore may lay no historical claim to the Grail but, not unlike Roslin, has emerged quite suddenly into the global biomedical science arena, jostling for attention in the face of considerable skepticism. But how can tiny Singapore hope to compete against larger nations with long-standing research programs? One strategy has been for Singapore to focus its efforts on select R&D targets, and one of these research areas is stem cells. Singapore is a small densely populated city-state, situated one degree north of the Equator and dwarfed by its nearest neighbors, Malaysia and Indonesia. In land mass, it ranks 180th of 215 countries, but in terms of Purchasing Power Parity per capita, it was ranked 21st among 180 member countries by the International Monetary Fund in 2007. To date, Singapore's prosperity has been secured by astute financial management and investment in a strategically designed portfolio including chemicals, electronic manufacturing, port activities, and financial services. The 12-fold surge in per capita wealth between 1960 (Singapore won independence first from the UK and then from Malaysia in 1965) and 2000 (Hoon and Ho, 2006Hoon, H.T., and Ho. K. W. (2006). Business Times, June 14, 2006.Google Scholar) signaled Singapore's movement from third world to first and was based primarily on manufacturing. But regional competition from cheaper labor locations has led Singapore to embrace knowledge-based industries, specifically the biomedical sciences, over the past 8 years. In 2000, the Singaporean Government set up the Agency for Science Technology and Research (A∗STAR), and between 2001 and 2010, it will have invested more than US $4 billion in infrastructural and operational support for existing and new thematic research facilities and institutes in the biomedical sciences. A∗STAR alone has established 14 new institutes with seven dedicated to the biomedical sciences (six of the seven are housed in the Biopolis complex, the brainchild of Sydney Brenner and Philip Yeo, which opened in 2003 and cost more than US $400 million). Stem cell research and regenerative medicine have a valued position in this sizable R&D initiative. There is no doubt that the choice of stem cells as a key R&D area for Singapore was heavily influenced by the significant contributions of Ariff Bongso, a researcher in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Scientific Director of the In-Vitro Fertilization program at the National University Hospital of Singapore. It was Bongso's group that first derived human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) from 5-day-old human blastocysts (obtained with informed consent from local IVF programs; Bongso et al., 1994Bongso A. Fong C.-Y. Ng S.-C. Ratnam S. Hum. Reprod. 1994; 9: 2110-2117PubMed Google Scholar). His work paved the way for Jamie Thomson at the University of Wisconsin (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11519) Google Scholar) to produce long-lived hESC cultures by improving the disaggregation conditions and using permanent feeder cell layers. It was this ability to derive hESCs and to maintain them in culture that triggered the tremendous excitement in stem cell research and its application to regenerative medicine in the late 1990s. Following Bongso's discovery, Singapore established its first stem cell start-up company, ES Cell International Pte Ltd (ESI), in June 2000 (http://www.escellinternational.com). Singapore now has more than 40 research groups located at universities, hospitals, and research institutes that are pursuing various facets of stem cell research. Institute-based groups have access to core funding, whereas others can compete with the wider research community for government project and program grants. Since 2000, more than US $20 million has been granted for stem cell research in Singapore. More recently, scientists have been able to seek specific support from the A∗STAR Singapore Stem Cell Consortium (SSCC; http://www.sscc.a-star.edu.sg). Housed in the new A∗STAR Institute of Medical Biology—as part of phase 2 of the Biopolis expansion (Figure 1)—the SSCC will be administering ∼US $75 million of government money for intramural and extramural stem cell research over 5 years. This compares favorably with the US $3 billion made available by Proposition 71 (in the form of repayable bonds) over a 10 year period for stem cell research in California. Ten of the world's leading pharma, biotech, and contract manufacturing companies have manufacturing facilities for pharmaceutical production in Singapore. In addition, Lonza, Genentech, and Novartis have set up commercial-scale biologics manufacturing facilities to produce protein therapeutics. Will stem cell research be able to bestow similar tangible benefits on the Singaporean economy? A big goal is for Singapore to develop and manufacture cell-based therapies for treating a range of degenerative diseases including heart failure, eye disease, cartilage repair, and diabetes. In so doing, Singapore hopes to serve as a medical hub for foreign patients seeking stem cell-based treatments. This challenging objective will be facilitated by the new A∗STAR Singapore Institute of Clinical Sciences (SICS) opened in 2007 and directed by Stanford cardiologist Judith Swain. SICS will be responsible for training clinician-scientists and will act as a critical bridge linking basic research undertaken by A∗STAR research institutes and universities with clinical research programs in Singapore's hospitals and disease centers. Another bridge between academia and clinical medicine is provided by the Duke University-National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School campus established in 2005. Here, US faculty from Duke University in North Carolina train foreign and local medical graduates, as well as importing and implementing Duke's acclaimed expertise in translational medical research. Singapore plans to become a provider of new human embryonic and adult stem cell lines and of reagents for drug discovery and drug testing, an objective facilitated by the new A∗STAR Experimental Therapeutics Centre also opened last year and led by British cancer researcher David Lane. In this center, cutting-edge scientific drug discovery teams will cohabit with business development operations. The wide variety of new research initiatives create much-needed additional PhD and postdoctoral opportunities for Singaporeans. Training of the next several generations of home-grown scientists is central to the Government's vision of economic development and will involve public sector research facilities as well as privately funded research endeavors like the Temasek Life Sciences Institute. By 2015, A∗STAR alone aims to produce a further 1000 PhD level Singaporean scientists trained both locally and in selected institutions abroad. In addition, Singapore has proved remarkably adept at attracting top scientists from around the world—the latest recruit is embryologist Davor Solter, previously Director of the Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology in Freiburg, Germany, who joined the Institute of Medical Biology last month as a principal investigator. Currently, there are over 5000 PhDs working in R&D in Singapore, over half of whom hold foreign citizenship. Given the history, it is not surprising that there is a focus in Singapore on basic hESC research recently exemplified by work on pluripotency genes and the hESC epigenetic landscape (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang J. Tam W.L. Tong G.Q. Wu Q. Chan H.Y. Soh B.S. Lou Y. Yang J. Ma Y. Chai L. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, Zhao et al., 2007Zhao X. Han X. Chew J.L.

In addition, ESI has generated six new hESC lines (grown on human feeder layers) to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards (Crook et al., 2007Crook J.M. Peura T.T. Kravets L. Bosman A.G. Buzzard J.J. Horne R. Hentze H. Dunn N.R. Zweigerdt R. Chua F. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 490-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar), furthering Singapore's goal of being an important provider of hESC lines. (ESI already provides 6 of the 21 NIH-registered hESC lines that became eligible for US federal research funding by presidential decree on August 9, 2001.) The new hESC lines hopefully will simplify the entry of hESC-derived cell products to the clinic. Most hESC lines are derived using mouse cell feeder layers, which is problematic for clinical application because exposure of hESCs to live animal cells greatly complicates the design and operation of any clinical trial. In contrast to, for example, the United States and Germany, Singapore does not have unduly onerous political or legislative restrictions on hESC research and has not enacted any specific legislation on the generation and use of hESCs. Instead, researchers in Singapore adhere strictly to guidelines drafted in 2002 by the Bioethics Advisory Committee (and subsequently endorsed by the Government), which were modeled on existing UK legislation. Singapore does regulate by law the activities of all fertility centers in Singapore, which could provide human eggs or embryos for research. Although the upcoming US presidential election may result in lifting of the ban on federal support for hESC research in the United States, other impediments to such research remain. For example, the 1996 Dickey-Wicker Amendment forbids U.S. federal support of research involving the creation or destruction of human eggs and embryos. In a recent remarkable development, Japanese researcher Shinya Yamanaka and his colleagues (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13505) Google Scholar) succeeded in converting adult human somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with very similar properties to hESCs (see Review by R. Jaenisch and R. Young in this issue of Cell). This demonstration may remove the stigma attached to working with hESCs in some countries, but the challenge of correctly directing the differentiation of any stem cell, whether an hESC or an iPS cell, is still a daunting one. Although purity, scale up, and efficacy present significant hurdles to the clinical development of all stem cell products, use of hESCs poses particular safety risks including the formation of teratomas. This and the need to avoid immunogenicity issues by using autologous sources of starting material make it more likely that adult stem cell-derived products will be the first to achieve marketing approval. There has been progress in Singapore in moving adult human stem cells from the bench into the clinic. For example, preclinical work with rabbits and pigs has led to early clinical trials in which patients receive autologous mesenchymal stem cell transplants to effect cartilage repair (Lee et al., 2007Lee K.B. Hui J.H. Song I.C. Ardany L. Lee E.H. Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2964-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, at the Singapore Eye Research Institute, investigators have performed surgery on 48 patients with a variety of ocular surface injuries using autologous transplants of cultivated human conjuctival stem cell explants and limbal stem cell explants (Tan et al., 2004Tan D.T. Ang L.P. Beuerman R.W. Transplantation. 2004; 77: 1729-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Yet despite the investment in stem cell research in Singapore and the strong pharma presence, many financial challenges remain before stem cells can be translated into viable clinical products. For example, the investment by large pharmaceutical/biotech companies into in-house or externally sponsored cell therapy has been noticeably lacking in Singapore as it has been elsewhere (with the exception of Genzyme-sponsored autologous myoblast transplantation clinical trials in Europe). Although many of these companies regard stem cell research as extremely important for drug discovery and screening (see Essay by L. Rubin in this issue), they are concerned about the timelines of getting robust cell-based products to the market and remain unconvinced by the business case for cell therapy. This same reticence to invest is shared by many venture capitalists making it very difficult for private cell therapy companies to survive (see Analysis by A. Parson in this issue). With its generous funding and an ultra-modern centralized and integrated scientific and clinical infrastructure, Singapore is well placed to tackle the big technical challenges of bringing stem cells from the laboratory into the clinic. Singapore is also well positioned to address the regulatory (safety, efficacy) and commercial (affordable products) challenges that stem cells, in particular hESCs, pose for translational medicine. The drive to attract foreign talent and to nurture home-grown talent continues and will not abate for the foreseeable future. Indeed, the Singaporean Government views its investment in biomedical R&D as at least a 20 year project. The bottom line is that Singapore's continued survival as a rich nation depends on each pillar of its economy thriving optimally. Few motivations for success in research can be quite as strong as this. I thank Ray Dunn, Jeremy Crook, Phil Ingham, Terence Soo, Michelle Khor, Peter Lim, and most particularly Justine Burley for helpful comments on this manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2009935804,"The California Initiative embodied in Proposition 71 was designed to boost embryonic stem cell research and its translation into cell therapies in the face of federal restrictions on such research. With funding starting to flow, the stem cell revolution is now underway. The California Initiative embodied in Proposition 71 was designed to boost embryonic stem cell research and its translation into cell therapies in the face of federal restrictions on such research. With funding starting to flow, the stem cell revolution is now underway. In 2004, California voters passed a ballot initiative providing $3 billion in state monies over 10 years to support stem cell research carried out in California and to construct facilities to allow this research to take place unencumbered by federal restrictions. Born from the frustration of parents who recognized that the potential of stem cell therapy was being snuffed out by restrictive federal policies, Proposition 71 (The Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative) was designed around the scientific needs of researchers, physicians, and academic administrators with the goal of using state bond financing to generate long-term, stable capital support for human embryonic stem cell research and its translation into cell therapies. Proposition 71 was a courageous initiative at a time of opposition by the Bush Administration to such research and was also a milestone demonstrating that ordinary citizens are willing to take bold steps when Washington fails to meet its obligations. The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) was established by Proposition 71 to distribute the grant monies. However, grant distribution was held up for 16 months while opponents of human embryonic stem cell research hamstrung the Institute in the courts, claiming the ballot initiative was unconstitutional. During this time CIRM maintained momentum by donations from private philanthropists, followed by a life-giving loan of $150 million from California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 2 days after President Bush vetoed the bill that would have loosened restrictions on federal funds for embryonic stem cell research in the United States. Now, a mere 3 years after Proposition 71's approval, the court challenges have been overcome, the funding is flowing, and Californians have begun to see their vision realized. Throughout the legal delays, vital infrastructure was built up by CIRM's governing body, the 29-member Independent Citizens' Oversight Committee (ICOC), established by Proposition 71 to include patient advocates, research institutes, and the business and general community of California to act in public to govern and to award grants recommended by management. They established operating procedures and created committees to establish working groups to oversee grants, standards, facilities, medical ethics, conflicts of interest, governance, and intellectual property. CIRM's first President, Zach Hall, aided by Arlene Chiu, both veteran neuroscientists with NIH administrative experience, hired a talented and committed staff, spearheaded a visionary strategic plan, and established procedures for issuing research funding applications (RFAs) and processes for managing the grants. Concurrently, the ICOC selected a peer review group comprised of expert scientists from outside California, chaired by Harvard University's Stuart Orkin. In 2006, CIRM's funding apparatus finally began turning its gears, issuing a call for RFAs from new and established researchers investigating fundamental questions about embryonic stem cell biology. A total of $45 million over 2 to 4 years has been awarded to 72 applicants. In addition, a stem cell training program was established in which $40 million was awarded for 3 years to cover the salaries of 54 graduate students, 80 postdoctoral fellows, and 35 clinical fellows, all of whom, as part of their training, are required to be schooled in the ethics of working with human stem cells. An additional $50 million was divided among 17 California institutions to construct shared research facilities where investigators can work together, and six institutions received funding to teach courses in stem cell techniques to scientists. CIRM has recently announced additional programs to expand its research scope. For example, a competition has just been completed that provides generous 5-year young investigator grants for salary and operations to 22 assistant professors. For the six clinician-scientists successful in that competition, additional funds will be provided to repay their medical school tuition loans to encourage them to consider stem cell-related research as a viable career opportunity. A second round of new investigator grants targeting 14 or more investigators has been approved and will be evaluated in the coming months. CIRM has also issued an RFA for establishing new pluripotent human stem cell lines and for new technologies to create them. We are interested in a multipronged approach that will include parallel lines of research not only on human embryonic stem cells but also on somatic cell reprogramming and induced pluripotency (Lewitzky and Yamanaka, 2007Lewitzky M. Yamanaka S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2007; 18: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Human embryonic stem cells will remain the gold standard for characterizing innate pluripotency, despite claims to the contrary expressed by President Bush in his State of the Union address last month. CIRM panels are judging a $262 million funding competition for the construction of major research facilities in California. Twelve academic institutions that successfully negotiated a scientific review are moving forward to qualify for designation as either CIRM “Institutes,” which will carry out basic, preclinical, and clinical research; CIRM “Centres of Excellence,” which will focus on two of those three areas; or CIRM “Special Programs,” which will focus on one of the three programs. A requirement for matching funds from the candidate institutions will leverage CIRM's contribution considerably, with over $700 million expected to flow into the program from all sources. CIRM-funded “Institutes” will house, at one location, basic researchers, translational scientists, and clinicians who will also maintain links with colleagues within and between institutions in various regions of California. California institutions are already drawing key scientists from around the country as well as from overseas: among others, Martin Pera to the University of Southern California, Peter Donovan to UC Irvine, Stephan Heller to Stanford, and Nissan Benvenisty to Cedars-Sinai. In addition, James Thomson and Shinya Yamanaka have agreed to spend part of their time at UC Santa Barbara and the Gladstone Institute, respectively. The influx of such top researchers will hopefully induce a new generation of young scientists to seek training and faculty appointments in California. Eight other states in the US have commitments in process that total just under $2 billion for their own stem cell programs, in part to retain staff and to reduce emigration. We welcome their efforts, for increasing the number of stem cell researchers across the country stands to benefit all programs in the United States and to spur advances in stem cell research and cell therapy applications globally. CIRM has also posted planning grants for Research Disease Teams to enable multidisciplinary teams of researchers in academia and business to write grants that integrate basic discoveries, translational research, and clinical trials for treating specific diseases or injuries with cell replacement therapy. Support for prospective planning grants is rarely provided by granting agencies, but this new program, by aligning basic and clinical research with the interests of for-profit companies, lies at the heart of CIRM's mission to translate basic research into improved clinical care. It is vital that we marshal all aspects of California's research capacity toward the development of stem cell therapeutics. The 2008 Disease Team Research Grants will require identification of an investigational new drug (IND) target that can reasonably be reached within 4–5 years, with funding potentially reaching $20 million (subject to ICOC approval), if all milestones are achieved through to phase II clinical trials."

A European law that prevents the patenting of discoveries that contravene morality is causing confusion when it comes to human embryonic stem cells. The ensuing debate is markedly different from the one in the United States, where the scope of stem cell patents and their licensing are under challenge. Patent lawyers in the field of biotechnology don't get bored. The science they review is constantly changing and so are the laws governing how new scientific discoveries should be evaluated. This is particularly true when it comes to stem cells—a new field with a lot of commercial potential. “The situation is similar to the plant transformation field in the 1980s and 1990s,” says Erich E. Veitenheimer, a partner in the Washington DC office of Cooley Godward Kronish LLP, a law firm that specializes in biotechnology patent claims. “There is a lot of activity. Lots of people finding similar things, so there are a lot of interferences, re-examinations, oppositions, litigations, and eventually cross-licensing.” A good example is the highly publicized challenge to three foundational patents on primate (including human) embryonic stem cells granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) in 1998 and 2001. The patents were challenged by two consumer groups—the New York-based Public Patent Foundation and the California-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights—who argued that the methods for isolating a primate stem cell line were obvious based on previous work (“prior art”) and therefore were not patentable. The concern expressed by the two groups was that the broad claims in the three patents were hindering human embryonic stem cell research in the US by requiring researchers to negotiate a costly license with WARF in order to work in this area. In October 2006, the USPTO agreed to re-examine the three WARF patents, although it could take years for the re-examination process to be concluded; for the time being the patents continue to be valid. In Europe, the patenting of human embryonic stem cells has been caught up in a battle not over sweeping claims but over morality. “The main issues in the US are the breadth of the patents and how they are being licensed. The main issue in Europe right now is morality,” says Philip Webber, a biotech patent attorney with Frank B. Dehn & Co. in London. WARF applied to the European Patent Office (EPO) for a European patent for cell cultures comprising primate embryonic stem cells. In 2004, the EPO refused the application on moral grounds—because the invention unavoidably involves the use of human embryos. WARF appealed this decision, which is now under review by the Enlarged Board of Appeal, the highest level for resolving such disputes within the EPO. “The European Patent Office has to decide whether human stem cell-based inventions are immoral or not,” says Webber. “The decision will include philosophical and moral questions. But the EPO is a patent-granting body, not an adjudicator on what is moral or not. It is difficult to see how it will come to a conclusion.” Morality does not typically come up in patent debates. “The morality issue is not as prevalent in arguments over other biotech inventions,” says Sarah Turner, a solicitor at the London office of the international law firm Lovells LLP. “With inventions like antibodies you tend to argue based on more standard arguments against patentability, for example that the invention was obvious,” says Turner. But debates over morality are not entirely new to biotech patent law in Europe. The most notable case was Harvard University's “oncomouse”—a transgenic mouse highly susceptible to cancer, created in the early 1980s by Philip Leder and Timothy Stewart. The patent application was filed in 1985 with the EPO, which considered the case at length, at many levels, and amidst much debate. The EPO eventually granted the patent in 1992—a decision that was opposed by animal-rights groups, church organizations, and various sections of the German Green party, who felt that the suffering caused to the animals was immoral. But in the end, the patent was maintained because the EPO held that the application's purpose was of such importance for humanity—to find a cure for cancer—as to outweigh the suffering of the animals concerned. And while transgenic mice raised ethical concerns, the debate has never been as heated as with human embryonic stem cells. “They are such an emotive subject,” says Turner. The EPO has received over 160 amicus curiae briefs regarding its impending decision on the WARF appeal from third parties who have an opinion on the fate of the application, including lawyers and biotech industry representatives, as well as religious, ethical, and green groups. The briefs show that public opinion is split and issues pertaining to stem cells are not easily settled. “The law says you cannot patent uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes. You could read the wording literally. But if you have a product and had to use human embryos to get it, then it is not clear where that falls within the law,” says Helen Brearley, a patent attorney with Elkington and Fife LLP in Kent, UK, adding that a decision by the EPO that “broadly” excludes patenting embryos could stifle research and innovation. Most European countries have laws in place to regulate human embryonic stem cell research. Several countries, including Belgium, Sweden, and the UK, allow research using surplus human embryos up to 14 days of age. Others have more restrictive laws. Countries like Austria and Ireland prohibit stem cell research entirely. Germany and Italy prohibit derivation of human embryonic stem cells, but scientists can import these cells for research use. Because of existing regulations, Brearley argues that there is no need for another layer of regulation by the EPO. “The Patent Office should not decide on morality when the issue is not a clear cut decision, because in the end a patent does not give you the right to practice the invention. Instead, it just prevents others from using it,” she explains. “When public opinion is divided, as in the case of stem cells, patent exclusions should be construed narrowly to exclude little rather than a lot.” Rules pertaining to the patentability of human embryonic stem cells (see Table 1) have their origin in a Directive adopted by the European Union (EU) in 1998 that “inventions shall be considered unpatentable where their commercial exploitation would be contrary to ordre public [public order] or morality.” The Directive goes on to explain that such inventions would include “(a) processes for cloning human beings; (b) processes for modifying the germline genetic identity of human beings; (c) uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes; (d) processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals which are likely to cause them suffering without any substantial medical benefit to man or animal, and also animals resulting from such processes.” In addition, the EU Directive states that “the human body, at any stage in its formation or development, including germ cells, and the simple discovery of one of its elements or one of its products, including the sequence or partial sequence of a human gene, cannot be patented.”Table 1What Is Patentable and What Is Not in the US and EuropeNonpatentablePatentableUnited States•Human-nonhuman chimeras•Isolated/purified embryonic stem (ES) cells, including human ES cells•Methods of deriving ES cells•Culture conditions for ES cells•Processes for differentiating ES cells•Genetic transformation and nuclear transfer for altering ES cellsEurope•Processes for extracting stem cells from human blastocysts•Direct destruction of human embryos•Available human ES cell lines and their use (if destruction of human embryos was involved)aThis point is under consideration with the WARF case currently before the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office.

(Source: Erich E. Veitenheimer, a partner with the Washington DC-based Cooley Godward Kronish LLP.) Open table in a new tab Although the EPO is independent of the EU, it voluntarily adopted the Directive's rules in 1999. In contrast, member states of the EU had no choice but to implement the EU Directive directly into their country's laws. Ironically, the Directive was meant to harmonize patent law in Europe and thus stimulate the competitiveness of the biotech industry. “But it has created considerable uncertainly and disruption to patent law,” says Aurora Plomer, a professor of law at the University of Sheffield, UK. Part of the problem is that the Directive was passed four months before researcher James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin, Madison reported the isolation of human embryonic stem cells in 1998. “Whether the Directive would embrace that invention was not at the forefront of discussions. So it was not debated or considered,” explains Plomer. “The question arose after Thomson's article came out.” This is why lawyers are now anxiously awaiting a decision on the WARF case by the EPO's Enlarged Board of Appeal so that they can have guidance. But the decision will not bring complete clarity, says WARF's intellectual property manager Paulanne Chelf. “If the EPO decides to broadly interpret [the moral exclusion], it may decide that human embryonic stem cells cannot be patented. However, if you take those cells, culture them with a cocktail of growth factors and cytokines and end up with a culture of a particular differentiated cell type, is that method patentable? You may not be destroying an embryo to do this, but using cells from an embryo that someone else destroyed,” she says. “And will cells which are ‘reprogrammed’ from adult cells be patentable? They do not come from an embryo.” Another caveat is that not all EU member states have interpreted the Directive in the same way. “We have obtained allowance of applications in Great Britain and Sweden to claims which may be rejected ultimately in the EPO,” says Chelf. The UK Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) will not grant patents relating to processes of obtaining stem cells from human embryos or for human totipotent stem cells, which have the potential to develop into an entire human body. But, in contrast to the EPO, it will grant patents relating to human embryonic pluripotent stem cells because they do not have the potential to develop into an entire human body. “Based on the same Directive, the UKIPO has interpreted the rules differently. It was up to the member states how they were going to interpret them,” says Webber. “The UK has interpreted the Directive narrowly.” This difference in approach has had some immediate effects. “We have been advising clients who want to file in Europe to file parallel patent applications with the EPO and with the UKIPO,” says Webber. “They have more of a chance of getting something granted.” Different laws regarding patents and research among EU member states could lead to a fragmented and confusing situation. “The legal reality is that there is diversity of regimes in Europe,” says Plomer. “We could potentially end up in a situation where research laws are permissive in some countries and the moral exclusion applied to patents has the effect of not allowing that research to be patented. This was not the intention of the EU legislators when the Directive was adopted.” And while many worry that unduly restrictive patents will hinder innovation, the long-term effect is not clear cut. “The breadth of patents in the US has caused a great deal of discussion and concern about the restrictive effects of granting patents as deterring innovation and blocking further research,” says Jane Gunnison, a partner in the patent practice at the firm Ropes & Gray LLP in New York City. “On the other hand in Europe, if it turns out that you cannot get a patent for human embryonic stem cells, will lack of a patent hold back innovation and research because industry wants some measure of protection for their investments? The two arguments make you aware of the complexity of the situation.” From another perspective, a lack of human embryonic stem cell patents in Europe, if that turns out to be the case, could spur researchers and companies to conduct their work in Europe, where they would be able to work in areas that could infringe a patent in the US. (They might, however, be prohibited from bringing the product of such research back to the US, depending on the nature of the product.) “People mistakenly believe that the patent system can be used to regulate activity that is of concern to the public. But that is not usually the case,” says Gunnison. “There isn't that kind of direct relationship between what is patented and what people work on. If one wants to regulate activity in a technology, other kinds of legal and regulatory systems are better suited than the patent system to accomplish that.” Although a definite date has not been set, most lawyers who talked to Cell expected a decision from the EPO's Enlarged Board of Appeal regarding the WARF patent application within the year. What will the decision accomplish? “The decision may help clarify some of the confusion, but not all,” says Paulanne Chelf of WARF. As the Enlarged Board of Appeal ponders the decision, scientists are finding new sources of material for producing human embryonic stem cells. In 2007, Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University and James Thomson's group independently reported a method to generate human embryonic stem cell-like cells by reprogramming adult human skin cells with a cocktail of transcription factors, without the need of a human egg or embryo. “Are the Yamanaka cells caught in the morality exclusion clause? It depends on how wide the EPO will want to go with the exclusions and how much the EPO will look at the history of an invention,” says Plomer. “If the application relates to a process that includes the reprogramming of a cell into an embryonic cell and if the process goes through an embryo-like state, it could be subject to the same moral exclusion [as in the WARF case].” Experts hope that the decision by the EPO will bring some harmony within Europe by providing a European-wide standard for ethical issues in an area in which the science is quickly developing. “If the EPO seeks to impose an inappropriately broad ban on human embryonic stem cell patents in Europe, applicants may still be able to secure patent protection in selected member states,” says Plomer. “The serious problem ahead lies in the lack of integration of the EPO system within EU law.”"
