https://openalex.org/W1976642472,"In mammals, the two enzymes in the trans-sulfuration pathway, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), are believed to be chiefly responsible for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) biogenesis. In this study, we report a detailed kinetic analysis of the human and yeast CBS-catalyzed reactions that result in H2S generation. CBS from both organisms shows a marked preference for H2S generation by β-replacement of cysteine by homocysteine. The alternative H2S-generating reactions, i.e. β-elimination of cysteine to generate serine or condensation of 2 mol of cysteine to generate lanthionine, are quantitatively less significant. The kinetic data were employed to simulate the turnover numbers of the various CBS-catalyzed reactions at physiologically relevant substrate concentrations. At equimolar concentrations of CBS and CSE, the simulations predict that H2S production by CBS would account for ∼25–70% of the total H2S generated via the trans-sulfuration pathway depending on the extent of allosteric activation of CBS by S-adenosylmethionine. The relative contribution of CBS to H2S genesis is expected to decrease under hyperhomocysteinemic conditions. CBS is predicted to be virtually the sole source of lanthionine, and CSE, but not CBS, efficiently cleaves lanthionine. The insensitivity of the CBS-catalyzed H2S-generating reactions to the grade of hyperhomocysteinemia is in stark contrast to the responsiveness of CSE and suggests a previously unrecognized role for CSE in intracellular homocysteine management. Finally, our studies reveal that the profligacy of the trans-sulfuration pathway results not only in a multiplicity of H2S-yielding reactions but also yields novel thioether metabolites, thus increasing the complexity of the sulfur metabolome.

Other novel effects of H2S include induction of a state of suspended animation in mouse by decreasing oxygen consumption and drastically reducing the metabolic rate (3Blackstone E. Morrison M. Roth M.B. Science. 2005; 308: 518Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and synchronizing ultradian metabolic oscillation in yeast (4Sohn H. Kuriyama H. Yeast. 2001; 18: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Under conditions of metabolic cycling in yeast, H2S production is catalyzed by sulfite reductase in the sulfur assimilation pathway (4Sohn H. Kuriyama H. Yeast. 2001; 18: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Inhibition of sulfite reductase reduces H2S production and in turn perturbs metabolic oscillations. H2S is a specific and potent inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the electron transport chain (3Blackstone E. Morrison M. Roth M.B. Science. 2005; 308: 518Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar).Although concentrations of H2S have been reported to range from 50 to 160 μm in brain (5Mitchell T.W. Savage J.C. Gould D.H. J. Appl. Toxicol. 1993; 13: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Savage J.C. Gould D.H. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 526: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Goodwin L.R.

Toxicol. 1989; 13: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and 30–50 μm in the peripheral system (8Zhao W. Zhang J. Lu Y. Wang R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6008-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar), these appear to be grossly overestimated (9Furne J. Saeed A. Levitt M.D. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 295: R1479-R1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Significantly lower H2S concentrations of 17 and 14 nm in liver and brain, respectively, have been reported recently (9Furne J. Saeed A. Levitt M.D. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 295: R1479-R1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The very significant discrepancy between these and the previous estimates of H2S levels presumably derives from the earlier use of acidic conditions that led to the release of acid-labile sulfur from iron-sulfur centers.In mammals, the primary catalysts for H2S generation are reported to be the two pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes involved in the trans-sulfuration pathway, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) (10Abe K. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhao W. Wang R. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H474-H480Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The trans-sulfuration pathway operates in the reverse direction in mammals serving to convert homocysteine to cysteine (Fig. 1), although in yeast and bacteria the pathway is involved in sulfur assimilation from sulfate to cysteine. CBS is widely assumed to be the major contributor to H2S production in the brain because of its relatively high expression in this organ (10Abe K. Kimura H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a recent study reported that 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase together with cysteine aminotransferase might also generate H2S in brain (12Shibuya N. Tanaka M. Yoshida M. Ogasawara Y. Togawa T. Ishii K. Kimura H. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2009; 11: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of these enzymes and of CSE, which is also present in brain (13Vitvitsky V. Thomas M. Ghorpade A. Gendelman H.E. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35785-35793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 14Diwakar L. Ravindranath V. Neurochem. Int. 2007; 50: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), to H2S production remain to be assessed. Genetic disruption of CSE in mouse leads to cardiac deficits, including pronounced hypertension and reduced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, consistent with a major role for CSE in the peripheral system (1Yang G. Wu L. Jiang B. Yang W. Qi J. Cao K. Meng Q. Mustafa A.K. Mu W. Zhang S. Snyder S.H. Wang R. Science. 2008; 322: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). However, brain H2S levels are reportedly unchanged in CSE−/− mice.Despite the growing recognition of the varied physiological effects of H2S, our understanding of its regulation and mechanism of its biosynthesis is poor. We have recently reported on the complex kinetics of H2S generation by human CSE (15Chiku T. Padovani D. Zhu W. Singh S. Vitvitsky V. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11601-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The profligacy of the human enzyme affords H2S generation by a multiplicity of routes involving cysteine and/or homocysteine as substrates. Kinetic simulations predict an increasingly important contribution of homocysteine to H2S generation with increasing grade of hyperhomocysteinemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases (16Refsum H. Ueland P.M. Nygård O. Vollset S.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 31-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar, 17Seshadri S. Beiser A. Selhub J. Jacques P.F. Rosenberg I.H. D舗Agostino R.B.

Neurol. 1998; 55: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). In addition to H2S, a variety of products is generated in these reactions, including two novel sulfur metabolites, lanthionine and homolanthionine, which represent the condensation products between 2 mol of cysteine and homocysteine, respectively. Although the steady-state kinetic parameters for H2S generation from cysteine and homocysteine have been reported for human CBS (hCBS) (19Chen X. Jhee K.H. Kruger W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52082-52086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), a comparable detailed kinetic analysis of H2S generation by CBS by multiple pathways and their sensitivity to the grade of hyperhomocysteinemia is not known. Furthermore, the relative contributions of CBS and CSE to H2S and lanthionine generation at physiologically relevant concentrations of substrate are not known.Human CBS is a unique heme containing PLP-dependent enzyme (20Kery V. Bukovska G. Kraus J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25283-25288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that catalyzes the β-replacement of serine by homocysteine to produce cystathionine. The latter is further metabolized by CSE in an α,γ-elimination reaction to produce cysteine. Although yeast and human CBS are highly homologous and catalyze the same chemical reaction with similar kinetic parameters, the yeast enzyme lacks heme and is not allosterically regulated by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (21Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In this study, we have elucidated the kinetics of H2S biogenesis by yeast and human CBS and used simulations to estimate the relative contributions of CBS and CSE to H2S production at physiologically relevant concentrations of substrate. We find that CBS and CSE share a common feature, i.e. catalytic promiscuity. However, in contrast to CSE, which is proficient at catalyzing reactions at the β- and γ-carbons of substrates (15Chiku T. Padovani D. Zhu W. Singh S. Vitvitsky V. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11601-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), CBS activity is confined to chemical transformations at the β-position. Our studies provide new insights into the existence of alternative trans-sulfuration reactions that can be a source of diverse sulfur metabolites, viz. H2S, lanthionine, and homolanthionine increasing the diversity of the sulfur metabolome.DISCUSSIONDespite the pharmacological interest in modulating H2S production (28Szabó C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 917-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar, 29Wallace J.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 501-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), there has been little attention paid to the mechanism of its generation and regulation. In this study, we have investigated the various reactions catalyzed by yeast and human CBS that lead to H2S production. We have also examined the relative importance of hCBS versus human CSE to H2S production and the sensitivity of these reactions to the grade of hyperhomocysteinemia.H2S Production by yCBSIn yeast, ultradian cycling is regulated by chemical signals, including H2S (30Sohn H.Y. Murray D.B. Kuriyama H. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), to achieve population synchronization. Interestingly, the H2S producing sulfate assimilation pathway and respiratory oscillations have been linked to the trans-sulfuration pathway with intracellular cysteine levels and CSE playing a regulatory role (31Sohn H. Kuriyama H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Yeast CBS catalyzes the production of cystathionine by a β-replacement reaction involving serine and homocysteine (reaction 1). The turnover number of this reaction under Vmax conditions (25.5 s−1) is ∼2-fold lower than for the condensation of cysteine and homocysteine (reaction 4, 55.0 s−1), leading to H2S production (Table 1). Yeast maintains very low cysteine concentration (0.25–0.45 μm), which is ∼1–10% of the intracellular concentration of other amino acids in this organism (4Sohn H. Kuriyama H. Yeast. 2001; 18: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Sohn H. Kuriyama H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Hence, at intracellular levels of cysteine and serine, reaction 1 is expected to dominate over reaction 4. Of the three H2S-generating reactions catalyzed by yCBS, the β-replacement of cysteine by homocysteine (reaction 4) exhibits a higher kcat value than for reactions 2 and 3 (Table 1). For the bimolecular reactions, the kinetic fits support a ping-pong mechanism, which is consistent with the mechanism previously reported for reaction 1 catalyzed by yCBS (21Jhee K.H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10548-10556Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Because of its toxicity to cells at elevated concentrations (32Kumar A. John L. Alam M.M. Gupta A. Sharma G. Pillai B. Sengupta S. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), intracellular cysteine levels are tightly regulated. H2S production by yCBS from cysteine and homocysteine will be sensitive to levels of these amino acids. However, at intracellular concentrations of substrates, the H2S-generating reactions are likely to be competitively inhibited by serine, which is abundant, binding to site 1. The mechanisms by which yCBS is regulated so that it serves either in the trans-sulfuration pathway or is diverted for H2S production are not known and merit investigation.Our studies reveal that yCBS is capable of generating lanthionine (reaction 3), a novel thioether product that is a component of the class of lantibiotics (33Willey J.M. van der Donk W.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 477-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although cyclic lanthionine ketimine has been reported in bovine and human brain (34Ricci G. Vesci L. Nardini M. Arduini A. Storto S. Rosato N. Cavallini D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 35Fontana M. Brunori A. Costa M. Antonucci A. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the presence and fate of this compound in yeast await elucidation. Lanthionine, like cysteine or cystine, can support the organic sulfur need for growth during the shift from the mycelial to the parasitic yeast form in the dimorphic pathogenic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum (36McVeigh I. Houston W.E. Mycopathol. Mycol. Appl. 1972; 47: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This suggests that lanthionine is transported into yeast cells and metabolized, probably by the action of CSE to cysteine, as discussed below.H2S Production by hCBSIn contrast to the profligacy of human CSE (15Chiku T. Padovani D. Zhu W. Singh S. Vitvitsky V. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11601-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), hCBS has been reported to catalyze H2S formation solely by the β-replacement of the physiologically relevant substrates cysteine by homocysteine (19Chen X. Jhee K.H. Kruger W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52082-52086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We find that hCBS can generate H2S from cysteine, albeit with lower kcat values than from cysteine and homocysteine (Table 1). CBS has also been reported to catalyze H2S generation by β-replacement of cysteine by several compounds, e.g. β-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, cysteamine, and methanethiol, with concomitant formation of the corresponding thioethers (26Braunstein A.E. Goryachenkova E.V. Tolosa E.A. Willhardt I.H. Yefremova L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 242: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).The canonical reaction catalyzed by hCBS in the trans-sulfuration pathway is the β-replacement of serine by homocysteine to generate cystathionine (Fig. 1). The turnover number under substrate saturation (kcat) of this reaction (reaction 1) is 3.7-fold lower than for cystathionine production from cysteine and homocysteine (4) (Table 1), and it could partly be explained by the better leaving group potential of H2S versus H2O. Consequently, at physiological substrate concentrations, the turnover number for reaction 1 is predicted to be 1.3-fold lower than for reaction 4 (Table 2). Thus, reaction 4 represents an alternative route for generating cystathionine at physiologically relevant substrate concentrations, accounting for ∼56% of its total synthesis (Fig. 1). However, unlike reaction 1, reaction 4 does not lead to net cysteine synthesis via the trans-sulfuration pathway because cysteine is consumed to produce cystathionine and then subsequently regenerated by cleavage of cystathionine catalyzed by CSE (Fig. 1). Because the other product of reaction 4 is the signaling molecule H2S, flux through this reaction must be regulated in the cell by mechanisms that await elucidation.Of the three H2S-producing reactions catalyzed by CBS, reaction 4 is the most efficient, accounting for 96% of the net production (Table 3). In contrast, the β-elimination (reaction 2) and β-replacement reactions (reaction 3) involving cysteine are of minor importance, representing between 1.6 and 2.6% of the total H2S derived from hCBS (Table 3).In contrast to the sensitivity of CSE-catalyzed H2S generation from homocysteine (15Chiku T. Padovani D. Zhu W. Singh S. Vitvitsky V. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11601-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), our simulations reveal that H2S production by hCBS is insensitive to the grade of hyperhomocysteinemia (Table 2). Increasing homocysteine from normal to moderate to severely elevated levels has virtually no effect on the kcat value for reaction 4 for H2S production (Table 2). The insensitivity to homocysteine concentrations results from the relatively low Kd value for serine binding to site 1 (Kd ∼ 56 μm) compared with the physiological concentration of serine (560 μm). Thus, serine competes effectively with cysteine, which is present at lower concentrations and exhibits a higher Kd value, and thus limits the three H2S-generating reactions because they involve binding of cysteine to site 1 (Fig. 6). Unlike CSE, homocysteine appears to be unable to bind to site 1 in hCBS, and the enzyme does not catalyze reactions at the γ-carbon. Consequently, the only reaction rate that is boosted by an increase in homocysteine concentration is the β-replacement of serine by homocysteine (reaction 1) whose turnover number is predicted to increase 3.8- and 14.7-fold under moderate and severe hyperhomocysteinemia, respectively (Table 2). This enhancement would only be relevant in hyperhomocysteinemia conditions resulting from a deficiency in enzymes other than hCBS.FIGURE 6Schematic representation for the sensitivity of the CSE- but not CBS-catalyzed H2S production to hyperhomocysteinemia. Unlike CSE, the PLP-binding pocket of CBS binds serine or cysteine but not homocysteine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The insensitivity of H2S formation by CBS to homocysteine suggests that CSE will be primarily responsible for enhanced H2S production under conditions of hyperhomocysteinemia (Table 4 and Fig. 5). We have estimated the relative contribution of CBS and CSE to the net H2S pool, assuming equivalent amounts of both enzymes and full activation of CBS by AdoMet. Thus, under normal conditions (10 μm homocysteine), CSE accounts for ∼32% of the H2S produced by the trans-sulfuration pathway, and this increases to ∼45 and ∼74% under moderate and severe hyperhomocysteinemia conditions. However, in tissues where one or the other enzyme is absent or present at greatly reduced levels, their relative contributions to H2S biogenesis will clearly be different. Furthermore, depending on the extent of CBS activation by AdoMet, its relative contribution to the H2S pool could vary between ∼25 and 70% in cells containing equimolar CSE.Mutations in CBS are the most common cause of severe hyperhomocysteinemia in comparison with defects elsewhere in the metabolic pathway (37Mudd S.H. Skovby F. Levy H.L. Pettigrew K.D. Wilcken B. Pyeritz R.E. Andria G. Boers G.H. Bromberg I.L. Cerone R. et al.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1985; 37: 1-31PubMed Google Scholar). In homocystinurics with CBS deficiency, CSE will not only be the primary source of H2S but is predicted to generate higher H2S levels due to increased accumulation of homocysteine (15Chiku T. Padovani D. Zhu W. Singh S. Vitvitsky V. Banerjee R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11601-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Under conditions of elevated homocysteine due to deficiencies elsewhere in the methionine cycle, i.e. not in CBS, or a higher flux through the trans-sulfuration pathway (e.g. after a methionine-rich meal), cystathionine production is predicted to increase significantly (Fig. 1 and Table 2). This could lead in turn to enhanced production of cysteine and stimulate glutathione production, because cysteine is the limiting substrate for the synthesis of this antioxidant. The activity of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the committing step in the synthesis of glutathione, is regulated by feedback inhibition by glutathione (38Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, H2S has been reported to enhance the activity of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (39Kimura Y. Kimura H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1165-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar).Rat CBS has been reported to generate lanthionine from a mixture of cysteine and serine (25Borcsok E. Abeles R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 695-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we show that lanthionine (reaction 3) can also be produced by the condensation of 2 mol of cysteine (Table 1). The estimated turnover number for lanthionine production by hCBS is ∼13,000-fold higher than by human CSE. In contrast, CSE catalyzes the cleavage of lanthionine to cysteine and pyruvate more efficiently (kcat ∼ 0.8 s−1) than CBS (kcat < 0.05 s−1). Thus, lanthionine concentrations are expected to be higher in tissues in which CSE levels and/or activity are low. Our results demonstrate that lanthionine derived from cysteine is produced almost exclusively (99.99%) by CBS, thus linking the origin of this metabolite to cysteine metabolism and CBS.Implications of Relaxed Substrate Specificity in the Trans-sulfuration PathwayThe profligacy of CBS and CSE leads to a much greater complexity of trans-sulfuration reactions catalyzed by these enzymes than previously appreciated and expand the sulfur metabolome. The relative insensitivity of CBS to the grade of hyperhomocysteinemia contrasts with that of CSE. These results imply that CSE plays a heretofore unrecognized role in intracellular homocysteine management both in the peripheral vasculature, where CBS levels are low or the enzyme is absent, and under hyperhomocysteinemic conditions. Evidence for the role of CSE in homocysteine homeostasis is provided by the ∼18-fold increase in homocysteine levels in aorta and heart in CSE−/− mice (1Yang G. Wu L. Jiang B. Yang W. Qi J. Cao K. Meng Q. Mustafa A.K. Mu W. Zhang S. Snyder S.H. Wang R. Science. 2008; 322: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The metabolic functions of lanthionine, which is predicted to be enriched in tissues with low CSE activity, and of homolanthionine, await further elucidation. The capacity of the trans-sulfuration pathway to catalyze a multitude of reactions raises important questions about how these reactions are regulated to meet cellular needs for the varied products.

Zhang J. Lu Y. Wang R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6008-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar), these appear to be grossly overestimated (9Furne J. Saeed A. Levitt M.D. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 295: R1479-R1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Significantly lower H2S concentrations of 17 and 14 nm in liver and brain, respectively, have been reported recently (9Furne J. Saeed A. Levitt M.D. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2008; 295: R1479-R1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The very significant discrepancy between these and the previous estimates of H2S levels presumably derives from the earlier use of acidic conditions that led to the release of acid-labile sulfur from iron-sulfur centers. In mammals, the primary catalysts for H2S generation are reported to be the two pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes involved in the trans-sulfuration pathway, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) (10Abe K.

https://openalex.org/W2154577866,"Collagen is the most abundant extracellular-network-forming protein in animal biology and is important in both natural and artificial tissues, where it serves as a material of great mechanical versatility. This versatility arises from its almost unique ability to remodel under applied loads into anisotropic and inhomogeneous structures. To explore the origins of this property, we develop a set of analysis tools and a novel experimental setup that probes the mechanical response of fibrous networks in a geometry that mimics a typical deformation profile imposed by cells in vivo. We observe strong fiber alignment and densification as a function of applied strain for both uncrosslinked and crosslinked collagenous networks. This alignment is found to be irreversibly imprinted in uncrosslinked collagen networks, suggesting a simple mechanism for tissue organization at the microscale. However, crosslinked networks display similar fiber alignment and the same geometrical properties as uncrosslinked gels, but with full reversibility. Plasticity is therefore not required to align fibers. On the contrary, our data show that this effect is part of the fundamental non-linear properties of fibrous biological networks."
https://openalex.org/W2041940817,"Transient receptor potential channels have recently been implicated in physiological functions in a urogenital system. In this study, we investigated the role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels in a stretch sensing mechanism in mouse primary urothelial cell cultures. The selective TRPV4 agonist, 4alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4alpha-PDD) evoked Ca(2+) influx in wild-type (WT) urothelial cells, but not in TRPV4-deficient (TRPV4KO) cells. We established a cell-stretch system to investigate stretch-evoked changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and ATP release. Stretch stimulation evoked intracellular Ca(2+) increases in a stretch speed- and distance-dependent manner in WT and TRPV4KO cells. In TRPV4KO urothelial cells, however, the intracellular Ca(2+) increase in response to stretch stimulation was significantly attenuated compared with that in WT cells. Stretch-evoked Ca(2+) increases in WT urothelium were partially reduced in the presence of ruthenium red, a broad TRP channel blocker, whereas that in TRPV4KO cells did not show such reduction. Potent ATP release occurred following stretch stimulation or 4alpha-PDD administration in WT urothelial cells, which was dramatically suppressed in TRPV4KO cells. Stretch-dependent ATP release was almost completely eliminated in the presence of ruthenium red or in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+). These results suggest that TRPV4 senses distension of the bladder urothelium, which is converted to an ATP signal in the micturition reflex pathway during urine storage."
https://openalex.org/W2083120573,"Key to understanding the epidemiology and pathogenesis of prion diseases, including chronic wasting disease (CWD) of cervids, is determining the mode of transmission from one individual to another. We have previously reported that saliva and blood from CWD-infected deer contain sufficient infectious prions to transmit disease upon passage into naïve deer. Here we again use bioassays in deer to show that blood and saliva of pre-symptomatic deer contain infectious prions capable of infecting naïve deer and that naïve deer exposed only to environmental fomites from the suites of CWD-infected deer acquired CWD infection after a period of 15 months post initial exposure. These results help to further explain the basis for the facile transmission of CWD, highlight the complexities associated with CWD transmission among cervids in their natural environment, emphasize the potential utility of blood-based testing to detect pre-clinical CWD infection, and could augur similar transmission dynamics in other prion infections."
https://openalex.org/W2089226849,"Previously we have shown that Ag85B-TB10.4 is a highly efficient vaccine against tuberculosis when delivered in a Th1 inducing adjuvant based on cationic liposomes. Another Th1 inducing adjuvant, which has shown a very promising profile in both preclinical and clinical trials, is IC31. In this study, we examined the potential of Ag85B-TB10.4 delivered in the adjuvant IC31 for the ability to induce protection against infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In addition, we examined if the antigen dose could influence the phenotype of the induced T cells.We found that vaccination with the combination of Ag85B-TB10.4 and IC31 resulted in high numbers of polyfunctional CD4 T cells co-expressing IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. This correlated with protection against subsequent challenge with M.tb in the mouse TB model. Importantly, our results also showed that both the vaccine induced T cell response, and the protective efficacy, was highly dependent on the antigen dose. Thus, whereas antigen doses of 5 and 15 microg did not induce significant protection against M.tb, reducing the dose to 0.5 microg selectively increased the number of polyfunctional T cells and induced a strong protection against infection with M.tb. The influence of antigen dose was also observed in the guinea pig model of aerosol infection with M.tb. In this model a 2.5 fold increase in the antigen dose reduced the protection against infection with M.tb to the level observed in non-vaccinated animals.Small changes in the antigen dose can greatly influence the induction of specific T cell subpopulations and the dose is therefore a crucial factor when testing new vaccines. However, the adjuvant IC31 can, with the optimal dose of Ag85B-TB10.4, induce strong protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This vaccine has now entered clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2148239379,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid signal transmitter present in blood. Blood plasma S1P is supplied from erythrocytes and plays an important role in lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs. However, the S1P export mechanism from erythrocytes to blood plasma is not well defined. To elucidate the mechanism of S1P export from erythrocytes, we performed the enzymatic characterization of S1P transporter in rat erythrocytes. Rat erythrocytes constitutively released S1P without any stimulus. The S1P release was reduced by an ABCA1 transporter inhibitor, glyburide, but not by a multidrug resistance-associated protein inhibitor, MK571, or a multidrug resistance protein inhibitor, cyclosporine A. Furthermore, we measured S1P transport activity using rat erythrocyte inside-out membrane vesicles (IOVs). Although the effective S1P transport into IOVs was observed in the presence of ATP, this activity was also supported by dATP and adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate. The rate of S1P transport increased depending on S1P concentration, with an apparent K(m) value of 21 microm. Two phosphorylated sphingolipids, dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate and ceramide 1-phosphate, did not inhibit S1P transport. Similar to the intact erythrocytes, the uptake of S1P into IOVs was inhibited by glyburide and vanadate but not by the other ABC transporter inhibitors. These results suggest that S1P is exported from the erythrocytes by a novel ATP-dependent transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1999057135,"SUMO is a protein modifier that is vital for multicellular development. Here we present the first system-wide analysis, combining multiple approaches, to correlate the sumoylated proteome (SUMO-ome) in a multicellular organism with the developmental roles of SUMO. Using mass-spectrometry-based protein identification, we found over 140 largely novel SUMO conjugates in the early Drosophila embryo. Enriched functional groups include proteins involved in Ras signaling, cell cycle, and pattern formation. In support of the functional significance of these findings, sumo germline clone embryos exhibited phenotypes indicative of defects in these same three processes. Our cell culture and immunolocalization studies further substantiate roles for SUMO in Ras signaling and cell cycle regulation. For example, we found that SUMO is required for efficient Ras-mediated MAP kinase activation upstream or at the level of Ras activation. We further found that SUMO is dynamically localized during mitosis to the condensed chromosomes, and later also to the midbody. Polo kinase, a SUMO substrate found in our screen, partially colocalizes with SUMO at both sites. These studies show that SUMO coordinates multiple regulatory processes during oogenesis and early embryogenesis. In addition, our database of sumoylated proteins provides a valuable resource for those studying the roles of SUMO in development."
https://openalex.org/W1965146753,"Recent yeast genetic studies have implicated the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and ubiquitin ligase functions of yRad6 and yBre1, respectively, in H2B ubiquitylation. However, there have been no corresponding biochemical analyses demonstrating intrinsic enzyme activities of yRad6 and yBre1 or related mechanistic details. Here, we describe a robust in vitro chromatin ubiquitylation assay that involves purified H2B ubiquitylation factors and natural nucleosomes. Our results indicate that yRad6 has an in vitro ability to nonspecifically ubiquitylate all core histones in the absence of an ubiquitin ligase but that yBre1 functions, through direct interactions with yRad6, to direct the ubiquitin conjugating activity of yRad6 toward the physiological H2B ubiquitylation site. Moreover, a yRad6 domain mapping analysis shows that an intact UBC domain is required for binding to yBre1, whereas the C-terminal acidic tail domain that is not required for a stable yBre1-yRad6 interaction is necessary for full enzyme activity of yRad6. We also find that, analogous to heteromeric complex formation by BRE1 paralogues in other organisms, yBre1 forms a homo-multimeric complex. Of special significance, our detailed biochemical analyses further show that the yBre1 RING finger domain is essential for H2B ubiquitylation but, surprisingly, dispensable for interaction of yBre1 with yRad6. In further support of the genetically identified requirement of the RNA polymerase II-associated yPaf1 complex for H2B ubiquitylation, protein interaction studies reveal that a purified yPaf1 complex directly and selectively interacts with yBre1 and thus serves to link the H2B ubiquitylation and general transcription machineries.

These studies provide a more detailed mechanistic basis for H2B ubiquitylation in yeast. Protein ubiquitylation is mediated by three classes of enzymes: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 2The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin ligasePol IIRNA polymerase IIWTwild typeH2Ahistone H2AH2Bhistone H2BH3histone H3H4histone H4ubH2Blysine 120-ubiquitylated H2BGSTglutathione S-transferaseNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideHAhemagglutinin. 2The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin ligasePol IIRNA polymerase IIWTwild typeH2Ahistone H2AH2Bhistone H2BH3histone H3H4histone H4ubH2Blysine 120-ubiquitylated H2BGSTglutathione S-transferaseNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideHAhemagglutinin. ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin ligases (E3s). E1 is universal for all protein ubiquitylation, but cognate E2-E3 pairs selectively ubiquitylate specific target proteins (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). Although histone H2B (H2B) ubiquitylation was first reported ∼30 years ago (2West M.H. Bonner W.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4671-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the identification of enzymes for H2B ubiquitylation is rather recent. Thus, deletions or mutations of RAD6 and BRE1 homologues result in the disappearance of H2B ubiquitylation in many organisms (3Weake V.M. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 653-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) but have been studied most extensively in yeast (4Osley M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These results have suggested that RAD6 and BRE1 may serve as E2 and E3 enzymes, respectively, for H2B ubiquitylation, although there have been no biochemical analyses that directly demonstrate the enzymatic activities of yeast Rad6 (yRad6) and Bre1 (yBre1) proteins in these functions. ubiquitin-activating enzyme ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubiquitin ligase RNA polymerase II wild type histone H2A histone H2B histone H3 histone H4 lysine 120-ubiquitylated H2B glutathione S-transferase nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride hemagglutinin. ubiquitin-activating enzyme ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubiquitin ligase RNA polymerase II wild type histone H2A histone H2B histone H3 histone H4 lysine 120-ubiquitylated H2B glutathione S-transferase nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride hemagglutinin. Yeast Rad6 is the first identified E2 shown to possess an in vitro ubiquitin conjugating activity toward free H2B in the absence of E3 (5Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). In addition to the common E2 signature motif, the UBC (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) domain, and unlike RAD6 homologues in other organisms, yRad6 has a highly acidic C-terminal domain that is responsible for histone polyubiquitylation in vitro (6Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, yRad6 was also shown to mediate an in vitro H2A ubiquitylation (6Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) that is not found in yeast cells, and yCdc34 subsequently was found to have similar histone ubiquitin conjugating activity in vitro (7Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A later demonstration of the sole requirement of the yeast RAD6 gene for H2B monoubiquitylation at lysine 123 in vivo (8Robzyk K. Recht J. Osley M.A. Science. 2000; 287: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) strongly suggested the presence of a physiological E3 that restricts yRad6 activity to lysine 123 on H2B. Three years later, two groups independently identified the yeast BRE1 gene as an E3 for H2B ubiquitylation (9Hwang W.W. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Ianculescu A.G. Tong A. Boone C. Madhani H.D. Mol.

Greenblatt J.F. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The BRE1 homologues in diverse organisms contain a RING (really interesting new gene) finger domain, one of the E3 signature motifs, that is essential for the ubiquitin ligase activity. Although the exact role of RING fingers in protein ubiquitylation is still unknown, there is a substantial evidence for interactions between E3 RING fingers and cognate E2s (11Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). In addition to yRad6 and yBre1, efficient H2B ubiquitylation in yeast requires the yPaf1 (yeast polymerase II-associated factor 1) complex (12Ng H.H. Dole S. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33625-33628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 13Wood A. Schneider J. Dover J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol.

Jaehning J.A. Burton Z.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 8: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). From a mechanistic viewpoint, it has been shown that yRad6 is recruited to promoters in a yBre1-dependent manner (13Wood A. Schneider J. Dover J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34739-34742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and to coding regions in an yPaf1 complex-dependent manner (16Xiao T. Kao C.F. Krogan N.J. Sun Z.W. Greenblatt J.F. Osley M.A. Strahl B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and that yPaf1 complex subunits (yPaf1 and yRtf1) are required for intracellular association (in extracts) of yRad6 with Pol II (13Wood A.

Greenblatt J.F. Osley M.A. Strahl B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the yPaf1 complex links H2B ubiquitylation and transcription machineries, although direct interactions of Rad6 or Bre1 with Pol II or the Paf1 complex in yeast were not established. Here we have established robust in vitro chromatin ubiquitylation assay systems with biochemically defined factors to show that yBre1 directs yRad6 to specifically ubiquitylate H2B at the single physiological site. Through extensive domain mapping studies, we further show that the yRad6 acidic C-terminal domain is required for efficient H2B ubiquitylation, that the yBre1 RING finger domain is essential for H2B ubiquitylation but is not required for binding of yBre1 to yRad6, and that yBre1 forms a homomeric complex via multiple domain interactions. Along with the further demonstration of a direct and selective interaction between yBre1 and the yPaf1 complex, these findings provide a detailed biochemical description of the mechanism of H2B ubiquitylation in yeast. The cDNAs for yRad6 (Gene ID 172348), yBre1 (Gene ID 1431087), yCtr9 (Gene ID 1732236), yRtf1 (Gene ID 1841838), yLeo1 (Gene ID 443970), yPaf1 (Gene ID 536721), and yCdc73 (Gene ID 632669) were PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA (Invitrogen).

For baculoviruses, cDNAs were subcloned in pFASTBAC1 vector with or without an epitope tag, and baculoviruses were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).

The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. The following antibodies were obtained commercially: anti-H2A, anti-H2B, anti-H3, anti-H4 and anti-HA (Abcam); anti-ubH2B (Medlabs); anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-FLAG (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated; Sigma); and anti-His (Qiagen). To establish comprehensive in vitro chromatin ubiquitylation and protein interaction assays, we first prepared basic H2B ubiquitylation factors (recombinant hE1, yRad6, and yBre1) and protein substrates (recombinant histones, histone octamers, and natural oligonucleosomes derived from HeLa cells) (Fig. 1A). The yeast E2-E3 H2B ubiquitylation system has advantages over that of other organisms because the presence of single copy RAD6 and BRE1 genes allows more simplified biochemical analyses (below). Consistent with the phylogenetic sequence conservation of E1 and the universal requirement of E1 for all protein ubiquitylation processes, the hE1 has proved compatible with yeast Rad6 and Bre1 proteins for in vitro ubiquitylation assays (below). Cognate E2-E3 pairs specifically and directly bind to each other (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). Consistent with co-isolation of yRad6 in an affinity-purified yBre1 complex (10Wood A. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Golshani A. Zhang Y. Greenblatt J.F. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), we confirmed a direct interaction between purified yRad6 and yBre1 proteins (Fig. 1B). Direct interactions between the RING finger E3 and cognate E2 proteins result in both substrate and E3 ubiquitylation (22Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), as is well documented for the H2A ubiquitylation-specific Ring1B E3 (23Ben-Saadon R. Zaaroor D. Ziv T. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this regard and further confirming the functional relevance of the physical interaction between yRad6 and yBre1, an E3 ubiquitylation assay revealed ATP-, E1-, and yRad6-dependent polyubiquitylation of yBre1 (Fig. 1C). To clearly demonstrate direct E2 and E3 functions of yRad6 and yBre1, respectively, we set up an in vitro chromatin ubiquitylation assay. This assay employs natural oligonucleosome arrays derived from HeLa cells because they provide preferred ubiquitylation substrates compared with the chromatin that is assembled with recombinant histones that lack all post-translational histone modifications (see “Discussion”). In this assay, newly synthesized ubiquitylated H2B (modified by His- and HA-tagged ubiquitin) is expected to migrate more slowly than the naturally ubiquitylated H2B that is present in the oligonucleosome substrate. Note also that lysine 120 in vertebrate H2B corresponds to lysine 123 in yeast H2B and is probed here by an anti-ubH2B antibody that specifically recognizes ubH2B (24Minsky N. Shema E. Field Y. Schuster M. Segal E. Oren M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Complete reactions containing purified hE1, yRad6, yBre1, ubiquitin, and oligonucleosomes generated a lysine 120-ubiquitylated H2B (Fig. 1D, top panel, lanes 2 and 8), whereas reactions with omission of any of these components did not (top panel, lanes 3–7). Although a significant level of H2B ubiquitylation (probed by an anti-H2B antibody) was detected in the absence of yBre1, this clearly represents H2B ubiquitylation at a site(s) other than lysine 120 (compare top panel, lane 5 versus middle panel, lane 5; see also below). The majority of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (probed by an anti-HA antibody) are thought to be ubiquitin-conjugated yRad6 because they were mainly observed in reactions containing hE1 and yRad6 (bottom panel, compare lanes 2, 5, 7 and 8 versus lanes 1, 3 and 4). In a test for efficiency of the in vitro H2B ubiquitylation reactions, we observed a dose-dependent increase in H2B ubiquitylation in response to varying amounts of yBre1 but not of yRad6 (supplemental Fig. S1). This suggests that the E3 is more limiting for H2B ubiquitylation, at least in vitro, and may explain the enhanced H2B ubiquitylation by ectopic E3, but not by ectopic E2, in a cell-based assay (25Kim J. Hake S.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The detection of a significant level of yBre1-independent H2B ubiquitylation by yRad6 in the in vitro chromatin ubiquitylation assay (above) led us to more detailed analyses of substrate and site specificities of yRad6 in the presence and in the absence of yBre1 (Fig. 2). Consistent with the earlier reports of the ability of yRad6 to ubiquitylate H2A and H2B (5Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 6Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), yRad6 was shown to mono- and polyubiquitylate all four core histones both in free and octamer forms in the absence of yBre1 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 6, in the anti-H2A, -H2B, -H3, and -H4 immunoblots), and the inclusion of yBre1 did not affect the overall histone ubiquitylation efficiency (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 7 versus lanes 2 and 6, respectively, in the anti-H2A, -H2B, -H3, and -H4 immunoblots). Importantly, the efficiency of histone ubiquitylation with the nucleosomal substrate decreased significantly compared with the efficiency of histone ubiquitylation with free histones or with histone octamers as substrates (Fig. 2, lanes 9–12 versus lanes 1–4 or lanes 5–8, in the anti-H2A, -H2B, -H3, and -H4 immunoblots). This suggests that nucleosome structure restricts nonspecific access of ubiquitylation factors to the histone core regions. However, and most importantly, H2B ubiquitylation at Lys120 was critically dependent upon yBre1 for all substrates tested (compare lanes 3, 7 and 11 versus lanes 2, 6 and 10, respectively, in the anti-ubH2B immunoblots). This indicates that yBre1 directs the yRad6 ubiquitin conjugating activity to a specific ubiquitylation site (lysine 120) through recognition of the target substrate. In addition, E3-independent histone ubiquitylation by yRad6 reflects a nonspecific yRad6 ubiquitin conjugating activity that is manifested in a purified assay system lacking constraints that normally control accessibility of yRad6 to histones. To determine the regions in yRad6 that are required for H2B ubiquitylation and for interaction with yBre1, we generated serial deletion mutants and a C88A mutant (cysteine to alanine substitution at amino acid 88 that abolishes ubiquitin conjugating activity of yRad6 (26Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 2695-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 3A). We first examined the interactions of purified yRad6 fragments (Fig. 3B) with yBre1. Direct binding of the C-terminal acidic tail deletion mutant (N152) (Fig. 3A) to yBre1 was comparable with that of wild type (WT) (Fig. 3C, compare lane 4 versus lane 3), whereas all other deletion mutants within the UBC domain failed to bind to yBre1 (lanes 5–8 versus lane 3). These results indicate that an intact yRad6 UBC domain is essential for interaction with yBre1 but that the yRad6 acidic tail is dispensable for this interaction. To investigate corresponding H2B ubiquitylation activities with the above-described yRad6 mutant proteins and because GST-fused yRad6 proteins exhibited much weaker ubiquitin conjugating activity compared with that of His-fused yRad6 (data not shown), we newly prepared His-tagged yRad6 fragments (Fig. 3D). Consistent with the absence of detectable interactions with yBre1, none of the partial UBC domain fragments showed any detectable ubiquitin conjugating activity on yBre1 (Fig. 3E, lanes 5–8) or on H2B (Fig. 3F, lanes 5–8). In addition, and as expected, the C88A mutant was catalytically inactive in both yBre1 and H2B ubiquitylation (Fig. 3, E, lane 3, and F, lane 3). Importantly, the N152 mutant lacking the acidic tail showed markedly decreased levels of yBre1 ubiquitylation (Fig. 3E, compare lane 4 versus lane 2) and H2B Lys120 ubiquitylation (Fig. 3F, compare lane 4 versus lane 2) compared with that of intact yRad6. This is consistent with the disappearance of ubH2B in the rad6-149 strain in which WT yRad6 is replaced by a mutant yRad6 that encodes amino acids 1–149 and thus lacks the C-terminal acidic domain (8Robzyk K. Recht J. Osley M.A. Science. 2000; 287: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Human RAD6 (hRAD6) homologues show strong amino acid sequence homology to yRad6 and are able to complement the E2 function of yRad6 (20Kim J. Guermah M. McGinty R.K. Lee J.S. Tang Z. Milne T.A. Shilatifard A. Muir T.W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2009; 137: 459-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) despite the absence of the C-terminal acidic tail (supplemental Fig. S2). To detail a role of the yRad6 acidic tail in H2B ubiquitylation, we compared the E2 activities of purified yRad6 WT and N152 mutant proteins with those of hRAD6 (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the observed increase of ubH2B in response to ectopic yBre1 expression in human cells (25Kim J. Hake S.B. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), both hRAD6A and hRAD6B efficiently ubiquitylated H2B at lysine 120 in the presence of yBre1 (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5). Interestingly, the H2B ubiquitylation level of the yRad6 N152 mutant was significantly lower than the levels observed with yRad6 WT and hRAD6 (compare 3 versus lanes 2, 4 and 5), indicating a specific requirement of the acidic tail for full intrinsic E2 activity of yRad6. Overall these data indicate that the C-terminal acidic domain plays a role in potentiating the enzymatic activity of yRad6. To determine the yBre1 domains that are responsible for H2B ubiquitylation and interaction with yRad6, we generated serial deletion mutants as well as mutants (H665A and C663A) with point mutations in residues critical for RING finger formation (10Wood A.

While searching for new natural anti-HCV agents in agricultural products, we found a potent inhibitor of HCV RNA expression in extracts of blueberry leaves when examined in an HCV subgenomic replicon cell culture system. This activity was observed in a methanol extract fraction of blueberry leaves and was purified by repeated fractionations in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The final purified fraction showed a 63-fold increase in specific activity compared with the initial methanol extracts and was composed only of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Liquid chromatography/mass-ion trap-time of flight analysis and butanol-HCl hydrolysis analysis of the purified fraction revealed that the blueberry leaf-derived inhibitor was proanthocyanidin. Furthermore, structural analysis using acid thiolysis indicated that the mean degree of polymerization of the purified proanthocyanidin was 7.7, consisting predominantly of epicatechin. Proanthocyanidin with a polymerization degree of 8 to 9 showed the greatest potency at inhibiting the expression of subgenomic HCV RNA. Purified proanthocyanidin showed dose-dependent inhibition of expression of the neomycin-resistant gene and the NS-3 protein gene in the HCV subgenome in replicon cells. While characterizing the mechanism by which proanthocyanidin inhibited HCV subgenome expression, we found that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 showed affinity to blueberry leaf-derived proanthocyanidin and was indispensable for HCV subgenome expression in replicon cells.

The number of people worldwide who are infected by HCV is estimated to be over 200 million with 2 million infections in Japan (4Myles D.C. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2001; 4: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar). The South Kyushu area of Japan, including Miyazaki prefecture, has a high prevalence of this virus, and it is now recognized as a social problem. There is no vaccine effective for HCV at present. The elimination of HCV may be achieved by a combination of pegylated α-interferon and ribavirin, a broad spectrum antiviral drug (4Myles D.C. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2001; 4: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar, 5Dillon J.F. J. Viral. Hepat. 2004; 11 (Suppl. 1): 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Ni Z.J. Wagman A.S. Curr. Opin.

Considering the prolonged period (20–30 years) required for development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in individuals infected with HCV, we speculated that progression of the disease might be influenced by daily diet. Our research project focuses on the daily use of agricultural products that could cure or reduce the risk of disease progression by HCV. Thus, we screened local agricultural products (1700 samples from 283 species) for their suppressive activity against HCV subgenome expression using an HCV replicon cell system. We found a significant suppressive activity in extracts of blueberry leaves. Blueberries are classified in the genus Vaccinium, and the species are native only to North America. Blueberry leaves have high quinic acid and chlorogenic acid contents and also significant flavonol glycosides such as rutin. Thus, they are high in antioxidant activity. In our subsequent screening studies using various kinds of blueberry species, the most potent activity was observed in the leaf of rabbit-eye blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum Aiton), which is cultivated in southern areas of Japan. In this study, extracts of rabbit-eye blueberry leaves were used in an effort to purify and identify the compound responsible for inhibition of the expression of subgenomic HCV RNA. We identified oligomeric proanthocyanidin with mean degree of polymerization (mDP) around eight as an inhibitor of HCV subgenome expression. We also analyzed cellular proteins that have affinity to the oligomeric proanthocyanidin in HCV replicon cells and identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 as one of candidate proteins involved in the proanthocyanidin-mediated inhibition of HCV subgenome expression. A lyophilized powder made from leaves of rabbit-eye blueberry (V. virgatum Aiton) was provided by Unkai Shuzo Co., Ltd. (Miyazaki, Japan). One gram of the lyophilized powder was extracted with 100 ml of methanol at room temperature with shaking for 15 min, and the supernatant was passed through filter paper (filter paper No.2, Toyo, Tokyo, Japan). The methanol extract was then extracted with 100 ml of chloroform, followed by centrifugation (1750 × g for 10 min), and the resultant precipitate and supernatant were collected. The precipitate was dissolved in methanol, concentrated in vacuo, and lyophilized (CMW-ppt). The supernatant was mixed with 150 ml of distilled water and methanol to perform a liquid-liquid extraction, and the water layer was collected and mixed with 150 ml of chloroform to repeat the chloroform extraction. The water layer was concentrated and lyophilized (CMW-W). The chloroform layer was also concentrated and lyophilized (CMW-C). Most HCV subgenome-expression inhibitory activity was recovered in the CMW-W fraction. To separate the components in the CMW-W fraction processing inhibitory activity against HCV RNA expression, we performed HPLC (Prominence System, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Preliminary fractionation of CMW-W to confirm the elution pattern of HCV expression suppressive components was carried out on a reversed-phase column (Atlantis dC18, 4.6 mm × 150 mm, 3 μm, Waters, Milford, MA) at 40 °C with UV detection at 254 nm. A gradient consisting of eluant A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) and eluant B (acetonitrile) was applied at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min as follows: 15–25% B linear from 0 to 12.5 min, 25–100% B linear from 12.5 to 17.5 min followed by washing 100% B from 17.5 to 25 min. For purification, the first HPLC fractionation was performed on a reversed-phase column (Atlantis T3, 4.6 mm × 150 mm, 3 μm, Waters). A gradient consisting of eluant A and eluant B (acetonitrile) was applied at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min as follows: 30% B from 0 to 7.5 min, 30–100% B linear gradient from 7.5 to 12.5 min, followed by washing with 100% B from 12.5 to 20 min. The CMW-W fraction dissolved in 30 ml of methanol was injected, and the eluted fractions (2.1 to 18.0 min, total 26 fractions) were collected. The gradient program for the second fractionation was 20% B from 0 to 7.5 min, 20–100% B linear from 7.5 to 12.5 min, followed by washing with 100% B from 12.5 to 20 min. Fractionation of the eluate was the same as the first HPLC program. In the third HPLC fractionation, the eluant B was replaced by methanol and eluted with 40–65% B linear gradient from 0 to 12.5 min and 65–100% B linear gradient from 12.5 to 17.5 min. Fractions eluted from 2.2 to 17.5 min (total 26 fractions) were collected. In all experiments, suppressive activity of each fraction against HCV RNA expression was measured using replicon cells. The Huh-7/3-1 cell line carrying an HCV-replicon was used (10Sakamoto H. Okamoto K. Aoki M. Kato H. Katsume A. Ohta A. Tsukuda T. Shimma N. Aoki Y. Arisawa M. Kohara M. Sudoh M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The line was established from Huh-7 cells by stable transfection with subgenomic selectable RNA in which the encoding HCV structural proteins were replaced by the firefly luciferase gene, the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of the Encephalomyocarditis virus and the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. With this HCV subgenome, the efficiency of subgenomic HCV expression could be estimated by measuring luciferase activity in the replicon cells. The HCV replicon cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with Glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For the HCV subgenome expression assay, the replicon cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with Glutamax and 5% fetal bovine serum were seeded in 96-well plates (5000 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h. Then the cells were cultured with various concentrations of samples for 72 h. Quantification of the luciferase activity was performed using the Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the luminescence was measured by DTX 800 Multimode Detector (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The inhibitory activity was expressed as the concentration required for 50% inhibition (IC50). Specific activity was calculated as a reciprocal number of IC50 (1/IC50). Total activity was calculated by multiplying yielded weight by specific activity. The cytotoxicity of the samples was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 10 μl/well of Cell Counting Kit-8 reagent was added to the cells cultured in a 96-well plate, incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm with a reference wavelength at 650 nm using an Emax Precision microplate reader (Molecular Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Cell viability was calculated as relative index of control cells, and effects of samples on cell viability were expressed as the concentration required for 50% cytotoxicity (CC50). For electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA-1600, Shimadzu), the excitation voltage and the beam current were kept at 15 kV and at 100 nA, respectively. The diameter of the electron beam was 50 μm, and the sample was processed for carbon shadowing in advance. Identification of the anti-HCV compound purified from blueberry leaves was done by HPLC-MSn fragmentation analyses. An HPLC System (Prominence System, Shimadzu) on a reversed-phase column (Atlantis T3, 2.1-mm inner diameter × 100 mm, 3 μm, Waters) was equipped with a photodiode array (PDA) detector scanning from 200 to 800 nm and mass spectrometry-ion trap-time of flight (MS-IT-TOF, Shimadzu) detector. The mobile phase consisted of a gradient system 30 min of eluant A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) and eluant B (acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. The elution program was 10–25% B linear from 0 to 7.5 min, 25–100% B linear from 7.5 to 12.5 min, followed by washing 100% B from 12.5 to 20 min. The column was maintained at 40 °C. Electrospray ionization conditions were recorded from m/z = 200 to 1500 in a negative ionization mode. Other MS conditions were as follows: interface voltage, −3.5 or −3.0 kV; nebulizer N2 gas, 1.5 or 2.0 liters/min; drying N2 pressure, 200 or 70 kPa, respectively. Heat block temperature and curved desolvation line temperature were both 200 °C. Analytical conditions were recorded from m/z 250 to 1500 in a negative ionization mode. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) probe temperature was set from 250 to 450 °C. Proanthocyanidins were characterized by a modified method of Porter et al. (11Porter L.J. Hrstich L.N. Chan B.G. Phytochemistry. 1986; 25: 223-230Crossref Scopus (1831) Google Scholar, 12Shoji T. Masumoto S. Moriichi N. Akiyama H. Kanda T. Ohtake Y. Goda Y. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2006; 54: 884-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), in which they were degraded to anthocyanidins by heating under acidic conditions. Briefly, 200 μl of purified compound from blueberry leaves (0.1–2.5 mg/ml) was mixed with 750 μl of n-butanol/HCl (95:5) and 50 μl of 1% of NH4Fe(SO4)2·12H2O dissolved in 2 m HCl. The mixture was vortexed and heated in an oven at 105 °C for 40 min, and cooled in flowing water. Optical densities of the treated solution were recorded at 540 nm by spectrophotometer (UV-1700, Shimadzu). Procyanidin B2 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a standard. The hydrolysates generated by the modified Porter method were also analyzed using LC/MS-IT-TOF as described above. The elution program was 10–40% B linear from 0 to 15 min followed by washing 100% B from 15 to 22.5 min. Electrospray ionization conditions were recorded from m/z 200 to 1500 in a positive ionization mode. Interface voltage and nebulizer N2 were 4.5 kV and 1.5 L/min, respectively. MS/MS conditions were set to auto system and recorded from m/z 50 to 1000. The parent MS was searched from m/z 200 to 1500, and ion accumulation was 30 ms. The data were analyzed by LCMS solution v3.41 software and Formula Predictor Software (Shimadzu). Thiolysis was performed by a previously described method (13Guyot S. Marnet N. Drilleau J.F. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2001; 49: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 14Gu L. Kelm M. Hammerstone J.F. Beecher G. Cunningham D. Vannozzi S. Prior R.L. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 4852-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 50 μl of purified samples (2 mg/ml in methanol) was mixed with 50 μl of methanol acidified with HCl (3.3%) and 100 μl of benzyl mercaptan (5% in methanol). The reaction was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min and then kept at ambient temperature for 3 h. Pure catechin or epicatechin solution (1.25 mg/ml in methanol) (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan) was also thiolyzed to obtain the epimerization rate to calculate the ratio of catechin and epicatechin in the terminal units. The reaction mixture was diluted 5-fold with methanol and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. An Atlantis T3 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 3 μm, Waters) was used at 40 °C as described above. UV detection was performed at 280 nm. The gradient program was 15–25% B linear from 0 to 10 min, 25–100% B linear from 10 to 30 min, followed by washing 100% B from 30 to 37.5 min and re-equilibration of the column 37.5 to 45 min under initial gradient conditions. To ascertain the elution pattern of thiolysis media and to estimate unknown peaks, LC/MS-IT-TOF was also employed in a negative ion mode. Flavan-3-ols and their benzylthio adducts obtained by thiolysis media of procyanidin B2 were used as a standard. The mDP was calculated by the formula, mDP = [sum of (benzylthio adducts × n) + sum of (free flavan-3-ol × n)]/[total free flavan-3-ol], in which “n” is DP of detected flavan-3-ol by thiolysis. To prepare proanthocyanidin from blueberry leaves, freeze-dried powder (100 g) was extracted with 1.2 liters of acetone for 10 min, and the supernatant was decanted. This procedure was repeated five times to remove the green pigment from the leaves, followed by washing in 1.2 liters of hexane for 30 min. The remaining residues were washed with ethyl acetate. The washed powder of leaves was extracted with 1.2 liters of methanol for 30 min, and the supernatant was filtered. This procedure was repeated four times, and the resulting crude methanol extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporator at 50 °C and lyophilized, finally resulting in ∼30 g of solid powder. The crude methanol extract (15 g) was then dissolved in 1.0 liter of 60% methanol and placed on a Sephadex LH-20 column (50 mm × 920 mm, Amersham Biosciences). Fractionation was performed using the following series of solvents: fraction I, 9.0 liters of 60% methanol (retrieved weight: 10.2 g); fraction II, 9.0 liters of 100% methanol (retrieved weight: 3.3 g); fraction III, 9.0 liters of 70% (v/v) acetone (retrieved weight: 1.3 g). The LC/MS-IT-TOF analyses of each fraction indicated that fraction I was primarily composed of quinic acid, chlorogenic acid, and flavonol glycosides such as rutin. Fraction II consisted of proanthocyanidin oligomers from tetramer to decamer as analyzed by thiolysis. Fraction III consisted of proanthocyanidin polymers that were decamers or greater. In each fraction, the eluate was divided into 28 subfractions/liter. Total RNAs from cultured replicon cells were prepared using RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen). RNAs were denatured at 65 °C for 15 min, cooled on ice, and then separated by 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis (2 μg/lane) and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with a biotinized probe of the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. For detection of the bound probe, membranes were incubated with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 680 conjugate (Invitrogen), and the bound fluorescence was detected by Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). For internal control, Β-actin mRNA-specific biotinized antisense RNA probe was used. Cultured replicon cells were harvested, and total cellular proteins were extracted with CelLytic-M (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% gel under reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was treated with a blocking buffer for near infrared fluorescent Western blotting (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Primary antibodies used were anti-human hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP K, hnRNP L, and hnRNP Q and anti-human Β-actin antibodies (EF-67, D-6, A-11, 18E4, and I-19, respectively, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) F, eIF3G eIF3H polyclonal antibodies (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), and anti-HCV NS-3 polyclonal antibody (10Sakamoto H. Okamoto K. Aoki M. Kato H. Katsume A. Ohta A. Tsukuda T. Shimma N. Aoki Y. Arisawa M. Kohara M. Sudoh M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were visualized with Alexa Fluor 680 anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) or IRDyeTM 800CW anti-goat IgG (LI-COR Biosciences) and detected by using as Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Purified blueberry leaf-derived proanthocyanidin or catechin was coupled with epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 5 × 108 HCV replicon cells were extracted with lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1% CHAPS, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)). The total protein extract (90 mg) was added to the coupled Sepharose beads (3 ml) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle rotation. The beads were centrifuged (500 × g) for 1 min, and the pellet was washed six times with the lysis buffer. The absorbed proteins were eluted by incubation in 2% SDS with 50 mm dithiothreitol at 100 °C for 10 min. The eluate was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra-4 Ultracel-5k (Millipore), and the solvent was replaced by the lysis buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the o-phthalaldehyde method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Fluorescent two-dimensional-DIGE was performed using fluorescent dyes, IC3-OSu and IC5-OSu (Dojindo Molecular Technologies), with a modification of the methods reported elsewhere (15Tonge R. Shaw J. Middleton B. Rowlinson R. Rayner S. Young J. Pognan F. Hawkins E. Currie I. Davison M. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 377-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 16Marouga R. David S. Hawkins E. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2005; 382: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of proteins per gel were precipitated using a two-dimensional clean-up kit (Bio-Rad) and then dissolved in 20 μl of sample buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 3% CHAPS, and 1% Triton X-100). After addition of 400 pmol of IC3-OSu or IC5-OSu, proteins were incubated at 40 °C for 30 min. The labeling reaction was quenched by incubation with 400 μm lysine for 15 min, followed by addition of an equal volume of the sample buffer with 150 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4% Bio-Lyte 3–10 (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and 0.004% bromphenol blue. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad). The mixed samples were applied to ReadyStrip IPG strips (pH 3–10 NL, 7 cm, Bio-Rad) for separation in the first dimension. The second-dimensional separation was performed by SDS-PAGE using an 8% gel. Fluorescence imaging was performed on a ProxpressTM proteomic imaging system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). IC3-OSu-labeled proteins were detected with 540/25 nm excitation and 590/35 nm emission filters. IC5-OSu-labeled proteins were detected with 625/35 nm excitation and 680/30 nm emission filters. In this study, while proteins from proanthocyanidin- or catechin-coupled Sepharose were labeled with IC5-OSu, a mixture of equal quantities of both samples was labeled with IC3-OSu and used as a reference for quantitation of IC5-OSu-labeled proteins as described (16Marouga R. David S. Hawkins E. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2005; 382: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The fluorescent images were aligned using SameSpot TT900 S2S (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK) and then analyzed with Progenesis Discovery software (Nonlinear Dynamics). Each group (eluate from proanthocyanidin- or catechin-coupled Sepharose) was run on triplicate gels three times. Spot intensity in the IC5-OSu image was normalized to the intensity of the corresponding IC3-OSu image spot in the same gel. The average spot intensities ± standard deviation (S.D.) from nine gels were calculated. Statistical differences were determined by Student’s t test, and p values <0.05 were considered significant. The proteins having high affinity to proanthocyanidin but not to catechin were detected using a 1.5-fold change (p < 0.05) as the cut off. Protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting was performed as described previously (17Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of proteins was separated by two-dimensional-DIGE gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein spots of interest were excised from the gel and digested overnight with trypsin. Each peptide extract was deposited onto a thin layer of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and allowed to adsorb for 5 min, after which the layers were washed twice with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Spectra were obtained using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-TOF-TOF-MS, Autoflex II TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonics) in positive-ion and reflectron mode. The data set was entered in an in-house Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK), to find the closest match with known proteins registered in the data base from the Swiss-Prot. ON-TARGETplus SMARTpools of duplex siRNAs targeting hnRNP L, hnRNP K, hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP A/B, hnRNP Q, eIF3F, eIF3G, eIF3H, and non-targeting control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Tokyo, Japan). Individual sequence of hnRNP A2/B1 siRNAs was confirmed by two single siRNAs (Target #09: 5′-CGGUGGAAAUUUCGGACCA-3′, Target #11: 5′-GGAGAGUAGUUGAGCCAAA-3′). The replicon cells were transfected with each siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 72 h incubation, the cells were assayed. We screened 283 species of local agricultural products for their suppressive activity against the expression of subgenomic HCV RNA using an HCV replicon cell system, and found significant suppressive activity in the leaves of the blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum Aiton), peels of roots of Taro (Colocasia esculenta L.), and hulls of seeds of Japanese plum (Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc). Among them, extracts of blueberry leaves contained the highest total activities. Therefore, we purified a compound from blueberry leaves that inhibited expression of subgenomic HCV RNA in replicon cells. An overall purification scheme is shown in Fig. 1, and a summary of the purification steps is shown in Table 1. From 1000 mg of lyophilized powder from the leaves, 440 mg of methanol extracts was obtained. The IC50 value of the methanol extracts was 5.47 μg/ml. The inhibitory activity was recovered in the CMW-W fraction (284.2 mg), in which the IC50 value was 1.74 μg/ml. The specific activity of CMW-W was 3-fold greater than that of the initial methanol extracts and the yield of the activity exceeded 200%, suggesting that an interfering substance had been removed.TABLE 1Purification of HCV subgenome expression inhibitory activity in blueberry leafTotal weightSubgenome expression, IC50Specific activityPurification factorTotal activityYieldmgμg/ml1/IC50mg/IC50%MeOH extract440.05.470.181.0080.44100Water layer284.21.740.573.14163.33203.05LC 1st140.20.891.126.15157.53195.84LC 2nd24.60.541.8510.1345.5656.63LC 3rd2.90.08711.4962.8733.3341.44 Open table in a new tab The CMW-W fraction was subjected to a subsequent HPLC purification step in which a preliminary HPLC elution pattern (a 15–100% gradient o"
https://openalex.org/W2033042382,"Background Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) has been shown to exert a synergistic antitumor effect when combined with fluoropyrimidine. This synergy may be attributable to the downregulation of thymidylate synthase (TS), which is frequently overexpressed in fluoropyrimidine-resistant cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the downregulation of TS has yet to be clearly elucidated. Methodology and Principal Findings In this study, we demonstrate that lapatinib, a dual TKI of EGFR and HER2 downregulates TS via inhibition of the nuclear translocation of EGFR and HER2. From our cDNA microarray experiments, we determined that a variety of nucleotide synthesis-related genes, including TS, were downregulated with lapatinib, and this was apparent in HER2-amplified cells. Targeted and pharmacologic inhibition assays confirmed that the dual inhibition of EGFR and HER2 is required for the more effective reduction of TS as compared to what was observed with gefitinib or trasutuzumab alone. Additionally, we determined that co-transfected EGFR and HER2 activate the TS gene promoter more profoundly than do either EGFR or HER2 alone. The translocation of EGFR and HER2 into the nucleus and the subsequent activation of the TS promoter were inhibited by lapatinib. Conclusions and Significance These results demonstrate that lapatinib inhibits the nuclear translocation of EGFR and HER2 and downregulates TS, thus sensitizing cancer cells to fluoropyrimidine."
https://openalex.org/W2069597305,"The reversible regulation of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) in response to agonist stimulation and cAMP/cGMP signals plays an important role in the regulation of smooth muscle (SM) tone. Here, we investigated the mechanism underlying the inhibition of MLCP induced by the phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1), a regulatory subunit of MLCP, at Thr-696 and Thr-853 using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-MYPT1 fragments having the inhibitory phosphorylation sites. GST-MYPT1 fragments, including only Thr-696 and only Thr-853, inhibited purified MLCP (IC50 = 1.6 and 60 nm, respectively) when they were phosphorylated with RhoA-dependent kinase (ROCK). The activities of isolated catalytic subunits of type 1 and type 2A phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A) were insensitive to either fragment. Phospho-GST-MYPT1 fragments docked directly at the active site of MLCP, and this was blocked by a PP1/PP2A inhibitor microcystin (MC)-LR or by mutation of the active sites in PP1. GST-MYPT1 fragments induced a contraction of Β-escin-permeabilized ileum SM at constant pCa 6.3 (EC50 = 2 μm), which was eliminated by Ala substitution of the fragment at Thr-696 or by ROCK inhibitors or 8Br-cGMP. GST-MYPT1-(697–880) was 5-times less potent than fragments including Thr-696. Relaxation induced by 8Br-cGMP was not affected by Ala substitution at Ser-695, a known phosphorylation site for protein kinase A/G. Thus, GST-MYPT1 fragments are phosphorylated by ROCK in permeabilized SM and mimic agonist-induced inhibition and cGMP-induced activation of MLCP. We propose a model in which MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr-696 and Thr-853 causes an autoinhibition of MLCP that accounts for Ca2+ sensitization of smooth muscle force.

Somlyo A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1325-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry between force and [Ca2+] varies with different agonists (2Rembold C.M. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), reflecting other signaling pathways that modulate the MLCP or myosin light chain kinase activities (3Bradley A.B.

Agonist activation of G-protein-coupled receptors triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Simultaneously, G-protein-coupled receptor signals are mediated by Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (6Guo Z. Su W. Ma Z. Smith G.M. Gong M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1856-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and initiate kinase signals, such as PKC, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (7Wang Y. Yoshioka K. Azam M.A. Takuwa N. Sakurada S. Kayaba Y. Sugimoto N. Inoki I. Kimura T. Kuwaki T. Takuwa Y. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and ROCK. These lead to inhibition of MLCP activity resulting in an increase in regulatory myosin light chain phosphorylation independent of a change in Ca2+ (Ca2+ sensitization) (for review, see Ref. 1Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1325-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). K+ depolarization can also activate RhoA in a Ca2+-dependent manner (8Sakurada S. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N. Wang Y. Seto M. Sasaki Y. Takuwa Y. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Conversely, Ca2+ desensitization occurs when nitric oxide production and the activation of Gas elevate cGMP and cAMP levels in SM, leading to dis-inhibition and restoration of MLCP activity (9Himpens B.

Thus, MLCP plays a pivotal role in controlling phosphorylation of myosin, in response to physiological stimulation. smooth muscle protein kinase C cAMP-dependent kinase Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinase myosin light chain phosphatase myosin phosphatase targeting subunit cGMP-dependent kinase protein phosphatase 1 delta isoform of PP1 protein phosphatase 2A PKC-activated PP1 inhibitor, Mr = 17 glutathione S-transferase thiophospho calcineurin 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid hemagglutinin adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). MLCP is a trimeric holoenzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) δ isoform and a regulatory complex of MYPT1 and an accessory M21 subunit (16Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37211-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A PP1 binding site, KVKF38, is located at the N terminus of MYPT1 followed by an ankyrin-repeat domain. This N-terminal domain forms a part of the active site together with the catalytic subunit and controls the substrate specificity via allosteric interaction and targeting to loci (17Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of MYPT1 directly binds to substrates such as myosin and ezrin/radixin/moecin proteins as well as, under some conditions, the plasma membrane, tethering the catalytic subunit to multiple targets (18Velasco G. Armstrong C. Morrice N. Frame S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 19Fukata Y. Kimura K. Oshiro N. Saya H. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MYPT1 is involved in the regulation of MLCP activity. Alternative splicing of MYPT1 occurs in SM depending on the tissue and the developmental stage (20Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An exon 13 splicing of MYPT1 is involved in Ca2+ sensitization that occurs in response to GTP (21Richards C.T. Ogut O. Brozovich F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4422-4427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas a splice variant of MYPT1, containing the C-terminal Leu-zipper sequence, correlates with cGMP-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle (22Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Direct binding of PKG to MYPT1 at the Leu-zipper domain and/or Arg/Lys-rich domain is involved in the activation of MLCP (23Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M.

In addition, a myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein (M-RIP) is directly associated with the MYPT1 C-terminal domain, proposed to recruit RhoA to the MLCP complex (26Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region also binds to ZIP kinase, which phosphorylates MYPT1 at Thr-696 4Residue numbering of MYPT1 is based on the amino acid sequence deduced from the longest splice variant of human MYPT1. (27Wooldridge A.A. MacDonald J.A. Erdodi F. Ma C. Borman M.A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34496-34504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, the C-terminal domain of MYPT1 functions as a scaffold for multiple phosphatase regulatory proteins.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), yet the molecular mechanism(s) of MYPT1 inhibitory phosphorylation is poorly understood. Receptor activation induces biphasic contraction of SM, reflecting a sequential activation of PKC and ROCK. Phosphorylation of CPI-17 occurs first in parallel with Ca2+ release and the activation of a conventional PKC that causes Ca2+-dependent Ca2+ sensitization (35Dimopoulos G.J. Semba S. Kitazawa K. Eto M. Kitazawa T. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A delayed activation of ROCK increases the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-853. These phosphorylation events maintain the sustained phase of contraction after the fall in [Ca2+]i (35Dimopoulos G.J. Semba S. Kitazawa K. Eto M. Kitazawa T. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-853 is elevated in response to various agonists (35Dimopoulos G.J. Semba S. Kitazawa K. Eto M. Kitazawa T. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 36Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Khalequzzaman M. J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Unlike the Thr-853 site, phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696 is often spontaneously phosphorylated under resting conditions and insensitive to stimuli with most agonists (36Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Khalequzzaman M. J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, up-regulation of MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr-696 is reported in some types of hypertensive animals and patients, suggesting an importance of the site under pathological conditions (37Seko T. Ito M. Kureishi Y. Okamoto R. Moriki N. Onishi K. Isaka N. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 38Hilgers R.H. Todd Jr., J. Webb R.C. J.

Pharmacol. 2005; 146: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CPI-17 and MYPT1 at Thr-696 is reversed in response to nitric oxide production and cGMP elevation, which parallels relaxation (14Etter E.F. Eto M. Wardle R.L. Brautigan D.L. Murphy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34681-34685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Bonnevier J. Arner A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28998-29003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Upon cGMP elevation, MYPT1 at Ser-695 is phosphorylated, and the Ser phosphorylation blocks the adjacent phosphorylation at Thr-696, causing dis-inhibition of MLCP (27Wooldridge A.A. MacDonald J.A. Erdodi F. Ma C. Borman M.A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34496-34504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 40Nakamura K. Koga Y. Sakai H. Homma K. Ikebe M. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 712-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, Ser-695 phosphorylation does not cause the dephosphorylation at Thr-696 in intact cerebral artery (41Neppl R.L. Lubomirov L.T. Momotani K. Pfitzer G. Eto M. Somlyo A.V. J. Biol. Chem.284. 2009; : 6348-6360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of MYPT1 governs Ca2+ sensitization and desensitization of SM, although the underlying mechanisms are still controversial. In addition, telokin, a dominant protein in visceral and phasic vascular SM tissues, is phosphorylated by PKG and PKA, activating MLCP by an unknown mechanism and inducing SM relaxation (42Choudhury N. Khromov A.S. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 2004; 25: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Multiple mechanisms have been suggested for the phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of MLCP. Thiophosphorylation of MYPT1 results in lower Vm and higher Km values of MLCP activity, suggesting that allosteric modulation of the active site is necessary for the thiophosphorylation-dependent inhibition of MLCP (43Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). On the other hand, translocation of MYPT1 to the plasma membrane region occurs in parallel with the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696 (44Shin H.M. Je H.D. Gallant C. Tao T.C. Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Morgan K.G. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 45Bolz S.S. Vogel L. Sollinger D. Derwand R. de Wit C. Loirand G. Pohl U. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3081-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), but the amount translocated and the functional meaning remain controversial (41Neppl R.L. Lubomirov L.T. Momotani K. Pfitzer G. Eto M. Somlyo A.V. J. Biol. Chem.284. 2009; : 6348-6360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-853 in vitro reduces its affinity for phospho-myosin, thus suppressing the phosphatase activity (18Velasco G. Armstrong C. Morrice N. Frame S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that reconstitution of thiophosphorylated MYPT1 at Thr-696 or Thr-853 with isolated PP1δ produces a less-active form of MLCP complex (46Murányi A. Derkach D. Erdodi F. Kiss A. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6611-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This supports the kinetic analysis (43Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) that suggests an allosteric effect of MYPT1 phosphorylation on the phosphatase activity. In contrast, a thiophosphopeptide mimicking the phosphorylation site of MBS85, a homolog of MYPT1 and not present in SM, inhibits the activity of MBS85·PP1 complex, suggesting the direct interaction between the MBS85 site and PP1 (47Tan I. Ng C.H. Lim L. Leung T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21209-21216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure model of MYPT1-(1–229). PP1δ complex, the electrostatic potential map at the MLCP active site complements amino acid profiles around the phosphorylation sites (17Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the inhibitory phosphorylation sites directly dock at the active site of MLCP and inhibit the activity. Here, we examine mechanisms underlying the inhibition of MLCP through the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696 and Thr-853 using GST fusion versions of various MYPT1 fragments including or excluding either or both of these phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylated MYPT1 fragments including either Thr-696 or Thr-853 potently and specifically inhibit MLCP purified from pig aorta and the enzyme associated with myofilaments in permeabilized ileum SM tissues. We further show that inhibition of MLCP in SM tissues is eliminated by activation of PKA/PKG, suggesting that the GST-MYPT1 fragments mimic agonist-induced autoinhibition and cAMP/cGMP-dependent dis-autoinhibition of MLCP in SM. Human MYPT1 cDNA was cloned from a HeLa cell cDNA library. Various parts of MYPT1 cDNA fragments were generated using PCR with a pair of mismatched primers with BamHI and EcoRI sites. The PCR product was cloned at the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX4T-2 (GE Healthcare). Recombinant GST-MYPT1 fragments were induced for 24 h at 23 °C with 0.1 mm isopropyl-Β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside in Escherichia coli Rosetta2TM(DE3)pLysS strain transformed with the pGEX vector and purified from lysozyme-treated bacterial lysates by GSH-HiTrap affinity chromatography using AKTA Purifier chromatography system. After the elution with 10 mm glutathione, the protein solution was dialyzed against 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, supplemented with 0.8 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (PefablocTM) and 0.5 mm Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine and stored in −80 °C. Phosphorylation of GST-MYPT1 proteins (10 μm) was performed for 1 h at 30 °C with recombinant human ROCK-II (Millipore #14-338) (1.25 μg/ml) or PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma) in the presence of 25 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, plus 1 mm ATP, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mm Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine, 0.4 mm PefablocTM, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Thiophosphorylation was carried out using 1 mm ATPγS instead of ATP. The reaction mixture was subjected to buffer exchange to 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, using a Protein Desalting Spin Column (Pierce) before the phosphatase assay. MLCP was prepared from pig aorta homogenate, as described previously (48Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Monomeric PP1 subunit was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (49Martin B.L. Shriner C. Brautigan D.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Human red cell PP2A was a generously gift from Prof. Brautigan (University of Virginia). Okadaic acid, microcystin-LR, Y27632, H1152, and 8Br-cGMP were obtained from Biomol. Anti-MYPT1 and anti- PP1δ was obtained from Millipore. Anti-HA (12CA5 clone) was obtained from the monoclonal facility at University of Virginia. HEK293 and A7r5 cells were purchased from ATCC and harvested in Dulbecco’s modified medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (CellGro). Phosphatase activity was measured as described previously (50Eto M. Leach C. Tountas N.A. Brautigan D.L. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 366: 243-260PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-labeled chicken gizzard myosin regulatory light chain (0.5 μm) was added to the reaction mixture of phosphatase and inhibitors to initiate the dephosphorylation. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the radioactivity of released 32Pi was counted using Beckman LS-6500 scintillation counter. The phosphatase activities without enzyme and with phosphatase minus inhibitor were set as 0 and 100%, respectively. Mean value was obtained from duplicate assay. IC50 ± error value was calculated by a nonlinear regression curve-fitting program using an equation: activity (%) = 100 − (100 × [inhibitor]/(IC50 + [inhibitor])). A GST pulldown assay was performed using GST-MYPT1 fragment as a ligand. A7r5 rat aortic smooth muscle cells in a 10-cm dish were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, with 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm Tris[2-carboxyethyl] phosphine, 0.8 mm Pefabloc, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell lysates were split into four portions, with 1 μm microcystin LR added to two of them. Each solution was mixed with 20 μl of GSH-agarose slurry and 10 μg of GST-MYPT1 proteins and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation and then washed with the lysis buffer 3 times. Proteins bound to the ligands were analyzed by immunoblotting. For HA-tagged PP1, HEK293 cells in a 6-cm dish were transiently transfected for 24 h with mammalian expression vector of HA-PP1δ (1 μg) plus Myc-MYPT1 (1 μg) using FuGene6TM transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The cells expressing the recombinant MLCP complex were used for a GST pulldown assay (51Matsuzawa F. Aikawa S.I. Ohki S.Y. Eto M. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (50Eto M. Leach C. Tountas N.A. Brautigan D.L. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 366: 243-260PubMed Google Scholar). The ECL signal was detected using a Fluorochem CCD camera imaging system and quantified using the attached software, AlphaEaseFC (Alpha-Inotech). Force measurements were performed as described previously (42Choudhury N. Khromov A.S. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell.

New Zealand White male rabbits were euthanized with halothane inhalation according to the animal protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Virginia. Small strips (250 μm × 2 mm) were cut from the longitudinal smooth muscle layer of the ileum in Hepes-buffered saline (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, with 0.15 m NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mmd-glucose). Muscle strips were tied with monofilament silk and mounted between a tungsten needle attached to a SensoNor AE801 force transducer and a stationary hook in a 400-μl bubble chamber with a stirring bar as reported previously (42Choudhury N. Khromov A.S. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 2004; 25: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Before the assay, each strip was stimulated with 154 mm K+ to assess viability. Procedures were done at room temperature (22–24 °C). Muscle strips were permeabilized for 20 min with 75 μm Β-escin in the cytoplasmic buffer (30 mm PIPES buffer, pH 7.1, with 74.1 mm potassium methanesulfonate, 3.3 mm magnesium methanesulfonate, 4.5 mm MgATP, and 10 mm creatine phosphate supplemented with 1 mm EGTA (pCa > 8) (42Choudhury N.

Chem. 1989; 264: 5339-5342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After permeabilization, intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted by addition of 10 μm A23187 for 10 min. Muscles were partially contracted with pCa6.3 buffer (the cytoplasmic buffer plus 6.5 mm Ca2+ and 10 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 μm chicken gizzard calmodulin that evokes ∼15% of the maximum contraction induced with pCa 4.5 buffer (the cytoplasmic buffer plus 10 mm Ca2+ and 10 mm EGTA). GST-MYPT1 fragments were intensively dialyzed against pCa6.3 buffer and concentrated using a Centricon tube, saving the filtrate as a control for contaminant Ca2+. GST-MYPT1 fragments or the “filtrate” controls were added to the bath, and the contraction was recorded. The mean value with the standard error (S.E.) was obtained from 3–5 independent experiments for each condition. Student’s t test was performed using Microsoft Excel to test for significance. Murányi et al. (46Murányi A. Derkach D. Erdodi F. Kiss A. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6611-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) report that thiophosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696 or Thr-853 suppresses the PP1 catalytic subunit upon reconstitution. We tested whether phosphorylation of MYPT1 induces an allosteric effect to suppress the activity or converts the region into autoinhibitory domains. We avoided the stable thiophosphorylation and prepared orthophosphorylated GST-tagged MYPT1 fragments (Fig. 1A) and asked whether the MYPT1 segment, including the phosphorylation sites, directly inhibits the activity of purified MLCP complex. The amino acid sequence around Thr-696, indicated by a black box in Fig. 1A, is conserved among the MYPT1 family, such as MYPT2 and MBS85. The sequence around Thr-853 is unique to MYPT1. There is charge complementarity around Thr-853 similar to the Thr-696 site and, interestingly, also around Ser-19 of regulatory myosin light chain 20 (RLC20) (17Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Phosphatase assays were performed using the MLCP purified from pig aorta, consisting of PP1δ and the N-terminal 68-kDa fragment of MYPT1 (48Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Unphosphorylated GST-MYPT1-(654–880) inhibits the pig aorta MLCP with an apparent IC50 of 1.4 ± 0.2 μm (Fig. 1B, open circles). Phosphorylation of GST-MYPT1-(654–880) with recombinant ROCK (closed circles) increased the inhibitory potency about 1000-fold (IC50 = 1.1 ± 0.2 nm). In contrast, PKA phosphorylation of GST-MYPT1-(654–880:T696A) protein at Ser-695 yielded no increase in the potency (Fig. 1B, closed diamond), indicating that the phosphorylation at adjacent Ser-695 is not inhibitory. GST-alone incubated with ROCK (broken line) did not suppress the phosphatase activity. Importantly, the thiophospho form of GST-MYPT1-(654–880) was no more potent than the orthophospho form, indicating that MLCP is incapable of dephosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696 and Thr-853 (data not shown). A shorter fragment including Thr-696 but lacking Thr-853, GST-MYPT1-(654–714) (Fig. 1B, closed and open triangles) was as effective as GST-MYPT1-(654–880) in inhibiting MLCP activity. Therefore, the phosphorylation of Thr-696 is sufficient to produce maximum potency for the inhibition of GST-MYPT1-(654–880). Asp-substitution at Thr-696, yielding GST-MYPT1-(654–880:T696D), did not enhance the inhibitory potency (Fig. 1B, open crosses). In addition to the phosphorylation at Thr-696, the phosphorylation of GST-MYPT1-(697–880) at Thr-853 also enhanced the inhibitory potency to the purified MLCP, 100-fold (IC50 = 60 ± 10 nm (phosphorylate"
https://openalex.org/W1996044283,"It has been previously proposed that nitric oxide (NO) is the only biologically relevant nitrogen oxide capable of activating the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). However, recent reports implicate HNO as another possible activator of sGC. Herein, we examine the affect of HNO donors on the activity of purified bovine lung sGC and find that, indeed, HNO is capable of activating this enzyme. Like NO, HNO activation appears to occur via interaction with the regulatory ferrous heme on sGC. Somewhat unexpectedly, HNO does not activate the ferric form of the enzyme. Finally, HNO-mediated cysteine thiol modification appears to also affect enzyme activity leading to inhibition. Thus, sGC activity can be regulated by HNO via interactions at both the regulatory heme and cysteine thiols."
https://openalex.org/W2040239818,"The clearance of debris after injuries to the nervous system is a critical step for restoration of the injured neural network. Microglia are thought to be involved in elimination of degenerating neurons and axons in the central nervous system (CNS), presumably restoring a favorable environment after CNS injuries. However, the mechanism underlying debris clearance remains elusive. Here, we establish an in vitro assay system to estimate phagocytosis of axon debris. We employed a Wallerian degeneration model by cutting axons of the cortical explants. The cortical explants were co-cultured with primary microglia or the MG5 microglial cell line. The cortical neurites were then transected. MG5 cells efficiently phagocytosed the debris, whereas primary microglia showed phagocytic activity only when they were activated by lipopolysaccharide or interferon-Β. When MG5 cells or primary microglia were co-cultured with degenerated axons, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was activated in these cells. Engulfment of axon debris was blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, indicating that p38 MAPK is required for phagocytic activity. Receptors that recognize dying cells appeared not to be involved in the process of phagocytosis of the axon debris. In addition, the axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration did not release lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting that degeneration of the severed axons and apoptosis may represent two distinct self-destruction programs. We observed regrowth of the severed neurites after axon debris was removed. This finding suggests that axon debris, in addition to myelin debris, is an inhibitory factor for axon regeneration.

Axon degeneration is an active, tightly controlled, and versatile process of axon segment self-destruction. The lesion-induced degeneration process was first described by Waller (1Waller A. Phil. Trans. R Soc. Lond. 1850; 140: 423-429Crossref Google Scholar) and has since been known as Wallerian degeneration (2Raff M.C. Whitmore A.V. Finn J.T.

This degeneration involves rapid blebbing and fragmentation of an entire axonal stretch into short segments, which are then removed by locally activated phagocytic cells. Phagocytic removal of damaged axons and their myelin sheaths distal to the injury is important for creating a favorable environment for axonal regeneration in the nervous system. Although the debris of degenerated axons and myelin is cleared by phagocytes in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), the debris is removed very slowly in the central nervous system (CNS) 3The abbreviations used are: CNScentral nervous systemMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseDMEMDulbecco’s modified Eagle’s mediumLDHlactate dehydrogenaseIFN-Βinterferon-Β.

This is considered to be one of the obstacles for regeneration of the injured axons in the CNS. central nervous system mitogen-activated protein kinase Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium lactate dehydrogenase interferon-Β. Apoptotic neurons are also engulfed by activated phagocytic cells. Apoptosis is very well documented in the CNS where a significant proportion of neurons undergo programmed cell death (6Kuan C.Y. Roth K.A. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 291-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To prevent the diffusion of damaging degradation products into surrounding tissues, dying neurons are phagocytosed. In the brain, apoptotic cells are engulfed mainly by the resident population of phagocytes known as microglia. Microglia are generally considered to be immune cells of the CNS (7Hanisch U.K. Kettenmann H. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (2758) Google Scholar). They respond to any kind of pathology with a reaction termed “microglial activation.” After injuries to the CNS, microglia react within a few hours with a migratory response toward the lesion site. Although insight into the mechanism of phagocytosis of dying cells by microglia has improved, little is known about the mechanism of clearance of degenerated axons and myelin debris by microglia after axonal injury in the CNS. Interestingly, the axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration do not seem to possess detectable activation of the caspase family (8Finn J.T. Weil M. Archer F. Siman R. Srinivasan A. Raff M.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1333-1341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Wallerian degeneration and apoptosis may represent two distinct self-destruction programs. Thus, the mechanism of microglial phagocytosis of dying cells might be different from that of axon/myelin debris. We aimed to elucidate the mechanism of debris clearance by microglia after an axonal injury. We established an in vitro assay system to estimate phagocytosis of degenerated axon debris. We found that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was critical for the phagocytic activity of microglia. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon-Β (IFN-Β) was necessary for the primary microglia to become phagocytic. In addition, clearance of degenerated axon debris allowed axonal growth from the severed neurites, suggesting that removal of the axon debris provides a favorable environment for axonal regeneration. Because the number of primary microglia that can be cultured from neonatal mice is limited, two cell culture lines were used. The MG5 microglial cell line derived from p53-deficient mice was cultured in A1-cell conditioned medium (9Ohsawa K. Imai Y. Nakajima K. Kohsaka S. Glia. 1997; 21: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary cultures of microglial cells were obtained from Wistar rats on postnatal day 1 (P1). Briefly, the rat cerebral cortex was digested with 0.25% trypsin and 70 units DNase for 15 min. Cells were passed through a 70-μm nylon mesh. The resultant cell suspension was diluted with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and seeded into poly-l-lysine-coated several dishes. Microglial cells from the astrocyte-monolayer sheet were removed by shaking. Briefly, the conditioned medium was collected into the centrifuge tube. The medium-removed dishes were shaken for several times. Then, the medium was gently poured into the dishes and recollected. For cortical explant cultures, the cortex was removed from E14-E16 (C57BL/6J mouse) or E18-E20 (Wistar rat) according to previously reported methods, with a slight modification (10Yamagishi S. Fujitani M. Hata K. Kitajo K. Mimura F. Abe H. Yamashita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20384-20388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cortex was chopped into 300–600-μm-sized pieces using tungsten needles. The chopped cortex pieces were then placed in a 3.5-cm tissue culture dish containing 1 ml of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 6 days of incubation at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator, the medium was exchanged to DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Primary microglia (4 × 105 cells) or MG5 cells (2 × 105 cells) were co-cultured. The extended neurites from the explant cortex culture were transected using a blade. The concentrations of reagents used in this study were as follows: 1 μg/ml LPS (Sigma-Aldrich), 300 units/ml IFN-Β (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 μm SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich), 100 μm kainic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μm MRS2578 (P2Y6 receptor antagonist; Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5 μm staurosporine (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The cells were pretreated with each inhibitor for 30 min before axotomy. The cortical explants and MG5 cells were co-cultured in a poly-l-lysine-coated dish for 12 h, and the neurites were then transected. The culture dish was then transferred to a heated stage apparatus (model MI-IBC-IF, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Time-lapse images were acquired every 8 min for 36 h with an Olympus IX81 microscope using a 10× objective lens. Images were combined into a time-lapsed sequence by using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Fluorescent immunostaining was performed at the end of the culture time. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-Β-tubulin III (Tuj-1) antibody (diluted 1:1000 in the blocking solution; Covance, Princeton, NJ), anti-ED1 (CD68) antibody (diluted 1:100 in the blocking solution; AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC), anti-GAP43 antibody (diluted 1:1000 in the blocking solution; Chemicon/Millipore, Temecula, CA), and anti-phospho-p38 antibody (diluted 1:100 in the blocking solution; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) was used as the secondary antibody. Cells were lysed with 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The homogenate was centrifuged at 17,400 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was stored at −20 °C. The protein concentration was measured using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were loaded into each lane, run on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were probed with anti-phospho-MEK1/2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-MEK1/2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase, (JNK, 1:5000; Promega, Madison, WI), anti-JNK (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-p38 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-p38 (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoblot analysis was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The media of the explant cultures were collected and assayed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, LDH catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate upon reduction of NAD+ to NADH/H+; the added tetrazolium salt is reduced to formazan. The amount of formazan formed correlates with LDH activity. The formazan product was measured with a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 490 nm. Total RNA was extracted from the cells or spleen/brain with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase using a random primer to prime MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Specific DNAs were mixed and amplified with 0.2 μm of each primer and cDNA. PCR primers used in this study were as follows: Tim-4 sense primer, 5′-GGCTCCTTCTCACAAGAAACCACA-3′; Tim-4 antisense primer, 5′-TCAGCTGTGAAGTGGATGGGAGA-3′; Β-actin sense primer, 5′-TGTATGCCTCTGGTCGTACC-3′; and Β-actin antisense primer, 5′-CAACGTCACACTTCATGATGG-3′. The PCR cycling conditions for Tim-4 were 5 min at 96 °C; multiple cycles of 30 s at 96 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C; 32 cycles. For Β-actin, the PCR-cycling conditions were 5 min at 96 °C; multiple cycles of 30 s at 96 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C; 21 cycles. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized using ethidium bromide. The significant difference in data in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 was calculated by Student’s t test. Other data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance, and differences between treatment means were determined by the Tukey-Kramer method.FIGURE 2Phagocytic microglia became highly motile and hypertrophic.

We employed the explant culture of the cerebral cortex from E14-E16 mice. At 6 days after explant culture, when numerous neurites were observed (Fig. 1A), we performed transection of the neurites by using a blade (Fig. 1B). The severed distal neurites began to develop signs of early degeneration, such as focal swelling and beading, ∼8 h after the axons had been separated from their cell bodies, namely, Wallerian degeneration (Fig. 1C). When the MG5 murine microglial cell line was co-cultured, the degenerated axon debris was partly cleared by the MG5 cells, whereas proximal neurites remained intact (Fig. 1D). To assess whether MG5 cells engulfed degenerating neurites, we immunostained the neurons and MG5 cells by anti-Tuj1 (green) and anti-ED1 (red) antibodies, respectively. The result demonstrated that these signals co-localized 36 h after axotomy (Fig. 1E). Thus, degenerated axon debris was cleared by phagocytosis by MG5 cells. Severed neurites became fragmented debris, consisting of microtubules and neurofilaments. We quantified the number of fragmented neurites by counting the Tuj1-positive particles. Quantitative analysis revealed that the residual axon debris was significantly reduced 36 h after transection if MG5 cells were co-cultured (reduced to 25.1% ± 7.4% of control) (Fig. 1F). To directly study the dynamic movement of MG5 cells during phagocytosis, we performed time-lapse analysis. The results shown in Fig. 1G and supplemental Movie S1 were based on time-lapse observations taken up to 36 h after transection. Live imaging showed that MG5 cells started to clear debris at ∼15 h and became highly motile afterward (supplemental Movie 1). Notably, engulfment was specific to the distal part of the severed neurites but not to the proximal part or to the cell bodies (Fig. 2, A–C). We then traced motile MG5 cells in the proximal (including cell bodies and proximal neurites) and distal (including transected distal neurites) regions from the transected site for up to 32 h and measured the distance of the movement in the two-dimensional field at 0–2, 10–12, 20–22, and 30–32 h (Fig. 2D). MG5 cells showed high motility, specifically in the distal region at 10–12 and 20–22 h, although little migration was observed in the proximal region during the observation period. We performed quantitative analysis of the microglial motility. MG5 cells became highly motile in the distal region (47.5 ± 12.6 μm/h) compared with the proximal region (13.3 ± 2.8 μm/h) (Fig. 2E). In addition, the cell bodies of some, but not all, MG5 cells in the distal region became hypertrophic in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2F). These observations in vitro resembled those in vivo after injury to the nervous system. Thus, our in vitro assay system is a useful tool to analyze the mechanism of debris clearance by microglial cells. We examined whether engulfment of degenerating axons was observed in primary cultures of microglia. Because primary microglial cells used in this study were obtained from Wistar rats on postnatal day 1 (P1), we employed the explant culture of the cerebral cortex from E18-E20 rats (6 days of incubation) (Fig. 3, A and B). Unlike MG5 cells, clearance of the debris was not efficient in primary microglia from rats (Fig. 3, A and B). Only 26% of the fragmented neurites were engulfed at 144 h after axotomy (compared with 74.9% by MG5 cells). This result suggests that neurite debris was not sufficient for induction of phagocytic activity from primary microglia. To assess whether activation of microglia was necessary for engulfment of debris, primary microglia were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS before axotomy. Clearance of the degenerated neurites by the primary microglia was strongly up-regulated by LPS at 96 h (reduced to 50.0% ± 4.2% of unstimulated control microglia) and 144 h (reduced to 8.1% ± 2.4% of unstimulated control microglia). It has been reported that IFN-Β enhances the ability of microglia to phagocytose apoptotic T cells, thereby resulting in a suppression of the immune response (11Chan A. Seguin R. Magnus T. Papadimitriou C. Toyka K.V. Antel J.P. Gold R. Glia. 2003; 43: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, we treated the primary microglia with 300 units/ml IFN-Β. Clearance of the degenerated neurites by the primary microglia was also significantly up-regulated, but to a lesser extent than that with the LPS treatment, at 96 h (reduced to 55.7% ± 4.8% of control) and 144 h (reduced to 51.8% ± 2.5% of control). This quantitative analysis showed that a certain amount of time was required for primary microglia to acquire ability for engulfment (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that primary microglia are in a resting state in vitro and that LPS or IFN-Β is required for the acquisition of phagocytic capability. However, it should be noted that activation of primary microglia by LPS or IFN-Β is not sufficient for phagocytosis, as these activated microglia did not phagocytose the proximal axons or cell bodies (data not shown). Thus, microglia may need to recognize some signals on the degenerated axons to become phagocytic. Next, we examined whether clearance of degenerated neurites was necessary for axonal growth from the severed neurites. The cortical explants were cultured for up to 96 h after transection in the presence or absence of MG5 cells, and fluorescent immunostaining was then performed using anti-Tuj1 and anti-ED1 antibodies. We found that numerous extended axons were observed distal to the transected site when degenerated debris was cleared by MG5 cells (Fig. 4, C and D). In contrast, no fibers could be seen beyond the site of transection if the debris was not cleared in the absence of MG5 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistent results were obtained in the presence of primary microglia (Fig. 4, E and F). In this experiment, the cortical explants were cultured for up to 10 days after transection in the presence of primary microglia and LPS, as a certain amount of time was required for primary microglia to acquire the engulfment ability. The above result raised the possibility that axon debris is an inhibitory factor for axon regeneration. Thus, we removed the distal neurites after transection with a scraper (Fig. 4G). Growth of the fibers beyond the transected site was observed in a few hours (data not shown). Seventy-two hours after removal of the debris, numerous fibers grew into the distal region from the transected site (Fig. 4, H and I). Regenerating axons express growth-associated phosphoprotein (GAP)43, which is widely used to specifically label injured neurons and to estimate axonal regeneration (12Goslin K. Schreyer D.J. Skene J.H. Banker G. Nature. 1988; 336: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We found that GAP43 was expressed at the growth cone of the regenerating axons (Fig. 4, J–L). Therefore, regrowth of the severed axons occurred if degenerated distal neurites were cleared. These data suggest that degenerated axon debris is a potent inhibitor of axon regeneration and that removal of the axon debris may provide a favorable environment for axonal regeneration after axonal injuries. We further examined whether microglia may have a role in enhancing axonal regeneration. After the axon debris was physically removed with a scraper, we added microglia in the presence or absence of LPS. Thirty-six hours after removal of the debris, neurite outgrowth from the transected site was increased in the presence of microglia and LPS (504.8 ± 22.8 μm) compared with the control (325.1 ± 24.3 μm) (Fig. 5). In the presence of microglia without LPS, no significant increase in the neurite growth was observed (402.1 ± 25.8 μm) compared with the control (Fig. 5). These results suggest that activated microglia contribute to enhancing axonal regeneration. Next, we attempted to explore the signaling pathways that regulate phagocytic activity of microglia. Previous reports have demonstrated that MAPK cascades are involved in microglial activation, which regulates cytokine production (13Bhat N.R. Zhang P. Lee J.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contributes to the generation of neuropathic pain (14Tsuda M. Mizokoshi A. Shigemoto-Mogami Y. Koizumi S. Inoue K. Glia. 2004; 45: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). To investigate whether MAPKs are activated in phagocytic microglia, the phosphorylation levels of MEK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK were estimated by Western blot analysis using antibodies against the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated proteins. The cortical explants and MG5 cells were co-cultured for 12 h, and the neurites were then transected. Degenerating axons (without proximal axons) and MG5 cells from 0–48 h after the transection were subjected to Western blot analysis. The phosphorylation level of MEK1/2 was unchanged during the observation period, whereas that of JNK was down-regulated at 12 h and thereafter (Fig. 6, A and B). However, the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK in MG5 cells was up-regulated as early as 12 h, and this up-regulation persisted for 24 h (Fig. 6, A and B). We next examined whether activation of p38 MAPK was required for engulfment of debris. A specific pharmacological p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, was employed to address this question. We found that the p38 MAPK inhibitor significantly blocked engulfment of degenerating neurites by MG5 cells (reduced to 74.0% ± 3.7% of control) (Fig. 6, C–F). We further examined whether the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was observed in microglia or in degenerated axons. We performed immunostaining by using antibodies against the phospho-p38 MAPK and Tuj1 or ED1 14 h after transection. Although immunoreactivity for Tuj1 did not colocalize with that for phospho-p38 MAPK, ED-1-positive MG5 cells were positive for phospho-p38 MAPK (Fig. 6G). These results demonstrated that activation of p38 MAPK was observed in MG5 cells, but not in degenerated axons. Consistent with this result, we could not detect the band for phospho-p38 MAPK in the absence of MG5 cells by Western blot (Fig. 6H). We next measured the phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK by Western blot analysis in primary microglia. The phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK was increased 24 h after transection of axons (Fig. 6, I and J). As mentioned above, primary microglia are in a resting state in vitro, and LPS is required for the activation of primary microglia. Therefore, the above results raised the possibility that phosphorylation of p38 MAPK is induced by LPS. To exclude this possibility, LPS-induced phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK was estimated up to 96 h in primary microglia. As shown in Fig. 6K, LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was detected transiently only at 0.5 h after the addition of LPS, but not at 24 h. These results exclude the possibility that LPS directly activated p38 MAPK during phagocytosis of axon debris in primary microglia. In a separate series of experiments, the effect of SB203580 on engulfment of degenerating neurites by LPS-stimulated primary microglia was assessed. LPS-stimulated primary microglia engulfed degenerating axons (reduced to 28.0% ± 4.5% of control), which were partially but significantly blocked by SB203580 (reduced to 53.3% ± 8.1% of control) (Fig. 6, L–O). Taken together, these data demonstrated that activation of p38 MAPK was required for engulfment of degenerating axons by primary microglia and MG5 cells. Because clearance of the proximal neurites from the transected site was not observed, our results demonstrated that activated primary microglia as well as MG5 cells recognized specifically degenerated debris. Thus, we assumed that the binding of some ligand(s) on the debris to some receptor(s) on the microglia initiated the phagocytic process. We hypothesized that receptors recognizing apoptotic cellular material such as phosphatidylserine (15Miyanishi M. Tada K. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kitamura T. Nagata S. Nature. 2007; 450: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 16Park D. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Elliott M.R. Lu M. Haney L.B. Ma Z. Klibanov A.L. Mandell J.W. Ravichandran K.S. Nature. 2007; 450: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) might be involved in this process. These receptors include T-cell immunoglobulin-and mucin-domain-containing molecule-4 (Tim-4) and brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1). It has been reported that the expression level of Tim-4 in the brain is very weak compared with that in the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and salivary glands (15Miyanishi M. Tada K. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kitamura T. Nagata S. Nature. 2007; 450: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). In the present study, we obtained results that were consistent with these findings (Fig. 7A, left). Next, we examined the Tim-4 mRNA expression in MG5 cells before and after axotomy. As shown in Fig. 7A, the expression level of Tim-4 mRNA in MG5 cells was very low in the control state and was not changed after transection of the neurites (Fig. 7A, right). The next hypothesis we tested was that the microglial receptor could function as a sensor for phagocytosis by sensing diffusible factors. It has been reported that the microglial metabotropic P2Y6 receptor recognizes the nucleotide UDP released from kainic acid (KA)-treated dying neurons and stimulates microglial phagocytosis (17Koizumi S. Shigemoto-Mogami Y. Nasu-Tada K. Shinozaki Y. Ohsawa K. Tsuda M. Joshi B.V. Jacobson K.A. Kohsaka S. Inoue K. Nature. 2007; 446: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). We examined whether the microglial P2Y6 receptor contributed to engulfment of degenerating axons. As shown in Fig. 7, B–E, MG5 cells engulfed degenerating axons (reduced to 37.6% ± 4.8% of control) that were not blocked by the P2Y6 receptor antagonist MRS2578 (10 μm) (reduced to 43.8% ± 3.7% of control). However, MG5 cells engulfed staurosporine-induced apoptotic neurons, which were partially blocked by MRS2578 (Fig. 7, F–H and J). These results exclude the possibility that the P2Y6 receptor is necessary for microglial cells to be phagocytic of degenerated axons after transection. We also found that the p38 MAPK inhibitor significantly blocked engulfment of dead neurons by MG5 cells (Fig. 7, I and J). Interestingly, the axons undergoing Wallerian degeneration did not seem to posse"
https://openalex.org/W2103498164,"Heat shock protein 25/27 (Hsp25/27) is a cytoprotective protein that is ubiquitously expressed in most cells, and is up-regulated in response to cellular stress. Previous work, in nonmuscle cells, has shown that Hsp27 inhibits TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation. During skeletal muscle disuse, Hsp25/27 levels are decreased and NF-kappaB activity increased, and this increase in NF-kappaB activity is required for disuse muscle atrophy. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to determine whether electrotransfer of Hsp27 into the soleus muscle of rats, prior to skeletal muscle disuse, is sufficient to inhibit skeletal muscle disuse atrophy and NF-kappaB activation. The 35% disuse muscle-fiber atrophy observed in nontransfected fibers was attenuated by 50% in fibers transfected with Hsp27. Hsp27 also inhibited the disuse-induced increase in MuRF1 and atrogin-1 transcription by 82 and 40%, respectively. Furthermore, disuse- and IKKbeta-induced NF-kappaB transactivation were abolished by Hsp27. In contrast, Hsp27 had no effect on Foxo transactivation. In conclusion, Hsp27 is a negative regulator of NF-kappaB in skeletal muscle, in vivo, and is sufficient to inhibit MuRF1 and atrogin-1 and attenuate skeletal muscle disuse atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2010663570,"During inflammation, circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) receive signals to cross the endothelial barrier and migrate through the extracellular matrix (ECM) to reach the injured site. Migration requires complex and poorly understood interactions of chemokines, chemokine receptors, ECM molecules, integrins, and other receptors. Here we show that the ECM protein lumican regulates PMN migration through interactions with specific integrin receptors. Lumican-deficient (Lum(-/-)) mice manifest connective tissue defects, impaired innate immune response, and poor wound healing with reduced PMN infiltration. Lum(-/-) PMNs exhibit poor chemotactic migration that is restored with exogenous recombinant lumican and inhibited by anti-lumican antibody, confirming a role for lumican in PMN migration. Treatment of PMNs with antibodies that block beta(2), beta(1), and alpha(M) integrin subunits inhibits lumican-mediated migration. Furthermore, immunohistochemical and biochemical approaches indicate binding of lumican to beta(2), alpha(M), and alpha(L) integrin subunits. Thus, lumican may regulate PMN migration mediated by MAC-1 (alpha(M)/beta(2)) and LFA-1 (alpha(L)/beta(2)), the two major PMN surface integrins. We detected lumican on the surface of peritoneal PMNs and not bone marrow or peripheral blood PMNs. This suggests that PMNs must acquire lumican during or after crossing the endothelial barrier as they exit circulation. We also found that peritoneal PMNs do not express lumican, whereas endothelial cells do. Taken together these observations suggest a novel endothelial lumican-mediated paracrine regulation of neutrophils early on in their migration path."

In vivo generation of 12-HETE-PEs occurs in a Th2-dependent model of murine lung inflammation associated with interleukin-4/interleukin-13 expression. In contrast, in Toll receptor-dependent peritonitis mediated either by live bacteria or bacterial products, 12-HETE-PEs are rapidly cleared during the acute phase then reappear during resolution.

Collectively, the studies infer the involvement of further uncharacterized 12/15-LOX products and indicate that the identification of novel lipids derived from this pathway is important.We recently reported that 15-LOX1 could generate 15-HETE-PE in response to calcium ionophore (11Maskrey B.

Precursor MS/MS scanning of lipid extracts from resident peritoneal lavage, the site of greatest basal 12/15-LOX expression in the mouse, identified four novel products as one diacyl (18:0a) and three plasmalogen (18:0p, 18:1p, and 16:0p) PEs that contain 12S-HETE (supplemental Figs. S1–S4). The enzymatic generation of these lipids is confirmed by several observations: (i) they contained primarily 12S-HETE enantiomer, (ii) they are absent from several tissues and organs in 12/15-LOX−/− mice, including peritoneal lavage, intestine and peritoneal membrane, and (iii) they are generated acutely on ionophore stimulation, with levels similar to free 12S-HETE. We previously showed that similar lipids are formed by ionophore-activated human peripheral monocytes, however in that case, oxidation was at C-15 and mediated by 15-LOX1 (11Maskrey B. Bermúdez-Fajardo A. Morgan A. Stewart-Jones E. Dioszeghy V. Taylor G.W. Baker P.R. Coles B. Coffey M.J. Kühn H. O’Donnell V.B. J. Biol.

Herein, we extended our studies to murine cells and characterized formation of 12S-HETE-containing lipids both in vitro and in vivo in three models of inflammation, as well as studying the tissue and cellular localization of the lipids.12S-HETE-PEs were primarily cell-associated and were metabolized within 3 h (Fig. 1). This is distinct to free acid products that are secreted and were stable over this time period. This may indicate phospholipase A2 hydrolysis within the plasma membrane, although this remains to be studied. Studies using H218O indicated that they form by direct oxidation by 12/15-LOX, similar to the corresponding human lipids generated by IL-4-treated monocytes (11Maskrey B. Bermúdez-Fajardo A. Morgan A. Stewart-Jones E. Dioszeghy V. Taylor G.W. Baker P.R. Coles B. Coffey M.J. Kühn H. O’Donnell V.B. J. Biol.

The lack of 12-HETE-PE externalization in unstimulated cells that already contain detectable amounts of these lipids indicates that both their formation and externalization are stimulated by ionophore. In wild-type cells, unoxidized PE was already present on the outside, but its levels did not increase on cell activation (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, in 12/15-LOX−/− macrophages, ionophore caused a large increase in PE externalization. This shows that in wild-type macrophages, externalization of PE is targeted toward oxidized species. However, in the absence of 12-HETE-PEs, the equivalent native PE lipids become externalized instead. Recent studies have proposed that extracellular exposure of oxidized phospholipids, including those containing hydroxy/oxy short-chain aldehydes derived from hydroperoxide decomposition, facilitates their physical contact with pattern recognition receptors (21Greenberg M.E.

This is termed the lipid whisker model. Thus it is possible that 12-HETE-PEs, formed and then externalized in response to agonist activation, may participate in similar processes, although this remains to be determined.Culture of human monocytes with 18:0a/15-HETE-PE effectively inhibited LPS stimulation of tumor necrosis factor-α and GCSF generation. This is consistent with a recent report showing that similar concentrations of oxidized PC, including a hydroxylipid, can inhibit LPS stimulation of cytokine gene expression (22von Schlieffen E. Oskolkova O.V. Schabbauer G. Gruber F. Blüml S. Genest M. Kadl A. Marsik C. Knapp S. Chow J. Leitinger N. Binder B.R. Bochkov V.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The mechanism involved binding of the lipid with LPS-binding protein and CD14 and a similar mechanism for 15-HETE-PE is likely (Fig. 7).Detection of 12-HETE and PE-HETE in lysates of resident peritoneal cells indicates that 12/15-LOX is basally active in vivo without inflammatory activation. Although further stimulation is achieved using ionophore in vitro, several bacterial and fungal mediators were without effect. Furthermore, two in vivo peritonitis models that mediate cell activation by Toll receptor-dependent mechanisms did not elevate 12-HETE-PE. Instead, 12-HETE-PEs were cleared during acute inflammation and reappeared during resolution (Fig. 4). This parallels the time course of clearance of 12/15-LOX-expressing macrophages and 12-HETE from the peritoneal cavity and their re-emergence, as recently demonstrated (20Dioszeghy V. Rosas M. Maskrey B.H. Colmont C. Topley N. Chaitidis P. Kühn H. Jones S.A. Taylor P.R. O’Donnell V.B. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 6514-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, 12-HETE-PEs were specifically and significantly elevated in a Th2-dependent model of lung allergy. Importantly, the time point where the lipids were detected coincided with the peak of IL-4/IL-13 generation (23McMillan S.J. Lloyd C.M. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2004; 34: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These data indicate that 12/15-LOX-dependent phospholipid peroxidation is associated with the Th2 and not Th1 inflammatory profile in vivo, consistent with previous reports showing induction of the human homolog, 15-LOX1 in human monocytes by IL-4/IL-13 in vitro (15Xu B.

Morgan A. Stewart-Jones E. Dioszeghy V. Taylor G.W. Baker P.R. Coles B. Coffey M.J. Kühn H. O’Donnell V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20151-20163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Following ionophore activation, 12-HETE-PEs were detected on the outside of the cells (Fig. 2). The lack of 12-HETE-PE externalization in unstimulated cells that already contain detectable amounts of these lipids indicates that both their formation and externalization are stimulated by ionophore. In wild-type cells, unoxidized PE was already present on the outside, but its levels did not increase on cell activation (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, in 12/15-LOX−/− macrophages, ionophore caused a large increase in PE externalization. This shows that in wild-type macrophages, externalization of PE is targeted toward oxidized species. However, in the absence of 12-HETE-PEs, the equivalent native PE lipids become externalized instead. Recent studies have proposed that extracellular exposure of oxidized phospholipids, including those containing hydroxy/oxy short-chain aldehydes derived from hydroperoxide decomposition, facilitates their physical contact with pattern recognition receptors (21Greenberg M.E.

This is termed the lipid whisker model. Thus it is possible that 12-HETE-PEs, formed and then externalized in response to agonist activation, may participate in similar processes, although this remains to be determined. Culture of human monocytes with 18:0a/15-HETE-PE effectively inhibited LPS stimulation of tumor necrosis factor-α and GCSF generation. This is consistent with a recent report showing that similar concentrations of oxidized PC, including a hydroxylipid, can inhibit LPS stimulation of cytokine gene expression (22von Schlieffen E. Oskolkova O.V. Schabbauer G. Gruber F. Blüml S. Genest M. Kadl A. Marsik C. Knapp S. Chow J. Leitinger N. Binder B.R. Bochkov V.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The mechanism involved binding of the lipid with LPS-binding protein and CD14 and a similar mechanism for 15-HETE-PE is likely (Fig. 7). Detection of 12-HETE and PE-HETE in lysates of resident peritoneal cells indicates that 12/15-LOX is basally active in vivo without inflammatory activation. Although further stimulation is achieved using ionophore in vitro, several bacterial and fungal mediators were without effect. Furthermore, two in vivo peritonitis models that mediate cell activation by Toll receptor-dependent mechanisms did not elevate 12-HETE-PE. Instead, 12-HETE-PEs were cleared during acute inflammation and reappeared during resolution (Fig. 4). This parallels the time course of clearance of 12/15-LOX-expressing macrophages and 12-HETE from the peritoneal cavity and their re-emergence, as recently demonstrated (20Dioszeghy V. Rosas M. Maskrey B.H. Colmont C. Topley N. Chaitidis P. Kühn H. Jones S.A. Taylor P.R. O’Donnell V.B. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 6514-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In contrast, 12-HETE-PEs were specifically and significantly elevated in a Th2-dependent model of lung allergy. Importantly, the time point where the lipids were detected coincided with the peak of IL-4/IL-13 generation (23McMillan S.J. Lloyd C.M. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2004; 34: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These data indicate that 12/15-LOX-dependent phospholipid peroxidation is associated with the Th2 and not Th1 inflammatory profile in vivo, consistent with previous reports showing induction of the human homolog, 15-LOX1 in human monocytes by IL-4/IL-13 in vitro (15Xu B.

In summary, esterified eicosanoids acutely generated by 12/15-LOX were characterized in vitro and in a model of Th2-dependent allergy in vivo. The studies define a class of lipid formed by this pathway that may represent novel mediators of 12/15-LOX bioactivity, and experiments are underway to address this idea.

Unlike its counterparts from other animal kingdoms, mammalian GDH is regulated by a host of ligands. The recently discovered hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia disorder showed that the loss of allosteric inhibition of GDH by GTP causes excessive secretion of insulin. Subsequent studies demonstrated that wild-type and hyperinsulinemia/hyperammonemia forms of GDH are inhibited by the green tea polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate. This was followed by high throughput studies that identified more stable inhibitors, including hexachlorophene, GW5074, and bithionol. Shown here are the structures of GDH complexed with these three compounds. Hexachlorophene forms a ring around the internal cavity in GDH through aromatic stacking interactions between the drug and GDH as well as between the drug molecules themselves. In contrast, GW5074 and bithionol both bind as pairs of stacked compounds at hexameric 2-fold axes between the dimers of subunits. The internal core of GDH contracts when the catalytic cleft closes during enzymatic turnover. None of the drugs cause conformational changes in the contact residues, but all bind to key interfaces involved in this contraction process. Therefore, it seems likely that the drugs inhibit enzymatic turnover by inhibiting this transition.

In eukaryotic organisms, GDH resides within the inner mitochondrial matrix where it catabolizes glutamate to feed 2-oxoglutarate to the Krebs cycle. Although there is some debate as to the directionality of the reaction, the high Km for ammonium in the reductive amination reaction seems to prohibit the reverse reaction under normal conditions in most organisms (2Smith E.L.

Biol. 2002; 318: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) of GDH have shown that the general architecture and the locations of the catalytically important residues have remained unchanged throughout evolution. The structure of GDH (Fig. 1) is essentially two trimers of subunits stacked directly on top of each other with each subunit being composed of at least three domains (19Peterson P.E. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 20Smith T.J. Schmidt T. Fang J. Wu J. Siuzdak G. Stanley C.A. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3446-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The bottom domain makes extensive contacts with a subunit from the other trimer. Resting on top of this domain is the “NAD binding domain” that has the conserved nucleotide binding motif. Animal GDH has a long protrusion, “antenna,” rising above the NAD binding domain that is not found in bacteria, plants, fungi, and the vast majority of protists. The antenna from each subunit lies immediately behind the adjacent, counterclockwise neighbor within the trimer. Because these intertwined antennae are only found in the forms of GDH that are allosterically regulated by numerous ligands, it is reasonable to speculate that it plays a role in regulation.From the structures GDH alone and complexed with various ligands, it is clear that GDH undergoes large conformational changes during each catalytic cycle (19Peterson P.E. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 20Smith T.J. Schmidt T. Fang J. Wu J. Siuzdak G. Stanley C.A. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3446-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (the locations of these changes are summarized in Fig. 1). Substrate binds to the deep recesses of the cleft between the coenzyme binding domain and the lower domain. Coenzyme binds along the coenzyme binding domain surface of the cleft. Upon binding, the coenzyme binding domain rotates by ∼18° to firmly close down upon the substrate and coenzyme (Fig. 1, arrow 1). As the catalytic cleft closes, the base of each of the long ascending helices in the antenna appears to rotate out in a counterclockwise manner to push against the “pivot” helix of the adjacent subunit (Fig. 1, arrow 2). There is a short helix in the descending loop of the antenna that becomes distended and shorter as the mouth closes in a manner akin to an extending spring (Fig. 1, arrow 3). The pivot helix rotates in a counterclockwise manner along the helical axes as well as rotating counterclockwise around the trimer 3-fold axis. Finally, the entire hexamer seems to compress as the mouth closes (Fig. 1, arrow 4). The three pairs of subunits that sit on top of each other move as a rigid units toward each other, compressing the cavity at the core of the hexamer. This last conformational change will be further examined in this work. Allosteric regulation is likely exacted by controlling some or all of these conformational changes.The reason for complex animal regulation came from studies that linked GDH regulation with insulin and ammonia homeostasis. The connection between GDH and insulin regulation was initially established using a non-metabolizable analog of leucine (7Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Nature. 1980; 288: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 23Sener A. Malaisse-Lagae F. Malaisse W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1981; 78: 5460-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), BCH (β-2-aminobicycle[2.2.1]-heptane-2-carboxylic acid). These studies demonstrated that activation of GDH was tightly correlated with increased glutaminolysis and release of insulin. In addition, it has also been noted that factors that regulate GDH also affect insulin secretion (24Fahien L.A. MacDonald M.J. Kmiotek E.H. Mertz R.J. Fahien C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13610-13614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vivo importance of GDH in glucose homeostasis was demonstrated by the discovery that a genetic hypoglycemic disorder, the hyperinsulinemia/hyperammonemia (HHS) syndrome, is caused by loss of GTP regulation of GDH (25Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 26Stanley C.A.

Saudubray J.M. Ganguly A. Smith T.J. Stanley C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1782-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Children with HHS have increased β-cell responsiveness to leucine and susceptibility to hypoglycemia following high protein meals (28Hsu B.Y. Kelly A. Thornton P.S. Greenberg C.R. Dilling L.A. Stanley C.A. J. Pediatr. 2001; 138: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This is likely due to uncontrolled catabolism of amino acids yielding high ATP levels that stimulate insulin secretion as well as high serum ammonium levels. During glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in normal individuals, it has been proposed that the generation of high energy phosphates inhibits GDH and promotes conversion of glutamate to glutamine, which, alone or combined, might amplify the release of insulin (29Li C. Buettger C. Kwagh J. Matter A. Daihkin Y. Nissim I.B. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Stanley C.A. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13393-13401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 30Li C. Najafi H. Daikhin Y. Nissim I.B. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2853-2858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Further support for this contention came from studies on the inhibitory effects of the polyphenolic compounds from green tea on BCH-stimulated insulin secretion (31Li C. Allen A. Kwagh J. Doliba N.M. Qin W. Najafi H. Collins H.W. Matschinsky F.M. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10214-10221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This not only lent support for the contention that GDH plays a significant role in insulin homeostasis, but also suggests that the HHS disorder might be directly controlled pharmaceutically. The role of GDH in insulin homeostasis is summarized in Fig. 2.FIGURE 2Link between GDH and insulin homeostasis. This figure shows the role of GDH in BCH stimulated insulin secretion and how GDH inhibitors affect this process (29Li C. Buettger C. Kwagh J. Matter A. Daihkin Y. Nissim I.B. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M.

In energy-depleted β-cells, a BCH ramp stimulates insulin secretion. Here, the major energy source is glutaminolysis via phosphate-dependent glutaminase and GDH, because the concentration of GDH inhibitors (ATP/GTP) have been depleted and the phosphate-dependent glutaminase activator Pi (inorganic phosphate) has been increased. BCH stimulates glutamine utilization via GDH activation, thus providing the ATP signal necessary for insulin secretion. GDH inhibitors block this process by inhibiting GDH activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To both find a more stable pharmaceutical agent to control HHS and to better understand the allosteric regulation of GDH, a high throughput screen was performed to identify new GDH inhibitors (32Li M. Allen A. Smith T.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 15089-15102Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Of the ∼30,000 compounds tested, ∼20 demonstrated significant activity. Three of the most active compounds, hexachlorophene, GW5074, and bithionol, were chosen for further analysis in this study. As shown here, all three compounds exhibit essentially non-competitive inhibition of the reaction and therefore do not compete with either substrate or coenzyme. Structural studies are presented here that demonstrate that six hexachlorophene (HCP) molecules bind to the inner core of the GDH hexamer, forming an internal ring via aromatic interactions. In contrast, bithionol and GW5074 bind as pairs between dimers of GDH subunits further away from the core of the enzyme. None of these compounds induce significant conformational changes in their immediate vicinity, and the mechanism of action is not clear from the location of their binding sites. However, detailed analysis of the various GDH complexes shows all of the drugs are binding to contact areas in the core of the hexamer that appear to be expanding and contracting during catalytic turnover. Therefore, inhibition is likely due interference with this “breathing” process.DISCUSSIONIn our previous studies, the antenna was shown to be crucial to allosteric regulation of GDH by palmitoyl CoA, GTP, and ADP (43Allen A. Kwagh J. Fang J. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14431-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We further proposed that this antenna evolved in the Ciliates, perhaps in response to changes in the organelle functions and then, through evolutionary exaptation (shift in the function of a trait during evolution), further refined to link amino acid catabolism with insulin homeostasis (43Allen A. Kwagh J. Fang J. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14431-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have further refined this model by suggesting that this functional evolution of GDH was made possible by the dynamic nature of the enzyme (44Smith T.J. Stanley C.A. Trends Biol. Chem. 2008; 33: 557-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). GDH necessarily undergoes large domain movements to dehydrate the substrate and coenzyme to improve catalytic efficiency. The easiest way to regulate GDH, therefore, may be to control these dynamic processes. By resting behind the NAD binding domain and under the pivot helix, ADP likely activates the enzyme by decreasing the energy required to open the catalytic cleft. In contrast, GTP wedges into the gap between the NAD binding domain and the pivot helix, making it harder to open the catalytic cleft. The antenna twists and turns during the catalytic cycle and, because deletion of the antenna abrogates acetyl CoA inhibition, perhaps this regulator binds to and inhibits this second motion.As shown in FIGURE 9, FIGURE 10, the third type of conformational change is a 3–4% expansion of the entire hexamer when the catalytic mouth opens. The fact that there is only movement between, and not within, the stacked dimers seems to argue that the interface between the stacked dimers is a major flex point within the hexamer that the drugs themselves seem to be taking advantage of. None of these drugs cause any local conformational changes upon binding. They are far removed from the known allosteric sites and the active site and yet act as potent inhibitors. It seems highly unlikely that it is merely a coincidence that all of these compounds bind to the areas most involved in this expansion and contraction. It should be noted that GTP does much the same thing (21Smith T.J. Peterson P.E. Schmidt T. Fang J. Stanley C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 707-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It does not significantly alter the side chains of the contact residues but apparently prevents the opening and closing of the catalytic cleft.GW5074 and bithionol wedge in between the two α-helices at the 2-fold axes (see yellow arrows in Fig. 9) while HCP forms a hydrophobic ring within the core of the hexamer. It seems logical that the binding of hydrophobic compounds to these areas affects the compression and/or the expansion of the hexamer. Although the numbers in Table 3 suggest that the drugs may be pushing the stacked dimers apart somewhat, it seems more likely that the drugs inhibit catalytic turnover by making the overall conformational transitions more difficult.Although it seems rather unexpected that HCP is able to work its way into the heart of GDH, there are examples of this occurring from previous chemical modification studies. When GDH is modified with the photoreactive 5′-(p-(fluorosulfonyl)benzoyl)-8-azidoadenosine (5′-FSBAzA), the enzymatic activity is not appreciably affected. However, there is a significant loss in sensitivity to activation by ADP and allosteric inhibition by NADH and GTP. The Ki for GTP increases ∼4-fold upon modification with 5′-FSBAzA, whereas the Kd for ADP and Km for NADH are not affected (45Dombrowski K.E. Colman R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). FSBAzA is a bifunctional reagent with a fluorosulfonyl group at one end and a photoreactive azidoadenosine moiety at the other. It was found that, in the dark, where only modification by the fluorosulfonyl group can occur, ∼0.5 mol of FSBAzA is incorporated per mole of enzyme. Subsequent photolysis causes cross-linking with ∼25% of the FSBAzA bound during the dark reaction (46Dombrowski K.E. Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3785-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The dark reaction is blocked by high NADH concentrations and even better by the combination of NADH and GTP. The major site of modification by FSBAzA is Tyr-190 and a minor modification site is Lys-143 (46Dombrowski K.E. Huang Y.C. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3785-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly because they are similar compounds, these results are similar to when GDH is modified by 5′-FSBA (47Pal P.K. Wechter W.J. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 48Schmidt J.A. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14515-14519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues Lys-420 and Tyr-190 are modified by 5′-FSBA, and this modification also abrogates the inhibition caused by high NADH concentrations. Also similar to the effects of 5′-FSBAzA, the chemical modification is blocked by high concentrations of NADH and by the addition of NADH and GTP.These chemical modification studies lend a great deal of insight to the results presented here. Both 5′-FSBA and 5′-FSBAzA react with Tyr-190. This residue approximately stacks against one of bound HCP conformations. This clearly demonstrates that these small compounds can work their way into the core of the GDH hexamer and, in fact, bind to the same residues as HCP. Further, it is very interesting to note that only half of the six subunits are modified by 5′-FSBAzA; consistent with only three HCP molecules stacking against the six Tyr-190 residues in the core of the hexamer. It seems likely that the rather large size of FSBAzA prohibits reaction with all six possible sites. It is important to note that Tyr-190 is not at all near the active site or the known allosteric regulatory binding sites and yet, upon modification, affects allosteric regulation. This lends credence to the idea that the breathing of the hexamer plays a significant role in not only catalysis but also allostery. This is further supported by the fact that high concentrations of NADH and NADH+GTP block modification of Tyr-190 by both of these compounds. From our previous studies (see Ref. 44Smith T.J. Stanley C.A. Trends Biol. Chem. 2008; 33: 557-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar for a review) these ligands effectively close the catalytic mouth of GDH, leading to the compressed conformation of the hexamer. It therefore seems highly likely that these ligands protect against 5′-FSBA and 5′-FSBAzA modification by blocking the breathing necessary for penetration by these compounds, and conversely, once bound affects enzymatic activity and regulation. An even greater validation of the results presented here is the fact that 5′-FSBAzA, but not 5′-FSBA, also modifies Lys-143. It is the alkane portion of the Lys-143 side chain that contributes to the hydrophobic pocket to which bithionol and GW5074 bind. Therefore, 5′-FSBAzA exactly binds to both of the drug binding sites identified here, and both areas are protected against modification by the addition of ligands that promote closure of the catalytic cleft and compression of the hexamer. The fact that neither 5′-FSBA nor 5′-FSBAzA inhibit the enzyme like bithionol, HCP, or GW5074 suggests that GDH breathing is required for binding but that the compounds themselves are not binding in orientations necessary to prevent such conformational changes.It is not clear why such similar compounds such as bithionol and HCP bind to different sites. Both HCP and bithionol are nearly insoluble in water with solubilities of ∼140 and ∼4 μg/ml, respectively. Perhaps the fact that 5′-FSBAzA binds to both the HCP and bithionol sites suggests that the two environments are nearly equivalent and that some slight difference between the two compounds is all that is necessary for the observed binding differences. For example, perhaps the binding site differences are not as important as the ability of the compounds to form the inter-drug stacking interactions observed between the bound HCP and bithionol molecules.There appears to be an evolutionary conservation of the effect of these drugs on GDH activity. All three drugs inhibited tetrahymena GDH with GW5074 exhibiting the weakest effects. In the case of bacterial GDH (E. coli), all three drugs exhibited significantly weaker effects. Nevertheless, HCP was able to inhibit the E. coli enzyme by ∼50% at the highest concentrations tested while bithionol inhibited the reaction by ∼40% at the highest concentrations tested. The results with tetrahymena were not entirely surprising, because the residues in contact with the drugs are highly conserved between the tetrahymena and bovine forms of GDH (43Allen A. Kwagh J. Fang J. Stanley C.A. Smith T.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14431-14443Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, these same residues are not well conserved in the bacterial form (19Peterson P.E. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the binding pockets for these compounds are found in bacterial GDH (e.g. Clostridium GDH (17Stillman T.J. Baker P.J. Britton K.L. Rice D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1131-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar)). There is a clear pocket that is accessible to the exterior solvent and is in a homologous location as the bithionol and GW5074 binding site. Because bacterial GDH does not have the antenna region, the entire inner core is exposed to solvent. Although a higher degree of inhibition would have been more convincing, the fact that HCP and GW5074 have any effect on the enzymatic activity suggests that the concerted conformational changes observed in mammalian GDH may have very ancient origins and are most certainly in play in the Ciliate form of the enzyme. It is also important to note that HCP and bithionol are known anthelmintic (expel or kill parasites) agents, but their mode of action is unclear. Given that both of these compounds inhibit GDH from such diverse sources, it seems possible that they, at least in part, act via GDH inhibition.As we have recently proposed (44Smith T.J. Stanley C.A. Trends Biol. Chem. 2008; 33: 557-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the complex motions within GDH may have initially evolved to improve catalytic efficiency. The negative cooperativity and extensive subunit communication may have evolved to conserve and transfer the energy involved in substrate binding to one subunit to facilitate product release from adjacent subunits (49Smith T. Bell J.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As is clear in the case of these drugs and the naturally occurring allosteric regulators, this complex ballet of motion creates numerous sites by which ligands can bind and modulate catalytic activity. This has allowed allostery in GDH to gradually evolve in complexity to create new functions and roles rather than creating entirely new gene products to accommodate the changing needs of the cell (e.g. linkage between amino acid catabolism and insulin"
https://openalex.org/W1997353282,"Background Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy (Lafora disease; LD) is a fatal autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in either the EPM2A gene, encoding the dual specificity phosphatase laforin, or the EPM2B gene, encoding the E3-ubiquitin ligase malin. Previously, we and others have shown that both proteins form a functional complex that regulates glycogen synthesis by a novel mechanism involving ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of at least two proteins, glycogen synthase and R5/PTG. Since laforin and malin localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and their regulatory role likely extend to other proteins unrelated to glycogen metabolism, we postulated that their absence may also affect the ER-unfolded protein response pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we demonstrate that siRNA silencing of laforin in Hek293 and SH-SY5Y cells increases their sensitivity to agents triggering ER-stress, which correlates with impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway and increased apoptosis. Consistent with these findings, analysis of tissue samples from a LD patient lacking laforin, and from a laforin knockout (Epm2a-/-) mouse model of LD, demonstrates constitutive high expression levels of ER-stress markers BIP/Grp78, CHOP and PDI, among others. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that, in addition to regulating glycogen synthesis, laforin and malin play a role protecting cells from ER-stress, likely contributing to the elimination of unfolded proteins. These data suggest that proteasomal dysfunction and ER-stress play an important role in the pathogenesis of LD, which may offer novel therapeutic approaches for this fatal neurodegenerative disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2015752737,"To investigate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster BCG vaccination delivered intradermally in healthy, BCG vaccinated subjects and to compare with a previous clinical trial where BCG vaccinated subjects were boosted with a new TB vaccine, MVA85A.Phase I open label observational trial, in the UK. Healthy, HIV-negative, BCG vaccinated adults were recruited and vaccinated with BCG. The primary outcome was safety; the secondary outcome was cellular immune responses to antigen 85, overlapping peptides of antigen 85A and tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) detected by ex vivo interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) ELISpot assay and flow cytometry.BCG revaccination (BCG-BCG) was well tolerated, and boosting of pre-existing PPD-specific T cell responses was observed. However, when these results were compared with data from a previous clinical trial, where BCG was boosted with MVA85A (BCG-MVA85A), MVA85A induced significantly higher levels (>2-fold) of antigen 85-specific CD4+ T cells (both antigen and peptide pool responses) than boosting with BCG, up to 52 weeks post-vaccination (p = 0.009). To identify antigen 85A-specific CD8+ T cells that were not detectable by ex vivo ELISpot and flow cytometry, dendritic cells (DC) were used to amplify CD8+ T cells from PBMC samples. We observed low, but detectable levels of antigen 85A-specific CD8+ T cells producing IFNgamma (1.5% of total CD8 population) in the BCG primed subjects after BCG boosting in 1 (20%) of 5 subjects. In contrast, in BCG-MVA85A vaccinated subjects, high levels of antigen 85A-specific CD8+ T cells (up to 14% total CD8 population) were observed after boosting with MVA85A, in 4 (50%) of 8 subjects evaluated. In conclusion, revaccination with BCG resulted in modest boosting of pre-existing immune responses to PPD and antigen 85, but vaccination with BCG-MVA85A induced a significantly higher response to antigen 85 and generated a higher frequency of antigen 85A-specific CD8+ T cells.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00654316 NCT00427830."
https://openalex.org/W2083984635,"Transcription factors Oct4 and Sox2 are key players in maintaining the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Small changes in their levels disrupt normal expression of their target genes. However, it remains elusive how protein levels of Oct4 and Sox2 and expression of their target genes are precisely controlled in ESCs. Here we identify PARP1, a DNA-binding protein with an NAD+-dependent enzymatic activity, as a cofactor of Oct4 and Sox2 to regulate expression of their target gene FGF4. We demonstrate for the first time that PARP1 binds the FGF4 enhancer to positively regulate FGF4 expression. Our data show that PARP1 interacts with and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates Sox2 directly, which may be a step required for dissociation and degradation of inhibitory Sox2 proteins from the FGF4 enhancer. When PARP1 activity is inhibited or absent, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of Sox2 decreases and association of Sox2 with FGF4 enhancers increases, accompanied by an elevated level of Sox2 proteins and reduced expression of FGF4. Significantly, specific knockdown of Sox2 expression by RNA interference can considerably abrogate the inhibitory effect of the poly(ADP- ribose) polymerase inhibitor on FGF4 expression. Interestingly, PARP1 deficiency does not affect undifferentiated ESCs but compromises cell survival and/or growth when ESCs are induced into differentiation. Addition of FGF4 can partially rescue the phenotypes caused by PARP1 deficiency during ESC differentiation.

Intensive research over past decades has demonstrated that transcription factors Oct4 and Sox2 are key players in maintaining the pluripotent state of ESCs (3Avilion A.A. Nicolis S.K. Pevny L.H.

It is also clear that Oct4 and Sox2 cooperatively regulate their own expression as well as that of different sets of target genes, such as FGF4 (8Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), Nanog (9Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A.

Remarkably, small changes in the levels of Oct4 and Sox2 disrupt normal expression of their target genes and alter cell fate determination in ESCs (11Boer B. Kopp J. Mallanna S. Desler M.

Therefore, levels of Oct4 and Sox2 as well as of their target genes must be tightly controlled. However, to date, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms controlling their expression is limited.

As is the case for most other transcription factors, Oct4 and Sox2 are regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, past emphasis has been mainly placed on their transcriptional regulation, whereas their post-transcriptional control has been little touched upon. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that Oct4 could be ubiquitinated and sumoylated and that ubiquitination and sumoylation jointly maintain the protein level of Oct4 in a normal range in ESCs (16Xu H.M. Liao B. Zhang Q.J. Wang B.B. Li H. Zhong X.M. Sheng H.Z. Zhao Y.X. Zhao Y.M. Jin Y. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3042-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, phosphorylation of Oct4 was also reported (18Saxe J.P. Tomilin A. Schöler H.R. Plath K. Huang J. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As for Sox2, one study indicated that Sox2 sumoylation negatively regulates its transcriptional activity, although its role in control of the Sox2 protein level is not known (19Tsuruzoe S. Ishihara K. Uchimura Y. Watanabe S. Sekita Y. Aoto T. Saitoh H. Yuasa Y. Niwa H. Kawasuji M. Baba H. Nakao M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition to ubiquitination, sumoylation, and phosphorylation, a wide variety of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, exists, and enzymes mediating these modifications make a great contribution to modulation of transcription factors. One such enzyme is poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1), a 114-kDa, abundant nuclear DNA-binding protein that catalyzes the covalent attachment of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) from NAD+ to itself and other nuclear protein acceptors such as topoisomerase I and II, NF-κB, p53, and histones (20Kasid U.N.

In contrast to Oct4 and Sox2, which are specifically expressed in pluripotent stem cells, PARP1 is a constitutively expressed protein (26Kanai M. Tong W.M. Wang Z.Q. Miwa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Kanai M. Hanashiro K. Kim S.H. Hanai S. Boulares A.H. Miwa M. Fukasawa K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although the best studied function of PARP1 is in the maintenance of genomic integrity (28Ménissier de Murcia J. Ricoul M.

However, the underlying mechanism responsible for its functions in transcription regulation is not well defined, and its role in ESC proliferation and differentiation has not been explored. Recent studies indicate that additional factors are involved in the regulation of target genes of Oct4 and Sox2 and that these factors function in a gene-specific manner. For example, Nakatake et al. (33Nakatake Y. Fukui N. Iwamatsu Y. Masui S. Takahashi K. Yagi R. Yagi K. Miyazaki J. Matoba R. Ko M.S. Niwa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7772-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) reported that Klf4 cooperates with Oct4 and Sox2 to activate Lefty1 expression. However, its presence is not required for expression of Oct4 and UTF1 under the same conditions (33Nakatake Y. Fukui N. Iwamatsu Y. Masui S. Takahashi K. Yagi R. Yagi K. Miyazaki J. Matoba R. Ko M.S. Niwa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7772-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Moreover, Esrrb was found to interact with Oct4, positively regulating Nanog expression (34van den Berg D.L. Zhang W. Yates A. Engelen E. Takacs K. Bezstarosti K. Demmers J. Chambers I. Poot R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5986-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recruitment of cofactors provides an important mechanism by which transcriptional factors may regulate expression of their target genes precisely and differentially in a tissue-specific and developmentally stage-specific manner. In the search for more such regulatory factors mediating Oct4 and Sox2 functions, the FGF4 distal enhancer provides a good model. FGF4 is essential for survival of the postimplantation embryo (35Feldman B. Poueymirou W. Papaioannou V.E. DeChiara T.M. Goldfarb M. Science. 1995; 267: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) and plays important roles at multiple stages of development (36Niswander L. Martin G.R. Development. 1992; 114: 755-768PubMed Google Scholar). It is expressed in the ICM of the blastocyst in vivo and in ESCs as well as embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells in vitro. However, its transcription is silent in the adult and down-regulated when ESCs are induced to differentiate (37Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 38Schoorlemmer J. Kruijer W. Mech. Dev. 1991; 36: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Uniquely, FGF4 transcription is regulated by a powerful distal enhancer located in the 3′-untranslated region, containing the POU and the HMG cassettes (8Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that Oct4 and Sox2 bind both in vitro and in vivo to the POU motif and the HMG motif, respectively, to control the expression of FGF4 (39Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 40Luster T.A. Rizzino A. Gene. 2003; 323: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether other factors, together with Oct4 and Sox2, are implicated in FGF4 expression in undifferentiated ESCs and during their differentiation. In this study, we identify PARP1 as a novel cofactor of Oct4 and Sox2 and as a regulator of FGF4 expression. It binds to the FGF4 enhancer together with Oct4 and Sox2 and is required for appropriate expression of FGF4 during ESC differentiation. Our data show that PARP1 interacts with Sox2 directly and modifies Sox2 by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, which may be a step required for dissociation of excessive Sox2 from the FGF4 enhancer. When PARP1 activity is absent or inhibited, Sox2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is reduced, which is associated with an elevated Sox2 protein level and increased binding of Sox2 to the FGF4 enhancer. Moreover, specific knockdown of Sox2 expression by RNA interference can rescue reduction in FGF4 expression caused by inhibition of PARP activity. In addition, we find that FGF4 can partially rescue PAPR1 deficiency-associated phenotypes in differentiating ESCs. Therefore, the study establishes links among PARP activity, Sox2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, and FGF4 expression, uncovering new mechanisms through which the Sox2 protein level and FGF4 transcription are dynamically regulated. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GST, Oct4, and Sox2 were raised and affinity-purified in our laboratory using bacterially expressed GST, GST-Oct4N (16Xu H.M. Liao B. Zhang Q.J. Wang B.B. Li H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 23495-23503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and GST-Sox2C (114-amino acid residues at the C terminus of the Sox2 protein) fusion proteins, respectively. Antibodies against the FLAG (Sigma), tubulin (Sigma), PARP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and PAR (Alexis Biochemical) were used for immunoblotting. Anti-human FGF4-neutralizing antibody (R & D Systems) was reconstituted in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and used for neutralization of FGF4 activity secreted by ESCs. 3AB, FGF4, and NAD+ were purchased from Sigma, and PJ34 was obtained from Calbiochem. The cDNA sequences corresponding to the full-length proteins of PARP1, Oct4, and Sox2 were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the RNA of mouse ESCs as templates, and they were cloned into pET-30a(+) (Novagen) and pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) vectors for expression in bacteria or pPyCAGIP vector (a kind gift of I. Chambers and A. Smith) for expression in mammalian cells. Probes and primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. To make small interfering RNA vectors for Sox2 (Sox2 RNAi), two independent 19-bp sequences (5′-GGTTGATATCGTTGGTAAT-3′ and 5′-CCCTGCAGTACAACTCCAT-3′) within the coding region of the murine Sox2 gene were selected and cloned into the pTER+ vectors (41van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Small interfering RNA vector for EGFP (EGFP RNAi) was made by selecting a 19-bp sequence in the coding region of the EGFP gene (5′-GGCTACGTCCAGGAGCGCA-3′). PARP1+/+ and PARP1−/− ESCs were grown in media consisting of Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, Chemicon), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen). ESCs were maintained on a feeder layer. To induce differentiation by retinoic acid (RA, Fisher), ESCs were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes without a feeder layer at a density of 5 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish for 24 h. Subsequently, RA at a concentration of 1 μm was added to the culture medium containing LIF. For spontaneous differentiation at low cell density, ESCs were cultured in a gelatin-coated 6-well plate at a density of 3000 per well for 7 days. P19 and F9 EC cells were maintained in the Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s media/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.5% NaHCO3 (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Both ESCs and EC cells were transiently transfected with LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer舗s instructions. HEK 293 cells were cultured under standard conditions and transfected using the calcium phosphate method. For Sox2 RNAi experiments, P19 cells were transfected with EGFP RNAi or Sox2 RNAi plasmids. Twelve hours after transfection, the cells were incubated in fresh medium and selected by Zeocin at 100 μg/ml for 12 h. Twenty four hours later, the transfected cells were trypsinized and replated in 24-well plates. After an additional 24 h, 3AB at a concentration of 6 mm was added. The cells were collected 48 h later. Preparation of nuclear extract (NE), oligonucleotide probes, and protein purification by affinity chromatography were accomplished as described previously (42Dhar S.K. Lynn B.C. Daosukho C. St Clair D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28209-28219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with minor changes (details are provided in the supplementary material). ChIP assays using formaldehyde cross-linking and specific antibodies were performed as described previously (17Zhang Z. Liao B. Xu M. Jin Y. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3042-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). ESCs were cultured in a gelatin-coated 24-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 per well. After 24 h, cells were cotransfected with 200 ng of the plasmid DNA construct (FGF4/pTAL) containing the enhancer fragment of the mouse FGF4 gene in the pTAL reporter gene or empty vector pTAL and 20 ng of pRL-TK (Promega) as an internal control to normalize the transfection efficiency. Forty eight hours after transfection, samples were collected and analyzed with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The NE of cells was prepared in CoIP buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with a specific antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h. The samples were analyzed using Western blotting. GST and His fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer舗s instructions from Amersham Biosciences and Novagen, respectively. GST pulldown experiments were performed as described previously (16Xu H.M. Liao B. Zhang Q.J. Wang B.B. Li H. Zhong X.M. Sheng H.Z. Zhao Y.X. Zhao Y.M. Jin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23495-23503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For the assay in vivo, cells were harvested and boiled in the lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS) for 10 min to disassociate protein-protein interaction. The lysate was then diluted by 10-fold in the CoIP buffer and sonicated briefly, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h. In vitro poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation assays were performed as described previously (24Huang J.Y. Chen W.H. Chang Y.L. Wang H.T. Chuang W.T. Lee S.C.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST fusion proteins (1 μg) were incubated in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with purified his-PARP1 fusion proteins (100 ng), 0.5 mm NAD+, and 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA for 40 min at 37 °C. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-PAR antibody. RNAs were extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer舗s protocol. cDNAs were synthesized with the ReverTra Ace® reverse transcriptase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix on an ABI PRISM 7900 machine as described previously (17Zhang Z. Liao B. Xu M. Jin Y. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3042-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The Ct value of each gene was normalized against that of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Data were analyzed using Student舗s t test. Data are shown as the mean ± S.D. of at least three experiments. We considered the difference between comparisons to be significant when p < 0.05 for all the statistical analysis. All experiments were performed at least three times. To identify proteins associated with control of FGF4 expression, in addition to its known regulators, Oct4 and Sox2, we conducted affinity chromatography with the NE of F9 mouse EC cells, using synthetic biotinylated oligonucleotides containing the 3′-untranslated region of FGF4 (biotin-FGF4 probe). F9 cells were chosen because of their relatively easy and low cost culture as compared with ESCs. The isolated proteins were visualized by Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 1A). Multiple protein bands were seen in the NE column with use of the biotin-FGF4 probe (Fig. 1A, lane 1). To exclude nonspecific binding proteins, only the protein bands, which vanished when a high concentration of nonbiotinylated FGF4 probe (non-biotin-FGF4 probe) was present (compare lanes 1 and 2), were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Among these proteins, the peptides from the 45-kDa protein band matched with Oct4, supporting the validity of the approach used. Interestingly, the peptides derived from the 100-kDa protein band corresponded to PARP1. The implication of PARP1 in transcriptional regulation prompted us to investigate further. We repeated the DNA-protein binding assay described in Fig. 1A and examined the probe-binding proteins by Western blot analysis. Using the probe (2×mIUR-NF-κB) known not to bind PARP (43Amiri K.I. Ha H.C. Smulson M.E. Richmond A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7714-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as a negative control (NC probe), PARP1 was found to bind the FGF4 probe, in addition to Oct4 and Sox2 (Fig. 1, B and C). Moreover, the binding intensity was dramatically reduced for all three proteins when the non-biotin-FGF4 probe was included in the reaction mixture (Fig. 1C, lane 3), indicating the specificity of their binding to the FGF4 enhancer. Next, to examine whether PARP1 was associated with the FGF4 enhancer under physiological conditions, ChIP assays were conducted. We found that PARP1 was specifically recruited to the FGF4 enhancer but not to the Sox2 enhancer or the FGF4 exon, whereas, as reported previously (12Chew J.L. Loh Y.H. Zhang W. Chen X. Tam W.L.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 40Luster T.A. Rizzino A. Gene. 2003; 323: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), Oct4 and Sox2 bound to the enhancers of both FGF4 and Sox2 (Fig. 1D). In addition, we found that purified His-PARP1 was capable of binding the biotin-FGF4 probe directly in vitro (Fig. 1E). Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time that PARP1 is directly associated with the FGF4 enhancer, together with Oct4 and Sox2, both in vitro and in vivo. To learn whether PARP1 recruited to the FGF4 enhancer has any function, we compared mRNA levels of FGF4 in PARP1+/+ and PARP1−/− ESCs cultured with or without feeder cells for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, the level of FGF4 transcripts was significantly lower in PARP1 knock-out cells than in wild type cells under both conditions. Furthermore, the mRNA level of FGF4 decreased in both wild type and PARP1-deficient ESCs during ESC differentiation induced by RA (Fig. 2B), consistent with a previous report (38Schoorlemmer J. Kruijer W. Mech. Dev. 1991; 36: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Significantly, FGF4 expression was lower in PARP1−/− cells than in PARP1+/+ cells at all time points tested (Fig. 2B). In contrast, there was no detectable difference in the mRNA level of Sox2 between wild type and PARP1 knock-out cells (Fig. 2, A and B). The results indicate that PARP1 may play a positive role in maintaining FGF4 expression in ESCs and during their differentiation. To verify that the effect of PARP1 on FGF4 expression is mediated through the FGF4 enhancer, we transfected the FGF4/pTAL luciferase reporter containing the FGF4 enhancer sequence into PARP1+/+ and PARP1−/− ESCs cultured without feeder cells, and we found that the luciferase activity was significantly lower in PARP1 knock-out cells than in wild type cells (Fig. 2C). This result indicates that PARP1 may regulate FGF4 expression, at least partially, through the FGF4 enhancer. We further reasoned that the phenotypes of PARP1-deficient cells should resemble those of FGF4−/− ESCs to a certain extent if PARP1 is an important regulator of FGF4 expression. It is known that undifferentiated FGF4−/− ESCs proliferate normally in vitro. However, the growth and/or survival of RA-induced differentiated cells is severely compromised in the absence of FGF4 (44Wilder P.J. Kelly D. Brigman K. Peterson C.L. Nowling T. Gao Q.S. McComb R.D. Capecchi M.R. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 614-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that PARP1−/− ESCs grew normally as wild type ESCs did when they were cultured under undifferentiated conditions (Fig. 2D). We next induced differentiation of PARP1−/− ESCs by two culture conditions as follows: spontaneous differentiation at low cell density and RA-induced differentiation, respectively. In both cases, the cells were cultured in the presence of LIF but in the absence of a feeder layer. At low cell density, the majority of colonies formed by wild type ESCs contained differentiated alkaline phosphatase-negative cells surrounding central undifferentiated alkaline phosphatase-positive cells (Fig. 2E, upper left panel). A minority of colonies was small and did not have differentiated cells peripherally (Fig. 2E, upper right panel). Addition of the anti-human FGF4-neutralizi"
https://openalex.org/W2010101046,"Neuropeptide signaling at the cell surface is regulated by metalloendopeptidases, which degrade peptides in the extracellular fluid, and beta-arrestins, which interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to mediate desensitization. beta-Arrestins also recruit GPCRs and mitogen-activated protein kinases to endosomes to allow internalized receptors to continue signaling, but the mechanisms regulating endosomal signaling are unknown. We report that endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) degrades substance P (SP) in early endosomes of epithelial cells and neurons to destabilize the endosomal mitogen-activated protein kinase signalosome and terminate signaling. ECE-1 inhibition caused endosomal retention of the SP neurokinin 1 receptor, beta-arrestins, and Src, resulting in markedly sustained ERK2 activation in the cytosol and nucleus, whereas ECE-1 overexpression attenuated ERK2 activation. ECE-1 inhibition also enhanced SP-induced expression and phosphorylation of the nuclear death receptor Nur77, resulting in cell death. Thus, endosomal ECE-1 attenuates ERK2-mediated SP signaling in the nucleus to prevent cell death. We propose that agonist availability in endosomes, here regulated by ECE-1, controls beta-arrestin-dependent signaling of endocytosed GPCRs."

Ablation of the genes encoding either protein causes severe defects in the secretion of milk lipid droplets, suggesting that the two proteins may function in the same pathway. Therefore, we determined whether BTN1A1 and XOR directly interact using protein binding assays, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and gel filtration. Bovine XOR bound with high affinity in a pH- and salt-sensitive manner (KD = 101 ± 31 nm in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to the PRY/SPRY/B30.2 domain in the cytoplasmic region of bovine BTN1A1. Binding was stoichiometric, with one XOR dimer binding to either two BTN1A1 monomers or one dimer. XOR bound to BTN1A1 orthologs from mice, humans, or cows but not to the cytoplasmic domains of the closely related human paralogs, BTN2A1 or BTN3A1, or to the B30.2 domain of human RoRet (TRIM 38), a protein in the TRIM family. Analysis of the protein composition of the MFGM of wild type and BTN1A1 null mice showed that most of the XOR in mice lacking BTN1A1 was released from the MFGM in a soluble form when the milk lipid droplets were disrupted to prepare membrane, compared with wild-type mice, in which most of the XOR remained membrane-bound. Thus BTN1A1 functions in vivo to stabilize the association of XOR with the MFGM by direct interactions through the PRY/SPRY/B30.2 domain.

However, in some cases, additional N-terminal α-helices, encoded by adjacent 5′ exons are an integral part of the entire domain and may play a role in the domain舗s stability. Secondary structure predictions using NPSA and Jpred programs suggest that the equivalent BTN1A1 domain will also contain N-terminal α- helices. Therefore, the term “B30.2” is used throughout this paper to include both the predicted N-terminal α-helices (outside of the historical B30.2 domain) and the β- sandwich (for hBTN1A1, residues 285–476; see Fig. 2 of Ref. 21Woo J.S.

Suh H.Y. Park S.Y. Oh B.H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 967-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One protein that may bind to the cytoplasmic region of BTN proteins (and the B30.2 domain) is the redox enzyme, xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), 5The enzyme is expressed in most tissues as xanthine dehydrogenase. Conversion to the oxidase form occurs in the mammary gland during or following secretion into milk (see Ref. 1Ogg S.L. Weldon A.K. Dobbie L. Smith A.J. Mather I.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10084-10089Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar for discussion). For convenience, the protein is denoted throughout as xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), regardless of whether it is in the dehydrogenase or the oxidase form. According to international convention, the genes encoding human and bovine BTN1A1 and XOR are denoted BTN1A1 and XDH, respectively, and the mouse genes are denoted Btn1a1 and Xdh, respectively. because it was shown to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of mouse BTN1A1 in an in vitro binding assay (26Ishii T. Aoki N. Noda A. Adachi T. Nakamura R. Matsuda T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, one XOR-deficient mouse strain (Xdh+/−) (27Vorbach C. Scriven A. Capecchi M.R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3223-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) displayed a lactation phenotype similar to that of Btn1a1 null mice (1Ogg S.L. Weldon A.K. Dobbie L. Smith A.J. Mather I.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10084-10089Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two proteins may be functionally linked by direct interaction. These conclusions, however, have been challenged, because XOR does not co-localize with BTN1A1 in immunolabeled freeze-fractured replicates of secreted milk lipid droplets (28Robenek H. Hofnagel O. Buers I. Lorkowski S. Schnoor M. Robenek M.J. Heid H. Troyer D. Severs N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10385-10390Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and a second mouse strain deficient in XOR does not appear to have an altered lactation phenotype (29Ohtsubo T. Rovira II Starost M.F. Liu C. Finkel T. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this paper, we devise in vivo and in vitro assays to show that the cytoplasmic domain of BTN1A1 binds to XOR via the B30.2 domain and that BTN1A1 is required for the stable association of XOR with the MFGM in vivo. Furthermore, interaction with XOR appears to be limited to BTN1A1 orthologs. These results are discussed in the context of potential functions of BTN1A1 in the mammary gland and other tissues and the relationship of BTN1A1 to other BTN family members. Reduced glutathione, vitamins, amino acids, pepstatin A, leupeptin, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, Nα-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, aprotinin, digitonin, and adjuvants were obtained from Sigma.

Recombinant proteins were expressed in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, because the genome does not contain the XOR gene (30Wood V. Gwilliam R. Rajandream M.A. Lyne M. Lyne R. Stewart A. Sgouros J. Peat N.

Potential interactions between BTN and endogenous XOR were thus avoided. cDNAs were inserted 3′ to the GST gene in the pESP-1 vector supplied with the ESP-Yeast Protein Expression and Purification System (Stratagene) (see supplemental Table 1S for details, definitions, nomenclature, and abbreviations for the vectors used). Deletion constructs were prepared using PCR (see supplemental Table 2S for primer pairs). SP-Q01 S. pombe cells were transformed with the completed vectors and grown in 1l cultures, as recommended by the manufacturer. In initial experiments, cells were resuspended in a mixture of 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (PBS1) and lysed by vortexing with glass beads for 5–7 min in the presence of proteinase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μl/ml aprotinin (8.2 IU/ml), 1 μm pepstatin A, 100 μm leupeptin) and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. In later experiments, improved yields of protein (6–10 mg of protein/liter) were obtained by resuspending the cells in a modified lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, Roche Applied Science protease inhibitors, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μl/ml aprotinin (8.2 IU/ml)) and breaking the cells with a French press. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 × gav for 30 min, followed by 34,000 × gav for 1 h in a Beckman model XL-90 ultracentrifuge. Recombinant proteins were purified by chromatography on glutathione resins following standard procedures. GST was removed from the recombinant proteins by digestion with thrombin (GE Healthcare). ∼5-mg batches of purified fusion protein were rebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated overnight with gentle agitation at 22 °C in 5.0 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and thrombin (10 NIH enzyme units/mg of fusion protein). The recombinant protein was recovered from the supernatant, and the thrombin was removed by gel filtration on Superdex 200. Total RNA was purified from lactating mouse mammary gland using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and XOR and BTN1A1 cDNAs prepared by reverse transcription-PCR using the SuperScriptTM III One-Step RT-PCR kit from Invitrogen and specific primers complementary to the 5′ and 3′ mouse Xdh and Btn1a1 open reading frames, respectively. The region of the cDNA encoding the processed form of mBTN1A1 with the N-terminal signal sequence removed was amplified with a second set of primers (supplemental Table 2S), which introduced XhoI and XmaI restriction enzyme sites into the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and the amplified product was cloned into the pECFP-C1 vector (Clontech Living Color vectors), which had been mutated so as to encode monomerized ECFP (enhanced cyan fluorescent protein). The signal peptide of mBTN1A1 was then inserted 5′ of the ECFP gene using primers incorporating NheI and AgeI restriction enzyme sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The completed vector thus encoded the mBTN1A1 signal sequence, followed by the ECFP gene fused to the mature form of mBTN1A1. Deletion constructs (supplemental Table 1S) were prepared by amplifying the appropriate regions of the open reading frame of Btn1a1 using the primers listed in supplemental Table 2S. A vector encoding mXOR with monomerized EYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) at the C terminus was constructed using primers encoding NheI and XmaI restriction enzyme sites at the 5′- and 3′- ends, respectively (supplemental Table 2S), and the amplified product cloned into the pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech). All PCR products were verified by sequencing. C3H mice were killed on day 10 of lactation by asphyxiation in CO2, and all of the mammary glands were excised and weighed. Connective and adipose tissue were removed, and three volumes of Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 10 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) containing proteinase inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 0.1 mm Nα-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 1.0 ml/100 ml (8.2 IU/ml) aprotinin, and 1 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid) were added per g of tissue. The tissue was minced finely and homogenized on ice using a Polytron homogenizer by giving five pulses of 10 s each at a speed setting of eight. Homogenates were filtered through two layers of cheesecloth premoistened with TBS, and the filtrates were centrifuged at 1,000 × gav for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain sediments, operationally called the nuclear pellet. The postnuclear supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × gav at 4 °C for 1 h, and the resulting postmicrosomal supernatants were retained for analysis. Postmicrosomal supernatants (50 mg of protein) were fractionated on 2-ml glutathione affinity columns, which had been saturated previously with either GST-mBTN1A1cyto (test column) or GST (control column). The columns were washed with PBS1, and bound protein was eluted with 10 ml of 10 mm reduced glutathione. Fractions containing protein were combined and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The entire procedure was repeated a total of three times with similar results. HEK 293T cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in 20 × 10 × 10-mm LAB-Tek culture chambers and co-transfected, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), with pmXOR-EYFP and a pECFP-mBTN1A1 vector (0.15 μg, each), encoding either full-length ECFP-mBTN1A1 or deletion constructs (supplemental Table 1S). Cultures were incubated overnight, and the cells were then washed three times with KHM buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 110 mm potassium acetate, and 2 mm MgCl2). Micrographs of selected cells were recorded using a Leica DMIRE2 fluorescence light microscope employing excitation wavelengths of 438 nm for ECFP and 500 nm for EYFP and separately visualizing the fluorophores between 426 and 450 nm and 488 and 512 nm, respectively. KHM buffer containing 20 μm digitonin was then added to permeabilize the plasma membrane. Soluble fluorescent fusion protein was allowed to diffuse out of the cells, and a second set of micrographs was recorded after there was no further change in the fluorescence signal (3–5 min). Transfection efficiencies were in the 50–70% range for each experiment, and ∼90% of the doubly transfected cells in any one microscope field displayed the fluorescence patterns described. Control and transfected cells, as above, were suspended in 3 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, and proteinase inhibitors, and mechanically disrupted by passage through a 27-gauge needle (10 times). The postnuclear supernatants were fractionated into membrane and cytosol fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × gav for 1 h and analyzed by Western blotting. Fusion proteins on the blots were detected with cross-reactive antibody to GFP (Invitrogen) diluted 1–2,500-fold, followed with a 1–10,000-fold dilution of goat anti-(rabbit IgG) horseradish peroxidase conjugate. For immunoprecipitation from HEK 293T cells, cultures were grown in 10-cm dishes and transfected with a total of 12 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine 2000. Control and transfected cells were harvested in Dulbecco舗s PBS (Invitrogen) and the above proteinase inhibitors (PBS2) and mechanically disrupted by passage through a 27-gauge needle a total of 10 times. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × gav for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration of the postnuclear supernatants was adjusted to 2.4 mg/ml. RIPA buffer (2×) was then added so that the final concentrations of the constituents were protein 1.2 mg/ml, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C with end-over-end stirring for 10 min, the detergent-soluble extracts were recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 × gav for 5 min and then precleared by incubation with protein A-coated beads at 4 °C for 1 h (20 μl of beads per 1.2 ml of RIPA buffer extract). To ensure optimal precipitation of potential XOR-BTN1A1 complexes, protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were titrated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to mXOR to determine the minimum amount of antibody required to precipitate all of the XOR from the RIPA buffer extracts. Immunoprecipitates were collected on the beads by incubating 20 μl of optimally coated XOR-antibody/protein A beads with 1.0 ml of each RIPA buffer extract, overnight, at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS2, and the bound protein was dissolved in SDS-PAGE buffer at 95 °C for 3 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For immunoprecipitations from lactating mammary tissue, total membrane fractions were collected from the postnuclear supernatants of tissue homogenates as described under “Affinity Chromatography of Tissue Extracts on a Glutathione Matrix.” After washing once with TBS, the microsomal membranes were extracted with RIPA buffer, and the immunoprecipitations were conducted on the clarified RIPA buffer extracts essentially as described above for HEK 293T cells. The immunoprecipitations were repeated with total membrane fractions from three wild-type (Btn1a1+/+) and three Btn1a1−/− C57/Bl6 mice, all at day 10 of lactation. GST fusion proteins at final concentrations of 0.01–2 μm were bound to 0.2 ml (packed volume) of glutathione-coated beads in 0.5–1.0 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, for 3 h at 4 °C, and the beads were then washed three times with 1.0-ml aliquots of PBS. For the binding assays, the beads were divided into 20-μl portions and incubated overnight with XOR purified from bovine milk (bXO) (0.1–2 μm, monomeric Mr) in a total volume of 1.0 ml at 4 °C, with end-over-end stirring, in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The beads were then briefly washed three times with 1.0-ml aliquots of ice-cold PBS and heated to 95 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Aliquots of the centrifuged supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, together with known amounts of fusion protein and bXOR as standards (0.5–8 μg). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and amounts of fusion protein and bXOR in the samples were determined using Quantity One 1-D Analysis software (Bio-Rad). Binding was assayed either with constant amounts of fusion protein on the beads and increasing amounts of bXOR or"

For each of these enzymes, the minor effects of changing viscosity indicate that kcat/Km is governed by the central chemical events in the enzyme-substrate complex rather than by enzyme-substrate encounter. Individual Arrhenius plots, obtained at intervals between pH 4.8 and 11.0, yielded ΔH‡ and TΔS‡ for the nonenzymatic methanolysis of ATP2−, ATP3−, and ATP4− in the absence of Mg2+. The addition of Mg2+ led to partly compensating changes in ΔH‡ and TΔS‡, accelerating the nonenzymatic methanolysis of ATP 11-fold at pH 7 and 25 °C. The rate enhancements produced by yeast hexokinase, homoserine kinase, and N-acetylgalactosamine kinase (obtained by comparison of their kcat/Km values in the presence of saturating phosphoryl acceptor with the second order rate constant for methanolysis of MgATP) ranged between 1012- and 1014-fold. Their nominal affinities for the altered substrates in the transition state were 2.1 × 10−16m for N-acetylgalactosamine kinase, 7.4 × 10−17m for homoserine kinase, and 6.4 × 10−18m for hexokinase. Compared with nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer, all three kinases were found to produce major reductions in the entropy of activation, in accord with the likelihood that substrate juxtaposition and desolvation play prominent roles in their catalytic action.

Compared with nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer, all three kinases were found to produce major reductions in the entropy of activation, in accord with the likelihood that substrate juxtaposition and desolvation play prominent roles in their catalytic action. A common property shared by enzymes catalyzing biological reactions that involve a single substrate and hydrolytic and hydration reactions in which the effective concentration of water (the second substrate) cannot be elevated much above its concentration in living tissue is their ability to lower the reaction heat of activation. The rates of these enzymatic reactions are less sensitive to temperature than are the rates of the uncatalyzed reactions, so that the rate enhancements and transition state affinities generated by enzymes of this kind increase with decreasing temperature. Entropic effects tend to be minor, with an average change in the entropy of activation that approaches zero (1Wolfenden R. Snider M. Ridgway C. Miller B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7419-7420Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). That behavior seems understandable in view of the absence of a second substrate or the fact that the second substrate (water) is present in abundance. Thus, approximation effects seem relatively unlikely to play a major role in catalysis by enzymes of those types. Instead, enthalpic effects play a prominent role in catalysis, consistent with the formation in the transition state of new electrostatic and H-bonds between the enzyme and substrate, for which much evidence exists in the structures of enzymes crystallized with transition state analogue inhibitors (1Wolfenden R. Snider M. Ridgway C. Miller B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7419-7420Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The effects of enzymes on the enthalpies and entropies of activation of two-substrate reactions remain largely unexplored. The thermodynamics of activation (for an enzyme reaction and for the corresponding uncatalyzed reaction) were examined recently for an unusual two-substrate enzyme (2Sievers A. Beringer M. Rodnina M.V. Wolfenden R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7897-7901Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 3Schroeder G.K. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4037-4044Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome was found to produce a 3 × 107-fold enhancement of the rate of peptidyl ester aminolysis entirely by rendering TΔS‡ more favorable, whereas ΔH‡ was actually found to become less favorable on the enzyme than in solution (3Schroeder G.K. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4037-4044Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Juxtaposition, that is, the gathering of two or more substrates at an enzyme active site in a configuration appropriate for reaction, appears to be partly responsible for that rate enhancement, and desolvation of the substrates may also contribute to the observed rate enhancement (4Trobro S. Aqvist J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7049-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Sharma P.K. Xiang Y. Kato M. Warshel A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11307-11314Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, the ribosome might be said to function as a predominantly “physical” catalyst, bringing the substrates near each other in a water-poor environment rather than as a predominantly “chemical” catalyst that participates in the reaction as a general acid or a general base. Consistent with that interpretation is the finding that ribosomal peptidyl transfer is very strongly inhibited by a bisubstrate analogue devised by Yarus and co-workers (6Welch M. Chastang J. Yarus M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because of its unusual composition (consisting entirely of RNA) and the relatively small rate enhancement that it produces, the behavior of the peptidyltransferase center of the ribosome seems unlikely to be typical of two-substrate enzymes in general. The present work was undertaken with the limited objective of determining the magnitude and thermodynamic basis of the rate enhancements that are produced by several more conventional protein enzymes that catalyze reactions involving more than one substrate. The three enzymes examined here, yeast hexokinase, N-acetylgalactosamine kinase, and homoserine kinase, all bind the phosphoryl acceptor and MgATP in random order (7Danenberg K.D. Cleland W.W.

These enzymes are stable and active over the temperature range between 0 and 50 °C, and product inhibition is negligible under the conditions of these experiments. These three enzymes were chosen because they have different active site architectures that have led to different hypotheses about their mechanisms of action. The active site of yeast hexokinase is equipped with an aspartate residue that may act as a general base that deprotonates the acceptor alcohol (12Cleland W.W. Hengge A.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Many kinases are equipped with such a residue (13Jones J.P. Weiss P.M. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3634-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), although the extent of its involvement in the rate-determining step is unclear (14Matte A. Tari L.W. Delbaere L.T. Structure. 1998; 6: 413-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast, the crystal structures of N-acetylgalactosamine kinase (GalNAcK) 2The abbreviations used are: GalNAcKN-acetylgalactosamine kinaseITCisothermal titration calorimetryMePmethyl phosphateHSKhomoserine kinase. 2The abbreviations used are: GalNAcKN-acetylgalactosamine kinaseITCisothermal titration calorimetryMePmethyl phosphateHSKhomoserine kinase. and homoserine kinase (HSK) suggest the absence of an active site residue that might act as a general base. Thoden and Holden (15Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32784-32791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have suggested that GalNAcK catalyzes phosphoryl transfer by juxtaposition of its two substrates, with a dissociative transition state like that of the spontaneous reaction. In the case of HSK, Krishna et al. (16Krishna S.S. Zhou T. Daugherty M. Osterman A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10810-10818Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have proposed that the enzyme juxtaposes the substrates and stabilizes the non-bridging oxygen atoms of ATP in the transition state by interaction with backbone NH groups and by the positive end of a helix dipole. That proposal would seem to imply an associative transition state in which the non-bridging oxygen atoms carry more negative charge than they carry in the ground state. In a dissociative transition state, the non-bridging oxygen atoms would be expected to bear less negative charge than they do in the ground state, so that pairing them with positively charged groups would actually be expected to be anti-catalytic.

For comparison with these enzyme-catalyzed reactions of MgATP, we sought to determine the rate of a similar reaction in the absence of a catalyst. Earlier work has shown that at elevated temperatures, the γ-phosphorus atom of MgATP undergoes spontaneous attack by water in the absence of enzyme (17Tetas M. Lowenstein J.M. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), that normal alcohols compete effectively with water in water-alcohol mixtures (18Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and that in the transition state for spontaneous alcoholysis and hydrolysis, the bond to the leaving group appears to be almost fully broken, whereas the bond to the attacking nucleophile has only begun to form (18Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Because Admiraal and Herschlag have shown that the rate of reaction is insensitive to the nature of the nucleophilic alcohol, a simple alcohol such as methanol would be expected to serve as a reasonable model for the reaction catalyzed by any kinase that mediates direct phosphoryl transfer from MgATP to an alcoholic acceptor. We, therefore, chose to examine the thermodynamics of activation for the methanolysis of ATP in the presence and absence of Mg2+ at various pH values using proton NMR to follow the course of reactions conducted in sealed tubes at elevated temperatures. Unless otherwise noted, reagents were obtained from Sigma. The β-O-methyl ester of ADP (ADP-O-CH3) and the α-O-methyl ester of AMP (AMP-O-CH3) were prepared by condensation of ADP or AMP with methanol in the presence of 0.1 m dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in methanol as described by Darzykiewicz et al. (19Darzynkiewicz E. Ekiel I. Tahara S.M. Seliger L.S. Shatkin A.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1701-1707Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, ADP or ATP (0.025 m), methanol (2 m), and anionic buffers (0.1 m, pH 4.8–9.0) were sealed in quartz tubes under vacuum and incubated in convection ovens (Barnstead/Thermolyne Corp., model 47900) at temperatures ranging between 50 and 110 °C (±1.5 °C as indicated by an American Society for Testing and Materials thermometer) for varying periods of time in buffers (0.1 m) consisting of potassium acetate (pH 4.8–6.0), methyl phosphonate (pH 7.0–8.0), or sodium carbonate (pH 9.0–11.0). Separate experiments involving the addition of potassium chloride showed that at the buffer concentrations used, reactions were insensitive to changes in ionic strength (less than 3% variation with ionic strength varying from 0.1 to 1.0). After reaction, samples were prepared for analysis by evaporation to dryness and dilution with D2O containing sodium carbonate buffer (0.1 m, pD 10.0), with dioxane (1.8 × 10−4m) added as an internal integration standard (8 H, δ = 3.7 ppm). The integrated intensities of the proton signals arising from methyl phosphate and from the C8 adenine protons of ATP, ADP, and AMP (Fig. 1) were then measured using a Varian 600 MHz spectrometer. Data were acquired for a minimum of four transients using a standard water suppression pulse sequence and processed using SpinWorks (20Marat K. SpinWorks. University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada1999–2007Google Scholar). In reactions conducted in the presence of MgCl2 and MnCl2, the concentration of metal ions (0.025 m) exceeded the value of Kd by at least 2 orders of magnitude (21Smith R.M. Alberty R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 2376-2380Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In experiments with added Mn2+, samples were prepared for NMR analysis by first removing Mn2+ ions by stirring with Chelex 100 beads (25% by volume) for 30 min followed by filtration to remove the beads. That treatment was repeated three times, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness and taken up in D2O for 1H NMR as described above. Homoserine kinase from Methanococcus jannaschii and human N-acetylgalactosamine kinase were a gift from Drs. Hazel Holden and James Thoden of the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Enzyme assays were performed using isothermal titration calorimetry (VP-ITC, Microcal, Northampton, MA) as described by Todd and Gomez (22Todd M.J. Gomez J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To determine kcat/Km using ATP as the variable substrate, the enzyme (∼1 × 10−8m active sites) and saturating (0.01 m) substrate (see below) were first prepared in HEPES buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.0) with magnesium chloride (5 × 10−3m) and degassed for 10 min to prevent bubble formation during the experiment. After thermal equilibration and a 200-s time lag to establish a base line, the second substrate, ATP (0.0075 ml), was injected into the reaction mixture (1.45 ml) to initiate the reaction. The final concentration of ATP (1 × 10−5m) was well below its Km value for each of the enzymes examined (1.0 × 10−4m for homoserine kinase (Table 1), 6.3 × 10−5m for hexokinase (23Sem D.S. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4978-4984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 8.3 × 10−5m for N-acetylgalactosamine kinase (Table 1)). In experiments of this kind, the enzyme reaction releases an amount of heat directly proportional to the amount of substrate turned over. The instrument output (Fig. 2A) reflects the amount of energy required to offset the heat generated by the reaction, and the lightly shaded area under the instrument response curve (Fig. 2A) represents the amount of heat generated in the turnover of 1 × 10−5m ATP.

Typically, conditions were arranged so that reactions ran to completion in ∼2000 s. The first 10% of the curve (excluding ∼30 s allowed for mixing immediately after injection) was used to calculate the rate constant. In a plot of the product formed as a function of time (Fig. 1B), that portion of the curve is approximately linear, and its slope is proportional to the second order rate constant, kcat/Km, kcatKm=slope[EA][ATP](Eq. 2) where [EA] is the concentration of the enzyme saturated with the phosphoryl acceptor. To verify the accuracy of this method, the results obtained calorimetrically at 25 °C were compared with those obtained using a coupled assay to detect ADP generation by the decrease in UV absorbance at 340 nm, arising from the oxidation of NADH in the presence of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (24Kornberg A. Pricer Jr., W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 481-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 25 °C. The results obtained by these methods were in close agreement with each other, and the kcat and Km values determined by ITC were in close agreement with values from the literature (Table 1). Relative viscosities were adjusted over the range between 1.0 and 6.5 by adding trehalose, polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight = 300), or sucrose. Viscosities of buffered solutions were measured using a Cannon-Fiske kinetic viscometer at 25 °C. Rate constants (kcat and kcat/Km) were determined using both the ITC method and the coupled enzyme assay described above. Effects of viscosity on kcat/Km were determined for each enzyme in the presence of saturating phosphoryl-accepting substrate (0.01 m) and subsaturating ATP (1 × 10−5m). Effects of viscosity on kcat were determined with both ATP and the phosphoryl acceptor at saturating concentrations (0.01 m). In the presence of methanol the major reaction product was methyl phosphate (MeP), formed by transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group to methanol in a reaction analogous to the reactions catalyzed by kinases that phosphorylate hydroxyl groups. In principle, other products could also be formed by the reaction of ATP with methanol. Thus, methanol attack could occur at the β-position in a reaction analogous to that catalyzed by GTP diphosphokinase and thiamine diphosphokinase, or cleavage could occur between the α- and β-phosphoryl groups to yield ADP-O-CH3 (by methanol attack at the β-phosphoryl group) or AMP-O-CH3 (by attack at the α-phosphoryl group). Although no enzymes appear to catalyze reactions of the first type, many enzymes catalyze reactions of the second type, including DNA polymerases, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and acyl-CoA synthetases. Finally, in a reaction analogous to that catalyzed by S-adenosyl methionine synthetase, ATP could undergo attack at the γ-phosphoryl group to yield 5′-methyl adenosine and inorganic triphosphate. In fact, a small amount of ADP-O-CH3, equal to ∼1.5% of the amount of MeP formed, was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of the product mixture arising from ATP methanolysis at pH 7.0 (doublet; δ = 3.55). Its identity was confirmed by the addition of authentic ADP-O-CH3. At low pH, but not at pH 7, a small amount of adenosine was also formed (∼1% the amount of MeP). No other products were observed by 31P or 1H NMR at pH 4.8 or 9.0 or in the presence of 0.025 m Mg2+ at pH 7.0. The sensitivity of the instrument was such that formation of methyl pyrophosphate or AMP-O-CH3 would have been observable if either of those reactions had occurred at rates equivalent to >0.1% of the rate of formation of MeP. In aqueous methanol, ATP hydrolysis and methanolysis occur concurrently, and ADP formed during the reaction can then undergo a second hydrolysis or methanolysis reaction (Fig. 3) (the amount of AMP obtained by hydrolysis is equal to the difference between total amounts of AMP and MeP formed). To calculate the rate of ADP methanolysis, the observed rate of ADP decomposition (k3 + k4), k3+k4=In([ADP]t[ADP]0)t(Eq. 3) was divided into methanolysis and hydrolysis terms based on the relative amounts of MeP and AMP formed, k3k4=[AMP]−[MeP][MeP](Eq. 4) These equations were combined to evaluate k4, k3+k4=k4[([AMP]−[MeP][MeP])+1](Eq. 5) ATP methanolysis is more complicated to analyze because MeP derived from ADP also contributes to the amount of product observed. To estimate the value of k2, the disappearance of ATP was monitored to determine the composite rate constant (k1 + k2). The amount of “transient ADP” that decomposes in a second phosphorylation reaction is equal to the amount of AMP formed. Based on transient ADP and the ratio of k3 to k4 determined previously, the amount of MeP derived from ADP was estimated and subtracted from the total amount of MeP formed. The corrected result, representing the amount of MeP derived from ATP, was used to determine k2. The resulting rate constants were found to vary in proportion to the methanol concentration (data not shown). Arrhenius plots obtained for ADP and ATP methanolysis at pH 5.5 and 7.0 were found to be virtually superimposable (Fig. 4, top and middle panels). But at pH 9.0, where ADP and ATP are completely unprotonated, ATP4− reacted approximately twice as rapidly as ADP3− over the temperature range from 50 to 110 °C (Fig. 4, lower panel). That difference was also noted by Admiraal and Herschlag (18Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) in earlier experiments at high pH. To obtain information about the methanolysis of ATP2−, ATP3−, and ATP4− in the absence of Mg2+, Arrhenius plots with at least six data points were gathered over the temperature range from 50 to 110 °C (R2 ≥ 0.975) at each of seven pH values between 4.8 and 9.0. Apparent pKa values of 6.5 and 4.3 were determined by titration at 25 °C under the conditions of the experiment. Comparable pKa values were reported earlier at this temperature and ionic strength (25Alberty R.A. Smith R.M. Bock R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 425-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The methanolysis of ATP showed a gradual decrease in rate with increasing pH (Fig. 5). Similar behavior was described earlier by Tetas and Lowenstein (17Tetas M. Lowenstein J.M. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) for ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly, ΔH‡ and TΔS‡ differed for each species of ATP, leading to an unusual pH profile with a maximum in the enthalpic barrier and a minimum in the entropic barrier at pH 6.0 (Fig. 5). The complexity of this behavior presumably arises from the very different heats of ionization of amines and phosphoric acid derivatives, and the fact that the ionization of ATP at pH 4.2 involves the loss of a proton from N1 of the adenine ring, whereas the ionization of ATP at pH 6.5 involves deprotonation of the γ-phosphoryl group (see “Discussion” for further information about the ionization of ATP). At pH 6.0–9.0, the contributions of ATP3− and ATP4− dominate the observed activation parameters, and at pH 5.5 and 4.8 the contribution of ATP2− to the observed activation parameters becomes evident (shaded portion of Fig. 5). Rate constants and activation parameters for ATP3− methanolysis (Table 2) were estimated from the observed rates at pH 6.0–8.0, the measured rate constant for ATP4− methanolysis at pH 9.0, and the relative abundance of the ionized species of ATP3− derived from a titration curve. For example, at pH 8.0, 92.5% of ATP is present as ATP4−, and 7.5% of ATP is present as ATP3−. The rate of methanolysis of ATP4−, measured at pH 9.0, was found to be 7.1 × 10−11m−1 s−1. The observed rate constant for methanolysis at pH 8.0, 1.6 × 10−10m−1 s−1, is the sum of the rate constants for ATP4− methanolysis and ATP3− methanolysis, with both values adjusted to reflect the relative abundance of the reacting species: (0.925)(7.1×10−11)+(0.075)(kATP3−)=1.6×10−10M−1S−1(Eq. 6) In the same manner, the rate constant for ATP3− methanolysis was calculated for experiments carried out at pH 6.0, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. The average of the four values obtained for the rate constant for ATP3− methanolysis was 1.3 × 10−9m−1 s−1, with a ΔG‡ value of 29.5 kcal/mol. No single value deviated from that average by more than 0.4 kcal/mol.TABLE 2Rate constants and thermodynamics of activation for the methanolysis (boldface type) and hydrolysis (lightface type) of different species of ATPΔG‡ΔH‡TΔS‡k25cMethanolysis rate constants are expressed in s−1m−1.

Open table in a new tab The value of ΔH‡ was estimated from the slopes of the Arrhenius plots obtained at pH 6.0, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. The average value for ΔH‡ obtained from the four experiments was 26.8 kcal/mol. No single value deviated from that average by more than 0.8 kcal/mol. Because excessive amounts of divalent cation lead to aggregation of MgATP complexes (26Glonek T. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1533-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Mg2+ was maintained in these experiments at a concentration equivalent to that of the nucleotide. ITC experiments (not shown) indicated dissociation constants of 1.7 × 10−5m for MgATP and 1.47 × 10−4m for MgADP at 25 °C, in reasonable agreement with values from the literature (21Smith R.M. Alberty R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 2376-2380Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). At 25 °C, with both components present at a concentration of 0.025 m, 97% of the ATP and 93% of the ADP are present as their Mg2+ complexes, and their Kd values have been shown to decrease with increasing temperature (27Wang P. Oscarson J.L. Izatt R.M. Watt G.D. Larsen C.D. J. Solution Chem. 1995; 24: 989-1012Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Titrations of MgATP or MgADP indicated that at pH 7.0 the phosphoryl groups are completely unprotonated (MgATP2− and MgADP−). Whereas ADP and ATP are similarly reactive in the absence of Mg2+ (as described above), these nucleotides were found to exhibit differing reactivities in the presence of Mg2+ (Table 2). Fig. 6 shows Arrhenius plots for the methanolysis of MgATP, the methanolysis of MgADP, and the methanolysis of ATP in the absence of Mg2+ at pH 7.0. Data are shown in pairs to facilitate visual comparison. At all temperatures examined Mg2+ enhanced the rate of ATP methanolysis. And when the Arrhenius plots were extrapolated to room temperature, it became evident that Mg2+ accelerates ATP methanolysis by ∼1 order of magnitude at 25 °C (Fig. 6A), a larger factor than had been observed in earlier experiments at higher temperatures (17Tetas M. Lowenstein J.M. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W1996907772,"Background During evolution, innate immunity has been tuned to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. However, some α-Proteobacteria are stealthy intracellular pathogens not readily detected by this system. Brucella members follow this strategy and are highly virulent, but other Brucellaceae like Ochrobactrum are rhizosphere inhabitants and only opportunistic pathogens. To gain insight into the emergence of the stealthy strategy, we compared these two phylogenetically close but biologically divergent bacteria. Methodology/Principal Findings In contrast to Brucella abortus, Ochrobactrum anthropi did not replicate within professional and non-professional phagocytes and, whereas neutrophils had a limited action on B. abortus, they were essential to control O. anthropi infections. O. anthropi triggered proinflammatory responses markedly lower than Salmonella enterica but higher than B. abortus. In macrophages and dendritic cells, the corresponding lipopolysaccharides reproduced these grades of activation, and binding of O. anthropi lipopolysaccharide to the TLR4 co-receptor MD-2 and NF-κB induction laid between those of B. abortus and enteric bacteria lipopolysaccharides. These differences correlate with reported variations in lipopolysaccharide core sugars, sensitivity to bactericidal peptides and outer membrane permeability. Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that Brucellaceae ancestors carried molecules not readily recognized by innate immunity, so that non-drastic variations led to the emergence of stealthy intracellular parasites. They also suggest that some critical envelope properties, like selective permeability, are profoundly altered upon modification of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and that this represents a further adaptation to the host. It is proposed that this adaptive trend is relevant in other intracellular α-Proteobacteria like Bartonella, Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Wolbachia."

Epithelial surfaces, such as the skin and the mucosal and squamous epithelia of the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts, are the major sites of cathelicidin function that includes homeostasis as well as immune responses. Accumulating evidence suggests that the expression, which is either constitutive or modulated by external stimuli, as well as the regulatory mechanisms, may be stimulus- and tissue-specific (20Schauber J.

Thus, normal skin and the colonic epithelium express very low levels of cathelicidin, although high basal expression is found in bone marrow, thymus, and several other tissues (19Bals R. Wang X.

On the other hand, sodium butyrate (NaB) so far remains the most potent inducer of cathelicidin in the colon epithelial cells (22Hase K. Eckmann L. Leopard J.D. Varki N. Kagnoff M.F. Infect.

Gut. 2003; 52: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although researchers have described several NaB-responsive elements in the cathelicidin upstream regulatory region, efforts to identify specific trans-acting factors remain largely elusive (39Termén S. Tollin M. Rodriguez E. Sveinsdóttir S.H. Jóhannesson B. Cederlund A. Sjövall J. Agerberth B. Gudmundsson G.H. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recent reports have suggested a role for intracellular signaling molecules like ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and transforming growth factor-β1 kinase in NaB-mediated up-regulation of cathelicidin expression (38Schauber J. Svanholm C. Termén S. Iffland K. Menzel T. Scheppach W. Melcher R. Agerberth B. Lührs H. Gudmundsson G.H. Gut. 2003; 52: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 40Schwab M. Reynders V. Shastri Y. Loitsch S. Stein J. Schröder O. Mol.

Several pathogenic microorganisms have been demonstrated to either up- or down-regulate cathelicidin in the mucosal ECs (5Islam D. Bandholtz L. Nilsson J. Wigzell H. Christensson B. Agerberth B.

Activation of cAMP-signaling pathways involves accumulation of cAMP second messenger inside the cells and subsequent phosphorylation of the cellular kinases (44Schwartz J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 13482-13484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A (PKA) is the best known cAMP effector that regulates transcription mainly through direct phosphorylation and activation of the bZip family members CREB, CREM τ, and ATF1. Activated bZip family transcription factors bind the consensus cAMP-response element (CRE) sequences over the promoters of the cAMP-responsive genes (45Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4717-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 46Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar sequence called AP-1-response element/TPA-response element (ARE/TRE) is occupied by activated AP-1 family proteins c-Fos and c-Jun. These molecules may be transcriptionally induced by CREB (47Nakamura T. Datta R. Sherman M.L. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22011-22015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or regulated post-translationally through phosphorylation by MAPKs (48Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar), which extensively cross-talk with the cAMP-PKA pathway. Although p38 MAPK is usually activated by cAMP, JNK and ERK may be either positively or negatively regulated (49Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 50Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Activated ERK and p38 MAPK in turn may phosphorylate CREB. CRE- and ARE/TRE-binding factors also include several transcriptional repressors. Although the majority of them (CREMα, -β, and -γ, E4BP4, and CREB2) are regulated via phosphorylation by PKA, a group of CREM family members known as ICER is stringently controlled at the transcriptional level by CREB and an autoregulatory feedback mechanism (45Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4717-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 46Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies have suggested that ICER may be involved in the transcriptional repression of cathelicidin (43Chakraborty K. Ghosh S. Koley H. Mukhopadhyay A.K. Ramamurthy T. Saha D.R. Mukhopadhyay D. Roychowdhury S. Hamabata T. Takeda Y. Das S. Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 2520-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here, we have studied transcriptional regulation of cathelicidin by cAMP signal transduction pathways. We have extensively investigated the role of CREB, AP-1, and ICER in cAMP-induced regulation of cathelicidin expression in the mucosal epithelial cells. In addition, we have also studied their role in NaB-regulated cathelicidin expression. Cathelicidin is a family of small cationic antimicrobial peptides, the sole member of which in humans is called hCAP-18 (human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide 18) (Scheme 1). The full-length molecule is synthesized in the cells and stored within vesicles. It is cleaved off by protease 3, and the mature 37-amino acid-long peptide (LL-37) with antimicrobial functions is secreted outside the cells. HT-29 (HTB-38), Caco-2 (HBT-37), INT-407 (CCL6), and A459 (CCL-185) cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Sodium butyrate (NaB), purified cholera toxin, 8-bromo-cAMP, N6,2′-O-dibutyryladenosine-cAMP, forskolin (FSK), 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (DDA), prostaglandin E2, actinomycin D (ActD), and (Rp)-cAMP were purchased from Sigma. Heat-labile toxin (LT) of enterotoxigenic E. coli was a generous gift from Dr. T. Hamabata of the International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo. Cathelicidin antibody was procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and CREB, c-Jun, and c-Fos antibodies and their respective phosphoantibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Synthetic inhibitors (U0126, SB203580, MG132, and JNK inhibitor II) were procured from Calbiochem. Oligonucleotides for the cloning of c-jun (FP, 5′-GAATTCATGACTGCAAAGATGGAAACG-3′; RP, 5′-CTCGAGGACGGTCTCTCTTCTAAATG-3′), c-fos (FP, 5′-GGAATTCATGATGTTCTCGGGCTTCAACGC-3′; RP, 5′-CTCGAGTCACAGGGCCAGCAGCGTGGGTG-3′), and cathelicidin upstream regulatory sequences (FP1, 5′-TAGATGGAGCAGAGCCTTCG-3′; FP2, 5′-CTGTTACCCAGGCTGGAGTG-3′; FP3, 5′-CTGCTTCCCGGGTTCAATG-3′; FP4, 5′-TACAGGTGTGAGCCATCATG-3′; FP5, 5′-CTTGAGCACCCCTGGCTATGAC-3′, and RP, 5′-GGCCCAGCAGCAGGAGCACCA-3′) were custom-synthesized from IDT. Primers for qPCR amplification of cathelicidin (FP, 5′-CCAAGCCTGTGAGCTTCACAG-3′; RP, 5′-GGACTCTGTCCTGGGTACAAG-3′), CREB (FP, 5′-ATGACCATGGAATCTGGAGC-3′; RP, 5′-TTAATCGGATTTGTGGCAG-3′), c-jun (FP, 5′-ACAGAGCATGACCCTGAACC-3′; RP, 5′-CCGTTGCTGGACTGGATTAT-3′), c-fos (FP, 5′-GAATCCGAAGGGAAAGGAA-3′; RP, 5′-CTTCTCCTTCAGCAGGTTGG-3′), and ICER (FP, 5′-TGGAGATGAAACAGATGAGGAA-3′; RP, 5′-TCTCTGAGGGCCTTGAGTTC-3′) were also received from IDT. All the cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For experimental purposes, 2 × 105 cells were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate and allowed to grow. Cells near confluence were cultured overnight in serum-free DMEM before the experiment except for NaB treatment where 1-day post-confluent cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 48 h in the presence of NaB (4 mmol/liter). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzolTM reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer舗s instructions. cDNA was prepared from 2 μg of extracted RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the standard protocol. Real time quantitative PCR was performed using ABI7300 (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantitation was done by the comparative CT method. PCR was performed with SYBR Green® Mastermix (Applied Biosystems), where SYBR green is the fluorescent reporter. The internal control gene GAPDH was amplified simultaneously in separate reaction tubes. To eliminate primer dimers, the fluorescent signal was collected at a temperature of 82 °C, where the primer dimers melted, but the PCR products were still in their double-stranded form, thereby emitting fluorescence. The reaction conditions were set as follows: initial heating at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of reactions at 95 °C (1 min), followed by 62 °C (2.5 min), and finally 82 °C (45 s). Final extension was carried out at 62 °C for 8 min. Threshold cycle number (CT) of triplicate reactions was determined using the ABI-SDS software, and the mean CT of triplicate reactions was determined. The levels of expression of the genes of interest were normalized against GAPDH using the formula 2−ΔΔCT, where −ΔΔCT = ΔCT (sample) − ΔCT (calibrator) and ΔCT is the CT of the target gene subtracted from the CT of the housekeeping gene (GAPDH). The calibrator used in our experiments was the unstimulated HT-29 and A549 cells. CREB and dominant negative CREB (dnCREB) constructs were the generous gifts from Marc Montiminy (Salk Institute), and the ICER expression construct was kindly provided by P. Sassone-Corsi (University of California, Irvine). c-jun and c-fos were PCR-amplified from cDNAs derived from HT-29 cells using Pfu TurboTM (Stratagene). Cathelicidin putative promoter sequences and the deletion mutants were also amplified by PCR. Amplified DNAs were cloned into pBluescriptSK+ (Novagen). Positive clones were selected by blue-white screening and confirmed by sequencing in an ABI automated sequencer. Overexpression constructs of all the above genes were generated by subcloning the DNAs into the pIRES-hrGFP vector (Stratagene), and the reporter constructs of cathelicidin promoter sequences were generated by subcloning the latter into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) upstream of the luciferase gene. Expression construct of hepatitis B “X” gene (HBX) was generated by PCR amplification of the gene using a clone of hepatitis B virus whole genome (kindly provided by Dr. Hidenori Shiraha, Okayama University, Japan) as template, followed by cloning into pBluescriptSK+ and finally subcloning into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Transfection of HT-29 cells was done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer舗s instructions. Briefly, cells (1 × 105/well) were seeded in 24-well plates 18 h prior to transfection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum but no antibiotics. Cells in each well were incubated with transfection mix containing 0.75 μg of total DNA for 6 h followed by addition of complete DMEM. Transient transfection was checked after 48 h. HepG2 cells stably expressing HBX were generated by transfecting the cells as described above followed by selection with G418 (600 μg/ml) for 4 weeks. Reporter assay was done 48 h post-transfection using dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) following the manufacturer舗s protocol. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS followed by lysis with 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). The lysate was cleared by brief centrifugation, and firefly luciferase reporter activity in the clear supernatant was measured with a luminometer (Berthold). Renilla luciferase activity in the same lysate was used as transfection control. LL-37 ELISA was performed by coating the ELISA plates (Nunc) with the secreted LL-37 protein present in the culture supernatants of unstimulated or FSK-stimulated HT-29 cells. 50 μl of the culture supernatant containing 50 μg of total protein was added to each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Excess supernatants were withdrawn from the wells, which were washed twice with PBS. 200 μl of blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (1×) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were washed three times with the wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in 1× PBS) followed by the addition of 100 μl of LL-37 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted (1:100) in blocking buffer. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, wells were washed four times with the wash buffer and further incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 100 μl of HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) diluted (1:1000) in the blocking buffer. Wells were washed again four times and incubated with 50 μl (1 mg/ml) of o-phenylenediamine (Sigma) diluted in phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 5.0. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 1 n H2SO4, and absorbance was taken at 590 nm. Cell lysates were prepared by harvesting cells in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). After clearing the lysate by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, supernatants were collected, and total protein content was measured by the Bradford assay. 30 μg of total protein per well was resolved in a 12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was probed with the specific primary antibody followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) and developed using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). A nonradioactive nuclear run-on assay (51Kwei K.A. Finch J.S. Thompson E.J. Bowden G.T. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was used in conjunction with qRT-PCR to measure the transcription rate of cathelicidin in the HT-29 cell line. Briefly, 107 numbers of cells were trypsinized and washed twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 150 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and passed through a 21-gauge needle five times, which ensures lysis of the cell membrane. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The run-on reaction was carried out in a 2× transcription buffer containing 200 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm each of ATP, GTP, and CTP, 200 mm sucrose, and 20% glycerol. The reaction was initiated by adding 4 mm biotin-16-UTP (Ambion) and continued for 1 h at 29 °C. uMACS column (Miltenyi Biotec) packed with magnetic beads covalently linked to streptavidin was used to isolate the biotin-labeled run-on RNA.

https://openalex.org/W2030607398,"The precise sequence of events that enable mammary tumorigenesis to convert transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter remains incompletely understood. We show here that X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (xIAP) is essential for the ability of TGF-beta to stimulate nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in metastatic 4T1 breast cancer cells. Indeed whereas TGF-beta suppressed NF-kappaB activity in normal mammary epithelial cells, those engineered to overexpress xIAP demonstrated activation of NF-kappaB when stimulated with TGF-beta. Additionally up-regulated xIAP expression also potentiated the basal and TGF-beta-stimulated transcriptional activities of Smad2/3 and NF-kappaB. Mechanistically xIAP (i) interacted physically with the TGF-beta type I receptor, (ii) mediated the ubiquitination of TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and (iii) facilitated the formation of complexes between TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) and IkappaB kinase beta that enabled TGF-beta to activate p65/RelA and to induce the expression of prometastatic (i.e. cyclooxygenase-2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) and prosurvival (i.e. survivin) genes. We further observed that inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of xIAP or expressing a mutant ubiquitin protein (i.e. K63R-ubiquitin) was capable of blocking xIAP- and TGF-beta-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. Functionally xIAP deficiency dramatically reduced the coupling of TGF-beta to Smad2/3 in NMuMG cells as well as inhibited their expression of mesenchymal markers in response to TGF-beta. More importantly, xIAP deficiency also abrogated the formation of TAB1.IkappaB kinase beta complexes in 4T1 breast cancer cells, thereby diminishing their activation of NF-kappaB, their expression of prosurvival/metastatic genes, their invasion through synthetic basement membranes, and their growth in soft agar. Collectively our findings have defined a novel role for xIAP in mediating oncogenic signaling by TGF-beta in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048635895,"Proliferation inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is governed by the activity of a transcription factor network. Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), retinoic acid receptor (RARα), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are expressed in VSMCs and are components of such a network. However, the relationship among them in the regulation of VSMC proliferation remains unknown. Here, we investigated the mechanisms whereby Klf4 mediates the growth inhibitory effects in VSMCs through RARα and PDGFRβ. We demonstrated that Klf4 directly binds to the 5′ regulatory region of RARα, down-regulates RARα expression, and specifically inhibits RARα-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and ERK signaling in cultured VSMCs induced by the synthetic retinoid Am80. Of particular interest, Klf4 inhibits RARα and PDGFRβ expression while blocking PI3K and ERK signaling induced by Am80 and PDGF-BB, respectively. The anti-proliferative effects of Klf4 on neointimal formation depend largely on PDGFR-mediated PI3K signaling without involvement of the RARα-activated signaling pathways. These findings provide a novel mechanism for signal suppression and growth inhibitory effects of Klf4 in VSMCs.

There is considerable interest in identifying extracellular signals, signal transduction molecules, and transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of VSMC proliferation and differentiation (1Liu Y.

Res. 2008; 102: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Many different environmental cues are known to affect VSMC proliferation and differentiation, including endothelial cell-VSMC interactions, VSMC-matrix contacts, mechanical forces, and various cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), activin, and transforming growth factor-β1 (3Khan R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11661-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Krüppel-like factors (Klfs) are DNA-binding transcriptional regulators that regulate a diverse array of cellular processes, including development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Members of this family bind similar CACCC elements on DNA (5Haldar S.M. Ibrahim O.A. Jain M.K. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2007; 43: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Klf4 was first identified as being highly expressed in epithelial cells, and gain/loss of function studies in vivo have confirmed a critical role for this factor in epithelial cell differentiation (6Suzuki T. Aizawa K. Matsumura T. Nagai R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has underlined the importance of Klf4 in a wide range of cellular processes, such as endothelial pro-inflammatory activation, macrophage gene expression, tumor cell development, and stem cell biology (7Feinberg M.W.

Klf4 was also isolated as a Klf expressed in the vasculature and could be induced by shear stress (8Feinberg M.W. Lin Z. Fisch S. Jain M.K. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Klf4 has been shown to repress the transforming growth factor-β-dependent increase in VSMC differentiation markers, including those for α-smooth muscle actin and SM22α (1Liu Y. Sinha S. Owens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48004-48011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that Klf4 represses myocardin-induced VSMC gene activation and myocardin expression itself (9Liu Y. Sinha S. McDonald O.G. Shang Y. Hoofnagle M.H. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9719-9727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Although Klf4 is not normally expressed in differentiated SMCs, it is up-regulated in PDGF-BB-treated cultured SMCs and in response to vascular injury in vivo (10McDonald O.G. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 36-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, Klf4 may be a key effector of SMC phenotypic switching (11Pidkovka N.A. Cherepanova O.A. Yoshida T. Alexander M.R. Deaton R.A. Thomas J.A. Leitinger N. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 792-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Kawai-Kowase K. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C59-C69Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a key integration point in the signal transduction cascade that links diverse extracellular stimuli to proliferation, differentiation, and survival (13Milella M. Kornblau S.M. Estrov Z. Carter B.Z. Lapillonne H. Harris D. Konopleva M. Zhao S. Estey E. Andreeff M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Among the MAPK subfamilies, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK is known to mediate terminal differentiation in many retinoid-induced cells (14Yen A. Roberson M.S. Varvayanis S. Lee A.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3163-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pettersson F. Couture M.C. Hanna N. Miller W.H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7053-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for the existence of additional retinoid-activated signaling pathways. One such pathway involves the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). An increasing body of experimental evidence has shown that PI3K regulates a variety of cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival (16Rosner D. Stoneman V. Littlewood T. McCarthy N. Figg N. Wang Y. Tellides G. Bennett M. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 2054-2063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been shown that cross-talk between the PI3K and ERK pathways may enhance or attenuate extracellular signals (17Campbell M. Allen W.E. Sawyer C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Trimble E.R. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In VSMCs, ligand-activated PDGF receptor (PDGFR) increases proliferation, whereas retinoic acid receptor (RARα) inhibits growth and promotes differentiation (18Mellgren A.M. Smith C.L. Olsen G.S.

Physiol. 2003; 285: H1370-H1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PDGFR activation triggers a cascade of downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K and ERK, and enhances proliferation (22Mehrhof F.B. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Dietz R. Scheidereit C. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, RARα activation triggers PI3K and MAPK pathways and stimulates actin remodeling (23Day R.M. Lee Y.H. Park A.M. Suzuki Y.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 34: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Proliferation inhibition of VSMCs is governed by the activity of a transcription factor network. Klf4 is one component of such a network. To understand further the regulatory role of Klf4 in VSMC proliferation and differentiation, we characterized the signaling pathways activated by Klf4 and determined its ability to influence PDGFR and RARα downstream signaling. We demonstrated that Klf4 overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and PI3K and ERK pathways. The binding of Klf4 to the 5′ regulatory region of RARα down-regulates RARα expression and also leads to impaired RARα-mediated PI3K and ERK signaling. Although Klf4 was found to be itself regulated by the PI3K pathway activated by the synthetic retinoid Am80, the anti-proliferative effects of Klf4 are independent of RARα. We further identified that Klf4 plays important anti-proliferative roles through inhibition of the PDGFRβ-mediated PI3K pathway.DISCUSSIONProliferation and differentiation of VSMCs are tightly regulated processes (36McDonald O.G. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1428-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whose abnormalities lead to vascular proliferative diseases. Recent studies indicate that Klf4 regulates VSMC proliferation and differentiation by multiple mechanisms, including enhancement of P53 expression and regulation of VSMC marker gene expression (37Autieri M.V. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 1455-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we first determined that overexpression of Klf4 inhibited neointimal hyperplasia caused by balloon injury (Fig. 1). To assess the role of Klf4 in the control of VSMC proliferation, we examined the effect of overexpressing and knocking down Klf4. In cultured VSMCs, Klf4 overexpression inhibited VSMC proliferation stimulated by serum, and Klf4 knockdown promoted cell growth (Fig. 2). These observations suggest that Klf4 is an inhibitor of VSMC proliferation. Indeed, Klf4 was reported to mediate cell growth inhibition by activating numerous genes that encode negative regulators of the cell cycle and suppressing the expression of genes that promote cell cycle progression (38Rowland B.D. Bernards R. Peeper D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 39Wei D. Kanai M. Huang S. Xie K. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We have found that overexpression of Klf4 could up-regulate differentiation marker genes SM22α and α-smooth muscle actin and down-regulate the dedifferentiation marker gene SMemb. In addition, transcriptional profiling has further revealed a global inhibitory function for Klf4 in regulating the expression of genes involved in macromolecular synthesis, including transcription, protein, and cholesterol biosynthesis (39Wei D. Kanai M. Huang S. Xie K. Carcinogenesis. 2006; 27: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 40Haxsen V. Adam-Stitah S. Ritz E. Wagner J. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether Klf4 regulates RAR and PDGFR, which comprise a transcriptional factor network regulating proliferation and differentiation of VSMCs.A number of potential signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of growth arrest and differentiation by Klf4. Klf4 has been demonstrated to be either upstream or downstream of the PI3K and MAPK pathways, which may be regulated by the RAR or PDGFR, in different cell types (12Kawai-Kowase K. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 292: C59-C69Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that the levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK 1/2 were reduced in Klf4-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3), indicating that Klf4 is a specific regulator of both signaling pathways. Multiple mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of PI3K and MAPK signaling by Klf4 in VSMCs. These include changes at the level of transcription for proliferation- and differentiation-associated receptors or at the level of interaction with cofactors. Indeed, cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways has been demonstrated in a diverse set of experimental conditions and in different cell types (41Venkatachalam K. Mummidi S. Cortez D.M. Prabhu S.D. Valente A.J. Chandrasekar B. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2008; 294: H2078-H2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Functional interactions between these two pathways could play a major role in regulating cell proliferation under particular conditions (42Gervais M. Dugourd C. Muller L. Ardidie C. Canton B. Loviconi L. Corvol P. Chneiweiss H. Monnot C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3940-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that both PI3K and ERK antagonists could abrogate the activation of PI3K and ERK by balloon injury, consistent with overexpression of Klf4. PDGFR and RARα are expressed in VSMCs and play a key role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (18Mellgren A.M. Smith C.L. Olsen G.S. Eskiocak B. Zhou B. Kazi M.N. Ruiz F.R. Pu W.T. Tallquist M.D. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Yamaguchi H. Igarashi M. Hirata A. Sugae N. Tsuchiya H. Jimbu Y. Tominaga M. Kato T. Arterioscler.

Physiol. 2003; 285: H1370-H1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Binding of the specific ligands to these receptors leads to the activation of the PI3K and ERK pathways (22Mehrhof F.B. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Dietz R. Scheidereit C. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 958-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 35Antonyak M.A. Boehm J.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because Klf4 exerts anti-proliferative effects through inhibition of PI3K and ERK pathways, we speculated that these actions of Klf4 could be mediated via either PDGFR inhibition or increase in RARα function.Retinoids modulate cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation (40Haxsen V. Adam-Stitah S. Ritz E. Wagner J. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 43Kada N. Suzuki T. Aizawa K. Matsumura T. Ishibashi N. Suzuki N. Takeda N. Munemasa Y. Sawaki D. Ishikawa T. Nagai R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The biological effects of retinoids are mainly mediated by their receptors, i.e. RARα and RXR. RARα interacts with both all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid and has three isoforms (α, β, and γ) (44Fujiu K. Manabe I. Ishihara A. Oishi Y. Iwata H. Nishimura G. Shindo T. Maemura K. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The selective activation of these receptors results in distinct biological effects on different cell types (45Miano J.M. Berk B.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 724-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 46Ou H. Haendeler J. Aebly M.R. Kelly L.A. Cholewa B.C. Koike G. Kwitek-Black A. Jacob H.J. Berk B.C. Miano J.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that retinoids regulate the expression of distinct target genes by activating different signaling pathways and/or exert opposing effects on the same target gene (47Chen Q. Ma Y. Ross A.C. Immunology. 2002; 107: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In fact, most studies on the biological functions of RARα have utilized fibroblasts or cancer cells; these have limited insight into the impact of RARα expression on VSMCs. Recently, the synthetic retinoid Am80, a RARα-specific agonist, was demonstrated to inhibit neointima formation through RARα-induced apoptosis and suppress smooth muscle phenotypic modulation by inhibiting Klf5 (44Fujiu K. Manabe I. Ishihara A. Oishi Y. Iwata H. Nishimura G. Shindo T. Maemura K. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 46Ou H. Haendeler J. Aebly M.R. Kelly L.A. Cholewa B.C. Koike G. Kwitek-Black A. Jacob H.J. Berk B.C. Miano J.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that Klf5 and Klf4 have similar structures but opposite effects on VSMC proliferation (48Yang Y. Goldstein B.G. Chao H.H. Katz J.P. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4: 1216-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 49Ghaleb A.M. Nandan M.O. Chanchevalap S. Dalton W.B. Hisamuddin I.M. Yang V.W. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the interaction between Klf4 and RARα may also play a key role in regulating VSMC proliferation and differentiation. Most interestingly, we found that RARα inhibition by Klf4 overexpression occurs at the transcriptional level (Fig. 4). Further studies suggest that Klf4 binds to the RARα promoter region in the vicinity of a typical Klf4-binding site and can decrease the transcriptional activity of RARα by 65%, indicating that Klf4 is a negative regulator of RARα expression (Fig. 4). Mutation analysis of the potential Klf4-binding sites within the RARα promoter region indicated that TCE1 element is required for the Klf4-mediated transcriptional repression of RARα, whereas TCE2 and TCE3 play a tonic inhibition on basal RARα promoter activity (Fig. 4), similar to the negative regulation of the transforming growth factor-β1/Smad3 function by Klf4 (1Liu Y. Sinha S. Owens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48004-48011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Ligand-activated RARα up-regulates PI3K and ERK signaling. We speculate that Klf4-mediated inhibition of PI3K and ERK is caused by impaired RARα signaling. Indeed, when Klf4-overexpressing VSMCs were treated with RARα agonists Am80 and Am580, the levels of phosphoactive Akt and ERK were restored (Fig. 5). Inhibition of RARα activity would mimic Klf4 action (Fig. 5), indicating that Klf4 could inhibit RARα expression while blocking PI3K and ERK signaling induced by Am80. We then detected whether oral administration of Am80 or Ro 41-5253 would affect neointima hyperplasia after carotid balloon injury. Administration of Am80 to animals failed to increase the PI3K and ERK signaling, and unexpectedly, the injury-induced neointima hyperplasia was diminished with Am80 treatment (Fig. 6), consistent with the observation of Nagai and co-workers (44Fujiu K. Manabe I. Ishihara A. Oishi Y. Iwata H. Nishimura G. Shindo T. Maemura K. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). They proved that Am80 suppressed neointima formation by inhibiting KLF5 (44Fujiu K. Manabe I. Ishihara A. Oishi Y. Iwata H. Nishimura G. Shindo T. Maemura K. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These data support the hypothesis that the anti-proliferative responses of pAd-Klf4 do not occur in the intact animal through impairing RARα expression and/or signaling. But the expression of the differentiation-related gene RARα is sharply reduced by Klf4, which provides a novel mechanism for the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in VSMCs. Klf4 creates a feedback loop of the differentiation effects of the RAR by blocking RARα signaling through inhibition of RARα expression. Thus, we believe that this differentiation-attenuating effect of Klf4 on VSMCs is a by-product, which is to maintain a balance between proliferation and differentiation. Because we have identified that growth arrest effect of Klf4 is not dependent on RARα-PI3K-ERK pathway, this prompted us to further examine whether the growth arrest effects of Klf4 is related to the PDGFR. There are two PDGF receptors, PDGFRα and PDGFRβ. Sano et al. (50Sano H. Sudo T. Yokode M. Murayama T. Kataoka H. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S.I. Kita T. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2955-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) found that blockade of PDGFRα alone had no effect on neointimal formation. PDGFRβ in SMCs plays an important role in SMCs migration and proliferation (50Sano H. Sudo T. Yokode M. Murayama T. Kataoka H. Takakura N. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S.I. Kita T. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2955-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). So, we detected the effect of PDGFRβ directly. We found that Klf4 overexpression significantly down-regulated PDGFRβ expression and phosphorylation of Akt and ERK (Fig. 7). Locally delivered PDGF-BB after carotid balloon injury reversed the inhibitory effect of pAd-Klf4, indicating that the inhibitory effect of Klf4 on neointimal formation is dependent on PDGFRβ-mediated PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling. From these results, we speculated and provided experimental evidence that the anti-proliferative actions of Klf4 stem from its ability to block PDGFRβ expression without altering its phosphorylation, which in turn leads to subsequent attenuation of PI3K and ERK signaling.In conclusion, we show that the zinc finger transcription factor Klf4 is a central player in a regulatory loop that controls proliferation and differentiation in VSMCs. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that Klf4 is an inhibitory factor of the RARα gene in VSMCs. So, we conclude that Klf4 plays a dual role: 1) Klf4-induced growth arrest is not dependent on RARα, but Klf4 can mediate the feedback loop of the RARα by blocking the RARα-sustained signaling through inhibition of RARα expression; and 2) Klf4-induced growth arrest is dependent on the PDGFRβ-mediated PI3K and ERK pathways. The results of the present study also provide a novel insight into the actions of RARs in VSMCs and a new mechanism for signal amplification or suppression and for the control of growth inhibitory effects in VSMCs.

There is considerable interest in identifying extracellular signals, signal transduction molecules, and transcription factors that are involved in the regulation of VSMC proliferation and differentiation (1Liu Y. Sinha S. Owens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48004-48011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 2Papanicolaou K.N. Izumiya Y. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 16-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Many different environmental cues are known to affect VSMC proliferation and differentiation, including endothelial cell-VSMC interactions, VSMC-matrix contacts, mechanical forces, and various cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), activin, and transforming growth factor-β1 (3Khan R.

The Krüppel-like factors (Klfs) are DNA-binding transcriptional regulators that regulate a diverse array of cellular processes, including development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Members of this family bind similar CACCC elements on DNA (5Haldar S.M. Ibrahim O.A. Jain M.K. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2007; 43: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Klf4 was first identified as being highly expressed in epithelial cells, and gain/loss of function studies in vivo have confirmed a critical role for this factor in epithelial cell differentiation (6Suzuki T. Aizawa K. Matsumura T. Nagai R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has underlined the importance of Klf4 in a wide range of cellular processes, such as endothelial pro-inflammatory activation, macrophage gene expression, tumor cell development, and stem cell biology (7Feinberg M.W. Cao Z. Wara A.K. Lebedeva M.A. Senbanerjee S. Jain M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38247-38258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Klf4 was also isolated as a Klf expressed in the vasculature and could be induced by shear stress (8Feinberg M.W. Lin Z. Fisch S. Jain M.K. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Klf4 has been shown to repress the transforming growth factor-β-dependent increase in VSMC differentiation markers, including those for α-smooth muscle actin and SM22α (1Liu Y. Sinha S. Owens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48004-48011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that Klf4 represses myocardin-induced VSMC gene activation and myocardin expression itself (9Liu Y. Sinha S. McDonald O.G. Shang Y. Hoofnagle M.H. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9719-9727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Although Klf4 is not normally expressed in differentiated SMCs, it is up-regulated in PDGF-BB-treated cultured SMCs and in response to vascular injury in vivo (10McDonald O.G. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 36-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, Klf4 may be a key effector of SMC phenotypic switching (11Pidkovka N.A.

Studies have suggested that the antiproliferative and possibly anti-tumor activities of these compounds are linked to their inhibitory effect on telomerase and/or telomere function. In the current studies, we show that HXDV, a synthetic analog of telomestatin, exhibits antiproliferative activity against both telomerase-positive and -negative cells and induces robust apoptosis within 16 h of treatment, suggesting a mode of action independent of telomerase. HXDV was also shown to inhibit cell cycle progression causing M-phase cell cycle arrest, as evidenced by accumulation of cells with 4 n DNA content, increased mitotic index, separated centrosomes, elevated histone H3 phosphorylation at Ser-10 (an M-phase marker), and defective chromosome alignment and spindle fiber assembly (revealed by time-lapse microscopy). The M-phase arrest caused by HXDV paralleled with reduction in the expression level of the major M-phase checkpoint regulator Aurora A. All these cellular effects appear to depend on the G-quadruplex binding activity of HXDV as its non-G-quadruplex binding analog, TXTLeu, is completely devoid of all these effects. In the aggregate, our results suggest that HXDV, which exhibits anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities, is also a novel M-phase blocker, with a mode of action dependent on its G-quadruplex binding activity.

A G-quadruplex is a four-stranded structure consisting of a stack of G-quartets (1Parkinson G.N. Lee M.P. Neidle S. Nature. 2002; 417: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has suggested the existence of the G-quadruplex conformation for telomeric DNA sequences both in vitro and in vivo (1Parkinson G.N. Lee M.P. Neidle S.

Recent studies have also demonstrated that a set of telomere-derived RNA transcripts containing mainly UUAGGG repeats with heterogeneous size raging from 100 bases to 9 kilobases were found at the telomere regions (see review, see Ref. 5Horard B. Gilson E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These telomeric RNA sequences have also been proposed to exist in their G-quadruplex conformation (5Horard B. Gilson E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Other DNA (e.g. a c-MYC promoter sequence) (6Siddiqui-Jain A. Grand C.L. Bearss D.J. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11593-11598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar) and RNA sequences (e.g. fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) mRNA) (7Didiot M.C. Tian Z. Schaeffer C. Subramanian M. Mandel J.L. Moine H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 4902-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have also been demonstrated to readily adopt the thermodynamically stable G-quadruplex conformation in vitro, although their existence in vivo remains unclear. Additionally, the existence of numerous G-quadruplex binding proteins (e.g. FMRP and yeast RAP1) (7Didiot M.C. Tian Z. Schaeffer C. Subramanian M. Mandel J.L. Moine H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 4902-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8Giraldo R. Rhodes D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2411-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and G-quadruplex-specific enzymes (e.g. WRN helicase and G-quadruplex-specific endonuclease) (9Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K.

Thus, the notion that the G-quadruplex conformation may play an important role in biology is emerging. G-quadruplex stabilizers, which stabilize the G-quadruplex conformation in vitro, are known to exhibit cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines (11Gomez D. Wenner T. Brassart B. Douarre C. O'Donohue M.F. El Khoury V. Shin-Ya K. Morjani H. Trentesaux C. Riou J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38721-38729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 12Tauchi T.

Vankayalapati H. Shin-Ya K. Wierzba K. Hurley L.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2098-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Telomestatin, which contains seven oxazole and one thiazoline rings, has been shown to induce apoptosis of tumor cells and exhibit anti-tumor activity in mice (11Gomez D. Wenner T. Brassart B. Douarre C. O'Donohue M.F. El Khoury V. Shin-Ya K. Morjani H. Trentesaux C. Riou J.F. J. Biol.

It has been suggested that telomestatin kills tumor cells through its perturbation of telomerase function and/or telomere structure (e.g. shortening of 3′ G-overhangs) (11Gomez D. Wenner T. Brassart B. Douarre C. O'Donohue M.F. El Khoury V. Shin-Ya K. Morjani H. Trentesaux C. Riou J.F. J. Biol.

Org. Lett. 2006; 8: 4165-4167Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), have led to the development of a facile synthetic scheme, leading to the synthesis of structurally similar macrocycle-based compounds (20Minhas G.S.

Here we study the mode of action of this novel G-quadruplex stabilizer, HXDV. Surprisingly, HXDV was found to exhibit anti-proliferative activity against many tumor cells independently of their telomerase status. In addition, HXDV induced robust apoptosis within 16 h of treatment. These results suggest that HXDV inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis through a telomerase-independent mechanism. HXDV was also shown to perturb cell cycle progression, resulting in accumulation of cells at the M-phase of the cell cycle based on results obtained from multiple approaches. Interestingly, the major M-phase checkpoint regulator Aurora A was down-regulated by HXDV. All these cellular effects appear to depend on the G-quadruplex binding activity of HXDV. In the aggregate, our results suggest that HXDV is a novel M-phase blocker, with a mode of action dependent on its G-quadruplex binding activity.

The DNA fragment encoding the α-tubulin fusion protein was excised (by XhoI/BamHI double digestion) from the plasmid DNA expressing the PA-GFP-α-tubulin fusion protein and cloned into pEYFP-C1 vector. Plasmids expressing H2B-EGFP and EYFP-tubulin were transfected into HEK 293 cells followed by selection with G418 for 2 weeks. The hPOT1 cDNA fragment was obtained by PCR of the pcDNA5/FRT/hPOT1/V5-His DNA using primers (see below) containing a BamHI restriction enzyme site (underlined). The sequence of the forward primer is 5′-GCAGAAGATGTAATCGGATCCTGCCATCCAATTTAGCA, and, the reverse primer 5′-TGCTAAATTGGATGGCAGGATCCGATTACATCTTCTGC. The PCR product was digested with BamHI, and cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT/ TO/HA/MCS/EGFP vector, then transfected into HEK 293 cells. Mouse monoclonal anti-γ-tubulin and anti-γ-H2AX antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Upstate, respectively. Polyclonal anti-H3 S10P, Aurora A/AIK, phospho-CENP-A (Ser-7), phospho-Aurora A (Thr-288)/Aurora B (Thr-232)/Aurora C (Thr-198), and anti-Cdc2 Y15P antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PARP1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HXDV was synthesized as described previously (20Minhas G.S. Pilch D.S. Kerrigan J.E. LaVoie E.J. Rice J.E. Bioorg.

About 2.5 × 105 cells were treated with HXDV for 18 h. Transfected cells were then stained with FITC-VAD-fmk (10 μm; Promega, Madison, WI) for 15 min for detecting caspase activation. For double staining, FITC-VAD-fmk-stained cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 66% ethanol at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then treated with RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) and stained with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml) for 15 min. The stained cells were then subjected to analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cytotoxicity was measured by a 4-day continuous 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described previously (23Qi H. Lin C.P. Fu X. Wood L.M. Liu A.A. Tsai Y.C. Chen Y. Barbieri C.M. Pilch D.S. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11808-11816Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). KB-3-1 cells were seeded on glass coverslips at about 30% confluence and cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator for 16 h, followed by HXDV treatment. Cells were fixed with ice-cold acetone/methanol (1:1) fixation reagent for 20 min, washed with 1× PBS twice, then incubated in a blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS buffer) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated in mouse anti-γ-tubulin antibody, washed, then incubated in anti-mouse IgG-Cy3 antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After the PBS wash, mounting medium was added to the coverslip and sealed. Cells treated with or without HXDV were trypsinized, washed with 1× PBS buffer twice, then incubated in 75 mm KCl solution at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.5 ml of a fixation reagent (3:1, methanol/acetic acid) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (final concentration 0.5 μg/ml). Cells in the fixative were then dropped from about 18 inches high onto angled, humidified microscope slides, followed by air drying for at least 30 min. The mounting medium was added to the slide, followed by covering with a coverslip. Before time-lapse imaging, HEK 293 cells expressing GFP fusion proteins were plated on a 35-mm culture dish and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a CO2 incubator for 12 h. After HXDV addition, the plate was placed on the viewing stage of an inverted microscopy (Olympus) with a motored XY precision stage surrounded by a chamber. To maintain cell activity, the temperature was controlled at 37 °C and 5% CO2 was provided inside the chamber. The shutter of the digital camera was controlled using IPLab 3.2 software, and digital pictures were taken every 3 min over a 16-h period. To measure the length of telomeric 3′ G-tails, genomic DNA was isolated from KB-3-1 cells treated with or without HXDV, followed by an oligonucleotide ligation assay according to the published procedure with slight modifications (24Cimino-Reale G. Pascale E. Battiloro E. Starace G. Verna R. D'Ambrosio E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E35Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions (20 μl each) containing genomic DNA (5 μg), [γ-32P]ATP-labeled CA18 ((CCCTAA)3) (2 μl), and Taq DNA ligase (2 μl, 40 units/μl, New England BioLabs) in 1× Taq DNA ligase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 25 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NAD, and 0.1% Triton X-100) were incubated at 45 °C for 5 h, followed by addition of 15 μl of an alkaline formamide dye solution (90% formamide, 10 mm sodium hydroxide, and 1 mm EDTA) and electrophoresis analysis in 8% urea gel. HXDV was shown to exhibit anti-proliferative activity against many tumor cells with IC50 values varying in a narrow range of 0.2 to 0.6 μm (Table 1). The cell lines employed in this study were divided into two groups: telomerase-positive (labeled TERT+) and telomerase-negative (labeled TERT−). SAOS-2 (a human epithelial-like osteosarcoma cell line), GM847 (an SV-40 transformed human fibroblast cell line), and 2RA (a subline derived from SV40-transformed human lung fibroblasts, WI38) are known to be telomerase-negative (TERT−) and employ the alternative lengthening of the telomere pathway for telomere maintenance (25Bryan T.M. Marusic L. Bacchetti S. Namba M. Reddel R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Londoño-Vallejo J.A. Der-Sarkissian H. Cazes L. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3862-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Other cell lines are telomerase-positive (TERT+). As shown in Table 1, both TERT+ and TERT− cells were equally sensitive to HXDV, suggesting that the anti-proliferative activity of HXDV is independent of the telomerase status, a result different from that of telomestatin (18Binz N. Shalaby T. Rivera P. Shin-ya K. Grotzer M.A. Eur. J. Cancer. 2005; 41: 2873-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The notion that HXDV inhibits cell growth through a telomerase-independent mechanism was also supported by the finding that HXDV was able to induce robust apoptosis (see Fig. 2) and cell cycle arrest (see Fig. 3) in HeLa and KB-3-1 cells within 16 h of treatment because telomerase inhibition is expected to cause slow inhibition of cell growth after multiple cycles of cell division (28Hayflick L.

B, HXDV induces apoptosis-dependent phosphorylation of H2AX. KB-3-1 cells were treated with VP-16 (2 and 10 μm) or HXDV (1 and 3 μm) in the absence or presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk (labeled CI), for 16 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting.

The majority of cells (>95%) show bright doublets in VP-16-treated cells, indicative of duplicated but not separated centrosomes (lower panel is the same cells with a higher magnification). HXDV-treated cells with condensed chromatin show separated centrosomes (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been suggested that telomestatin could target the telomeric 3′ G-rich overhang (e.g. by stabilizing its G-quadruplex conformation) and thereby perturb telomere structure and function (e.g. Pot1 redistribution and shortening of the 3′ overhang) (11Gomez D. Wenner T. Brassart B. Douarre C. O'Donohue M.F. El Khoury V. Shin-Ya K. Morjani H. Trentesaux C. Riou J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38721-38729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, unlike telomestatin, HXDV (3 μm for 1 and 2 days) treatment did not cause significant shortening of the length of the 3′ G-overhangs (Fig. 1B). In addition, no significant Pot1 redistribution was observed in cells treated with HXDV (3 μm) as revealed by time-lapse microscopy (see Fig. 1C, compare images taken at 0.5 and 16 h). It has been shown that perturbation of the telomere structure (e.g. expression of dominant-negative TRF2) induces ATM-dependent apoptosis, presumably as a result of telomere deprotection and the consequent formation of DNA double strand breaks at chromosome ends (29Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Table 1, HXDV exhibited about equal antiproliferative activity against ATM+ (YZ5 and L40) and ATM- cells (PEB7 and L3). These results provide indirect support for the notion that HXDV does not induce telomere deprotection. Several G-quadruplex stabilizers including telomestatin have been shown to induce apoptosis (11Gomez D. Wenner T. Brassart B. Douarre C. O'Donohue M.F. El Khoury V. Shin-Ya K. Morjani H.

Cancer. 2005; 41: 2873-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To determine whether HXDV induces apoptosis, several apoptosis assays were performed. First, PARP1 cleavage was measured and shown to increase with time in KB-3-1 cells treated with HXDV (Fig. 2A). PARP1 cleavage was shown to depend on caspase activation because co-treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, largely abolished PARP1 cleavage (Fig. 2A, labeled CI). However, the non-G-quadruplex binding analog, TXTLeu (see supplemental Fig. S1B, for the structure), did not induce any detectable apoptosis signals even at a concentration as high as 10 μm (Fig. 2A, right panel). Additionally, KB-3-1 cells treated with HXDV for 16 h were shown to elevate the population of cells with caspase activation from 3.8 to 36%, as monitored by FACS analysis of FITC-VAD-fmk-stained KB-3-1 cells (Fig. 2B). As positive controls, VP-16 and CPT, both of which are well characterized DNA damaging agents and known to induce apoptosis (30Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), were shown to induce caspase activation under the same conditions (Fig. 2B). Finally, DNA fragmentation, a characteristic apoptosis end point, was detected by monitoring the sub-G1 population in HXDV-treated HeLa cells using FACS (Fig. 2C). The sub-G1 population of HXDV-treated HeLa cells increased from 8 to 37% in a caspase-dependent manner (Fig. 2C, labeled CI). Together, these results suggest that HXDV induces rapid (within 16 h of treatment) and robust apoptosis. HXDV was shown to cause perturbation of cell cycle progression of KB-3-1 cells (Fig. 3A). KB-3-1 cells treated with HXDV (3 μm) for 16 h were shown to exhibit a significant accumulation of the G2/M population (from 20 to 49%) and a slight increase in S-phase population (from 17 to 23%) (Fig. 3A). As a positive control, KB-3-1 cells were also treated with VP-16 (10 μm for 16 h) (a topoisomerase II poisoning DNA damaging agent) (31O'Loughlin C. Heenan M. Coyle S. Clynes M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 1149-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and shown to accumulate the G2/M population (20 to 50%) as expected. G2/M arrest is known to be caused by either DNA damaging agents (G2 arrest) or tubulin inhibitors (M-phase arrest). To determine whether HXDV-induced G2/M arrest is due to DNA damage, the DNA damage signal, γ-H2AX, was measured in KB-3-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, HXDV, like VP-16, induced γ-H2AX in KB-3-1 cells, indicative of the formation of DNA double strand breaks. However, further analysis indicated that HXDV-induced γ-H2AX, unlike VP-16-induced γ-H2AX, was completely abolished by co-treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 3B, labeled CI). It is well known that massive DNA double strand breaks and hence DNA damage signals such as γ-H2AX could be generated as a consequence of apoptotic nuclease-induced chromosomal DNA fragmentation (32Parrish J.Z. Xue D. Chromosoma. 2006; 115: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Consequently, the HXDV-induced γ-H2AX signal may be due to a secondary event, resulting from apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation rather than a direct HXDV-induced DNA damage. It has been shown that phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 (H3S10P) (33Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25543-25549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and dephosphorylation of Cdc2 at Tyr-15 (Cdc2Y15P) (31O'Loughlin C. Heenan M. Coyle S. Clynes M. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 1149-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Hoffmann I. Karsenti E. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1994; 18: 75-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are indicative of transition between G2- and M-phases. As shown in Fig. 3B, VP-16-treated KB-3-1 cells exhibited dramatic reduction of the H3S10P level, whereas HXDV-treated cells exhibited a concentration-dependent increase of H3S10P, suggesting that HXDV promotes whereas VP-16 inhibits G2/M transition. Consistent with this notion, HXDV was shown to cause a decrease, whereas VP-16 treatment cause an increase, in the phosphorylation of Cdc2 at Tyr-15 (Cdc2Y15P) in KB-3-1 cells. As a positive control for M-phase arrest, the tubulin inhibitor colcemid (Fig. 3B, labeled Col), like HXDV, was shown to elevate histone H3 phosphorylation (at Ser-10) and decrease Cdc2 phosphorylation (at Tyr-15) (Fig. 3B). It is well known that the centrosomes are duplicated in S-phase and become separated in M-phase. Consequently, G2-arrested cells are expected to exhibit duplicated but not separated centrosomes, whereas M-phase-arrested cells exhibit duplicated and separated centrosomes. As shown in Fig. 3C (see the doublets pointed by arrows in the left panel with higher magnification), the majority of VP-16-treated cells (>95%) exhibited only duplicated but not separated centrosomes (based on γ-tubulin immunostaining) indicative of G2- and/or S-phase arrest, whereas the majority of HXDV- arrested cells showed two well separated centrosomes (see the two well separated dots, labeled by arrows, in the right panels). In the aggregate, these results suggest that HXDV arrested cells outside of the G2 phase of the cell cycle, perhaps at the M-phase. To confirm that HXDV arrests cells at the M-phase, several additional experiments were performed. First, HXDV (3 μm)-treated KB-3-1 cells were shown to increase the mitotic index (percentage of cells with condensed chromosomes) about 5-fold from 3.1 to 16% (Fig. 4A). It should be noted that chromosome morphology of the HXDV-arrested cells at M-phase is different from the tubulin inhibitor, colcemid (Fig. 4A, arrows). Instead, the morphology of HXDV-treated cells is similar to dimethyl sulfoxide-treated cells that only showed a normal percentage of M-phase population (about 3%). The possibility that HXDV may arrest cells at the M-phase was further examined by time-lapse microscopy. HEK 293 cells expressing H2B-EGFP fusion protein were employed to monitor chromosome dynamics using time-lapse microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4B, an untreated 293 cell entered mitosis through progressive chromosome condensation (from 0 to 30 min), followed by alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate (45 min), separation of the chromosomes (60 min), and de-condensation of chromosomes (75 and 90 min). By contrast, HXDV-treated cells seemed to arrest cells at the stage of chromosome condensation (either prophase or prometaphase). Some cells undergo chromosome alignment and de-alignment, suggesting a major perturbation in chromosome dynamics (Fig. 4B). We also examined the dynamic of spindle fibers during the course of M-phase progression in cells expressing EYFP-α-tubulin fusion protein by time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 4C). The duration of spindle fiber assembly in the untreated HEK 293 cell was around 60 min, and the whole process of mitosis was less than 120 min. By contrast, the HXDV-treated cell extended the duration of mitosis beyond 400 min, and exhibited a collapsed structure of spindle fibers without further progression into telophase that is normally marked by elongated spindle fibers. These results suggest that the G-quadruplex stabilizer, HXDV, can affect chromosome dynamics and spindle fiber function at M-phase of the cell cycle. The effect of HXDV on chromosome alignment and spindle fiber assembly could suggest a dysfunction of some mitotic checkpoints. We performed experiments to focus on one of the major mitotic checkpoint kinases, the Aurora A. Aurora kinases are major M-phase checkpoint proteins, essential for many aspects of M-phase prog"
https://openalex.org/W2051499020,"Despite the introduction of conjugated polysaccharide vaccines for many of the Neisseria meningitidis serogroups, neisserial infections continue to cause septicaemia and meningitis across the world. This is in part due to the difficulties in developing a, cross-protective vaccine that is effective against all serogroups, including serogroup B meningococci. Although convalescent N. meningitidis patients develop a natural long-lasting cross-protective immunity, the antigens that mediate this response remain unknown. To help define the target of this protective immunity we identified the proteins recognized by IgG in sera from meningococcal patients by a combination of 2D protein gels, western blots and mass spectrometry. Although a number of outer membrane antigens were identified the majority of the antigens were cytoplasmic, with roles in cellular processes and metabolism. When recombinant proteins were expressed and used to raise sera in mice, none of the antigens elicited a positive SBA result, however flow cytometry did demonstrate that some, including the ribosomal protein, RplY were localised to the neisserial cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2070535192,"5S ribosomal RNA gene repeats are arranged in heterochromatic arrays (5S rDNA) situated near the centromeres of Arabidopsis chromosomes. The chromatin remodeling factor DDM1 is known to maintain 5S rDNA methylation patterns while silencing transcription through 5S rDNA intergenic spacers (IGS). We mapped small-interfering RNAs (siRNA) to a composite 5S rDNA repeat, revealing a high density of siRNAs matching silenced IGS transcripts. IGS transcript repression requires proteins of the heterochromatic siRNA pathway, including RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2) and DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3). Using molecular and cytogenetic approaches, we show that the DDM1 and siRNA-dependent silencing effects are genetically independent. DDM1 suppresses production of the siRNAs, however, thereby limiting RNA-directed DNA methylation at 5S rDNA repeats. We conclude that DDM1 and siRNA-dependent silencing are overlapping processes that both repress aberrant 5S rDNA transcription and contribute to the heterochromatic state of 5S rDNA arrays."
https://openalex.org/W1987645931,"An important virulence strategy evolved by bacterial pathogens to overcome host defenses is the modulation of host cell death. Previous observations have indicated that Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague disease, exhibits restricted capacity to induce cell death in macrophages due to ineffective translocation of the type III secretion effector YopJ, as opposed to the readily translocated YopP, the YopJ homologue of the enteropathogen Yersinia enterocolitica O∶8. This led us to suggest that reduced cytotoxic potency may allow pathogen propagation within a shielded niche, leading to increased virulence. To test the relationship between cytotoxic potential and virulence, we replaced Y. pestis YopJ with YopP. The YopP-expressing Y. pestis strain exhibited high cytotoxic activity against macrophages in vitro. Following subcutaneous infection, this strain had reduced ability to colonize internal organs, was unable to induce septicemia and exhibited at least a 107-fold reduction in virulence. Yet, upon intravenous or intranasal infection, it was still as virulent as the wild-type strain. The subcutaneous administration of the cytotoxic Y. pestis strain appears to activate a rapid and potent systemic, CTL-independent, immunoprotective response, allowing the organism to overcome simultaneous coinfection with 10,000 LD50 of virulent Y. pestis. Moreover, three days after subcutaneous administration of this strain, animals were also protected against septicemic or primary pneumonic plague. Our findings indicate that an inverse relationship exists between the cytotoxic potential of Y. pestis and its virulence following subcutaneous infection. This appears to be associated with the ability of the engineered cytotoxic Y. pestis strain to induce very rapid, effective and long-lasting protection against bubonic and pneumonic plague. These observations have novel implications for the development of vaccines/therapies against Y. pestis and shed new light on the virulence strategies of Y. pestis in nature."

A diverse spectrum of signaling molecules is biosynthesized in nature from polyunsaturated fatty acids, their peroxides, and further transformations of the fatty acid peroxides. The peroxides are formed by two classes of dioxygenase enzyme. The hemoprotein dioxygenases include prostaglandin H synthase (cyclooxygenase) in animals (1Smith W.L. Song I. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), α-dioxygenase in plants (2Hamberg M. Ponce de Leon I. Rodriguez M.J. Castresana C. Biochem.

The non-heme iron lipoxygenases are even more widespread, being almost ubiquitous among organisms that contain polyunsaturated fatty acids (6Brash A.R. J. Biol.

Currently we are trying to understand the scope of the reactions catalyzed by this catalase-related family of enzymes. Our objectives are to help understand the structure-function relationships in the reactions with peroxides, to provide new insights on the mechanism of these hemoprotein-catalyzed transformations, as well as, by reflection, to give a different perspective on the parent hemoprotein, the hydrogen peroxide-metabolizing true catalase. The underlying chemistry of the fatty acid hydroperoxide transformations by the specialized P450 and catalase-related hemoproteins can be written as purely free radical in character, or ionic, or with facets of both (19Grechkin A.N.

Biophys. 2003; 409: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Reaction is generally considered to be initiated by homolytic cleavage of the peroxide O–O bond (see Fig. 1). While subsequent reactions can be construed as following a radical pathway to product (e.g. in the hydroperoxide lyase reaction (19Grechkin A.N. Brühlmann F. Mukhtarova L.S. Gogolev Y.V. Hamberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 1419-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)), others are considered to involve an electron transfer step, giving a carbocation intermediate in the penultimate steps to product (22Ullrich V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The underlying grounds for these mechanisms are more a subject of debate and of comparison to other chemistry than of defining evidence on the reactions in question. The results reported here add a measure of experimental support for ionic events in the peroxide transformation by a catalase-related hemoprotein. Recently genome sequencing was completed on the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina (23Swingley W.D. Chen M. Cheung P.C. Conrad A.L. Dejesa L.C. Hao J. Honchak B.M. Karbach L.E. Kurdoglu A. Lahiri S.

A. marina is a focus of attention owing to its harboring a light-harvesting complex containing the unusual chlorophyll d, considered a bridge in the evolutionary development of photosynthetic mechanisms (24Mimuro M. Tomo T. Tsuchiya T. Photosynth. Res. 2008; 97: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Ohashi S. Miyashita H. Okada N. Iemura T. Watanabe T. Kobayashi M. Photosynth.

BLAST searches of the A. marina genome reveal three individual LOX sequences and additionally, the presence of DNA encoding a putative fusion protein of lipoxygenase and catalase-related hemoprotein, the topic of this report. We find an unexpected by-product in the reaction with one particular fatty acid (C18.2ω6); the partial incorporation of 18O from water in a newly formed hydroxyl group has implications related to the mechanism of hydroperoxide transformation. Fatty acids were purchased from NuChek Prep Inc. (Elysian, MN). Standards of racemic HPODEs, HODEs, HPOTrEs, HOTrEs, HPETEs, and HETEs were prepared by vitamin E-controlled autoxidation (26Peers K.E. Coxon D.T. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1983; 32: 49-56Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Chiral hydroperoxides were prepared enzymatically using the A. marina LOX domain for conversion of linoleic acid to 9R-HPODE, α-linolenic acid to 12R-HPOTE, and arachidonic acid to 11R-HPETE. Labeled water H218O, nominally with ≥95% oxygen-18, was purchased 25 years ago from the Monsanto Research Corp. (Miamisburg, OH). Genomic DNA from A. marina MBIC11017 was a kind gift from Dr. Robert E. Blankenship of Washington University in St. Louis. cDNA encoding the full-length fusion protein, designated as a hypothetical protein (ABW27596 of 805 amino acids) was cloned by PCR. Forward and reverse primers in PCR reaction contained NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, and an N-terminal (His)6 tag was engineered for the full-length construct. The sequence of the forward primer was 5′-TCCATATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGATAGTCGTGATCCGCGC-3′ and that of the reverse primer was 5′-GACTCGAGTTAGATATTGGTGCTCATCATAAG-3′. The correct PCR product was subsequently cut with NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes and inserted into the same sites of the expression vector pET17b. DNA sequencing confirmed the identity to the published sequence in GenBankTM (accession number CP000828.1, gene AM1–2589 and protein ABW27596) and at CyanoBase. A cDNA encoding only the N-terminal (catalase-related) domain was similarly prepared using the upstream primer 5′-TCCATATGGATAGTCGTGATCCGCGC-3′ together with the downstream primer 5′-GACTCGAGTTAGTGATGGTGATGCACTAGGCTGGAGCTAGGAGT-3′, including a His4 tag. Expression of the N-terminal and full-length domains in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) was accomplished with methods described previously (27Boutaud O. Brash A.R. J. Biol.

The LOX domain required a lower temperature for expression, 14 °C instead of 28 °C, and use of 2× YT (16 g Tryptone, 10 g yeast extract, and 5 g NaCl in a final volume of 1 L, adjusted to pH 7.0 using NaOH) medium, to be described in detail elsewhere. Purification of the His-tagged full-length protein and N-terminal domain followed the protocol of Imai et al. (28Imai T. Globerman H. Gertner J.M. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19681-19689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Boutaud et al. (27Boutaud O. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with some modifications, as described recently (29Gao B. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 477: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The frozen pellet from a 50-ml bacterial culture was resuspended in 10 ml of BugBuster® protein extraction reagent (Novagen) by sonication and homogenized using glass Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton). The 16,000 × g supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (0.5-ml bed volume, Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl at 0.5 ml/min. The column was then washed with the equilibration buffer, and the nonspecific bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 m NaCl, 70 mm glycine. A final wash was performed by 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole. The His tag protein was then eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. The full-length fusion protein was dark green in color. Fractions containing the most protein as judged by SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C for later use. Small scale incubations were performed at room temperature in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl using the fatty acids C18.4ω3, C18.3ω3, C20.4ω6, or C18.2ω6 (10–30 μg) added in 5 μl of ethanol. Incubations with fatty acid hydroperoxides were conducted in a 1-ml quartz cuvette, and the rate of reaction was monitored by repetitive scanning from 350 to 200 nm using a Lambda-35 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Larger scale incubations were conducted in 50 ml of oxygenated buffer with an appropriate amount of A. marina full-length enzyme and 10 mg of fatty acid substrate. Reaction was complete within 5 min, whereupon the samples were acidified to pH 6 with 1 n HCl and extracted using a 1-ml Oasis HLB cartridge (Waters) or 1-g size for the larger incubations. Products were analyzed initially by RP-HPLC using a C18 Waters Symmetry 5-μm column (0.46 × 25 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with methanol/water/acetic acid (70/30/0.01, by volume). Peaks were monitored using an Agilent 1100 diode array detector. To detect radiolabeled products, a Packard A-100 Flo-One Radiomatic liquid scintillation detector was connected to the Agilent 1100 diode array detector. For larger scale samples, a semi-preparative 5-μm Beckman ODS column (10 mm × 25 cm) was used for the separation of incubation products; the major peaks were collected and extracted from the solvent with dichloromethane, taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen, and stored in methanol at −20 °C. The major products collected from RP-HPLC were further purified as the methyl esters by SP-HPLC using a Beckman 5-μm Ultrasphere silica column (25 × 0.46 cm, or 25 × 1 cm for milligram quantities of product) with a solvent system of hexane/isopropanol (100:1.5, v/v). Reaction of the A. marina enzyme with 12R-HPOTrE was conducted at 0 °C with the substrate initially in ice-cold hexane (10 ml and 100 μm) and layered over the A. marina enzyme (0.8 nmol) in 200 μl of phosphate buffer, pH 7. The reaction was initiated by vigorous vortex mixing of the two phases, which was continued for 2 min; then the test tube was placed back on ice. The hexane phase was scanned from 200–350 nm in UV using a PerkinElmer Lambda-35 spectrophotometer. The combined hexane phases were evaporated to a small volume (∼2 ml) by using a vigorous stream of nitrogen. The sample was then treated with ethanol (20 μl) and ethereal diazomethane for 30 s at 0 °C and then rapidly evaporated to dryness and stored in hexane at −80 °C until further analysis. The sample was purified as described previously for an allene oxide derived from 13S-HPOTrE using a 4.5- × 0.46-cm silica column operated at −15 °C using a solvent system of hexane/diethyl ether (100:1, v/v) run at a flow rate of 3 ml/min (30Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 3382-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). LC-MS was performed using an LTQ ion-trap instrument (ThermoFinnigan) monitoring negative ions. A Waters Symmetry C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm) was used and eluted with CH3CN/H2O/HAc (55/45/0.01, v/v) at 0.2 ml/min. In some cases, samples were run on a Waters Acquity HSS T3 1.8 μm ultra-pressure liquid chromatography column (2.1 × 100 mm) eluted with a programmed gradient from solvent A (methanol/water/ammonium acetate of 5/95/10 mm, v/v/concentration) to B (methanol/water/ammonium acetate = 95/5/10 mm, v/v/concentration) at 0.3 ml/min. Isocratic runs were also performed with the solvent system of CH3CN/H2O/NH4Ac (35/65/10 mm, v/v/concentration) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using the same column. Methyl esters were prepared using ethereal diazomethane in methanol. Catalytic hydrogenations were performed in 100 μl of ethanol using ∼1 mg of palladium and bubbling with hydrogen for 2 min at room temperature. The hydrogenated products were recovered by the addition of water and extraction with ethyl acetate. Methoxime derivatives were prepared by treatment with 5 μl of methoxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine (10 mg/ml) overnight at room temperature. Trimethylsilyl ether were prepared using bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoracetamide (10 μl) at room temperature for 2 h or overnight. Subsequently, the reagents were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and the samples were dissolved in hexane for GC-MS. Analysis of the methyl ester trimethylsilyl derivatives or the further methoxime derivatives of the products were carried out in the positive ion electron impact mode (70 eV) using a ThermoFinnigan DSQ mass spectrometer. The initial temperature was set for 150 °C, held for 1 min, and then increased to 300 °C at 20 °C/min increment and held at 300 °C for 3 min. 1H NMR and 1H,1H-COSY NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DXR 500- or 600-MHz spectrometer at 298 K. Analysis of the allene oxide methyl ester from C18.3ω3 was conducted at 253 K in d-hexane (with ppm values normalized to the hexane peak at 1.30). Other ppm values are reported relative to residual non-deuterated solvent (δ = 7.16 ppm for C6H6). The 18O2 labeled 9R-HPODE was prepared using Anabaena 9R-LOX (31Zheng Y. Boeglin W.E. Schneider C. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5138-5147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reacted with C18.2ω6 in pH 7.5 Tris buffer under an atmosphere of 18O2. The 18O2 oxygenation product, labeled 9R-HPODE, was purified and quantified by UV spectroscopy (ϵ = 23,000 (32Gibian M.J. Vandenberg P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar)). The 18O content was measured by negative ion electrospray LC-MS as shown under “Results.” The incubation buffer for H218O experiments was prepared by addition of 150 μl H218O (≥95% oxygen-18) to 50 μl of 200 mm Tris, 600 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, to generate a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The incubation reactions were conducted in this 50 mm Tris buffer containing the 72% H218O or using 18O2-labeled 9R-HPODE in regular Tris buffer. Control reactions were performed in parallel using 9R-HPODE in regular Tris buffer. Authentic 13S-HODE or 13RS-HODE methyl esters were epoxidized using equimolar mCPBA in dichloromethane at 0 °C for 30 min. The epoxidation products were separated by RP-HPLC with methanol/water (85/15, by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The peak co-chromatographing with the enzymatic epoxyalcohol product described under “Results” was collected and further separated by SP-HPLC using hexane/isopropanol (100/1, by volume) at 2 ml/min, again collecting the peak that co-chromatographed with the enzymatic product. The enantiomers of the epoxide originating from 13RS-HODE were well resolved using a Chiralpak AD column (25 × 0.46 cm) with a solvent of hexane/ethanol (100/5, by volume). Chromatograms from the chiral column are given in the supplemental materials. The first-eluting peak co-chromatographed with the enzymatic product and was confirmed to have an identical NMR spectrum. This was achieved in five steps as follows: (i) Synthesis of 9,10-epoxy-12Z-octadecenoic acid (supplemental Scheme 1): Linoleic acid (50 mg) was epoxidized using equimolar mCPBA in dichloromethane on ice for 30 min. The sample was washed with 0.1 m NaHCO3 and water, dried, and stored in methanol. Although the two major products, the 12,13- and 9,10-cis-epoxides separate on RP-HPLC (eluting in that order; e.g. Ref. 33Bylund J. Ericsson J. Oliw E.H. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), SP-HPLC using the solvent system hexane/isopropanol/glacial acetic acid (100/1/0.1, by volume) gave the same order of elution and a more satisfactory separation (34Laethem R.M. Balazy M. Koop D.R. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1996; 24: 664-668PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) Isolation of the cis-9,10-epoxide enantiomers: the chemically synthesized 9,10-epoxy-12Z-octadecenoic acid enantiomers were resolved using a Chiralpak AD column with a solvent system of hexane/methanol/glacial acetic acid (100/2/0.05, by volume) giving retention times of 24.7 and 30.3 min. (The peaks eluted earlier when ≥100-μg amounts were chromatographed and with tailing, thus limiting the amounts that could be purified per injection). A semi-preparative Chiralpak AD column (25 × 1 cm) was used to prepare milligram quantities. (iii) The absolute stereochemistries were assigned after chemical transformation to 9-HODE (methyl ester acetate derivative) following procedures reported for conversion of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids to HETEs with minor modifications (35Falck J.R. Manna S. Jacobson H.R. Estabrook R.W. Chacos N. Capdevila J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3334-3336Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Each 9,10-epoxide enantiomer (4 mg) as the methyl ester was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (500 μl), ice-cold acetic acid (1 ml) was added, saturated aqueous potassium iodide (200 μl) was then added to the mixture, and the reaction was stirred in the dark for 16 h at room temperature to prepare a mixture of the 9-hydroxy-10-iodo- and 9-iodo-10-hydroxy derivatives. Following evaporation to dryness and extraction three times with Et2O, the combined organic extracts were washed with H2O, 5% Na2SO3, 5%NaHCO3, and brine. The organic layer was dried under nitrogen, dissolved in dichloromethane (500 μl), pyridine and acetic anhydride (300 μl, 2:1, v/v) were added, and the mixture was allowed to react overnight at room temperature. The resulting iodo-acetates were taken to dryness, redissolved in Et2O, and washed with H2O, 5% NaHCO3, and brine. The samples were taken to dryness, redissolved in dry benzene (800 μl), and treated with 5 equivalents of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene (10 μl). After overnight reaction, the mixture of 9-HODE methyl ester acetates was washed with concentrated CuSO4 solution (to remove the 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene), and the organic layer was dried under nitrogen, and redissolved in ethanol. The 9-HODE methyl ester acetate samples were purified by SP-HPLC with a solvent system of hexane/isopropanol (100/0.5, by volume). The chemically derived 9-HODE ester acetates were chromatographed on a Chiralpak AD column using a solvent system of hexane/methanol (100/1, by volume) run at 1 ml/min. Authentic standards prepared directly from 9R-HODE and 9RS-HODE were also run on the same system to assign the stereoconfiguration, with the 9S enantiomer eluting first at 4.4 min and the 9R at 5.0 min. In this way it was shown that of the two 9,10-epoxides resolved earlier on the chiral column, the first-eluting enantiomer was converted to 9S-HODE and thus was itself 9S,10R-epoxy-12Z-octadecenoic acid, and the second peak, which gave 9R-HODE, was 9R,10S-epoxy-12Z-octadecenoic acid. (iv) Each epoxide enantiomer (2 mg of the methyl ester) was reacted with singlet oxygen using methylene blue as sensitizer (1 ml of a 0.6 mg/15 ml methanol solution) and a strong source of visible light at 0 °C for 2 days. At this stage, ∼50% was converted to a more polar product on TLC. The samples were taken to dryness, redissolved in ethyl acetate (5 ml), and passed through the Bond-Elut silica cartridge (1 g) to remove the methylene blue. After esterification with diazomethane and treatment with a 1.5-fold excess of triphenylphosphine to reduce hydroperoxides, each sample was resolved into two major 9,10-epoxy-13-hydroxy diastereomers by SP-HPLC using a Beckman Ultrasphere silica column (25 × 1 cm) with a solvent system of hexane/isopropanol (100/2, by volume, 4 ml/min, retention times of 13.7 and 14.5 min). The first eluting diastereomer from each original chiral epoxide co-chromatographed with the natural product. These enantiomers were collected separately for further comparison with the enzymatic product and structural confirmation by NMR. (v) To distinguish between the two chemically synthesized enantiomeric 9,10-epoxy-13-hydroxy products that matched the natural product on SP-HPLC, they were compared with the enzymatic product by chiral column analysis using a Chiralpak AD column with a solvent system of hexane/ethanol (100/5, by volume) at flow rate of 1 ml/min. The two chemically synthesized enantiomers resolved at retention times of 14.5 and 16.5 min, and the first-eluting enantiomer, the one derived from the 9R,10S-epoxide, co-chromatographed with the enzymatic product. The cyclopentenone ester of C18.3ω3 was treated with 0.1 m methanolic KOH solution for 30 min at room temperature. After extraction with dichloromethane (and re-esterification with diazomethane to ensure it was still 100% methyl ester), it was compared with an untreated sample on SP-HPLC and RP-HPLC with the solvent system of hexane/isopropanol (100/1.5, by volume) or methanol/H2O (85/15, by volume), respectively. BLAST searches using the catalase-related allene oxide synthase domain of Plexaura homomalla identified a good match (E value, 3e-30; 29% amino acid identity) on the main chromosome of A. marina MBIC11017, a hypothetical protein of 805 amino acids designated as ABW27596. The polypeptide consisted of an N-terminal catalase-related sequence and C-terminal lipoxygenase (and an alignment with related fusion proteins is given in supplemental Fig. S1). The full-length cDNA was cloned from A. marina genomic DNA with an N-terminal His tag encoded in the upstream PCR primer. Separate constructs were also prepared of the N-terminal catalase-related domain and the C-terminal lipoxygenase. After insertion into the expression vector pET17b the proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and subsequently purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. The full-length fusion protein was recovered with a yield of ∼110 mg of the green-colored protein per liter of bacterial culture. The UV-visible spectrum exhibited a typical hemoprotein absorbance with the main Soret band at 405 nm. SDS-PAGE showed a major band at the predicted molecular mass of 92 kDa with a purity of ∼90% (supplemental Fig. S2). Expression of the catalase-related domain by itself (amino acids 1–351) gave strong expression of the protein but with low (<10%) incorporation of heme (data not show"

Here, we test the hypothesis that BMSCs suppress immune responses by Fas-mediated apoptosis of activated lymphocytes and find both Fas and FasL expression by primary BMSCs. Jurkat cells or activated lymphocytes were each killed by BMSCs after 72 h of co-incubation. In comparison, the cytotoxic effect of BMSCs on non-activated lymphocytes and on caspase-8(−/−) Jurkat cells was extremely low. Fas/Fc fusion protein strongly inhibited BMSC-induced lymphocyte apoptosis. Although we detected a high level of Fas expression in BMSCs, stimulation of Fas with anti-Fas antibody did not result in the expected BMSC apoptosis, regardless of concentration, suggesting a disruption of the Fas activation pathway. Thus BMSCs may have an endogenous mechanism to evade Fas-mediated apoptosis. Cumulatively, these data provide a parallel between adult stem/progenitor cells and cancer cells, consistent with the idea that stem/progenitor cells can use FasL to prevent lymphocyte attack by inducing lymphocyte apoptosis during the regeneration of injured tissues.

In the present study, we hypothesize that BMSC-mediated cytotoxicity of lymphocytes involves the FasL-activated apoptotic machinery. FasL is a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. FasL interacts with its receptor, Fas (CD95/APO-1) and triggers a cascade of subcellular events culminating in apoptotic cell death. FasL and Fas are key regulators of apoptosis in the immune system. In addition, FasL is expressed by cells in immune-privileged sites, such as cancer cells, neurons, eyes, cytotrophoblasts of the placenta, and reproductive organs (13Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 14Griffith T.S. Ferguson T.A. Immunol.

Wekerle H. Neumann H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The discovery that FasL is also expressed by a variety of tumor cells raises the possibility that FasL may mediate immune privilege in human tumors (18o舗Connell J. o舗Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Activated T cells expressing Fas are sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Thus, up-regulation of FasL expression by tumor cells may enable tumorigenesis by targeting apoptosis in infiltrating lymphocytes. In the present work, we show that BMSCs can mediate immunosuppressive activity by FasL-induced killing of activated lymphocytes. Thus, BMSCs have properties of immune-privileged cells. Normal human BMSCs were isolated according to a previously published protocol (1Robey P.G. Bianco P. J. Am. Dent. Assoc. 2006; 137: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or were purchased (passage 1) from Cambrex Bio Science (Baltimore, MD). Cells were positive for CD105, CD166, CD29, and CD44 and negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45 (>95% of total cell number). BMSCs were cultured as a monolayer in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (MSCGM; Cambrex Bio Science) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Cambrex). When the cells had grown to 70–80% confluence, they were detached with trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen). Wild-type Jurkat cells (TIB-152 ATCC) and caspase-8-negative (I 9.2; ATCC) Jurkat cells with a mutation in the cysteine protease, caspase-8/FLICE, were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were split every third day, ensuring that the cell density in the culture did not exceed 5 × 105 cells/ml. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors were separated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. The lymphocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at a density of 105/ml in 6-well plates. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (Sigma-Aldrich) was then added to each well at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 48 h. Human skin fibroblasts were grown from skin biopsies and cultured in monolayer cultures in Eagle舗s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen). Electrophoresis was performed separately on lysates from BMSCs and lymphocytes. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred overnight to 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blots were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in a solution consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaPO4, 0.05% Tween 20, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Fas or anti-FasL antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in blocking solution containing 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Proteins were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody, enhanced chemifluorescence (Amersham Biosciences International), and quantified by Storm System Fluorescence Imaging (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Prestained molecular mass markers were from Novex (San Diego, CA). Total RNA was extracted separately from normal BMSCs and activated and non-activated lymphocytes using RNeasyTM total RNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer舗s manual. cDNA was made from 1 μg of total RNA with oligo dT primers to synthesize the first-strand cDNA. RT was performed at 42 °C for 50 min followed by 70 °C for 15-min reaction termination, and 37 °C for 20 min RNase H digestion of RNA. The nested primer pairs for FAS ligand mRNA in this study were designed based on the cDNA sequence in GenBankTM (accession: NM_000639) and described in Table 1.TABLE 1Primer pairs for FAS ligand mRNAPrimerPositionOligo sequenceFASL-335–54 nt (external sense)5′-AGAGATCCAGCTTGCCTCCT-3′FASL-41028–1009 nt (external antisense)5′-TGGAAAGAATCCCAAAGTGC-3′FASL-5136–151 nt (internal sense)5′-CTGGCCTGACTCACCA-3′FASL-6653–636 nt (internal antisense)5′-AGGTGTCTTCCCATTCCA-3′FASL-7465–482 nt (internal sense)5′-AGCTCTTCCACCTACAGA-3′FASL-8980–964 nt (internal antisense)5′-ACGTCTGAGATTCCTCA-3′ Open table in a new tab The following thermocycle programs were used for nested PCR: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45s, 58 °C (FASL-3 and FASL-4), or 50 °C (FASL-5 and FASL-6) or 48 °C (FASL-7 and FASL-8) for 45s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by an extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were analyzed in 1.5% SeaKem LE agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by UV illumination. Single bands of PCR product of FASL-7 and FASL-8 were cut from the agarose gel, purified with GeneClean kit, and subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (TOPOTM TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen, CA). The insert size from a number of subclones was determined by KpnI restriction enzyme digestion analysis. Plasmid sequencing was performed by MTR Scientific Company using T7 and M13 primers. FasL siRNAs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The target sequence used for FasL was 5′-GUCUACAUGAGGAACUCUATT-3′. hMSC cells was transfected with 25 nm siRNA duplexes (the final concentration in the cell culture medium) in the presence of the carrier Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer舗s protocol. After 48-h transfection with FasL siRNA duplexes or without FasL siRNA, hMSC cells were harvested for the study of cell interaction and the examination of FasL expression by Western blot. For co-culture experiments, BMSCs were seeded on flasks or chamber glass slides (Nunc) at a density of 2,000/cm2 and allowed to recover for 15 h. Where indicated, BMSCs and Jurkat cells were prestained with 10 μm CellTracker Green CMFDA or CellTracker Red CMTPX (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C. Jurkat cells were added to BMSCs at a density of 20,000/cm2. Co-cultured cells and controls were cultured in a medium mixture containing MSCGM and RPMI (50:50, v/v). For apoptosis, medium and unattached cells were removed 24 h after co-culture initiation and replaced with fresh media mixture. Live Jurkat-BMSC attachment was observed using scanning laser microscopy (LSM 510; Zeiss). To induce apoptosis, BMSCs were treated with anti-Fas antibody (clone CH-11) (10–100 ng/ml) and cultured for 18 h. Soluble Fas/Fc chimera) and Fc fragment (R&D Systems) were used for blocking Fas-mediated apoptosis. Cell viability was examined using WST-1 assay, and the apoptotic rate of BMSC was detected by annexin V staining or PI staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. We used Jurkat cells as a positive control for apoptosis detection. Phosphatidylserine exposure in Jurkat cells was detected in co-culture conditions by staining with annexin V (AV) Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature and taking observations with a fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 25; Zeiss). Non-attached Jurkat cells were then removed with three washes of RPMI and Jurkat cells attached to BMSCs were removed with trypsin/EDTA. Where indicated, unattached and attached cell populations were simultaneously stained with annexin V Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature. The number of early apoptotic (AV+/PI−) and necrotic/late apoptotic (AV+/PI+) cells were expressed as a percentage of total Jurkat cells. In some experiments, Jurkat cells were prelabeled with Cell Tracker Red, and at various time points after co-culture initiation, stained with AV. All samples were analyzed using a FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson). A viability analysis of cells was performed using a commercial colorimetric assay (Roche Applied Science) based on the cleavage of WST-1 tetrazolium salt by mitochondrial dehydrogenases of viable cells. Briefly, 10 μl of WST-1 was added to each of the 96-well culture plates containing 100 μl of cell suspension. After 40 min of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, plates were evaluated using an ELISA reader and reference wavelengths of 450 and 650 nm. Data were expressed as the mean percentage of three replicates relative to untreated controls. BMSCS were fixed in 70% ethanol for at least 7 days, treated with 0.5 mg/ml RNase (Sigma) and 0.1% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before staining with 20 μg/ml PI (Sigma). Cells were then analyzed for DNA content by a FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer. The pre-G1 population corresponded to that of apoptotic cells. The acquired histograms were analyzed using Cell Quest Software (Becton Dickinson) (19Lacombe F. Belloc F. Hematol. Cell Ther. 1996; 38: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To investigate the nature of BMSC lymphocyte interaction, we performed co-culture experiments using BMSCs and purified lymphocytes or Jurkat cells. Strong attachment of lymphocytes to stromal cells was detected immediately after initiation of co-culture (Fig. 1A). Apoptosis of attached lymphocytes was detected 18 h after co-culture initiation and reached 90% by 72 h (Fig. 1, B and C), as shown by annexin V labeling. To prove that annexin V-labeled cells are lymphocytes we used different approaches, including prelabeling of lymphocytes with cell trackers, double labeling with anti-CD3 antibody (data not shown) and annexin V, and morphological and size differences between lymphocytes and bone marrow stromal cells. Non-attached lymphocytes reached only 20% apoptosis despite 72 h of co-incubation (Fig. 1, C and D). To prove contact dependence of BMSC-induced lymphocyte apoptosis, we performed transwell experiments. As shown in Fig. 1E, lymphocytes separated from BMSCs by 3-μm pore inserts reached only 15% apoptosis after 72 h of co-incubation. The supernatant collected from BMSC lymphocyte co-culture was not able to initiate apoptosis of control Jurkat cells (Fig. 1E). Both Jurkat cells and activated lymphocytes were much more sensitive to BMSC-mediated apoptosis than non-activated lymphocytes (Fig. 2A). BMSCs demonstrated some level of annexin V binding, which was not increased during co-culture with lymphocytes. To prove that lymphocyte apoptosis requires contact with BMSCs, co-incubation of Jurkat with human skin fibroblasts was performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, co-incubation with fibroblasts did not cause significant apoptosis of Jurkat cells. Incubation with Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line (CHO K-1), and hamster kidney fibroblast cell line (BHK 21) also did not result in Jurkat cell apoptosis (data not shown). The observation that lymphocyte apoptosis requires cell-cell contact led us to propose that the death receptor-activated pathway is involved in the apoptosis of Jurkat cells under co-culture conditions. Therefore, we tested the expression of FasL on BMSCs. Strong expression of FasL was detected as the protein (Fig. 3A) and the mRNA (Fig. 3B) by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR, respectively. This finding was inconsistent with previously published flow cytometry data showing no FasL expression on BMSCs (20Ryan J.M. Barry F.P. Murphy J.M. Mahon B.P. J. Inflamm. (Lond.). 2005; 2: 8Crossref Scopus (696) Google Scholar). To confirm our results, we performed flow cytometry analysis of permeabilized and non-permeabilized BMSCs. As shown in Fig. 3C, the majority of FasL demonstrated intracellular localization. These data explain the discrepancy between our findings and the previously published data (20Ryan J.M. Barry F.P. Murphy J.M. Mahon B.P. J. Inflamm. (Lond.). 2005; 2: 8Crossref Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Moreover, only under co-culture conditions, we were able to detect FasL on non-permeabilized BMSCs by fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 3D). To further support the possible role of FasL in BMSC-initiated apoptosis of lymphocytes, we performed a co-culture experiment of BMSCs and mutated Jurkat cells, in which the extrinsic apoptotic pathway has been disabled at the level of caspase-8. As shown in Fig. 4A, the apoptotic rate of attached mutated Jurkat cells was significantly lower than the rate of normal Jurkat cells. In addition, a rise in caspase-3 level was detected in attached lymphocytes as soon as 18 h after co-culture initiation (Fig. 4C). We then added Fas/Fc chimera and control peptide prior to co-culture initiation to further examine whether BMSC-mediated apoptosis of lymphocytes involves Fas-FasL interaction. As shown in Fig. 4B, lymphocytes exposed to recombinant human Fas/Fc chimera (1 μg/ml), but not to control antibody, had been protected from apoptosis. To provide additional evidence that FasL plays a role in BMSC-mediated apoptosis of lymphocytes, we suppressed FasL expression on BMSCs by siRNA delivery. The efficacy of FasL antisense RNA in inhibiting FasL protein expression was then tested by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). Western blot analysis found a complete inhibition in FasL protein expression in the BMSCs. Treatment of cells with the FasL siRNA significantly reversed the ability of BMSCs to induce apoptosis of Jurkat cells (Fig. 4D). Expression of functional FasL by BMSCs calls into question the expression and functionality of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in these cells. For this reason, we examined the expression of Fas, TRAIL, and TNF receptor II on BMSCs. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, significant expression of Fas (Fig. 5, A and B), but not TNF receptor II or TRAIL receptors (data not shown) was detected in BMSCs. Despite our finding that BMSCs demonstrate a high level of expression of Fas protein (Fig. 5, A and B), ligation of this receptor by an anti-Fas antibody was unable to initiate cell death and had no effect on the rate of BMSC proliferation (Fig. 5C). In addition, anti-Fas treated BMSCs were found to be negative for major apoptotic indicators, such as PS exposure, caspase-3 activation, and pre-G1 subpopulation formation (data not shown). To detect the stage in apoptotic pathway that was blocked in BMSCs, we examined apoptotic events upstream to mitochondria. Our data indicated no caspase-8 activation following BMSCs incubation with anti-Fas-activating antibody at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. These data indicate that blockage of the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway happened upstream to caspase-8 activation, probably on the level of DISC formation. Nevertheless, we were able to activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by different stimuli, including growing BMSCs under unattached conditions (anoikis) and UV irradiation (data not shown). Thus, while we conclude that BMSCs co-express Fas and FasL, we propose that the Fas pathway in BMSCs is not active such that BMSCs can evade autocrine and/or T-cell-induced apoptosis by FasL. In the present study, we show that BMSCs counterattack activated lymphocytes using the same mechanism as cancer cells: Fas-mediated apoptosis. Fas and FasL are co-expressed on primary BMSCs. Moreover, BMSCs kill co-cultured lymphocytes and Jurkat cells. As expected, both Jurkat cells and activated lymphocytes were susceptible to induction of apoptosis by BMSCs, and non-activated lymphocytes were notably spared. Caspase-8 deficiency inhibited apoptosis of Jurkat cells, and blocking with Fas Fc protein prevented BMSC-induced apoptosis by 60%. These results show that death receptors are responsible for lymphocyte cell death and that BMSC-associated FasL inhibited apoptosis signaling by Fas on lymphocytes, rather than induction of the Jurkat cells to kill themselves. Previous reports concerning BMSC-induced apoptosis in general and FasL expression on BMSC (MSC) in particular, are controversial. Benvenuto et al. (21Benvenuto F. Ferrari S. Gerdoni E. Gualandi F. Frassoni F. Pistoia V. Mancardi G. Uccelli A. Stem. Cells. 2007; 25: 1753-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) demonstrated a protective effect of BMSCs on lymphocytic apoptosis. A possible explanation of this apparent contradiction with our present report is the fact that the two studies use different populations of lymphocytes: Benvenuto et al. collected non-attached lymphocytes for flow cytometry analysis, while we studied apoptosis only of lymphocytes that were attached to BMSCs. In addition, recent studies support our data, showing that BMSCs induce apoptosis in lymphocytes. FasL is found on cells derived from the Banna Minipig Inbred-line (BMI-MCS) (22Liu J. Lu X.F. Wan L. Li Y.P. Li S.F. Zeng L.Y. Zeng Y.Z. Cheng L.H. Lu Y.R. Cheng J.Q. Transplant Proc. 2004; 36: 3272-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, Ryan et al. (20Ryan J.M. Barry F.P. Murphy J.M. Mahon B.P. J. Inflamm. (Lond.). 2005; 2: 8Crossref Scopus (696) Google Scholar) demonstrated no FasL expression on BMSCs. Plumas et al. (8) demonstrated that MSCs induce apoptosis of activated lymphocytes, but had a different explanation from the one that we present here: that tryptophan is converted into kynurenine by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expressed by MSCs in the presence of IFNγ. In the present work, we demonstrated that blocking the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway does not completely inhibit BMSC-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that additional mechanisms might play a role in this process. The intracellular localization of FasL in BMSC may explain the inconsistency concerning FasL expression, since flow cytometry does not generally pick up intracellular epitopes without permeabilization. Moreover, our results are consistent with data showing that FasL is required for the graft survival of donor bone marrow transplant from C3H-gld mice (23George J.F. Sweeney S.D. Kirklin J.K. Simpson E.M. Goldstein D.R. Thomas J.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). C3H-gld mice have a FasL defect because of a point mutation that does not inhibit expression but renders it incapable of inducing apoptosis through Fas. In addition, the putative externalization of FasL to induce lymphocyte apoptosis can explain the fact that lymphocytes showed a peak of apoptosis 3 days after co-culture initialization. The way that FasL is externalized remains to be elucidated. One possible mechanism involves FasL-positive exosome formation, as is now indicated for cancer cells (24Abrahams V.M. Straszewski S.L. Kamsteeg M. Hanczaruk B. Schwartz P.E. Rutherford T.J. Mor G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5573-5581PubMed Google Scholar), or FasL externalization during activation by lymphocytes. Inducibility of the FasL externalization in BMSCs is in line with recent data describing induction of soluble factors that mediate immunosupression by BMSCs. Supernatants from non-activated BMSCs did not have any suppressive capacity on lymphocyte proliferation; however, co-culture with lymphocytes, with or without transwell separation, induced the suppressive activity of BMSC (25Maitra B. Szekely E. Gjini K. Laughlin M.J. Dennis J. Haynesworth S.E. Koç O.N. Bone Marrow Transplant. 2004; 33: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In addition, controversy in this field can be explained by heterogeneity of isolated BMSC populations. In the present work, we used both commercially available (Cambrex) and BMSCs isolated in our laboratories; the detailed description of the latter was recently published (26Sacchetti B. Funari A. Michienzi S. Di Cesare S. Piersanti S. Saggio I. Tagliafico E. Ferrari S. Robey P.G. Riminucci M. Bianco P. Cell. 2007; 131: 324-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar). Results were similar regardless of which source was used. In parallel to our results, Pluchino et al. (27Pluchino S. Zanotti L. Rossi B. Brambilla E. Ottoboni L. Salani G. Martinello M. Cattalini A. Bergami A. Furlan R. Comi G. Constantin G. Martino G. Nature. 2005; 436: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that adult neural multipotent (stem) precursor cells induce apoptosis of infiltrating pro-inflammatory Th1 cells. The lymphocyte apoptosis occurred via multiple distinct pathways, with the death receptor-mediated pathway likely to predominate. Co-expression of Fas and FasL by BMSCs calls into question the functionality of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in these cells. Although we detected high levels of Fas expression on BMSCs, stimulation of Fas with different concentrations of anti-Fas antibody did not result in any apoptotic response. Although we were not able at this stage to identify the exact molecular mechanism of Fas-mediated pathway inactivation in BMSCs, we could narrow it to the step that includes events between Fas protein trimerization to caspase-8 activation. We speculate that similar to previously demonstrated cancer cells models (17), transformation of intracellular domain of Fas protein expressed in hMBSCs prevents trimerization of the receptor and blocks activation of apoptotic pathway activation. Our speculation based on the observation that we were not able to detect Fas with antibodies against the intracellular domain, but had a very strong specific bond with antibodies against the extracellular domain (data not shown). However, to prove this hypothesis additional experiments should be performed. Our finding regarding expression of nonfunctional Fas on BMSCs consistent with previous studies performed on different adult stem cells (SCs). All examined adult stem cells, including neural and satellite SCs, are shown to express at least one type of death receptor (28Ceccatelli S. Tamm C. Sleeper E. Orrenius S. Toxicol Lett. 2004; 149: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Sánchez A. Factor V.M. Espinoza L.A. Schroeder I.S. Thorgeirsson S.S. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, SCs are shown to express all components of the Fas/TNF apoptotic pathway: surface FAS, TNFR1, TNFR2, Fas-associated protein with death domain, and caspase-8. Fas treatment of neural stem cells (NSCs) activates the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway, which may have an anti-apoptotic as well as a growth-stimulating role. However, the exposure of SCs to death receptor agonists failed to induce apoptosis. As was shown in NSCs, the mitochondrial pathway was not affected, and caspase-3 served as an executioner caspase in the apoptotic machinery. Similarly, the differentiation of putative rat liver hepatic progenitor (RLE) cells to hepatocytes turns on a TNF-α-mediated apoptotic pathway. It was shown that 50% of the differentiated cells underwent apoptosis after 6 h of TNF-α treatment, whereas control RLE cells were resistant. Concomitant FasL expression and insensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis have been demonstrated in different types of cancer, suggesting a mechanism for immune evasion by tumor cells (18o舗Connell J. o舗Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. Shanahan F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The expression of FasL on tumor cells is so well established that it is considered by some as a marker for cancer prognosis. Moreover, previous studies show that many malignant cells are of mesenchymal origin, such as those observed in osteosarcomas. The expression of FasL in these cells may explain the aggressive progression of this tumor type. These observations, taken together with our data, draw a direct parallel between adult stem cells and cancer cells. The discovery that allogenic BMSC preferentially engraft at tumor sites and contribute to stromal tissue formation (30Studeny M. Marini F.C. Champlin R.E. Zompetta C. Fidler I.J. Andreeff M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3603-3608PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that BMSCs (with or without gene modification) may be useful in targeting cancer therapy. The ability of BMSCs to activate FasL-mediated apoptosis may open new strategies for targeted treatment of Fas-sensitive cancers. In conclusion, FasL is expressed on BMSCs where it is plays role in the anti-immune activity of these cells against lymphocytes. Taken together with the rapidly accumulating data on the capacity of BMSCs to facilitate tissue regeneration, these data suggest that the unique success of BMSCs during transplantation may result from their ability to neutralize the innate immunity of the original tissue. Furthermore, the combined expression of non-functional Fas and functional FasL in BMSCs may create an immune-protected niche for these cells at the site of tissue injury. We thank Drs. Jonathan D. Ashwell and Rocky S. Tuan for critical evaluation of this work and important suggestions for experiments and Drs. Svetlana Glushakova and Paul Blank for comments and discussion.

https://openalex.org/W2088911470,"Sorting nexins (SNXs) constitute a family of proteins classified by their phosphatidylinositol (PI) binding Phox homology (PX) domain. Some members regulate intracellular trafficking. We have here investigated mechanisms underlying SNX4 mediated endosome to Golgi transport.We show that SNX4 forms complexes with clathrin and dynein. The interactions were inhibited by wortmannin, a PI3-kinase inhibitor, suggesting that they form when SNX4 is associated with PI(3)P on endosomes. We further localized the clathrin interacting site on SNX4 to a clathrin box variant. A short peptide containing this motif was sufficient to pull down both clathrin and dynein. Knockdown studies demonstrated that clathrin is not required for the SNX4/dynein interaction. Moreover, clathrin knockdown led to increased Golgi transport of the toxin ricin, as well as redistribution of endosomes.We discuss the possibility of clathrin serving as a regulator of SNX4-dependent transport. Upon clathrin release, dynein may bind SNX4 and mediate retrograde movement."

The data are consistent with the presence of natural variations in the LOS, which include a triphosphorylated lipid A (LA) with and without a phosphoethanolamine group, and both hexa- and pentaacylated LA molecules. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on 89I LA produced by hydrolysis of the LOS, and the purified LA molecules were analyzed by MALDI-TOF and tested for their relative ability to induce the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by human monocytic THP-1 cells and primary human monocytes. The potency of tumor necrosis factor-alpha induction varied by approximately 2-10-fold, depending on the state of acylation and phosphorylation. The results highlight the significance of phosphorylation along with acylation of the LA component of LOS in stimulation of inflammatory signaling, and suggest that natural strain variation in these moieties may be a feature of meningococcal bacteria, which is of critical importance to the progression of the infection."
https://openalex.org/W2079363406,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase that has been implicated in learning, synaptic plasticity, neurotransmission, and numerous neurological disorders. We previously showed that conditional loss of Cdk5 in adult mice enhanced hippocampal learning and plasticity via modulation of calpain-mediated N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) degradation. In the present study, we characterize the enhanced synaptic plasticity and examine the effects of long-term Cdk5 loss on hippocampal excitability in adult mice. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from the Schaffer collateral CA1 subregion of the hippocampus (SC/CA1) reveal that loss of Cdk5 altered theta burst topography and enhanced post-tetanic potentiation. Since Cdk5 governs NMDAR NR2B subunit levels, we investigated the effects of long-term Cdk5 knockout on hippocampal neuronal excitability by measuring NMDAR-mediated fEPSP magnitudes and population-spike thresholds. Long-term loss of Cdk5 led to increased Mg2+-sensitive potentials and a lower threshold for epileptiform activity and seizures. Biochemical analyses were performed to better understand the role of Cdk5 in seizures. Induced-seizures in wild-type animals led to elevated amounts of p25, the Cdk5-activating cofactor. Long-term, but not acute, loss of Cdk5 led to decreased p25 levels, suggesting that Cdk5/p25 may be activated as a homeostatic mechanism to attenuate epileptiform activity. These findings indicate that Cdk5 regulates synaptic plasticity, controls neuronal and behavioral stimulus-induced excitability and may be a novel pharmacological target for cognitive and anticonvulsant therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1989770688,"Background Recently we and others have identified CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes within the highly expressed M. tuberculosis protein TB10.4. This has enabled, for the first time, a comparative study of the dynamics and function of CD4 and CD8 T cells specific for epitopes within the same protein in various stages of TB infection. Methods and Findings We focused on T cells directed to two epitopes in TB10.4; the MHC class I restricted epitope TB10.4 3–11 (CD8/10.4 T cells) and the MHC class II restricted epitope TB10.4 74–88 (CD4/10.4 T cells). CD4/10.4 and CD8/10.4 T cells displayed marked differences in terms of expansion and contraction in a mouse TB model. CD4/10.4 T cells dominated in the early phase of infection whereas CD8/10.4 T cells were expanded after week 16 and reached 5–8 fold higher numbers in the late phase of infection. In the early phase of infection both CD4/10.4 and CD8/10.4 T cells were characterized by 20–25% polyfunctional cells (IL-2+, IFN-γ+, TNF-α+), but whereas the majority of CD4/10.4 T cells were maintained as polyfunctional T cells throughout infection, CD8/10.4 T cells differentiated almost exclusively into effector cells (IFN-γ+, TNF-α+). Both CD4/10.4 and CD8/10.4 T cells exhibited cytotoxicity in vivo in the early phase of infection, but whereas CD4/10.4 cell mediated cytotoxicity waned during the infection, CD8/10.4 T cells exhibited increasing cytotoxic potential throughout the infection. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that CD4 and CD8 T cells directed to epitopes in the same antigen differ both in their kinetics and functional characteristics throughout an infection with M. tuberculosis. In addition, the observed strong expansion of CD8 T cells in the late stages of infection could have implications for the development of post exposure vaccines against latent TB."
https://openalex.org/W2043121404,"Cryptochromes and DNA photolyases are related flavoproteins with flavin adenine dinucleotide as the common cofactor. Whereas photolyases repair DNA lesions caused by UV radiation, cryptochromes generally lack repair activity but act as UV-A/blue light photoreceptors. Two distinct electron transfer (ET) pathways have been identified in DNA photolyases. One pathway uses within its catalytic cycle, light-driven electron transfer from FADH−* to the DNA lesion and electron back-transfer to semireduced FADHo after photoproduct cleavage. This cyclic ET pathway seems to be unique for the photolyase subfamily. The second ET pathway mediates photoreduction of semireduced or fully oxidized FAD via a triad of aromatic residues that is conserved in photolyases and cryptochromes.

We show that photobleaching of 5,10-methenylTHF in Arabidopsis cry3, a member of the cryptochrome DASH family, with repair activity for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer lesions in single-stranded DNA and in Escherichia coli photolyase results from reduction of 5,10-methenylTHF to 5,10-methyleneTHF that requires the intact tryptophan triad.

Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). DNA photolyases repair cytotoxic and mutagenic DNA lesions that are formed during exposure of DNA to UV-B. These DNA lesions are cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) or pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. According to their substrate specificity, DNA photolyases are designated as CPD photolyases or (6-4) photolyases (2Essen L.O. Klar T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The repair of both types of DNA lesions by photolyase requires the catalytic fully reduced and anionic flavin cofactor FADH− that, when photoexcited, injects an electron directly into the DNA lesion (1Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1A (electron transfer pathway 1). During extraction from the cell and purification under aerobic conditions the flavin cofactor is usually oxidized to the semireduced and eventually to the fully oxidized form. Reduction of these flavin species to FADH− in vitro can be achieved by illumination of the enzyme in the presence of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol or Β-mercaptoethanol. This process is named photoactivation (1Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Photoactivation in vitro requires photoexcitation of the flavin and a triad of redox-active residues in the protein moiety that is highly conserved in DNA photolyases (3Aubert C. Vos M.H. Mathis P. Eker A.P. Brettel K. Nature. 2000; 405: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 4Byrdin M. Eker A.P. Vos M.H. Brettel K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8676-8681Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1A (electron transfer pathway 2). These residues are generally tryptophans that allow transport of an electron from the protein surface to the U-shaped flavin cofactor, which is buried within the C-terminal α-helical domain (5Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 6Brudler R. Hitomi K. Daiyasu H.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15103-15110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Photoreduction of the flavin cofactor was also observed in cryptochrome blue/UV-A photoreceptors. However, instead of fully reduced flavin, semireduced flavin species (either anionic flavin semiquinone radical or neutral semiquinone radical) accumulate. This form of the photoreceptor is considered as the signaling state (11Banerjee R. Schleicher E. Meier S. Viana R.M. Pokorny R. Ahmad M. Bittl R. Batschauer A. J. Biol.

Because DASH cryptochromes were found to lack repair activity for CPDs in double-stranded DNA, they were considered as cryptochrome-type photoreceptors (6Brudler R. Hitomi K. Daiyasu H. Toh H.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17696-17700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and loop structures of double-stranded DNA (19Pokorny R. Klar T. Hennecke U. Carell T. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 21023-21027Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and, thus, belong to the CPD photolyase group. In contrast to conventional CPD photolyases, DASH cryptochromes are unable to flip the CPD lesion out of the DNA duplex (7Huang Y. Baxter R. Smith B.S. Partch C.L. Colbert C.L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17701-17706Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Besides the flavin cofactor that is essential for enzymatic activity, DNA photolyases and most likely all cryptochromes contain a second chromophore (1Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Like the catalytic flavin, the second chromophore is non-covalently attached to the protein moiety. The majority of DNA photolyases and, as far as studied, the cryptochromes including the DASH-type like cry3 from Arabidopsis thaliana contain polyglutamated 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (5,10-methenylTHF) as the second chromophore (1Sancar A.

Several organisms like the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans (Synechococcus elongatus) produce deazariboflavins (7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin) and utilize them as second cofactor (22Eker A.P. Kooiman P. Hessels J.K. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8009-8015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In photolyases of thermophilic bacteria and Archaea of the genus Sulfolobus, FMN and FAD, respectively, were found as second cofactors (23Ueda T. Kato A. Kuramitsu S. Terasawa H. Shimada I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36237-36243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Fujihashi M. Numoto N. Kobayashi Y. Mizushima A. Tsujimura M. Nakamura A. Kawarabayasi Y. Miki K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The sole function of the second cofactors demonstrated at present is transfer of excitation energy to the catalytic flavin cofactor via a Förster-type mechanism. The crystal structures of DNA photolyases and DASH cryptochromes revealed that the second chromophores are located in a cleft between the N-terminal α/Β domain and the C-terminal α domain (7Huang Y. Baxter R. Smith B.S. Partch C.L. Colbert C.L. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17701-17706Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Klar T. Pokorny R. Moldt J.

Science. 1995; 268: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The centroid distances between the catalytic FAD and the second chomophore are in the range of 15–18 Å. The close distances and the angles between the transition dipole moments of the two cofactors are favorable for efficient energy transfer. Indeed, energy transfer efficiencies are about 70% for Escherichia coli photolyase (25Payne G. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7715-7727Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), close to 100% for A. nidulans photolyase (26Kim S.T. Heelis P.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11244-11248Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and between 78% (dark-adapted) and 87% (light-adapted) for Arabidopsis cry3 (27Song S.H. Dick B. Penzkofer A. Pokorny R. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2006; 85: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although the second cofactors are not essential for catalysis (28Heelis P.F. Payne G. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4634-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Jorns M.S. Wang B. Jordan S.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6810-6816Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), they increase the efficiency of repair and possibly of photoactivation by having higher extinction coefficients than FADH− in the near UV and blue region (30Hamm-Alvarez S. Sancar A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9649-9656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectral overlap between 5,10-methenylTHF emission and the absorption of the different flavin redox states is on the order FADHo > FADox > FADH− (31Jorns M.S. Wang B.Y. Jordan S.P. Chanderkar L.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Illumination in vitro of photolyase that contains fully oxidized or semireduced flavin results in light-induced absorbance changes. The decrease in absorption in the 450–470-nm region reflects a decrease in the amount of fully oxidized FAD concomitant with transient increase in absorption above 500 nm, which indicates the formation of a neutral semiquinone radical. Excitation of the 5,10-methenylTHF antenna chromophore at its absorption peak at 380 nm causes a likewise photoreduction of the catalytic FAD (1Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 27Song S.H. Dick B. Penzkofer A. Pokorny R. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. J. Photochem. Photobiol.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, irreversible bleaching of the 380-nm peak is observed under high irradiance UV-A or camera flash illumination (28Heelis P.F. Payne G. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4634-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Hamm-Alvarez S. Sancar A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9649-9656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This irreversible bleaching goes along with release of the folate cofactor from the protein moiety (30Hamm-Alvarez S. Sancar A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9649-9656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was named photodecomposition of 5,10-methenylTHF (28Heelis P.F. Payne G. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4634-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the formed folate species remained unknown (30Hamm-Alvarez S. Sancar A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9649-9656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous spectroscopic characterization of Arabidopsis cry3, a similar bleaching of the 380-nm peak was observed (27Song S.H. Dick B. Penzkofer A. Pokorny R. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2006; 85: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here we show that a third electron transfer pathway exists in photolyase and DASH cryptochome, where the 5,10-methenylTHF cofactor is photoreduced to 5,10-methyleneTHF. Thus, bleaching at 380 nm does not simply reflect destruction but is a specific chemical conversion of the second chromophore. Flavin adenine dinucleotide disodium salt hydrate (FAD) was purchased from Sigma and was used without further purification. Riboflavin (RF) was purchased from Duchefa Biochemie B.V. RF was used as internal standard for HPLC analysis. (6R,S)-5,10-methenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid chloride (5,10-methenylTHF), (6R,S)-5,10-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid calcium salt (5,10-methyleneTHF), (6S)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid (THF), and (6R,S)-5-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid calcium salt (5-methylTHF) were purchased from Schircks Laboratories. They were used as delivered. Chemical structures of folates are shown in Fig. 1B. All folate and flavin stock solutions were prepared immediately before usage, and their concentrations were determined by their molar absorption coefficients: FAD, ϵ450 nm 11,300 m−1cm−1; RF, ϵ445 nm 12,500 m−1cm−1; 5,10-methenylTHF, ϵ354 nm 24,900 m−1cm−1; 5,10-methyleneTHF, ϵ294 nm 25,000 m−1cm−1; THF, ϵ297 nm 29,100 m−1cm−1; 5-methylTHF, ϵ290 nm 31,700 m−1cm−1. Β-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate sodium salt (NADP+) was purchased from AppliChem. NADP+ stock solution was prepared immediately before usage, and the concentration was determined by the molar absorption coefficient of NADP+, ϵ260-nm 18,000 m−1cm−1. To introduce Trp-356 → Phe (W356F) and Trp-432 → Phe (W432F) substitutions into the CRY3 gene, mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). As the template, the CRY3 gene (amino acids Met-1—Pro-526; GenBankTM protein accession code 568461) in the pQE-60 vector (Qiagen) was used (16Kleine T. Lockhart P. Batschauer A. Plant J. 2003; 35: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The following primer sets were used with mutated codons shown in small letters: W356F, 5′-GTGCAAGGGAAGtttAGCCAAGATCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGATCTTGGCTaaaCTTCCCTTGCAC-3′; W432F, 5′-CTAATTATGGAAACtttACCTATGGAGCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCCTGCTCCATAGGTaaaGTTTCCATAATTAG-3′. The correctness of the final expression constructs was verified by sequencing. Expression and purification of proteins were done under red light conditions as described (21Pokorny R. Klar T. Essen L.O. Batschauer A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the size-exclusion chromatography step was omitted, and the final NaCl concentration was adjusted to 200 mm during the concentrating step on Amicon ultra centrifugal filter concentrator with a 30-kDa cut-off (Millipore). UV-visible absorption spectra of purified cry3 wild type and mutant proteins were recorded using a 2-channel UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). For direct comparison of cry3 wild type and mutants, absorption cross-section spectra were calculated (8Klar T. Pokorny R. Moldt J. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 954-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Photoreduction of fully oxidized FAD by blue light and UV-A illumination and photobleaching of 5,10-methenylTHF by UV-A treatment in the protein samples were followed by recording difference spectra during illumination at 15 °C as already described (8Klar T. Pokorny R. Moldt J. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 954-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interference filters (Schott) were used for monochromatic radiation with blue light (450 ± 6 nm; 50 μmol m−2 s−1) or UV-A (386 ± 5 nm; 112 μmol m−2 s−1). Kinetics were plotted for the 450-nm absorption peak of fully oxidized FAD and for the 384-nm absorption peak of 5,10-methenylTHF. The data were fitted by mono-exponential decay curves. Excitation and emission spectra of cofactors released from cry3 wild type and mutants after trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the protein (27Song S.H. Dick B. Penzkofer A. Pokorny R. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2006; 85: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and after trichloroacetic acid treatment of cofactor standards, respectively, were recorded in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol using an RF-5301 PC spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu) in a three-window glass fluorescence cuvette (Hellma GmbH & Co. KG). The cofactor composition and the ratios of cofactor to protein were determined by HPLC reverse phase chromatography analysis as already described (27Song S.H. Dick B. Penzkofer A. Pokorny R. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2006; 85: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cofactors were separated and eluted from the column using a continuous linear gradient of methanol (60–80%), and separation was monitored by absorption at 360 nm (5,10-methenylTHF and oxidized flavins), at 450 nm (only oxidized flavins), and at 295 nm (oxidized flavins and all folates except 5,10-methenylTHF). For comparison, 5 nmol of each standard were processed analogously. For ESI-MS analysis cofactor standards (5,10-methenylTHF and 5,10-methyleneTHF, both monoglutamated) were separated by liquid chromatography, and mass spectra were recorded online by ESI-MS as described below. A 36 μmE. coli photolyase protein solution was treated with sodium borohydride (final concentration 50 mm) to reduce the polyglutamated 5,10-methenylTHF and release the formed 5-methylTHF (29Jorns M.S. Wang B. Jordan S.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6810-6816Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The enzyme completely depleted of folate by chromatography on a Sephadex PD-10 (GE-Healthcare) desalting column was reconstituted with monoglutamated 5,10-methenylTHF by incubating 10 nmol of the enzyme with a 10-fold molar excess of 5,10-methenylTHF at 10 °C for 75 min. The incorporation of 5,10-methenylTHF into E. coli photolyase was monitored spectroscopically and seen by the increase in absorbance at 380 nm. After removal of unbound 5,10-methenylTHF by repeated concentration and dilution of the protein solution in 500 μl of Vivaspin ultrafiltration spin columns (Sartorius Stedim Biotech), the reconstituted protein solution (43 μm) was used for UV-A (386 ± 5 nm, 120 μmol m−2 s−1) treatment followed by recording the absorption spectra. For liquid chromatography-MS measurements to 100 μl of the E. coli photolyase protein solutions (concentration, 48 μm for reconstituted dark sample and 43 μm for reconstituted UV-A irradiated sample), 1 ml acetonitrile was added. After centrifugation for 15 min (18,000 × g), the supernatants containing the extracted cofactors were dried by lyophilization. The pellet was redissolved in 50 μl of H2O and subjected to liquid chromatography-MS analysis. For chromatography, a 125/2 Nucleodur C18ec column (Macherey-Nagel) was utilized with an Agilent 1100 chromatography system (Agilent). The following gradient was applied at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and a column temperature of 25 °C with buffer A (H2O, 0.05% formic acid) and buffer B (acetonitrile, 0.045% formic acid), holding B for 5 min at 2% followed by a linear increase of B to 10% within an additional 5 min and to 30% within 15 min. Finally, buffer B was increased to 95% B within 2 min. Mass spectra were recorded online by ESI-MS using a LTQ-FT mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan). High resolution mass spectra were obtained using the ICR detection cell, and MSMS data were generated in the linear ion trap. 5,10-MethyleneTHF dehydrogenase/5,10-methenylTHF cyclohydrolase was purified from E. coli cells (BL21 (DE3)) following established procedures (32D’Ari L. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23953-23958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the enzyme was purified from total soluble protein extracts by protamine sulfate (2%) and ammonium sulfate (35, 55, and 70%) precipitation in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm Β-mercaptoethanol followed by heparin and anion exchange chromatography in the same buffer system with 1 m KCl for elution. The specificity of the purified enzyme for the two substrates, NADP+ and 5,10-methyleneTHF, was tested and is shown in supplemental Fig. S1B. The release of the cofactors from cry3 or E. coli photolyase by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, heat treatment, or incubation of the sample in 20% acetonitrile (as used for reverse phase chromatography analysis) inhibited the enzyme assay. Thus, the cofactors were released from the protein moiety by incubation in imidazole (33Xu L. Zhang D. Mu W. van Berkel W.J. Luo Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), resulting in intact cofactor (supplemental Fig. S1A). Thereto the protein sample was incubated at 4 °C for 5 h in the dark in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol containing 500 mm imidazole. After removal of precipitated proteins by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) the released cofactors were separated from the protein by a concentrating step on an Amicon ultra centrifugal filter concentrator with 30-kDa cut-off (Millipore) and tested in the enzyme assay. Cofactor standard solutions were treated and analyzed the same way, but the concentrating step was omitted (supplemental Fig. S1C). The conversion of 5,10-methyleneTHF to 5,10-methenylTHF by the dehydrogenase activity was traced spectroscopically by the increase in 340-nm absorbance caused by the formation of NADPH (supplemental Fig. S1D) (34Dev I.K. Harvey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4245-4253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the standard enzyme assay mixture contained 0.2 mm NADP+, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, 10 mm Β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol in a final volume of 130 μl. The mixture was prepared without NADP+; after the addition of the enzyme solution, the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 20 °C. Afterward, NADP+ was added to the mixture to start the reaction. For spectroscopic measurements the reference contained the same enzyme assay mixture of released cofactors or cofactor standards like the measured sample except that no NADP+ was added. cry3 was cocrystallized with a thymine dimer-comprising oligonucleotide (T-T<>T-T-T) as previously described (19Pokorny R. Klar T. Hennecke U. Carell T. Batschauer A. Essen L.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 21023-21027Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Bleaching of cry3·T5 cocrystals and recording of fluorescence and UV-visible spectra was achieved at the Cryobench, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. X-ray data were collected for photobleached cry3 cocrystals at beamline ID14-1, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility and processed and scaled by XDS and XSCALE (35Kabsch W. J. Appl.

https://openalex.org/W2025380529,"Vocal learning has evolved in only a few groups of mammals and birds. The developmental and evolutionary origins of vocal learning remain unclear. The imitation of a memorized sound is a clear example of vocal learning, but is that when vocal learning starts? Here we use an ontogenetic approach to examine how vocal learning emerges in a songbird, the chipping sparrow. The first vocalizations of songbirds, food begging calls, were thought to be innate, and vocal learning emerges later during subsong, a behavior reminiscent of infant babbling. Here we report that the food begging calls of male sparrows show several characteristics associated with learned song: male begging calls are highly variable between individuals and are altered by deafening; the production of food begging calls induces c-fos expression in a forebrain motor nucleus, RA, that is involved with the production of learned song. Electrolytic lesions of RA significantly reduce the variability of male calls. The male begging calls are subsequently incorporated into subsong, which in turn transitions into recognizable attempts at vocal imitation. Females do not sing and their begging calls are not affected by deafening or RA lesion. Our results suggest that, in chipping sparrows, intact hearing can influence the quality of male begging calls, auditory-sensitive vocal variability during food begging calls is the first step in a modification of vocal output that eventually culminates with vocal imitation."
https://openalex.org/W2026222621,"Activation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B (5-HT(2B)), a G(q/11) protein-coupled receptor, results in proliferation of various cell types. The 5-HT(2B) receptor is also expressed on the pacemaker cells of the gastrointestinal tract, the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), where activation triggers ICC proliferation. The goal of this study was to characterize the mitogenic signal transduction cascade activated by the 5-HT(2B) receptor. All of the experiments were performed on mouse small intestine primary cell cultures. Activation of the 5-HT(2B) receptor by its agonist BW723C86 induced proliferation of ICC. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by LY294002 decreased base-line proliferation but had no effect on 5-HT(2B) receptor-mediated proliferation. Proliferation of ICC through the 5-HT(2B) receptor was inhibited by the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 and by the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor inhibitor Xestospongin C. Calphostin C, the alpha, beta, gamma, and micro protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Gö6976, and the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and zeta PKC inhibitor Gö6983 inhibited 5-HT(2B) receptor-mediated proliferation, indicating the involvement of PKC alpha, beta, or gamma. Of all the PKC isoforms blocked by Gö6976, PKCgamma and micro mRNAs were found by single-cell PCR to be expressed in ICC. 5-HT(2B) receptor activation in primary cell cultures obtained from PKCgamma(-/-) mice did not result in a proliferative response, further indicating the requirement for PKCgamma in the proliferative response to 5-HT(2B) receptor activation. The data demonstrate that the 5-HT(2B) receptor-induced proliferative response of ICC is through phospholipase C, [Ca(2+)](i), and PKCgamma, implicating this PKC isoform in the regulation of cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2062103850,"Tadpoles of the anuran species Rana pirica can undergo predator-specific morphological responses. Exposure to a predation threat by larvae of the salamander Hynobius retardatus results in formation of a bulgy body (bulgy morph) with a higher tail. The tadpoles revert to a normal phenotype upon removal of the larval salamander threat. Although predator-induced phenotypic plasticity is of major interest to evolutionary ecologists, the molecular and physiological mechanisms that control this response have yet to be elucidated. In a previous study, we identified various genes that are expressed in the skin of the bulgy morph. However, it proved difficult to determine which of these were key genes in the control of gene expression associated with the bulgy phenotype. Here, we show that a novel gene plays an important role in the phenotypic plasticity producing the bulgy morph. A functional microarray analysis using facial tissue samples of control and bulgy morph tadpoles identified candidate functional genes for predator-specific morphological responses. A larger functional microarray was prepared than in the previous study and used to analyze mRNAs extracted from facial and brain tissues of tadpoles from induction-reversion experiments. We found that a novel uromodulin-like gene, which we name here pirica, was up-regulated and that keratin genes were down-regulated as the period of exposure to larval salamanders increased. Pirica consists of a 1296 bp open reading frame, which is putatively translated into a protein of 432 amino acids. The protein contains a zona pellucida domain similar to that of proteins that function to control water permeability. We found that the gene was expressed in the superficial epidermis of the tadpole skin."
https://openalex.org/W2019743373,"The matrilins are a family of multidomain extracellular matrix proteins with adapter functions. The oligomeric proteins have a bouquet-like structure and bind to a variety of different ligands whereby the avidity of their interactions is dependent on the number of subunits and domains present. Here we show the contribution of post-translational proteolytic processing to the heterogeneity of matrilins seen in tissue extracts and cell culture supernatants. A cleavage site after two glutamate residues in the hinge region close to the C-terminal coiled-coil oligomerization domain is conserved among the matrilins. Cleavage at this site yields molecules that lack almost complete subunits. The processing is least pronounced in matrilin-1 and particularly complex in matrilin-2, which contains additional cleavage sites. Replacement of the hinge region in matrilin-4 by the matrilin-1 hinge region had no marked effect on the processing. A detailed study revealed that matrilin-4 is processed already in the secretory pathway and that the activation of the responsible enzymes is dependent on proprotein convertase activity. Matrilin-3 and -4, but not matrilin-1 subunits present in matrilin-1/-3 hetero-oligomers, were identified as substrates for ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5, whereas ADAMTS1 did not cleave any matrilin. A neo-epitope antibody raised against the N terminus of the C-terminal cleavage product of matrilin-4 detected processed matrilin-4 in cultures of primary chondrocytes as well as on cartilage sections showing that the conserved cleavage site is used in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1980179242,"The sphingomyelin signal transduction pathway is known to play a role in mediating the action of various cytokines. Herein, we examined the role of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase)/ceramide in peptidoglycan (PGN)-induced NF-κB activation and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in macrophages. PGN-induced COX-2 expression was attenuated by an nSMase inhibitor (3-O-methyl-sphingomyeline, 3-OMS) and ceramidase, but not by an acidic SMase inhibitor (imipramine). C2-ceramide, bacterial SMase (which mimics cellular SMase activity), and a ceramidase inhibitor (N-oleoyl-ethanolamine) individually had no effect on COX-2 expression; however, they markedly enhanced PGN-induced COX-2 expression.

Staphylococcus aureus is a major Gram-positive bacterial pathogen that activates the innate immune system of a host and induces the release of inflammatory molecules such as chemokines and cytokines (1Krivan H.C.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize the structure of microorganisms, are essential for innate immune signaling (8Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8423) Google Scholar). TLR2 has been shown to be a main receptor recognizing PGN, and its activation in response to PGN induces activation of transcription factor NF-κB and induction of proinflammatory cytokines (9Wang Q. Dziarski R. Kirschning C.J. Muzio M. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10Wang Z.M. Liu C. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20260-20267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For TLR2 signaling, TLR2 utilizes adaptor proteins, such as MyD88, to activate IL-1 receptor-associated kinase. Then the activated IL-1 receptor-associated kinase dissociates MyD88 from the receptor, followed by association with TNF-associated factor 6. This triggers activation of NF-κB, which is required for induction of gene expression (11O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). In addition, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is also activated in response to PGN, which leads to activation of NF-κB transcription factor (12Chen B.C. Chang Y.S. Kang J.C. Hsu M.J.

There are two isoforms of COX, named COX-1 and COX-2, which have been cloned and identified to have 60% homology in humans (13Mitchell J.A. Larkin S. Williams T.J. Biochem.

COX-1 is a housekeeping enzyme, is constitutively expressed in most mammalian tissues, and appears to be responsible for the production of prostaglandins that mediate normal physiological functions such as maintenance of the integrity of the gastric mucosa and regulation of renal blood flow. In contrast, COX-2 is considered to be an inducible immediate-early gene and can be rapidly and transiently induced by proinflammatory mediators, including endotoxins and cytokines (12Chen B.C.

DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Ceramide is an intracellular second messenger that can be generated by sphingomyelin membrane cleavage using either acid sphingomyelinases (aSMases) or neutral sphingomyelinases (nSMases) (20Hannun Y.A.

These include the inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1, as well as environmental stresses, such as UV light; differentiating agents, like vitamin D3; and other immunomodulatory signals, including Fas and CD28 (22Kolesnick R.

A recent study from our laboratory showed that PGN induces TLR2, p85α, and Ras complex formation and subsequently activates the Ras/Raf-1/ERK pathway, which in turn initiates IκB kinase (IKK)α/β and NF-κB activation and ultimately induces COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages (12Chen B.C.

The purpose of this study was to identify the signaling pathway of PGN-induced ceramide formation and its roles in PGN-mediated NF-κB activation and COX-2 expression in macrophages. Our studies demonstrated that PGN might activate the nSMase/ceramide pathway to induce activation of the MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK pathway, which in turn initiates NF-κB activation and ultimately induces COX-2 expression in macrophages.

All of the materials for the SDS-PAGE were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Livingstone, MT), and the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 37 °C incubator. After reaching confluence, the cells were seeded onto either 6-cm dishes for immunoblotting or the kinase assays, 10-cm dishes for the ceramide formation assay, 3.5-cm dishes for the sphingomyelinase activity assay, or 12-well plates for transfection and the κB-luciferase assays. Mouse-specific pathogen-free BALB/c mice, aged 6–8 weeks and weighing 20–25 g, were obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center, National Applied Research Laboratory (Taipei, Taiwan) and maintained in a specific pathogen-free environment in the animal house of Taipei Medical University. The use of animals was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taipei Medical University. The peritoneal macrophages were prepared as described previously (24Chen B.C. Hsieh S.L. Lin W.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 280-288PubMed Google Scholar). BALB/c mice that had been intraperitoneally injected with 1.5 ml of 3% thioglycollate 3 days before macrophage isolation were ether-anesthetized with the peritoneal cavities lavaged with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl to remove elicited peritoneal macrophages and cultured at RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 37 °C incubator. The cells were cultured on 6-cm dishes for an immunoblotting assay. For these assays, 2 × 105 RAW 264.7 cells were seeded onto 12-well plates, and the cells were transfected the following day using GenePORTERTM 2 with 0.5 μg of pGL2-ELAM-Luc and 0.5 μg of pBK-CMV-Lac Z. After 24 h, the medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum and then stimulated with PGN (30 μg/ml) for another 24 h before being harvested. To assess the effects of nSMase and aSMase inhibitors, drugs were added to cells 20 min before PGN addition. To assay the effect of the p38 MAPKαDN, the cells were cotransfected with the p38 MAPKαDN, pGL2-ELAM-Luc, and pBK-CMV-Lac Z for 24 h and then treated with PGN. Luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay system (Promega) and was normalized on the basis of Lac Z expression. The level of induction of luciferase activity was compared as a ratio of cells with and without stimulation. To determine the expressions of COX-2, α-tubulin, ERK phosphorylated at Tyr204, ERK2, JNK phosphorylated at Thr183/Tyr185, JNK2, p38 MAPK phosphorylated at Thr180/Tyr182, p38 MAPK, and MKK3/6 phosphorylated at Ser189/Ser207 in RAW 264.7 macrophages, proteins were extracted, and Western blotting analyses were performed as described previously (25Chen B.C.

Briefly, RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured in 6-cm dishes. After reaching confluence, the cells were treated with PGN or pretreated with specific inhibitors as indicated followed by PGN. After incubation, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized in extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05 mm pepstatin A, and 0.2 mm leupeptin. Samples of equal amounts of protein (60 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was then incubated in TBST buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.02% Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat milk. The proteins were visualized by specific primary antibodies and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibodies. Immunoreactivity was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative data were obtained using a computing densitometer with Image-Pro Plus image analysis software system (Eastman Kodak Co.). The activities of aSMase and nSMase were measured using an Amplex Red sphingomyelinase assay kit according to the procedures described by the manufacturer. Briefly, RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured in 35-mm Petri dishes. After reaching confluence, the cells were treated with PGN (30 μg/ml) for the indicated time intervals or pretreated with specific inhibitors as indicated followed by PGN. After incubation, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and harvested. To assess aSMase activity, the cells were extracted in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg PMSF for 30 min on ice. To assess nSMase activity, the cells were extracted in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml PMSF for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatants were assayed following the manufacturer's instructions. The assay mixture contained the following components in a total volume of 200 μl: 100 μl of the enzyme source (150 μg), 2 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, 0.2 unit/ml choline oxidase, 8 units/ml alkaline phosphatase, and 0.5 μm sphingomyelin. Assay mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the fluorescence was measured with a HIDEX (Turku, Finland) chameleon microplate reader with excitation at 563 nm and emission at 587 nm. The quantification of ceramide in RAW 264.7 macrophages was performed as described previously (26Schiffmann S. Sandner J. Schmidt R. Birod K. Wobst I. Schmidt H. Angioni C. Geisslinger G. Grösch S. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured in 10-cm dishes. After reaching confluence, the cells were treated with PGN for the indicated time intervals. After incubation, the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and collected in 0.5 ml of PBS. The cells were centrifuged at 1,500 rpm and 4 °C for 5 min. The PBS supernatant was removed, and the cells were stored at −80 °C. The lipids were extracted with 500 μl of methanol after the addition of internal standards (C17:0 ceramide). The suspension was incubated at 25 °C with 30 min of shaking and then centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 30 min at 25 °C. The supernatants were collected, and the extraction step was repeated. The combined organic phases of ceramide were assayed. The liquid-liquid extractions; the amounts of C16:0 ceramide, C18:0 ceramide, C24:0 ceramide, and C24:1 ceramide; and the internal standards were determined by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separation was accomplished under gradient conditions using a Luna C18 column (150 × 2 mm ID, 5-μm particle size, and 10-nm pore size). The HPLC mobile phases consisted of water-formic acid (100:0.1, v/v) (A) and acetonitrile-tetrahydrofuran-formic acid (50:50:0.1, v/v/v) (B). A gradient program was used for the HPLC separation at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The initial buffer composition was 60% (A)/40% (B) held for 0.6 min, then linearly changed to 0% (A)/100% (B) in 4.4 min and held for 5 min, and then linearly returned to 60% (A)/40% (B) in 0.5 min and held for an additional 5.5 min. Forty microliters of each sample were injected, and the total run time was 16 min. Tandem mass spectrometry analyses were performed on an API 4,000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a Turbo V source (Applied Biosystems). Precursor-to-product ion transitions of m/z 536.8 → 280.5 for C16:0 ceramide, m/z 564.9 → 308.5 for C18:0 ceramide, m/z 646.9 → 390.8 for C24:1 ceramide, m/z 648.9 → 392.8 for C24:0 ceramide, and m/z 550.9 → 294.5 for C17:0 ceramide were used for multiple reactions monitoring with a dwell time of 15 ms. Concentrations of the calibration standards, quality controls, and unknowns were evaluated by Analyst software 1.4.2 (Applied Biosystems). The mean peak areas of the samples reconstructed with internal standards were compared with the mean peak area of 10 ng/ml internal standards in methanol. Total ceramide was calculated from the sum of C16:0, C18:0, C24:0, and C24:1 ceramide subspecies. The lipids were extracted according to the method established by Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41842) Google Scholar), and ceramide was quantified by the diacylglycerol kinase assay. In brief, RAW 264.7 macrophages were grown in 10-cm dishes. After reaching confluence, the cells were pretreated with specific inhibitors as indicated followed by PGN. After incubation, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1,500 rpm for 5 min), washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and extracted with 3 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v). Lipids in the organic phase extract were dried under N2. Ceramide contained in each sample was resuspended in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing β-octylglucoside/dioleoylphosphatidylgerol (7.5%: 2.5 mm), 50 μl of 2× buffer, 19.4 μl dilution buffer, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 3 μg of Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol). After 30 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by extraction of lipids with 1.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2), 0.3 ml of H2O, 0.5 ml of chloroform, and 0.5 ml of 1% HClO4. The lower organic phase was dried under N2 and resolved at 40 μl of chloroform:methanol (4: 1). Ceramide 1-phosphate was resolved by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 plates (Whatman, Pittsburgh, PA) using a solvent system of chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:H2O (10:4:3:2:1) and detected by autoradiography. RAW 264.7 cells were grown in 6-cm dishes. After reaching confluence, the cells were treated with 30 μg/ml PGN for the indicated time intervals or pretreated with specific inhibitors as indicated followed by PGN. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS; lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate; and centrifuged. The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against p38 MAPK in the presence of A/G-agarose beads overnight. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase reactions were performed by incubating immunoprecipitated beads with 20 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μm ATP and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. To assess p38 MAPK kinase activity, 50 μg/ml of myelin basic protein was added to serve as the substrate. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The results are presented as the means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. One-way analysis of variance followed by, when appropriate, Bonferroni's multiple range test was used to determine the statistical significance of the difference between means. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Previous study has found that PGN (1–100 μg/ml) induced COX-2 expression in a concentration-dependent manner, with a submaximal effect at 30 μg/ml (12Chen B.C. Chang Y.S. Kang J.C. Hsu M.J. Sheu J.R.

To explore whether nSMase and aSMase might mediate PGN-induced (30 μg/ml) COX-2 expression, the nSMase inhibitor, 3-OMS (28Zeng C. Lee J.T. Chen H. Chen S. Hsu C.Y. Xu J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the aSMase inhibitor, imipramine (29Albouz S. Le Saux F. Wenger D. Hauw J.J. Baumann N. Life Sci. 1986; 38: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), were used. As shown in Fig. 1A, pretreatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with 3-OMS (3∼30 μm) inhibited PGN-induced (30 μg/ml) COX-2 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. When cells were treated with 30 μm 3-OMS, PGN-induced COX-2 expression was inhibited by 61 ± 2% (n = 3). However, imipramine (3–30 μm) did not affect PGN-induced COX-2 expression (Fig. 1A). Next, we determined whether nSMase directly enhanced PGN-induced COX-2 expression. A lower concentration (3 μg/ml) of PGN was used in the following experiments. Treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with recombinant bSMase (0.1–0.3 unit/ml), an exogenous source of SMase that mimics SMase action by degrading membrane sphingomyelin to increase cellular ceramide levels (30Zhang P.

Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), did not induce COX-2 expression. However, treatment of cells with various concentrations (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 unit/ml) of recombinant bacterial SMase concentration-dependently enhanced COX-2 expression induced by the lower concentration (3 μg/ml) of PGN by 167 ± 12, 175 ± 20, and 385 ± 57%, respectively (n = 3) (Fig. 1B). Ceramide is metabolized by the ceramidase into sphingosin (26Schiffmann S. Sandner J. Schmidt R. Birod K. Wobst I. Schmidt H. Angioni C. Geisslinger G. Grösch S. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We further explored whether ceramidase affected PGN-induced COX-2 expression. Treatment with macrophages with recombinant ceramidase (30–300 ng/ml) inhibited PGN-induced COX-2 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. When cells were treated with 300 ng/ml ceramidase, PGN-induced COX-2 expression was inhibited by 50 ± 8% (n = 3) (Fig. 1C). Next, we directly measured the activities of nSMase and aSMase induced by PGN stimulation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Stimulation of cells with 30 μg/ml PGN induced an increase in nSMase activity in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum after 20 min of treatment (Fig. 2A). In contrast, PGN treatment did not alter aSMase activity (Fig. 2A). Confirming the effect"

In the present study, a mass spectrometry-based approach was used to analyze the effects of cytosine methylation on the kinetics of AGT repair of O(6)-methyldeoxyguanosine (O(6)-Me-dG) adducts placed within frequently mutated 5'-CG-3' dinucleotides of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. O(6)-Me-dG-containing DNA duplexes were incubated with human recombinant AGT protein, followed by rapid quenching, acid hydrolysis, and isotope dilution high pressure liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis of unrepaired O(6)-methylguanine. Second-order rate constants were calculated in the absence or presence of the C-5 methyl group at neighboring cytosine residues. We found that the kinetics of AGT-mediated repair of O(6)-Me-dG were affected by neighboring 5-methylcytosine ((Me)C) in a sequence-dependent manner. AGT repair of O(6)-Me-dG adducts placed within 5'-CG-3' dinucleotides of p53 codons 245 and 248 was hindered when (Me)C was present in both DNA strands. In contrast, cytosine methylation within p53 codon 158 slightly increased the rate of O(6)-Me-dG repair by AGT. The effects of (Me)C located immediately 5' and in the base paired position to O(6)-Me-dG were not additive as revealed by experiments with hypomethylated sequences. Furthermore, differences in dealkylation rates did not correlate with AGT protein affinity for cytosine-methylated and unmethylated DNA duplexes or with the rates of AGT-mediated nucleotide flipping, suggesting that (Me)C influences other kinetic steps involved in repair, e.g. the rate of alkyl transfer from DNA to AGT."

https://openalex.org/W2009819415,"Lipids can act as signaling molecules, activating intracellular and membrane-associated receptors to regulate physiological functions. To understand how a newly discovered signaling lipid functions, it is necessary to identify and characterize the enzymes involved in their production and inactivation. The signaling lipid N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) is known to activate intracellular and membrane-associated receptors and regulate physiological functions, but little is known about the enzymes involved in its production and inactivation.Here we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce and inactivate PEA, suggesting that genetic manipulations of this lower eukaryote may be used to identify the enzymes involved in PEA metabolism. Accordingly, using single gene deletion mutants, we identified yeast genes that control PEA metabolism, including SPO14 (a yeast homologue of the mammalian phospholipase D) that controls PEA production and YJU3 (a yeast homologue of the mammalian monoacylglycerol lipase) that controls PEA inactivation. We also found that PEA metabolism is affected by heterologous expression of two mammalian proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases, namely huntingtin and alpha-synuclein.Together these findings show that forward and reverse genetics in S. cerevisiae can be used to identify proteins involved in PEA production and inactivation, and suggest that mutated proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases might affect the metabolism of this important signaling lipid."

Furthermore, binding of hemin is modulated by a cooperative mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis, steady-state kinetic experiments, and fluorescence anisotropy have been used to verify the possible involvement of loop 113–119 in the tetramerization process and in the cooperative phenomenon. This protein segment is one of the most prominent structural differences between PfGST and other GST isoenzymes. Our results demonstrate that truncation, increased rigidity, or even a simple point mutation of this loop causes a dramatic change in the tetramerization kinetics that becomes at least 100 times slower than in the native enzyme. All of the mutants tested have lost the positive cooperativity for hemin binding, suggesting that the integrity of this peculiar loop is essential for intersubunit communication. Interestingly, the tetramerization process of the native enzyme that occurs rapidly when GSH is removed is prevented not only by GSH but even by oxidized glutathione. This result suggests that protection by PfGST against hemin is independent of the redox status of the parasite cell.

Expressed in almost all living organisms, GSTs represent a large superfamily of multifunctional detoxifying enzymes that are able to conjugate GSH to a lot of toxic electrophilic compounds, thus facilitating their excretion. Many other protection roles of GSTs have been described, including the enzymatic reduction of organic peroxides (3Salinas A.E. Wong M.G. Curr. Med.

PfGST is one of the most abundant proteins expressed by P. falciparum (from 1 to 10%, i.e. from 0.1 to 1 mm) (12Harwaldt P. Rahlfs S. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and different from what occurs in many organisms, it is the sole GST isoenzyme expressed by this parasite. Despite its structural similarity to the Mu class GST, this specific isoenzyme cannot be assigned to any known GST class (13Fritz-Wolf K. Becker A. Rahlfs S. Harwaldt P. Schirmer R.H. Kabsch W. Becker K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13821-13826Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The interest in this enzyme is due to its particular protective role in the parasite. In fact, in addition to the usual GST activity that promotes the conjugation of GSH to electrophilic centers of toxic compounds, this protein efficiently binds hemin, and thus it could protect the parasite (that resides in the erythrocytes) from the parasitotoxic effect of this heme by-product (14Becker K. Tilley L. Vennerstrom J.L. Roberts D. Rogerson S. Ginsburg H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Specific compounds that selectively inhibit its catalytic activity or hemin binding could be promising candidates as antimalarial drugs. In this context, the discovery of structural or mechanistic properties of this enzyme that are not found in other GSTs may be important for designing selective inhibitors that are toxic to the parasite but harmless for the host cells. Two properties never observed in other members of the GST superfamily are of particular interest. The first property is that this enzyme, in the absence of GSH, is inactivated in a short time and loses its ability to bind hemin (15Liebau E. De Maria F. Burmeister C. Perbandt M. Turella P.

Recent studies indicated that the inactivation process is related to a dimer to tetramer transition (13Fritz-Wolf K. Becker A. Rahlfs S. Harwaldt P. Schirmer R.H. Kabsch W. Becker K. Proc. Natl.

The second property is the strong positive homotropic phenomenon that modulates the affinity of the two subunits for hemin (15Liebau E. De Maria F. Burmeister C. Perbandt M. Turella P. Antonini G.

From a structural point of view, the most intriguing differences of PfGST when compared with other GSTs are a more solvent-exposed H-site and an atypic extra loop connecting helix α-4 and helix α-5 (residues 113–119; see also Fig. 1) that could be involved in the dimer-dimer interaction. Actually, in the absence of ligands, two biological dimers form a tetramer, and these homodimers are interlocked with each other by loop 113–119 of one homodimer, which occupies an H-site of the other homodimer (13Fritz-Wolf K.

Upon binding of S-hexylglutathione, loop 113–119 rearranges; residues Asn-114, Leu-115, and Phe-116 form an additional coil in helix α-4; and the side chains of Asn-111, Phe-116, and Tyr-211 flip into the H-site of the same dimer (17Hiller N.

The changed course of residues 113–119 in the liganded enzyme prevents the interlocking of the dimers.In this paper, by means of site-directed mutagenesis, fluorescence anisotropy, kinetic studies, and size exclusion chromatography, we check the influence of selected mutations of this atypic loop in the tetramerization process and the possible involvement of this protein segment in the cooperative phenomenon that characterizes hemin binding. In addition we describe that the tetramerization process is inhibited not only by GSH but even by GSSG. This finding suggests that hemin binding of PfGST is independent of the redox status of the cell. Finally, we demonstrate that the presence of GSH (or GSSG) in the active site is not essential for hemin binding, but this interaction only requires an active dimeric conformation.

Chem. 1999; 6: 279-309PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 5Deponte M. Becker K.

The mammalian cytosolic GSTs are dimeric proteins grouped into eight species-independent classes termed Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Omega, Pi, Sigma, Theta, and Zeta on the basis of sequence similarity, immunological reactivity, and substrate specificity (3Salinas A.E. Wong M.G. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 279-309PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar, 9Meyer D.J.

PfGST is one of the most abundant proteins expressed by P. falciparum (from 1 to 10%, i.e. from 0.1 to 1 mm) (12Harwaldt P. Rahlfs S. Becker K. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and different from what occurs in many organisms, it is the sole GST isoenzyme expressed by this parasite. Despite its structural similarity to the Mu class GST, this specific isoenzyme cannot be assigned to any known GST class (13Fritz-Wolf K. Becker A. Rahlfs S. Harwaldt P. Schirmer R.H. Kabsch W. Becker K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13821-13826Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The interest in this enzyme is due to its particular protective role in the parasite. In fact, in addition to the usual GST activity that promotes the conjugation of GSH to electrophilic centers of toxic compounds, this protein efficiently binds hemin, and thus it could protect the parasite (that resides in the erythrocytes) from the parasitotoxic effect of this heme by-product (14Becker K. Tilley L. Vennerstrom J.L. Roberts D. Rogerson S. Ginsburg H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 163-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Specific compounds that selectively inhibit its catalytic activity or hemin binding could be promising candidates as antimalarial drugs. In this context, the discovery of structural or mechanistic properties of this enzyme that are not found in other GSTs may be important for designing selective inhibitors that are toxic to the parasite but harmless for the host cells. Two properties never observed in other members of the GST superfamily are of particular interest. The first property is that this enzyme, in the absence of GSH, is inactivated in a short time and loses its ability to bind hemin (15Liebau E. De Maria F. Burmeister C. Perbandt M. Turella P. Antonini G. Federici G. Giansanti F. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Caccuri A.M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26121-26128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicated that the inactivation process is related to a dimer to tetramer transition (13Fritz-Wolf K. Becker A. Rahlfs S. Harwaldt P. Schirmer R.H. Kabsch W. Becker K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13821-13826Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Tripathi T. Rahlfs S. Becker K. Bhakuni V. BMC Struct.

Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The second property is the strong positive homotropic phenomenon that modulates the affinity of the two subunits for hemin (15Liebau E. De Maria F. Burmeister C. Perbandt M. Turella P. Antonini G. Federici G. Giansanti F. Stella L. Lo Bello M. Caccuri A.M. Ricci G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26121-26128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of PfGST, solved by two different groups (13Fritz-Wolf K. Becker A. Rahlfs S. Harwaldt P. Schirmer R.H. Kabsch W. Becker K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13821-13826Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Perbandt M. Burmeister C. Walter R.D. Betzel C. Liebau E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1336-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), provides insights into this effect. From a structural point of view, the most intriguing differences of PfGST when compared with other GSTs are a more solvent-exposed H-site and an atypic extra loop connecting helix α-4 and helix α-5 (residues 113–119; see also Fig. 1) that could be involved in the dimer-dimer interaction. Actually, in the absence of ligands, two biological dimers form a tetramer, and these homodimers are interlocked with each other by loop 113–119 of one homodimer, which occupies an H-site of the other homodimer (13Fritz-Wolf K. Becker A. Rahlfs S. Harwaldt P. Schirmer R.H. Kabsch W. Becker K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13821-13826Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18Perbandt M. Burmeister C. Walter R.D. Betzel C. Liebau E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1336-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Upon binding of S-hexylglutathione, loop 113–119 rearranges; residues Asn-114, Leu-115, and Phe-116 form an additional coil in helix α-4; and the side chains of Asn-111, Phe-116, and Tyr-211 flip into the H-site of the same dimer (17Hiller N. Fritz-Wolf K. Deponte M. Wende W. Zimmermann H. Becker K. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Perbandt M. Burmeister C. Walter R.D. Betzel C. Liebau E. J.

The changed course of residues 113–119 in the liganded enzyme prevents the interlocking of the dimers. glutathione S-transferase from P. falciparum c-Jun N-terminal kinase. glutathione S-transferase from P. falciparum c-Jun N-terminal kinase. In this paper, by means of site-directed mutagenesis, fluorescence anisotropy, kinetic studies, and size exclusion chromatography, we check the influence of selected mutations of this atypic loop in the tetramerization process and the possible involvement of this protein segment in the cooperative phenomenon that characterizes hemin binding. In addition we describe that the tetramerization process is inhibited not only by GSH but even by GSSG. This finding suggests that hemin binding of PfGST is independent of the redox status of the cell. Finally, we demonstrate that the presence of GSH (or GSSG) in the active site is not essential for hemin binding, but this interaction only requires an active dimeric conformation."

Importantly, the genetics of dysplasia, a facultative cancer, at the edge of malignant transformation is unknown.We employed laser microdissection to harvest c-Raf1- induced dysplastic as opposed to transgenic but otherwise morphologically unaltered epithelium and compared findings to non-transgenic lung. We then employed microarrays to search genome wide for gene regulatory networks. A total of 120 and 287 genes were significantly regulated, respectively. Dysplasia was exclusive associated with up-regulation of genes coding for cell growth and proliferation, cell-to-cell signalling and interaction, lipid metabolism, development, and cancer. Likewise, when dysplasia was compared with non-transgenic cells up-regulation of cancer associated genes, tight junction proteins, xenobiotic defence and developmental regulators was observed. Further, in a comparison of the data sets of dysplasia vs transgenic and dysplasia vs non-transgenic 114 genes were regulated in common. We additionally confirmed regulation of some genes by immunohistochemistry and therefore demonstrate good concordance between gene regulation and coded protein.Our study identified transcriptional networks at successive stages of tumor-development, i.e. from histological unaltered but transgenic lungs to nuclear atypia. Our SP-C/c-raf transgenic mouse model revealed interesting and novel candidate genes and pathways that provide clues on the mechanism forcing respiratory epithelium into dysplasia and subsequently cancer, some of which might also be useful in the molecular imaging and flagging of early stages of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2058334346,"Background Circulating epithelial progenitor cells are important for repair of the airway epithelium in a mouse model of tracheal transplantation. We therefore hypothesized that circulating epithelial progenitor cells would also be present in normal human subjects and could be important for repair of the airway after lung injury. As lung transplantation is associated with lung injury, which is severe early on and exacerbated during episodes of infection and rejection, we hypothesized that circulating epithelial progenitor cell levels could predict clinical outcome following lung transplantation. Methodology/Principal Findings Quantitative Real Time PCR was performed to determine peripheral blood mRNA levels of cytokeratin 5, a previously characterized marker of circulating epithelial progenitor cells. Cytokeratin 5 levels were evaluated in healthy human subjects, in lung transplant recipients immediately post-transplant and serially thereafter, and in heart transplant recipients. All normal human subjects examined expressed cytokeratin 5 in their buffy coat in amounts that were not significantly influenced by age or gender. There was a profound, statistically significant decrease in cytokeratin 5 mRNA expression levels in lung transplant patients compared to healthy human subjects (p = 3.1×10−13) and to heart transplant recipients. There was a moderate negative correlation between improved circulating cytokeratin 5 mRNA levels in lung transplant recipients with recovering lung function, as measured by improved FEV1 values (rho = −0.39). Conclusions/Significance Levels of cytokeratin 5 mRNA, a proxy marker for circulating epithelial progenitor cells, inversely correlated with disease status in lung transplant recipients. It may therefore serve as a biomarker of the clinical outcome of lung transplant patients and potentially other patients with airway injury."
