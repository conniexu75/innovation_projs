https://openalex.org/W2121264285,"Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of exonic CAG triplet repeats in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein (Htt), however, the means by which neurodegeneration occurs remains obscure. There is evidence that mutant Htt interacts with transcription factors leading to reduced histone acetylation. We report that administration of the histone deacetylase inhibitor phenylbutyrate after onset of symptoms in a transgenic mouse model of HD significantly extends survival and attenuates both gross brain and neuronal atrophy. Administration of phenylbutyrate increased brain histone acetylation and decreased histone methylation levels as assessed by both immunocytochemistry and Western blots. Phenylbutyrate increased mRNA for components of the ubiquitin-proteosomal pathway and down-regulated caspases implicated in apoptotic cell death, and active caspase 3 immunoreactivity in the striatum. These results show that administration of phenylbutyrate, at doses that are well tolerated in man, exerts significant neuroprotective effects in a transgenic mouse model of HD, and therefore represents a very promising therapeutic approach for HD.

The expanded polyglutamine domains can interact with other polyglutamine containing proteins, including several transcription factors (1Cha J.H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Alterations in gene transcription occur as an early feature of transgenic mouse models of HD and other polyglutamine diseases (2La Spada A.R. Fu Y.H. Sopher B.L. Libby R.T. Wang X. Li L.Y. Einum D.D.

One example is recruitment of CREB-binding protein (CBP) into aggregates of polyglutamine containing proteins in cultured cell lines (5Kazantsev A. Preisinger E. Dranovsky A. Goldgaber D. Housman D.

CBP is depleted from its normal nuclear localization and sequestered into Htt containing aggregates in cell culture, transgenic mice, and human HD postmortem brain tissue (7Nucifora Jr., F.C. Sasaki M. Peters M.F. Huang H. Cooper J.K. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Troncoso J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2423-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). CBP functions as a histone acetyltransferase enzyme. Mutant huntingtin directly binds to the acetyltransferase domains of CBP and another protein, P300/CBP associated factor, which results in a reduction of the acetyltransferase activity in cell-free assays as well as a decrease in the level of histone acetylation in mammalian cells (8Steffan J.S. Bodai L. Pallos J. Poelman M. McCampbell A. Apostol B.L. Kazanstev A. Schmidt E. Zhu Y.Z. Greenwald M. Kurokawa R. Housman D.E. Jackson G.R. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). There is, however, evidence of increased CRE-mediated transcription in a transgenic mouse model of HD (9Obrietan K. Hoyt K.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Histone acetylation helps transcription factors gain access to specific regions of DNA when it is tightly packed in chromatin, and thereby increases gene transcription. In a Drosophila model of polyglutamine-dependent neurodegeneration, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors arrest the ongoing progressive neuronal degeneration (8Steffan J.S. Bodai L. Pallos J. Poelman M. McCampbell A. Apostol B.L. Kazanstev A. Schmidt E. Zhu Y.Z. Greenwald M. Kurokawa R. Housman D.E. Jackson G.R. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The toxic effects of polyglutamines in yeast were mitigated by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (10Hughes R.E. Lo R.S. Davis C. Strand A.D. Neal C.L. Olson J.M. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13201-13206Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, histone acetylation is reduced in cell lines that express a mutant androgen receptor with an expanded polyglutamine repeat, and this is reversed by overexpression of CBP or by treatment with HDAC inhibitors, with a concomitant reduction in cell loss (11McCampbell A. Taye A.A. Whitty L. Penney E. Staffan J.S. Fischbeck K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15179-15184Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) ameliorates motor deficits in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD, although its effects on survival were not assessed. (12Hockly E Richon VM. Woodman B. Smith D.L. Zhou X. Rosa E. Sathasivam K. Ghazi-Noori S. Mahal A. Lowden P.A. Steffan J.S. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M. Lewis C.M. Marks P.A. Bates G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2041-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). The HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate improves survival and attenuates striatal atrophy in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD when administered presymptomatically starting at 21 days of age (13Ferrante R.J. Kubilus J.K. Lee J. Ryu H. Beesen A. Zucker B. Smith K. Kowall N.W. Ratan R.R. Luthi-Carter R. Hersch S.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9418-9427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A critical issue, however, is whether HDAC inhibitors exert neuroprotective effects when administered after the onset of symptoms, analogous to the situation in HD patients. We found that the HDAC inhibitor phenylbutyrate exerts significant effects on survival and ameliorates histopathologic degeneration in the N171-82Q transgenic mouse model of HD when administered after the onset of symptoms. Furthermore, we show for the first time that histone methylation is markedly increased in the N171-82Q transgenic mouse model of HD, and that this is ameliorated by phenylbutyrate treatment.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—Transgenic N171-82Q mice were originally obtained from Drs. Ross and Borchelt (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), and maintained on a B6C3F1 background (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). The offspring were genotyped using a PCR assay on tail DNA. Mice were housed 4-5 per cage with free access to food and water, under standard conditions with a 12-h light/dark cycle. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Weill Medical College of Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male and female N171-82Q mice, and littermates, were equally distributed between experimental groups.Treatment—Mice received intraperitoneal injections of 4-phenylbutyric acid sodium salt (100 mg/kg/day, volume 3.33 ml/kg; Triple Crown USA, Inc., Perkasie, PA) or vehicle (PBS, 3.33 ml/kg), 6 days per week from 75 days of age.Survival—Thirty-six mice (24 in the drug and 12 in the vehicle groups) were used in survival, weight, and behavior studies. Mice were observed daily, and deemed to have reached end-stage of the disorder when they could no longer initiate movement after being gently agitated for 2 min. Death was recorded when animals reached this stage and were euthanized by Na-pentobarbital overdose, or at the time of natural death if this occurred between daily inspections.Behavioral and Weight Assessment—Motor performance was assessed using an accelerating rotarod apparatus (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). The rotarod was accelerated from 0 rpm at a rate of 5.3 rpm/min over 180 s, then maintained at 16 rpm for a further 120 s (300 s total). The time elapsed on the rotarod measures the motor competency of the mouse in the task. Mice were given two rotarod training sessions to acclimate them to the apparatus, and then tested twice weekly from 75 days of age. Each mouse undertook three 300-s trials per test session, with the best result recorded. Mice were weighed twice a week.HDAC Inhibition—The HDAC inhibitory action of phenylbutyrate was confirmed by an in vitro HDAC fluorescent activity assay (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), as previously described (14Richon V.M. Zhou X. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Phenylbutyrate was incubated with the HeLa extract for 30 min, and then incubated for 25 min with developer.Histone Acetylation and Methylation Levels in Brain Tissue—Fifteen N171-82Q and littermate wild-type mice (aged 4-5 months) received single intraperitoneal injections of 100 mg/kg Na-phenylbutyrate in PBS or vehicle (PBS). Mice were sacrificed 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h post-injection (n = 3 per group), brain and spleen were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nuclear fractionation was carried out according to Ref. 15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York2000: 61-111Google Scholar. Levels of acetylated H3 histones were measured by Western blot analysis according to published methods (anti-acetylated H3 dilution 1:3000; anti-acetylated H4 dilution 1:2000) (16Warrell Jr., R.P. He L.Z. Richon V. Calleja E. Pandolfi P.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1621-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Levels were compared with butyrate-treated and untreated HeLa cell extracts. Histone methylation in both vehicle and Na-phenylbutyrate-treated wild-type and N171-82Q mice at 0, 1, 2, and 3 h was measured by Western blot analysis using an anti-dimethylated H3 (Lys-9) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Anti-acetylated H3 and H4 antibodies as well as butyrate-treated and control HeLa cell extracts were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase from Amersham Biosciences. The Western blots were quantitated using computer-assisted densitometry.Histology and Immunohistochemical Localization of Acetylated and Methylated Histones—Mice were treated with 100 mg/kg Na-phenylbutyrate or PBS from 75 days of age. At 100 or 120 days of age, mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (n = 5 per group). Brains were removed, post-fixed with the perfusant for 2 h, and then cryoprotected in 20% glycerol, 2% Me2SO. Brains were then cut into frozen 50-μm thick sections, and serial sections stained for Nissl substance (cresyl violet) or immunostained with an antibody recognizing the first 256 amino acids of human huntingtin (EM48, dilution, 1:1,000). An antibody to ubiquitin (dilution, 1:200, Dako Corp., Carpintena, CA) was also used to confirm the presence of protein aggregates. Immunocytochemical localization of acetylated histone H3 and acetylated histone H4 was conducted in adjacent sections, as previously described (17Richon V.M. Sandhoff T.W. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10014-10019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical detection of histone methylation was done using an antibody to anti-dimethyl-histone H3 (Lys-9) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Caspase activation was examined using an affinity purified anti-active caspase 3 antibody (dilution, 1:1000, BD Pharmingen).Stereology/Quantitation—Serial-cut coronal tissue sections beginning from the most rostral segment of the neostriatum to the level of the anterior commissure were used for huntingtin aggregate analysis. Unbiased stereologic counts of huntingtin-positive aggregates (≥1.0 μm diameter) were obtained from the dorsolateral neostriatum in 5 mice each from phenylbutyrate-treated and PBS-treated N171-82Q mice at 120 days using Neurolucida Stereo Investigator software (Microbright-field, Colchester, VT). The total areas of the rostral neostriatum were defined in serial sections in which counting frames were randomly sampled. The optical dissector method was employed estimating the number of huntingtin-positive aggregates. Striatal neuron areas were analyzed by microscopic videocapture using a Windows-based image analysis system for area measurement (Optimas, Bioscan Inc., Edmonds, WA). The software automatically identifies and measures profiles. All computer identified cell profiles were manually verified as neurons and exported to Microsoft Excel. Cross-sectional areas were analyzed using Statview.RNA Isolation and Microarray Analysis—Striata were dissected from mouse brains and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated by extraction with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Labeled cRNA probes were generated from total RNA samples using the Message-Amp™ cRNA kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Briefly, the procedure consists of reverse transcription of 2 μg of total RNA with a T7 oligo(dT) primer bearing a T7 promoter sequence followed by in vitro transcription of the resulting DNA with T7 RNA polymerase to generate anti-sense RNA copies of each mRNA (Ambion Inc.). The quality of total RNA and labeled cRNA were assessed with Agilent's Lab-on-a-Chip total RNA nano-biosizing assay (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Biotinylated cRNA probes were hybridized to Murine Genome Array U74Av2 chips, containing 6,000 identified genes and 6,000 EST clusters, using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400 according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. The image data on each individual microarray chip was scaled to 250 target intensity, using the Microarray Suite software (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Drug-induced alterations in gene expression were analyzed using the GeneSpring software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood, CA). Data analysis was carried out on 10 microarrays (5 PBS-treated and 5 phenylbutyrate-treated mice). Normalization was carried out using default normalization parameters by GeneSpring software as follows: per sample, by dividing the raw data by the 50th percentile of all measurement, and per gene, by dividing the raw data by the median of the expression level to specific samples. Data from probe sets representing genes that failed the detection criteria (labeled “absent” or “marginal” in all 10 microarrays) were eliminated, and all further analyses were carried out in the remaining 7,116 probe sets. The Welch t test statistical method was used to find differentially expressed genes by two-group comparisons, and genes were assumed to be significantly up-regulated or down-regulated if the calculated p value was <0.05.Real-time RT-PCR—One-step quantitative real-time RT-PCR using a LightCycler thermal cycler system (Roche Diagnostics) was performed to confirm microarray results. PCR was carried out with the SYBR Green quantitative RT-PCR system (Sigma) and gene-specific primers for 40 cycles according to the manufacturer's protocols. After amplification, a melting curve analysis and length verification by gel electrophoresis were carried out to confirm the specificity of PCR products. As a negative control, template RNA was replaced with PCR-grade water. Calculations of threshold cycle and difference were analyzed with LightCycler analysis software (Roche). Gene-specific primers were designed using LightCycler probe design software (Roche). PCR primer pairs used for each gene were as follows: Gfer, 5′-GCCTGCACAATGAGGT-3′ and 5′-GGCTCAGATGCACTTTAAT-3′; Gstm3, 5′CTCTGCCTACATGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGAGAGAACCGGGA-3′; Psma3, 5′-CATTAGCAGACATAGCGAG-3′ and 5′-ATCACGGCAAGTCATTT-3′; Casp9, 5′-AGAACGACCTGACTGC-3′ and 5′-CTCCCGTTGAAGATATTCAC-3′; Cflar, 5′-TGGAATACCGTGACAGTC-3′ and 5′-CTTGCATATCGGCGAAC-3′; Prkce, 5′-AAACACCCTTATCTAACCCA-3′ and 5′-AGATCACTCCGTGCTG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-AGAGCTGAACGGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GTTGAAGTCGCAGGAG-3′.Data Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons of rotarod, weight data, bioassay, and histological data were compared by analysis of variance or repeated measures analysis of variance. Survival data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the Mantel-Cox log-rank test.RESULTSSystemic administration of phenylbutyrate at a dose of 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal 6 days per week starting at 75 days of age produced a significant increase in survival of 23% in the N171-82Q transgenic mouse model of HD (Fig. 1) (p < 0.0001). Life span was 153.2 ± 4.8 days in the phenylbutyrate-treated mice and 124.5 ± 5.4 days in mice that received vehicle.Surprisingly, phenylbutyrate treatment had no significant effects on weight loss or on motor performance as assessed by rotarod performance in the N171-82Q mice (data not shown). This contrasts with findings using other therapeutic interventions including creatine and minocycline, in which improved survival is accompanied by improved motor performance and delayed weight loss (18Andreassen O.A. Dedeoglu A. Ferrante R.J. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante K.L. Thomas M. Friedlich A. Browne S.E. Schilling G. Borchelt D.R. Hersch S.M. Ross C.A. Beal M.F. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Treatment with another HDAC inhibitor, SAHA, before onset of symptoms ameliorated rotarod deficits, but had no effect on grip strength (12Hockly E Richon VM. Woodman B. Smith D.L. Zhou X. Rosa E. Sathasivam K. Ghazi-Noori S. Mahal A. Lowden P.A. Steffan J.S. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M. Lewis C.M. Marks P.A. Bates G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2041-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Treatment with sodium butyrate starting at 21 days of age improved both rotarod performance and weight loss (13Ferrante R.J. Kubilus J.K. Lee J. Ryu H. Beesen A. Zucker B. Smith K. Kowall N.W. Ratan R.R. Luthi-Carter R. Hersch S.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9418-9427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of beneficial effects on motor symptoms in the present study may reflect the fact that therapy was initiated after symptom onset.Histopathologic studies in brains of treated and untreated mice were performed at both 100 and 120 days of age. These studies showed a significant attenuation of gross brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement, as well as neuronal atrophy after phenylbutyrate treatment, which was significant at 120 days (Fig. 2). At 120 days the total brain volume in the phenylbutyrate-treated mice was 21.6% greater than in PBS (p < 0.01) and the ventricular volume was 82.4% less (p < 0.001). Whereas marked striatal neuron atrophy was present in untreated N171-82Q mice at 120 days, phenylbutyrate treatment significantly reduced striatal neuron atrophy in N171-82Q mice (wild-type littermate control: 143.9 ± 11.9 μm2; phenylbutyrate-treated N171-82Q mice: 116.5 ± 17.5 μm2; PBS-treated N171-82Q mice: 54.2 ± 25.3 μm2; F3,15 = 12.85; phenylbutyrate versus PBS, p < 0.01). The numbers of Htt and ubiquitin-stained aggregates were unaltered by phenylbutyrate administration (Fig. 3) (Huntingtin aggregates in phenylbutyrate-treated N171-82Q mice: 3.25 × 106 ± 1.11; PBS-treated N171-82Q mice: 3.11 × 106 ± 1.02, F2,10 = 1.09; p < 0.38). These results are similar to observations with sodium butyrate in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD (13Ferrante R.J. Kubilus J.K. Lee J. Ryu H. Beesen A. Zucker B. Smith K. Kowall N.W. Ratan R.R. Luthi-Carter R. Hersch S.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9418-9427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with SAHA had no effect on numbers of aggregates and gross morphology, but showed a tendency to reduce neuronal atrophy (12Hockly E Richon VM. Woodman B. Smith D.L. Zhou X. Rosa E. Sathasivam K. Ghazi-Noori S. Mahal A. Lowden P.A. Steffan J.S. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M. Lewis C.M. Marks P.A. Bates G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2041-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). To verify that the effects we observed were because of an increase in histone acetylation, we performed both immunocytochemistry and Western blots. Administration of phenylbutyrate for 2 weeks increased immunostaining for both acetylated histone H3 and histone H4 in striatal neurons (Fig. 4). Administration of phenylbutyrate at 100 mg/kg increased histone acetylation in the spleen (not shown) and brain at 2 h post-administration (Fig. 5). Another histone modification that can repress gene transcription is methylation of lysine 9 on histone 3. Using immunocytochemistry we found a marked increase in methylation of histone 3 in the striatum at 120 days of age, which was markedly attenuated by phenylbutyrate treatment (Fig. 6). This finding was confirmed by Western blots (Fig. 7). We verified that phenylbutyrate dose dependently inhibited histone deacetylase activity in vitro with an IC50 of ∼10 mm.Fig. 2Gross brain and histopathological neuroprotection with phenylbutyrate treatment. Photomicrographs of coronal serial sections through the rostral neostriatum at the level of the anterior commissure in phenylbutyrate-treated (A1-5) and PBS-treated (B1-5) N171-82Q HD transgenic mice at 120 days. There was gross atrophy of the brain in the PBS-treated N171-82Q mice along with ventricular enlargement. In contrast, the phenylbutyrate-treated N171-82Q mice at 120 days (A) show significantly less atrophy and ventricular enlargement than the PBS-treated N171-82Q mice. Corresponding Nissl-stained tissue sections from the dorso-medial aspect of the neostriatum in phenylbutyrate-treated (A6) and PBS-treated mice (B6) showed marked neuronal atrophy in the PBS-treated N171-82Q mice.

Phenylbutyrate was administered for 2 weeks starting at 75 days of age to 5 N171-82Q mice, whereas 5 mice received vehicle. Transcription products in striatum of the two groups were compared (Table I). To validate the alterations of gene expression at the mRNA level, which appeared on the microarray, real-time RT-PCR was performed using a LightCycler thermal cycler system (Fig. 8). Expression of selected genes (Gfer, Gstm3, and Psma3) were significantly up-regulated after phenylbutyrate treatment compared with controls (p < 0.05), whereas the other genes (Casp9, Cflar, and Prkce) showed significantly lower expression after phenylbutyrate treatment than in controls (p < 0.05). Because caspase 9 is involved in activation of caspase 3, and is increased in HD patients, we examined caspase 3 immunoactivity at 120 days of age (19Kiechle T. Dedeoglu A. Kubilus J. Kowall N.W.

It was markedly increased in the striatum of the N171-82Q mice as compared with controls, similar to the observations in the R6/2 mice.

https://openalex.org/W2112278084,"Osteoblast lineage-specific differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells is a well regulated but poorly understood process. Both bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt signaling are implicated in regulating osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Here we analyzed the expression profiles of mesenchymal stem cells stimulated with Wnt3A and osteogenic BMPs, and we identified connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as a potential target of Wnt and BMP signaling. We confirmed the microarray results, and we demonstrated that CTGF was up-regulated at the early stage of BMP-9 and Wnt3A stimulations and that Wnt3A-regulated CTGF expression was β-catenin-dependent. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of CTGF expression significantly diminished BMP-9-induced, but not Wnt3A-induced, osteogenic differentiation, suggesting that Wnt3A may also regulate osteoblast differentiation in a CTGF-independent fashion. However, constitutive expression of CTGF was shown to inhibit both BMP-9- and Wnt3A-induced osteogenic differentiation. Exogenous expression of CTGF was shown to promote cell migration and recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells. Our findings demonstrate that CTGF is up-regulated by Wnt3A and BMP-9 at the early stage of osteogenic differentiation, which may regulate the proliferation and recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells; however, CTGF is down-regulated as the differentiation potential of committed pre-osteoblasts increases, strongly suggesting that tight regulation of CTGF expression may be essential for normal osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2138138539,"Glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) is uniquely involved in the detoxification of oxidative damage to membrane lipids. Our previous studies showed that Gpx4 is essential for mouse survival and that Gpx4 deficiency makes cells vulnerable to oxidative injury. In the present study, we generated two lines of transgenic mice overexpressing Gpx4 (Tg(GPX4) mice) using a genomic clone containing the human GPX4 gene. Both lines of Tg-(GPX4) mice, Tg5 and Tg6, had elevated levels of Gpx4 (mRNA and protein) in all tissues investigated, and overexpression of Gpx4 did not cause alterations in activities of glutathione peroxidase 1, catalase, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, and manganese superoxide dismutase. The human GPX4 transgene rescued the lethal phenotype of null mutation of the mouse Gpx4 gene, indicating that the transgene can replace the essential role of mouse Gpx4 in mouse development. Cell death induced by t-butylhydroperoxide and diquat was significantly less in murine embryonic fibroblasts from Tg(GPX4) mice compared with wild type mice. Liver damage and lipid peroxidation induced by diquat were reduced significantly in Tg(GPX4) mice. In addition, diquat-induced apoptosis was decreased in Tg(GPX4) mice, as evidenced by attenuated caspase-3 activation and reduced cytochrome c release from mitochondria. These data demonstrate that Gpx4 plays a role in vivo in the mechanism of apoptosis induced by oxidative stress that most likely occurs through oxidative damage to mitochondrial phospholipids such as cardiolipin. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) is uniquely involved in the detoxification of oxidative damage to membrane lipids. Our previous studies showed that Gpx4 is essential for mouse survival and that Gpx4 deficiency makes cells vulnerable to oxidative injury. In the present study, we generated two lines of transgenic mice overexpressing Gpx4 (Tg(GPX4) mice) using a genomic clone containing the human GPX4 gene.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; Gpx1–4, glutathione peroxidases 1–4; Tg(GPX4) mice, transgenic mice overexpressing Gpx4; t-BuOOH, t-butylhydroperoxide; ALT, alanine amino-transferase; cyt. c, cytochrome c; TEMED, N,N,N′, N′-tetramethylethylenediamine; PLA2, phospholipase A2; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; CL, cardiolipin; CLOOH, cardiolipin hydroperoxide. such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, are constantly generated in aerobic organisms during normal respiration. In addition, environmental factors (such as ionizing radiation) and pathological compounds (such as β-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease) can generate ROS. Although ROS at physiological concentrations may be required for normal cell function, excessive production of ROS can be detrimental to cells, because ROS can cause oxidative damage to lipids, protein, and DNA. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are found predominantly in cellular membranes, are especially vulnerable to attack by ROS because of the high concentration of allylic hydrogens in their structure (1Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Lipid. 1995; 30: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). The resulting lipid hydroperoxides can affect membrane fluidity and the function of membrane proteins. In addition, lipid hydroperoxides can undergo iron-mediated, one-electron reduction and oxygenation to form epoxyallylic peroxyl radicals, which trigger a chain reaction of free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation (2Girotti A.W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1529-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The end-products of lipid peroxidation are reactive aldehydes such as 4-hydroxyl nonenal and malondialdehyde, many of which are highly toxic to cells (3Yu B.P. Yang R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 786: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition, reactive aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation can attack other cellular targets, such as proteins and DNA, thereby propagating the initial damage in cellular membranes to other macromolecules. Because lipid hydroperoxides formed in membranes are an important component of ROS generation in vivo, their detoxification appears to be critical in the survival of an organism to oxidative stress (4Mylonas C. Kouretas D. In Vivo. 1999; 13: 295-309PubMed Google Scholar, 5Dargel R. Exp. Toxicol. Pathol. 1992; 44: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). All cells possess a complex antioxidant system to detoxify reactive oxygen species. Antioxidant enzymes act in concert to remove various ROS produced by free radical reactions. Superoxide dismutases (Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD) scavenge the superoxide radicals, converting them into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, whereas catalase and the glutathione peroxidases convert hydrogen peroxide to water. The glutathione peroxidases are a group of selenoproteins that catalyze the reduction of peroxides generated by ROS at the expense of glutathione (6Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Four selenoprotein glutathione peroxidases have been identified in mammalian systems: glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) was the first mammalian selenoprotein to be identified and is the most abundant glutathione peroxidase; glutathione peroxidase 2 (Gpx2) is a glutathione peroxidase expressed in the gastrointestinal tract; glutathione peroxidase 3 (Gpx3) is a plasma form of glutathione peroxidase; and glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) is a membrane-associated glutathione peroxidase that is also called phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase. Recently, a new glutathione peroxidase, Gpx6, has been identified, but its cellular role and significance are not clear (7Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). Among the glutathione peroxidases, Gpx4 is unique in several ways. First, in addition to the common substrates (hydrogen peroxide and alkyl peroxides) reduced by all glutathione peroxidases, Gpx4 reduces hydroperoxide groups on phospholipids, lipoproteins, and cholesterol esters. Second, unlike the other glutathione peroxidases, which are tetrameric enzymes, Gpx4 is a monomeric enzyme and is rich in hydrophobic amino acid residues. Because of its small size and large hydrophobic surface, Gpx4 can interact with complex lipids in membranes and thereby detoxify membrane lipid hydroperoxides (8Ursini F. Bindoli A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1987; 44: 255-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The other pathway for removing membrane lipid peroxides from membranes is through the coupled actions of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and Gpx1 (9van Kuijk F.J. Handelman G.J. Dratz E.A. J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar): PLA2 first excises the fatty acid hydroperoxide from the phospholipid hydroperoxide in the membrane, and then Gpx1 reduces the fatty acid hydroperoxide to alcohol and water. From kinetic modeling, the Gpx4 pathway is estimated to be far more efficient at removing phospholipid hydroperoxides than the PLA2-Gpx1 pathway, because the affinity of Gpx4 to membrane lipid peroxides is more than 104-fold greater than PLA2 (10Antunes F. Salvador A. Pinto R.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, Gpx4 is considered to be the primary enzymatic defense system against oxidative damage to cellular membranes (6Brigelius-Flohe R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Gpx4 is ubiquitously expressed; however, its activity makes up only a fraction of the total cellular glutathione peroxidase activity in most tissues. The exception is the testes, where Gpx4 activity makes up the majority of the glutathione peroxidase activity (11Chambers I. Frampton J. Goldfarb P. Affara N. McBain W. Harrison P.R. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Despite its relative low cellular abundance, Gpx4 was shown to play a critical role in the antioxidant defense system in our study using mice deficient in Gpx4. The Gpx4 null mutation (Gpx4–/–) is embryonically lethal; Gpx4–/– embryos die at embryonic stage E7.5 to E8.5 (12Yant L.J. Ran Q. Rao L. Van Remmen H. Shibatani T. Belter J.G. Motta L. Richardson A. Prolla T.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In addition, embryonic fibroblasts derived from mice heterozygous for the Gpx4 gene (Gpx4+/–) have increased lipid peroxidation, more cell death after exposure to oxidizing agents, and experienced growth retardation under high oxygen (13Ran Q. Van Remmen H. Gu M. Qi W. Roberts L.J. Prolla T. Richardson A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 1101-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that Gpx4 deficiency makes cells vulnerable to oxidative stress, especially lipid peroxidation. In the present study, we generated two lines of transgenic mice overexpressing Gpx4 (Tg(GPX4) mice) using a genomic clone containing the human GPX4 gene. Both lines of Tg(GPX4) mice, Tg5 and Tg6, have elevated levels of Gpx4 (mRNA and protein) in all tissues studied. We further demonstrated that Tg(GPX4) mice had reduced oxidative injury after oxidative stress. The Tg(Gpx4) mouse therefore is a potentially valuable animal model for studying the role of reduced membrane lipid peroxidation in vivo in the mechanism underlying a variety of pathological conditions. Generation of Tg(GPX4) Mice—A human P1 library (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO) was screened for the human GPX4 gene using a PCR-based method. Positive P1 clones were analyzed for the presence of GPX4 gene and 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences by restriction analysis, Southern blotting, and PCR using sequence information obtained from the human genome data base. The P1 clone (3C15) contained the intact human GPX4 gene (∼3 kb) plus ∼30 and 20 kb of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, respectively. DNA from this clone was isolated and injected to fertilized oocytes derived from B6D2F1 mice to generate transgenic mice by the Transgenic Core of the San Antonio Nathan Shock Aging Center. Tail DNA was isolated from mice derived from the injected oocytes, digested with ScaI, and analyzed by Southern blotting using a 32P-labeled human GPX4 probe to detect the presence of the human GPX4 transgene. A PCR-based genotyping protocol was developed to genotype the mice (G4-T9: GAA CTT CAC CAA GGT AAG GGG GCT GTG; G4-T10: CCT TCT CTA TCA CCT GTC GGG GAG GAA). The Tg(GPX4) mice were crossed to C57/B6J mice four times and maintained in the hemizygous state. Male and female mice at 2–4 months of age were used for this study. All procedures for handling the mice in this study were reviewed and approved by the IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) of University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and the IACUC of Audie Murphy Veterans Affairs Hospital. Assays for Gpx4 Expression—Total RNA was isolated from tissues using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To detect the expression of the human GPX4 transgene, RT-PCR (reverse transcription PCR) was performed with SuperScript™ One-Step RT-PCR Systems (Invitrogen), using a pair of PCR primers (G4F1: TCC CAG TGA GGC AAG ACC GAA; G4R1: TTG TCG ATG AGG AAC TTG GTG) that specifically amplifies the human GPX4 mRNA. Total RNA from human cell line EJ cells was used as positive control for RT-PCR. Total Gpx4 mRNA levels in tissues from Tg(GPX4) and wild type mice were determined as previously described using a cDNA probe for Gpx4, and β-actin was used to adjust for loading variation (14Guo Z.M. Van Remmen H. Wu W.T. Richardson A. Mutat. Res. 1998; 409: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Gpx4 protein levels in tissues from Tg(GPX4) and wild type mice were determined by Western blots as described previously (12Yant L.J. Ran Q. Rao L. Van Remmen H. Shibatani T. Belter J.G. Motta L. Richardson A. Prolla T.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). To detect Gpx4 protein in tissue subcellular fractionations, tissues (testes and liver) were homogenized in buffer 1 (250 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 500 μm EGTA, 100 μm EDTA, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. The homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei, which were re-homogenized and re-centrifuged to eliminate unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain the mitochondria pellet. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to yield the cytosolic fraction and the pellet containing microsomes. Gpx4 protein levels in each fraction were determined by Western blots. Representative protein levels for each fraction were used to adjust for loading (histone-1 for the nuclear fraction, IκB-α for the cytosolic fraction, ATPase for the mitochondrial fraction, and ERp57 for the microsomal fraction). Gpx1, Catalase, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Mn-SOD Activity Determination— Tissues from Tg(GPX4) and wild type mice were homogenized in Dounce homogenizers in ice-cold lysis buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.05% SDS) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for antioxidant defense enzymatic activity assay. Gpx1 activity was measured using activity gels as described by Sun et al. (15Sun Y. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1988; 5: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell homogenates were run on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were soaked in 1 mm reduced glutathione. The substrate, cumene hydroperoxide (0.008%), was added to the solution, and the gels were soaked for 10 min. The gels were rinsed twice with water and stained in 1% ferric chloride/1% potassium ferricyanide solution. After staining, the gels became dark green with yellow bands indicating the presence of glutathione peroxidase activity. The gels were photographed using a digital-camera imager system (Amersham Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using ImageQuaNT 5.0 software. The activities of Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD were measured using a SOD activity gel as previously described (16Guo Z.M. Yang H. Hamilton M.L. VanRemmen H. Richardson A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2001; 122: 1771-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fifteen micrograms of protein was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then soaked in a solution containing nitroblue tetrazolium, riboflavin and TEMED. The gel was illuminated at 560 nm in a light box for 15 min. Under these conditions, the gel stained purple with achromatic bands indicating the presence of SOD activity. The gel images were recorded with a digital-camera imager system (Amersham Biosciences), and the recorded images were then analyzed using ImageQuaNT 5.0. Catalase protein levels were determined by Western blot using an anti-catalase antibody (Research Diagnostics Inc.). β-Actin levels were used to adjust for loading. Assay for Cell Viability of Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts—Timed matings of male Tg(GPX4) and female C57/B6J mice were carried out to obtain murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). MEFs were derived from 13.5 post-coitum embryos and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (50:50 mix) medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin, and streptomycin. MEFs from one embryo were grown to confluency in two T75 flasks and frozen in liquid nitrogen (2.5 × 106 per vial) as passage 1 (P1) cells. The cells were subsequently passed as 1:2. The viabilities of MEFs after t-butylhydroperoxide (t-BuOOH, Sigma) and diquat (diquat dibromide monohydrate, PS-365, Chem Service, West Chester, PA) exposure were determined using the neutral red assay (17Fautz R. Husein B. Hechenberger C. Mutat. Res. 1991; 253: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, MEFs from Tg(GPX4) and wild type mice were plated in a 24-well plate at a concentration of 2.5 × 104 per well. MEFs were then exposed to various concentrations of t-BuOOH and diquat for 2 h. Twenty-four hours after treatment, MEFs were placed in neutral red medium (50 μg/ml of neutral red, Sigma) and incubated for 3 h. At the end of the incubation, 0.5 ml of elution medium (50% ethanol plus 1% acetic acid) was added to each well, and the mixture was incubated further for 10 min. The elution medium was then transferred to a 96-well plate, and absorption of the elution medium was read at 540 nm with a micro-plate reader (Dynex Technologie). Assay for Caspase-3 Activity—The caspase-3 activity in MEFs, with or without t-BuOOH treatment, was determined using the caspase assay system from Promega (Madison, WI). The cells were lysed by repeated freezing and thawing in lysis buffer provided in the kit. Cell lysates corresponding to equal amounts of total protein were used to set up caspase-3 activity assay reactions. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 h, the intensities of color in the reaction wells, which were proportional to caspase-3 activity present in the samples, were measured with a microplate reader at 405 nm. Caspase-3 protein levels in liver tissues were determined by Western blot using an anti-caspase-3 antibody (sc-7148, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The intensities of bands corresponding to p20 of caspase-3 were quantified and used as indicators of caspase-3 activation. Plasma Alanine Aminotransferase and F2-isoprostane Levels—Two groups of Tg(GPX4) and wild type mice (2–4 months of age) were injected intraperitoneally with diquat dissolved in saline at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Six hours after injection, the mice were sacrificed, and plasma was isolated to determine ALT activity and free F2-isoprostanes. Plasma ALT activities were determined using an ALT kit (SGPT, Teco Diagnostics, Anaheim, CA). The levels of F2-isoprostanes were determined using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as described by Morrow and Roberts (18Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma was added to HPLC (pH 3.0) water, and mixed by vortex. After centrifugation (2,500 × g for 3 min 4 °C), the F2-isoprostanes were extracted from the clear supernatants with a C18 Sep-Pak column and a silica Sep-Pak column. The F2-isoprostanes were then converted to pentafluororobenzyl esters and subjected to thin layer chromatography. The F2-isoprostanes were further converted to trimethysilyl ether derivatives, and the F2-isoprostanes levels were quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. An internal standard, 8-isoPGF2a-d4 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), was added to the samples at the beginning of extraction to correct yield of the extraction process. The amount of F2-isoprostanes was expressed as picograms of 8-Iso-prostaglandin F2α per milliliter of plasma. Cytochrome c Determination—Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were obtained as described above. Equal amounts of protein were then separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to Western blotting with an anti-cytochrome c antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Data were normalized to loading controls (IκB-α for the cytosolic fraction; ATPase for the mitochondrial fraction). Generation of Tg(GPX4) Mice—Based on our prior experience, transgenic mice generated with a transgene containing endogenous human gene with large amounts of the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences give expression patterns that mimic the endogenous mouse gene (19Chen X. Mele J. Giese H. Van Remmen H. Dolle M.E. Steinhelper M. Richardson A. Vijg J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2003; 124: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A human P1 clone, containing the intact human GPX4 gene (about 3 kb) plus about 30 and 20 kb of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequence, respectively, was identified and used to generate transgenic mice (Fig. 1A). Tail DNA isolated from mice derived from the injected oocytes was digested with ScaI and probed with a 32P-labeled human GPX4 probe to detect the presence of human GPX4 gene (Fig. 1B). Two lines of transgenic mice, Tg(GPX4) mice, were generated in this study. They are designated as Tg6 and Tg5. Based on signal intensities analyzed by Southern blot, the Tg6 mice appear to have one copy of the transgene, and the Tg5 mice have three copies of the transgene (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of Gpx4 in Tissues from Tg(GPX4) Mice—To detect the expression of the human GPX4 transgene, total RNA was isolated from tissues of the Tg(GPX4) mice, and RT-PCR (reverse transcription PCR) was performed using a pair of PCR primers that specifically amplifies the human GPX4 mRNA. As indicated in Fig. 1C, human GPX4 mRNA is detected in heart, cerebral cortex, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, and testes tissues from Tg6 mice and Tg5 mice (Fig. 1C), indicating that the human GPX4 transgene is indeed expressed in Tg(GPX4) mice. RNA from a human cell line EJ cells was used as a positive control to demonstrate the specificity of the RT-PCR reaction. We next determined whether Tg(GPX4) mice had increased levels of total Gpx4 mRNA (expression from both the endogenous gene and transgene) in liver, cerebral cortex, and testes tissues using Northern blots. Fig. 2A shows that there were a 50% to 100% increase in Gpx4 mRNA levels in Tg6 mice compared with wild type mice and a 4- to 11-fold increase in Gpx4 mRNA levels in Tg5 mice compared with wild type mice. To determine if the increased levels of Gpx4 mRNA were translated to increased levels of Gpx4 protein, the total Gpx4 protein levels in tissues from Tg(GPX4) mice were determined with an anti-Gpx4 antibody that recognizes both the murine and human Gpx4 protein. In Tg6 mice, the levels of Gpx4 protein in liver, kidney, heart, testes, and brain regions of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum were ∼50% higher than in the same tissues from wild type mice (Fig. 2B). The total Gpx4 protein levels in tissues from Tg5 mice were 2- to 3-fold higher than their non-Tg littermates (Fig. 2B). Because Gpx4 is associated with different subcellular organelles, we compared the subcellular localization of Gpx4 in testes and liver of Tg5 and wild type mice. As shown in Fig. 3, there was a 2- to 3-fold increase in Gpx4 protein in nuclei, cytosol, mitochondria, and microsomal fractions from either the testes or liver of Tg5 mice. Thus, the Gpx4 protein level appears to be increased in all subcellular compartments in the Tg(GPX4) mice. Gpx4 and Gpx1 are two ubiquitously expressed selenoprotein glutathione peroxidases. We next wanted to know whether overexpression of Gpx4 affects the activity of Gpx1 in tissues of Tg(GPX4) mice. Therefore, we measured the Gpx1 activity in liver, kidney, and cerebral cortex from Tg(GPX4) and wild type mice. As indicated in Fig. 4A, there was no significant alteration in Gpx1 activity in tissues from either Tg5 or Tg6 transgenic mice. Catalase is an anti-oxidant defense enzyme that detoxifies hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, we also measured catalase protein levels in tissues from wild type, Tg5, and Tg6 mice and found no difference (Fig. 4B). We also measured the Cu/Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD activities in tissues from Tg(GPX4) and wild type mice, and we did not detect any significant differences between either Tg5 (or Tg6) and wild type mice (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus, the overexpression of Gpx4 in either line of Tg(GPX4) mice had no significant effect on the expression of the other major antioxidant enzymes. The above studies indicated that the GPX4 transgene is overexpressed in all cells. To determine if its expression is comparable to the endogenous murine Gpx4 gene, we asked if the transgene could rescue the null phenotype observed in the Gpx4–/– mice. We previously demonstrated that Gpx4 homozygous null embryos (Gpx4–/–) die at E7.5 to E8.5 (12Yant L.J. Ran Q. Rao L. Van Remmen H. Shibatani T. Belter J.G. Motta L. Richardson A. Prolla T.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In this study, the Tg6 mice, which express Gpx4 at the lower level, were crossed to mice heterozygous for the murine Gpx4 gene (Gpx4+/–) to generate Gpx4+/– mice that have the human GPX4 transgene, i.e. Gpx4+/–Tg(GPX4) mice. Male and female Gpx4+/–Tg(GPX4) mice were then breed, and the offspring were genotyped for the presence of the GPX4 transgene, as well as for the status of the endogenous mouse Gpx4 gene. Fig. 5A shows an example of the genotyping results from two litters of new born mice. Gpx4–/– genotype was detected in mice that contained the human GPX4 transgene. Fig. 5B is the summary of the genotype information from 75 pups generated from this breeding scheme. Eighteen Gpx4–/–Tg(GPX4) mice were found in the 75 mice. The number of Gpx4–/–Tg(GPX4) genotypes was similar to the expected number, indicating that the human GPX4 transgene can completely replace the endogenous Gpx4 gene in mice without functional endogenous Gpx4 gene. These data also demonstrated that the human GPX4 transgene was properly expressed during development. The Gpx4–/–Tg-(GPX4) mice develop into adulthood (6 months of age), and there is no obvious abnormality in these mice. Sensitivity of Embryonic Fibroblasts from Tg(GPX4) Mice to Cell Death Induced by Oxidative Stress—MEFs were derived from wild type and Tg(GPX4) embryos, and MEFs from Tg6 and Tg5 lines of Tg(GPX4) mice showed 0.5- and 2-fold increases, respectively, in Gpx4 protein levels over MEFs from wild type mice (data not shown). Because t-BuOOH is an oxidizing agent that is known to generate lipid peroxidation (20Rohn T.T. Hinds T.R. Vincenzi F.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Biomembr. 1993; 1153: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), MEFs were exposed to various concentrations of t-BuOOH. Data in Fig. 6A show that MEFs from Tg(GPX4) mice had significantly higher survival rates than MEFs from wild type mice after exposure to t-BuOOH. The data in Fig. 6A also indicate that MEFs from the Tg5 line of Tg(GPX4) mice had higher survival rates than MEFs from Tg6 line, presumably due to their higher levels of Gpx4. We also compared the sensitivity of MEFs from the Tg(GPX4) mice to superoxide anions by incubating MEFs with the bipyridyl herbicide diquat, which generates superoxide (21Jones G.M. Vale J.A. J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. 2000; 38: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, MEFs from Tg(GPX4) mice had significantly higher survival rates than MEFs from wild type mice after diquat treatment. Again, MEFs from the Tg5 line of Tg(GPX4) mice had higher survival rates than MEFs from Tg6 line. To determine if the differences in cell survival was due to the MEFs from the Tg(GPX4) mice having reduced apoptosis in response to t-BuOOH treatment, we compared the activity of caspase-3 in MEFs from Tg(GPX4) mice (Tg5) and wild type mice. MEFs from Tg(GPX4) mice had a lower basal level of caspase-3 activity compared with cells from wild type mice, and treatment with t-BuOOH increased caspase-3 activity in MEFs from both Tg(GPX4) and wild type mice. However, caspase-3 activity was significantly lower in the MEFs from the Tg(GPX4) mice than MEFs from the wild type mice at 3 h after treatment with t-BuOOH (Fig. 6C). Thus, the reduced cell death of MEFs from Tg(GPX4) mice appears to be associated with reduced apoptosis. Sensitivity of Tg(GPX4) Mice to Diquat—The bipyridyl herbicide diquat is a potent pro-oxidant that generates superoxide anions through redox cycling (21Jones G.M. Vale J.A. J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. 2000; 38: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). When injected into mice, diquat causes liver damage associated with lipid peroxidation (22Smith C.V. Hughes H. Lauterburg B.H. Mitchell J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1985; 235: 172-177PubMed Google Scholar), and diquat has been used to study the protective role of antioxidant enzyme against oxidative stress in mice (23Fu Y. Cheng W.H. Porres J.M. Ross D.A. Lei X.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the responses of Tg(GPX4) and wild type mice to diquat treatment. Plasma levels of ALT activity was studied as a marker of liver damage. In untreated mice, no difference in plasma ALT levels was observed between Tg(GPX4) mice and wild type mice (Fig. 7A). Diquat injection resulted in a 6.1-fold increase in plasma ALT activity in wild type mice compared with a 2.2-fold increase in the Tg(GPX4) mice. Thus, the Tg(GPX4) mice showed less liver damage (i.e. decrease in plasma ALT a"

We use the model to provide new insights into several different mechanisms of folate homeostasis. The model reproduces the known pool sizes of folate substrates and the fluxes through each of the loops of the folate cycle and has the qualitative behavior observed in a variety of experimental studies. Vitamin B12 deficiency, modeled as a reduction in the Vmax of the methionine synthase reaction, results in a secondary folate deficiency via the accumulation of folate as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (the “methyl trap”). One form of homeostasis is revealed by the fact that a 100-fold up-regulation of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase (known to occur at the G1/S transition) dramatically increases pyrimidine production without affecting the other reactions of the folate cycle. The model also predicts that an almost total inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase is required to significantly inhibit the thymidylate synthase reaction, consistent with experimental and clinical studies on the effects of methotrexate. Sensitivity to variation in enzymatic parameters tends to be local in the cycle and inversely proportional to the number of reactions that interconvert two folate substrates. Another form of homeostasis is a consequence of the nonenzymatic binding of folate substrates to folate enzymes. Without folate binding, the velocities of the reactions decrease approximately linearly as total folate is decreased. In the presence of folate binding and allosteric inhibition, the velocities show a remarkable constancy as total folate is decreased.

Among its important functions are the delivery of one-carbon units to the methionine cycle, for use in methylation reactions, and the synthesis of pyrimidines and purines. Dietary folate deficiency or genetic polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing enzymes are associated with megaloblastic anemia, developmental abnormalities including neural tube defects and Down's syndrome, and various types of cancer, especially those of the gastrointestinal tract and leukemias (1Bailey L.B.

Elevated homocysteine concentrations, a biomarker of a low folate status, have been implicated in cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease (6Carmel R. Jacobsen D.W.

Furthermore, several enzymes in the cycle are the targets of cancer chemotherapeutic agents (11Jackman A.L. Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999Crossref Google Scholar, 12McGuire J.J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 2593-2613Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Because of its importance in human health, folate metabolism has long been the focus of clinical, nutritional, and biochemical investigations. Biochemical studies have provided extensive and detailed information about each of the enzymes and metabolites of the folate cycle. As a consequence, the components and the reaction diagram of the folate cycle are well understood (13Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 23-42Google Scholar). The structure of the folate cycle is relatively complex (Fig. 1) and consists of several interacting loops. Most of the reactions depend in a nonlinear way on the concentrations of their substrates. Therefore, the behavior of the full cycle in response to dietary and genetic variation cannot be easily deduced from the reaction diagram itself. The global behavior of the cycle can, however, be investigated through a mathematical model of the reactions of and interactions among the components of the cycle. Our first purpose in this paper is to develop a basic mathematical model of the cytosolic folate cycle based on known biochemistry. The model uses standard reaction kinetics and does not, at this stage, incorporate details such as polyglutamation, compartmentalization, tissue specificity, and long range inhibitions. Despite these simplifications, this basic model reproduces and explains many experimental findings on the global behavior of the system, including system homeostasis in the presence of chemotherapeutic agents and up-regulation of enzymes during the cell cycle. Our second purpose is to investigate the role of folate-binding proteins in the control of folate homeostasis. We show that allosteric inhibition by folate substrates results in a remarkable robustness of reaction velocities as total folate is reduced. We view this basic model as a platform on which we can build tissue-specific models incorporating additional details such as those mentioned above. Such more detailed models can then be used to investigate specific biological and biochemical questions, such as the roles of polyglutamation, the control of purine and pyrimidine synthesis, and the effects of chemotherapeutic agents (11Jackman A.L. Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, the basic model, when combined with our previous model of the methionine cycle (14Reed M. Nijhout H.F. Sparks R. Ulrich C.M. J. Theor. Biol. 2004; 226: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), can be used to address questions involving the interactions between these two cycles. In a series of papers, Jackson (15Jackson R.C. Harrap K.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 158: 827-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Jackson R.C. Harrap K.R. Pharmacol.

His studies inspired others to develop mathematical models to understand the effects of anti-folate drugs (21Vorontzov I.N. Greshilov M.M. Belousova A.K. Gerasimova G.K. Biokhimiya. 1980; 45: 83-97PubMed Google Scholar, 22White J.C. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5722-5727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Morrison P.F. Allegra C.J. J. Biol.

These studies are now more than 15 years old and, naturally, were unable to utilize the wealth of recent biochemical and genetic findings about folate metabolism. The present model builds on these previous efforts but incorporates recent biochemical findings to build a more comprehensive model of the folate cycle. In addition, our purposes are more general in that we are not primarily concerned with the effects of antifolate drugs but instead wish to understand the emergent properties of this nonlinear complex interconnected system and the responses of the folate cycle and methionine cycle to dietary and genetic variation. Structure of the Model—Fig. 1 illustrates the components of the folate cycle treated in this paper. The structure of the cycle and the relevant reactions are based on the reaction scheme of Wagner (13Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 23-42Google Scholar) and represent the cytosolic reactions in mammalian liver. Most of the reactions in the folate cycle are bimolecular. In the present study, we focus on variation of the folate compounds and therefore treat other substrates as constants. We assume that each of the reactions is a random bimolecular reaction. For the unidirectional reactions, the velocity can be written as follows (25Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 275Google Scholar),V=Vmaxγ⋅[S]Km,S⋅[F]Km,F1+[S]Km,S+[F]Km,F+1γ[S]Km,S⋅[F]Km,F(Eq. 1) where F indicates the folate substrate, and S indicates the nonfolate substrate. We take γ = 1, which means that each substrate does not affect the binding of the other. Thus, the velocity of each unidirectional reaction can be written in the following simple form.V=Vmax⋅[S]Km,S+[S]⋅[F]Km,F+[F](Eq. 2) In the case of reversible reactions we take the analogous form,V=Vmaxf⋅[Sf]Km,Sf+[Sf]⋅[Ff]Km,Ff+[Ff]−Vmaxr⋅[Sr]Km,Sr+[Sr]⋅[Fr]Km,Fr+[Fr] (Eq. 3) where Sf, Ff and Sr, Fr refer to the substrates of the forward and reverse reactions, respectively. The forward direction is indicated for each reversible reaction in Table II.

The rate for the nonenzymatic interconversion between THF and 5,10-CH2-THF is denoted by VNE. Each of these V values varies in time, of course, since the current rate depends on current substrate concentrations. Thus, both the basic folate model and the model with enzyme inhibition have the following form.ddt[5mTHF]=VMTHFR−VMS+Fin−Fout(Eq. 4) ddt[THF]=VMS−VFTS+VPGT+VAICART+VDHFR−VSHMT−VNE+VFTD(Eq. 5) ddt[DHF]=VTS−VDHFR(Eq. 6) ddt[5,10-CH2-THF]=VSHMT+VNE−VTS−VMTD−VMTHFR(Eq. 7) ddt[5,10-CH=THF]=VMTD−VMTCH(Eq. 8) ddt[10f-THF]=VMTCH+VFTS−VFGT−VAICART−VFTD(Eq. 9) The basic folate model and the enzyme-binding folate model differ in the form of the V values and the choice of some rate constants. Parameter Values for the Basic Model—Table II shows that for most of the reactions in Fig. 1 there are a wide range of Km and especially Vmax values reported in the literature. The great variation in parameter values is probably due to the fact that different authors use different species, different tissues, and different cell lines (cancerous versus noncancerous). Moreover, the Vmax of some enzymes varies with the cell cycle. Hence, the literature does not give strong guidance on parameter choices for a general model of folate metabolism. Our initial choices of parameter values for the basic model under normal cytosolic physiological conditions were based on the following considerations. First, in our earlier model of the methionine cycle (14Reed M. Nijhout H.F. Sparks R. Ulrich C.M. J. Theor. Biol. 2004; 226: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we found the velocity of the reaction catalyzed by methionine synthase, VMS, to be ∼85 μm/h. This implies that at steady-state, VMTHFR is also ∼85 μm/h (see Fig. 1). Second, the ratios of the rates of three reactions that use 5,10-CH2-THF as a substrate, VMTHFR, VMTD, and VTS, were found by Green et al. (31Green J.M. MacKenzie R.E. Matthews R.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8014-8022Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to be ∼35:1100:1. If VMTHFR is ∼85 μm/h, then VMTD and VTS must be ∼2670 and 2.42 μm/h. At steady state, VDHFR = VTS and VMTCH = VMTD. The sum of the rates of the four reactions that interconvert 10f-THF and THF must also equal VMTD. Finally, VSHMT + VNE must equal VMTHFR + VMTD + VTS.

Immunopurified PRMT7 actively methylated histones, myelin basic protein, a fragment of human fibrillarin (GAR) and spliceosomal protein SmB. Amino acid analysis showed that the modifications produced were predominantly monomethylarginine and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). Examination of PRMT7 expressed in E. coli demonstrated that peptides corresponding to sequences contained in histone H4, myelin basic protein, and SmD3 were methylated. Furthermore, analysis of the methylated proteins showed that symmetric dimethylarginine and relatively small amounts of monomethylarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine were produced. SDMA was also formed when a GRG tripeptide was methylated by PRMT7, indicating that a GRG motif is by itself sufficient for symmetric dimethylation to occur. Symmetric dimethylation is reduced dramatically compared with monomethylation as the concentration of the substrate is increased. The data demonstrate that PRMT7 (like PRMT5) is a Type II methyltransferase capable of producing SDMA modifications in proteins.

The methylation of protein substrates is catalyzed by enzymes that transfer a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to a protein acceptor, a process that occurs in many organisms. The residues that are modified by methylation include arginine, histidine, lysine, and aspartic acid. Protein-arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) 1The abbreviations used are: PRMT, protein-arginine methyltransferase; ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine; SDMA, symmetric dimethylarginine; MMA, monomethylarginine; MBP, myelin basic protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl. catalyze the formation of methylarginine residues. Four types of protein arginine methyltransferases have been described (14Clarke S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Type I PRMTs form ω-NG-monomethylarginine and asymmetric ω-NG,NG-dimethylarginine (ADMA) residues; type II PRMTs form ω-NG-monomethylarginine and symmetric ω-NG,NG′-dimethylarginine (SDMA) residues; type III and type IV PRMTs synthesize only ω-NG-monomethylarginine (MMA) and δ-NG-monomethylarginine, respectively.

Here we report the discovery of another Type II protein arginine methyltransferase, PRMT7, that can synthesize SDMA. This protein was initially characterized in hamster cells as a protein that modulates drug sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (25Gros L. Delaporte C. Frey S. Decesse J. Saint-Vincent B.R. Cavarec L.

Plasmid Constructs—The cDNA of PRMT7 was cloned with primers specific to the open reading frame of FLJ10640, a cDNA we identified with homology to PRMT5 and other PRMTs (Fig. 1 and Table I). Of the three splice variants of this cDNA, the longest variant was chosen. The cDNA was amplified by PCR at 95 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 95 °C for 45 s and then annealing at 55 °C for 45 s and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min. After 30 cycles, the reactions were then incubated at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XbaI restriction endonucleases, gel-purified, and ligated at 16 °C for 21 h into vector pEF2 (16Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L.

The reactions were then incubated at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was digested with KpnI and XbaI restriction endonucleases, gel-purified, and ligated into the vector pEF2-FLAG-PRMT7, which had been digested with KpnI and XbaI. Purification of GST-PRMT7—Selected Escherichia coli transformants in the Rosetta strain (Novagen) were grown in TB medium (11.8 g of SELECT Peptone 140 (pancreatic digest of casein), 23.6 g of yeast extract, 9.4 g of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, and 2.2 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate; Invitrogen) plus 150 μg/ml ampicillin to an optical density at A600 of 0.5 at which time isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The GST-PRMT7 fusion protein was purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described (16Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31531-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The bound protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 5 mm EDTA. Protein was quantified with the Bio-Rad protein assay. The SDS-PAGE of the GST-PRMT7 fusion protein is shown in Fig. 2. Immunopurification of FLAG-PRMT7—Dishes of adherent HeLa or COS cells transfected with pEF2-FLAG-PRMT7 as described (26Tang M.X. Redemann C.T. Szoka Jr., F.C.

Biol. 1984; 4: 1641-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped with a silicone policeman in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.8 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 104 KIU/ml of aprotinin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. To immunoprecipitate epitope-tagged PRMT7, 1.0 μg of the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) was added to 1 ml of each lysate (supernatant) that was then incubated at 4 °C overnight with rocking. Thirty μl of Protein A/G Plus beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 3–4 h at 4 °C with rocking. The beads were pelleted and then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. The beads with attached immunopurified protein were stored at -80 °C until used. Preparation of Monomethylarginine (ω-NG-Monomethylarginine)— Conversion of Fmoc-OCOCl to Fmoc-OSu was performed as described (28Paquet A. Can. J. Chem. 1976; 54: 733-737Crossref Google Scholar, 29Sigler G.F. Fuller W.D. Chuturverdi N.C. Goodman M. Verlander M. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2157-2162Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). HOSu (0.633 g, 5.5 mmol) was added to a solution of Fmoc-OCOCl (1.29 g, 5.0 mmol) in dioxane (12.5 ml) in a 50-ml round-bottomed flask with a magnetic stirrer. It was cooled in an ice bath, and triethylamine (0.70 ml, 5.0 mmol) was added over a 5-min period with stirring. Stirring then continued at room temperature for 2 h. The precipitated triethylamine hydrochloride was filtered off (weight = 0.63 g), and the filtrate was evaporated to ∼5 ml and added portionwise to an Erlenmeyer flask containing 25 ml of diethyl ether. An oil separated out and was placed in the refrigerator overnight. The next day the supernatant solution was decanted and separated from the oil. This filtrate immediately began to crystallize and afforded 430 mg of white crystals (26% yield). Additional product left in the oil was not isolated. The product had an m.p. 143–144 °C (uncorrected) (theory: m.p. 150–153 °C) and was used directly in the next step. Preparation of Fmoc-Arg(Me)-OH—A solution of NG-methyl-l-arginine (acetate salt) (124 mg, 0.50 mmol, ICN Biomedicals, Inc., catalog number 155470) in water (1 ml) in a 10-ml round-bottomed flask was treated with triethylamine (140 μl, 2.0 eq) followed by the addition of Fmoc-OSu (152 mg, 0.45 mmol, 0.90 eq) in acetonitrile (1 ml). An additional 0.30 ml of acetonitrile was required for rinsing. Magnetic stirring continued at room temperature for 30 min, and the pH was maintained at pH 8–9 by addition of triethylamine. The resultant clear solution was evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator, and a white tacky semisolid residue was obtained. Water was added (5 ml), and the pH was determined to be 6–7 and then the mixture was placed in the refrigerator overnight (4 °C). The oily product that solidified overnight was isolated by filtration, washed with water, and dried in vacuo. Further drying in the dessicator gave 60 mg (32% yield) of white solid. The product was insoluble in water and ethyl acetate; soluble in acetonitrile and N,N-dimethylformamide. Deprotection of an aliquot with 15% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide followed by a ninhydrin test was positive and in agreement with the expected structure. The peptide, SGRMeGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRK, was prepared by solid phase synthesis as described below for the other peptides (RMe represents ω-NG-monomethylarginine). Peptides—The following peptides were synthesized chemically as substrates for PRMT7: P-SmD3, AGRGRGKAAILKAQVAARGRGRG-MGRGN-NH2; P-MBP, SQGKGRGLSLSRFSWGAE-NH2; M1, SGRGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRK-NH2; GRG; M8, SGAGKGGKGLGKGGAKAHAK-NH2 with all arginines substituted with alanine; MM, SGRMeGKGGKGLGKGGAKRHRK-NH2 (RMe, monomethylarginine). Briefly, the peptides were prepared on solid phase by the Fmoc/t-butyl-strategy and O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate-activation on a SYRO multiple peptide synthesizer (MultiSynTech GmbH, Witten, Germany) as reported (30Pipkorn R. Boenke C. Gehrke M. Hoffmann R. J. Pept. Res. 2002; 59: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The methylated peptide MM was synthesized until the previous glycine (position 4 of peptide MM) on a 433A batch synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany), and the remaining three residues were coupled manually with 20 mg of peptide resin. After cleavage with trifluoroacetic acid the crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography with an aqueous acetonitrile gradient with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purified peptides were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and stored dry at -20 °C until used. In Vitro Methylation Reactions—The 30-μl reaction mixtures included 1–10 μg of substrate protein or peptide as noted in the figure legends, 5 μl of [3H]S-adenosylmethionine (81 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.1–1 μg of GST-PRMT7, or 15 μl of protein A/G PLUS beads (containing the immunopurified FLAG-PRMT7 isolated from ∼1 × 107 HeLa or COS cells), plus buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6) to make the final concentration 8.3 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6. The 30-μl reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5–21 h as described in the figure legends. To determine the incorporation, aliquots of the reaction mixtures were precipitated with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid onto 0.45 μm nitrocellulose filters (HA, Millipore) as described (31Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4669-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis of Methylated Proteins—Aliquots of the in vitro methylation reactions were electrophoresed on precast 15% polyacrylamide gels (Novex, Invitrogen). Gels were stained with 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in water and destained with 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid in water and then dried and exposed to Biomax film at -80 °C for 14 days. TLC—In vitro methylation reactions (30 μl) were hydrolyzed with 250 μl of 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 21 h in a sealed glass ampule. The hydrolyzed amino acids were dried in an oven after opening the ampule. Thirty μl of water was added to the dried residue, and then 10 μl of the solution was applied to each lane of a Silica 60 TLC plate (Whatman). The solvent of 30% ammonium hydroxide, chloroform, methanol, and water (2:0.5:4.5:1) was used for the chromatographic separations of the amino acids (5Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8289-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Color was developed with a ninhydrin spray (Sigma). Standards (MMA, ADMA, and SDMA) were purchased from Calbiochem. Chromatographs were coated with three applications of EN3HANCE Spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and then exposed to film at -80 °C for 7–21 days. Analysis of the Distribution of PRMT7 in Cells—COS-1 cells were plated at 3 × 104 cells per chamber in LabTek II 4-well chamber slides (VWR) on the day before transfection. Plasmid pEF2-Myc-PRMT7 was transfected into COS-1 cells with Superfectamine transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described above under “Immunopurification of FLAG-PRTM7.” Plasmid pEF2-Myc-PRMT5 or pEF2-Myc vector was transfected at the same time as positive and negative controls, respectively. 24–36 h after transfection, the cells were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4 and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature (32Spector D.L. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 163: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed three times in PBS and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 plus 1% normal goat serum in PBS for 5 min on ice. The cells were washed three times in PBS plus 1% normal goat serum and incubated in 1:200 diluted rabbit anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times in PBS plus 1% normal goat serum followed by incubation in rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at a dilution of 1:150 for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were subsequently washed three times in PBS. The chamber was removed from the slide and then mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was added to cells. A coverslip was placed over the cells on the slide and sealed with clear nail polish. The stained cells were visualized under a Nikon eclipse TE200 microscope with ×200 magnification, and photographs were taken by a CoolSNAP Pro digital camera (Media Cybernetics, Houston, TX) with Image Pro Plus software. The Sequence Motif Search Program (Kyoto University) was used to search for proteins containing consensus S-adenosylmethionine binding sites. One protein identified was encoded by the cDNA designated FLJ10640, which contained a motif for an S-adenosylmethionine binding site and other methyltransferase motifs suggesting that it might be a PRMT. We designated the protein encoded by the FLJ10640 cDNA PRMT7. When the protein sequence of PRMT7 was compared with the other known human PRMTs, PRMT7 seemed to be a member of the human PRMT family (Fig. 1). Table I shows a summary of the homology of all the known protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT1 through PRMT7) with respect to each other. PRMT7 is most similar to PRMT4. To determine whether PRMT7 contains methyltransferase activity, FLAG-PRMT7 was expressed in HeLa cells and immunopurified with anti-FLAG antibody. The immunopurified protein was assayed in vitro for methylation activity with four different substrate proteins. Fig. 3A shows that the FLAG-PRMT7 preparation has significant methyltransferase activity with histones, MBP, GAR (a fragment of human fibrillarin), and SmB (a spliceosomal Sm protein) as substrates. Fig. 3B shows both a Coomassie Blue-stained gel and the autoradiograph of the proteins methylated in these reactions. Of the five histones (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) in the preparation that was assayed only two were methylated. Based on their size and the results of a control experiment in which the five histones were methylated individually (data not shown), we concluded that the methylated (labeled) histones are H2A and H4. MBP was also methylated. Although low quantities of GAR and SmB were present in the methylation reactions, their methylation was nevertheless appreciable judging from the intensity of the autoradiographic bands. Because PRMT5 methylates these same proteins in vitro, these data suggested that there might be some functional similarity between PRMT7 and PRMT5 (16Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S.

Alternatively, the similarity of substrates for PRMT5 and PRMT7 could be caused by association of PRMT5 with PRMT7. To rule out this possibility, hemagglutinin-PRMT5 and FLAG-PRMT7 were expressed in COS cells. After the cells were lysed, FLAG-PRMT7 was immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunoprecipitated FLAG-PRMT7 was analyzed by blotting and probing with anti-hemagglutinin antibody. The results did not show any detectable hemagglutinin-PRMT5 associated with PRMT7, thereby eliminating the possibility that the activity of immunopurified PRMT7 was due to the presence of PRMT5 (Fig. 4).Fig. 4PRMT7 is not associated with PRMT5. COS cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. After 48 h, the cells were lysed and either lysate (from 1 × 105 cells) or immunoprecipitate (from 1 × 106 cells) was separated by PAGE (12.5%) and blotted. The blots were probed with anti-hemagglutinin antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next we determined the type of methylation produced by the immunopurified PRMT7. In this experiment, COS cells were transiently transfected with pEF2-FLAG-PRMT7, and the protein was assayed for activity by in vitro methylation. As shown in Fig. 5, SDMA, ADMA, and MMA were not found in detectable quantities in the absence of substrate (lane 1). However, in the presence of histones, SDMA was clearly produced (lane 2). No ADMA or MMA was detectable in this case. When the MBP peptide (P-MBP) was methylated, no detectable SDMA was produced, and the major product was MMA (lane 3). Nevertheless, the formation of SDMA in histone substrates suggested that PRMT7 might be a Type II PRMT. PRMT7 was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The GST-PRMT7 fusion protein was used to methylate various peptides in vitro. Fig. 6A shows that methylation occurred with peptides M1, P-SmD3, and P-MBP as substrates. Because the GRG tripeptide was not trichloroacetic acid-precipitated because of its small size, it was analyzed with the other peptides after hydrolysis and TLC. As is shown in Fig. 6B (lane 1), GST-PRMT7 alone did not produce SDMA, ADMA, or MMA in detectable quantities. With peptides M1 (lane 2), P-SmD3 (lane 3), P-MBP (lane 4), and GRG (lane 5), however, a large amount of SDMA was generated with relatively much less ADMA and MMA, indicating that PRMT7 is in fact a Type II PRMT. The fact that the GRG tripeptide was methylated by PRMT7 was surprising. Nevertheless, this result demonstrates that the GRG motif is sufficient for methylation by PRMT7. To confirm that SDMA is synthesized by PRMT7, we used GST-PRMT7 produced in E. coli with protein (Fig. 7A) and peptide (Fig. 7B) substrates. GST-PRMT7 methylated the proteins H2A, MBP, and SmD1, although SmD1 was methylated at a low level. GST-PRMT7 also methylated the peptides M1 and MM. Peptide MM contained a G-RMe-G (where RMe is methylarginine) instead of the usual GRG motif present in peptide M1. PRMT7 methylated MM significantly greater than it labeled M1 (Fig. 7B). When TLC was performed to determine the products of the methylation, it was evident that GST-PRMT7 alone produced no detectable SDMA, ADMA or MMA (Fig. 7C, lane 1). However, PRMT7 yielded mostly SDMA with the M1 peptide (lane 2). When the monomethylated peptide (MM) was tested, once again SDMA was synthesized (lane 3), indicating that PRMT7 is a Type II PRMT. When all three of the arginines in peptide M1 were substituted with alanines, this peptide designated M8 was not methylated (lane 4) showing that PRMT7 methylates only arginine residues to synthesize SDMA predominantly. Because Miranda et al. (33Miranda T.B. Miranda M. Frankel A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22902-22907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) found that PRMT7 synthesizes MMA but no dimethylarginines with a peptide substrate, we tested the effects of peptide concentration on the rela"
https://openalex.org/W2085465508,"Genome-wide analysis of transcriptional regulation is generally studied by determining sets of “signature transcripts” that are up- or down-regulated relative to a reference situation when a single culture parameter or genetic modification is changed. This approach is especially relevant for defining small subsets of transcripts for use in high throughput, cost-effective diagnostic analyses. However, this approach may overlook the simultaneous control of transcription by more than one environmental parameter. This study represents the first quantitative assessment of the impact of transcriptional cross-regulation by different environmental parameters. As a model, we compared the response of aerobic as well as anaerobic chemostat cultures of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to growth limitation by four different macronutrients (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur). The identity of the growth-limiting nutrient was shown to have a strong impact on the sets of transcripts that responded to oxygen availability and vice versa. We concluded that identification of reliable signature transcripts for specific environmental parameters can be obtained only by combining transcriptome data sets obtained under several sets of reference conditions. Furthermore, the two-dimensional approach to transcriptome analysis is a valuable new tool to study the interaction of different transcriptional regulation systems."
https://openalex.org/W2117316466,"CYLD is a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, an autosomal dominant predisposition to multiple tumors of the skin appendages. Recent studies suggest that transfected CYLD has deubiquitinating enzyme activity and inhibits the activation of transcription factor NF-κB. However, the role of endogenous CYLD in regulating cell signaling remains poorly defined. Here we report a critical role for CYLD in negatively regulating the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). CYLD knockdown by RNA interference results in hyper-activation of JNK by diverse immune stimuli, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, lipopolysaccharide, and an agonistic anti-CD40 antibody. The JNK-inhibitory function of CYLD appears to be specific for immune receptors because the CYLD knockdown has no significant effect on stress-induced JNK activation. Consistently, CYLD negatively regulates the activation of MKK7, an upstream kinase known to mediate JNK activation by immune stimuli. We further demonstrate that CYLD also negatively regulates IκB kinase, although this function of CYLD is seen in a receptor-dependent manner. These findings identify the JNK signaling pathway as a major downstream target of CYLD and suggest a receptor-dependent role of CYLD in regulating the IκB kinase pathway.

This type of ubiquitination, which occurs early during a cellular response, does not target protein degradation but is important for signal transduction (14Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R.

Interestingly, the self-ubiquitination of TRAF2 and TRAF6 is potently inhibited by CYLD under overexpression conditions (4Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 5Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G.

Nature. 2003; 424: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Although it remains unclear whether CYLD regulates the ubiquitination of TRAFs under endogenous conditions, these findings suggest the possibility that CYLD may function as a negative regulator of TRAF ubiquitination and activation of downstream signaling events. Among the downstream signaling cascades activated by TRAFs are those that lead to activation of IκB kinase (IKK) and three families of MAP kinases (MAPKs): c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal responsive kinase, and p38 (8Aggarwal B.B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). IKK is known as a specific activator of NF-κB, a family of inducible transcription factors regulating genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, cell growth/survival, and oncogenesis (18Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 19Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). The MAPKs activate a number of transcription factors, including the ternary complex factor Elk-1 and members of the AP1 and cAMP-response element-binding protein/activation transcription factor families (20Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Additionally, the MAPKs are involved in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression (21Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar, 22Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R.

The biological functions of JNK, which include regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, cell growth, apoptosis, and tumor formation (24Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 25Lin A. Dibling B. Aging Cell. 2002; 1: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Manning A.M. Davis R.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), are particularly diverse. Activation of JNK is mediated by a kinase cascade involving MAPK kinases and MAPK kinase kinases. Two MAPK kinases, MKK4 and MKK7, serve as the direct kinases of JNK. MKK7 is required for JNK activation by inflammatory cytokines, whereas MKK4 is more important for JNK activation by stress signals (27Tournier C. Dong C. Turner T.K. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that activation of IKK by TRAF6 and TRAF2 involves Lys63-linked ubiquitination (13Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 14Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J-I. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). This signaling mechanism appears to be important for IKK activation by specific immune receptors, including interleukin-1 receptors and T-cell receptors (11Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.-K. Xia Z.-P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination of TRAF2 has also been shown to mediate activation of JNK induced by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α (15Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15429-15434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Habelhah H. Takahashi S. Cho S.G. Kadoya T. Watanabe T. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 2003; 23: 322-332Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A role for CYLD in NF-κB regulation is suggested by some recent studies that reveal that CYLD inhibits the activation of an NF-κB reporter gene in transfected cells (1Bignell G.R. Warren W. Seal S. Takahashi M. Rapley E. Barfoot R. Green H. Brown C. Biggs P.J. Lakhani S.R. Jones C. Hansen J. Blair E. Hofmann B. Siebert R. Turner G. Evans D.G. Schrander-Stumpel C. Beemer F.A. van Den Ouweland A.

Nature. 2003; 424: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether CYLD functions as a negative regulator of the IKK or other signaling cascades downstream of various immune receptors. In the present study, we have taken the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene knockdown approach to investigate the function of endogenous CYLD in the regulation of cell signaling. We demonstrate that CYLD is a key negative regulator of JNK downstream of diverse immune receptors. Further, CYLD also inhibits IKK activation, but this function of CYLD is receptor-dependent. Plasmid Constructs—Human CYLD was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR and inserted into the pcDNA-HA vector (28Harhaj E.W. Sun S-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7088-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) downstream of the HA epitope tag. CYLDR is a modified form of the pcDNA-HA-CYLD in which the siRNA binding site was mutated (by site-directed mutagenesis) without altering the amino acid codons. Thus, the CYLDR retains the wild-type CYLD amino acid sequence but is resistant to siRNA-mediated suppression. GST-IκBα-(1–54) was constructed by inserting a DNA fragment encoding the first 54 amino acids of human IκBα and three copies of the HA epitope tag into the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Pharmacia Corporation). GST-c-Jun (1–79) encodes a GST-fusion protein containing the first 79 amino acids of c-Jun. Cell Culture and Antibodies—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, and human B-cell line BJAB were obtained from ATCC. 293 cells stably transfected with murine CD40 (293-CD40) were kindly provided by Dr. Steven Ley (National Institute of Medical Research, London, UK) (29Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 15: 5375-5385Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The anti-CYLD antibody was generated by injecting rabbits with a GST-fusion protein containing an N-terminal region of human CYLD (amino acid 136–301). Anti-mouse CD40 antibody was purchased from Pharmingen. The polyclonal antibodies for tubulin (TU-02), extracellular signal responsive kinase (K-23), JNK1 (C-17), JNK2 (N18), p38 (C-20), Oct1 (C-21), TRAF2 (C-20), IKKγ (FL-419), and MKK4 (MEK-4 H-98) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The recombinant JNK protein, anti-MKK7, and phospho-specific antibodies recognizing activated forms of different MAPKs were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. RNAi—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for human CYLD and luciferase were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sense strand sequences of the oligonucleotides are as follows. CYLD siRNA, AAG UAC CGA AGG GAA GUA UAG; luciferase siRNA, AAC TTA CGC TGA GTA CTT CGA. For siRNA delivery, 293 and HeLa cells were transfected in 6-well plates with 140 pmol of siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). At 16–24 h following the first transfection, the cells were transfected again with the same amount of siRNA together with 300 ng of carrier DNA using Lipofectamine 2000. At about 30 h after the second transfection, the cells were used for different experiments. For stable gene knockdown using the small hairpin RNA technique, a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the CYLD siRNA was cloned into the pSUPER-retro-puro vector (Oligoengine) downstream of the U6 promoter. The generated retroviral construct, named pSUPER-shCYLD, was used to produce recombinant viruses and infect the indicated cells as described previously (30Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25222-25230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The infected cells were enriched by selection using puromycine. The bulk-infected cells were used in the experiments to avoid clonal variations. Immunoblotting (IB), in Vitro Kinase Assay, and Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells in a kinase lysis buffer and immediately subjecting them to IB and in vitro kinase assays as described previously (31Uhlik M. Good L. Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Zandi E. Karin M. Sun S-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Activated MAPKs were analyzed by IB using phospho-specific antibodies. Nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to EMSA (32Sun S-C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) using a 32P-radiolabeled high affinity κB probe (5′-CAA CGG CAG GGG AAT TCC CCT CTC CTT-3′) or a control probe containing the Oct-1 binding site (5′-TGT CGA ATG CAA ATC CTC TCC TT-3′); this was followed by resolving the DNA-protein complexes on native 5% polyacrylamide gels. CYLD Is a Negative Regulator of JNK but Not IKK in the TNF-α Signaling Pathway—To systematically analyze the role of CYLD in regulation of cell signaling, we generated a CYLD-specific antibody. This antibody could readily detect the transfected CYLD (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Additionally, it also detected an endogenous protein band comigrating with the transfected CYLD (lane 1). This protein band, which was not detected by IB using a preimmune serum (data not shown), became more prominent when higher amounts of cell extracts were used in the IB (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3). To confirm that this protein is endogenous CYLD, we performed RNAi assays. The expression of this endogenous protein was markedly suppressed by a CYLD-specific siRNA (siCYLD, Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 4) but not by a control siRNA for luciferase (siLuc, lanes 1 and 3). Similar results were obtained in 293 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). The CYLD antibody also detected some other proteins, but this was likely because of nonspecific cross-reaction because these proteins are much smaller than the predicted mass (105 kDa) of CYLD and because their expression was not affected by the CYLD siRNA. With the CYLD antibody and siRNA, we first examined the effect of CYLD knockdown on cell signaling stimulated by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. In both 293 and HeLa cells, TNF-α stimulated the catalytic activity of IKK and JNK as demonstrated by immunecomplex kinase assays (Fig. 2, A and B, top two panels). JNK activation was also detected based on its site-specific phosphorylation in vivo by IB using a phospho-specific anti-JNK antibody (fourth panel). In addition to IKK and JNK, TNF-α stimulated the activation of the p38 MAPK (Fig. 2, A and B, sixth panel) but did not appreciably induce the activity of extracellular signal responsive kinase (data not shown). If endogenous CYLD serves as a negative regulator of TNF-α-stimulated cell signaling, the CYLD knockdown should result in hyperactivation of the specific kinases under the negative control of CYLD. In this regard, IKK is particularly interesting because CYLD has been shown to inhibit the induction of NF-κB reporter gene by various immune receptors under transient transfection conditions (4Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 5Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G. Nature. 2003; 424: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 6Trompouki E. Hatzivassiliou E. Tsichritzis T. Farmer H. Ashworth A. Mosialos G. Nature. 2003; 424: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 7Regamey A. Hohl D. Liu J.W. Roger T. Kogerman P. Toftgard R. Huber M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To our surprise, however, the CYLD knockdown did not promote IKK activation in the TNF-α-stimulated 293 cells (Fig. 2A, top panel) or HeLa cells (Fig. 2B, top panel). Consistently, the TNF-α stimulated NF-κB DNA binding activity was not enhanced in the CYLD knockdown cells (Fig. 2C, top panel). Interestingly, parallel analyses using the same cells revealed that the CYLD knock-down markedly enhanced the activation of JNK as demonstrated by both kinase assays (Fig. 2, A and B, second panel) and phospho-specific IB assays (fourth panel). The loss of CYLD also caused a low basal level of JNK activation in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2, A and B, fourth panels, lane 4). This result was not caused by variations in protein loading because the amounts of total JNK1 and JNK2 proteins (fifth panel) as well as tubulin (bottom panel) were comparable in the different samples. Further, the CYLD knockdown did not enhance the activation of p38 (sixth panel). To further confirm that CYLD negatively regulates JNK activation in the TNF-α signaling pathway, we generated a modified form of CYLD cDNA harboring sense mutations in the siRNA-targeting site. Although such mutations do not change the amino acid sequence of CYLD, they render the expressed CYLD mRNA resistant to siRNA-mediated destruction. As expected, this modified version of CYLD (CYLDR) was efficiently expressed even in the presence of CYLD siRNA (Fig. 2D, third panel, lanes 5 and 6). More importantly, expression of CYLDR in the CYLD knockdown cells greatly reduced the level of JNK activation (second panel, compare lanes 4 and 6). Furthermore, the CYLD reconstitution did not affect TNF-α-stimulated activation of IKK (first panel). Together, these data demonstrate that JNK is a primary downstream target of CYLD in the TNF-α signaling pathway. CYLD Knockdown Has No Effect on JNK Activation by a Stress Agent—JNK activation can be induced by both immune stimuli and stress signals, which involve different upstream signaling pathways. To assess the mechanism by which CYLD negatively regulates JNK, we examined the effect of CYLD knockdown on JNK activation by a stress stimulus, anisomycin. As expected, incubation of 293 cells with anisomycin resulted in strong activation of JNK (Fig. 3A, top panel, lanes 1–4). Interestingly, the anisomycin-induced JNK activation was not significantly affected by the CYLD knockdown (lanes 5–8). On the other hand, analysis of TNF-α-stimulated JNK activation using the same cells revealed a marked enhancement of this cytokine-specific JNK response by CYLD knock-down (lanes 9–12). This result indicates that CYLD does not regulate the JNK signaling pathway stimulated by stress signals. Furthermore, this finding also implies that CYLD does not directly regulate JNK but targets upstream step(s) involved in JNK activation by TNF-α and other immune stimuli. CYLD Negatively Regulates the Activation of MKK7—Gene targeting studies suggest that JNK activation by inflammatory cytokines and stress signals involves two different upstream kinases, MKK7 and MKK4, with MKK7 being critical for cytokine-induced JNK activation (27Tournier C. Dong C. Turner T.K. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). As a further step to investigate the mechanism underlying CYLD-mediated JNK regulation, we examined the effect of CYLD knockdown on TNF-α-stimulated activation of MKK7 and MKK4. These two JNK kinases were isolated from the cells by immunoprecipitation; this was followed by analyzing their catalytic activity by in vitro kinase assays using recombinant JNK (catalytically inactive) as substrate. As seen with JNK activation, the TNF-α-stimulated MKK7 activation was markedly enhanced in CYLD knockdown cells (Fig. 3B, top panel). This drastic effect was not caused by the variation in the level of MKK7 protein expression (second panel). MKK4 was also weakly induced by TNF-α (third panel, lanes 1–4); however, this response was not significantly enhanced in the CYLD knockdown cells (lanes 5–8). Thus, MKK7 is an upstream target of CYLD in the JNK signaling pathway. CYLD Negatively Regulates JNK Activation by Diverse Stimuli—Next we expanded our studies to investigate whether CYLD also negatively regulates JNK signaling downstream of other immune receptors. One receptor of interest is CD40, which is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor super-family and mediates important immune functions via activation of IKK, JNK, as well as other MAPKs. For convenient CYLD knockdown, we used a previously characterized 293 cell line stably transfected with the murine CD40 cDNA (293-CD40, (29Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 15: 5375-5385Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar)). As expected from the prior studies (29Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 15: 5375-5385Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar), the 293-CD40 cells did not exhibit significant signaling activity under unstimulated conditions (Fig. 4A, top two panels, lane 1). However, cross-linking of CD40 with its agonistic antibody resulted in activation of both IKK (Fig. 4A, top panel) and JNK (second panel). Consistent with the TNF-α-stimulated cells, CYLD knockdown markedly enhanced the activation of JNK in the anti-CD40-treated cells (second panel). A detailed time course analysis revealed that the magnitude but not the kinetics of JNK activation was regulated by CYLD (second panel). Thus, CYLD functions as a negative regulator of JNK in both the TNF-α and CD40 signaling pathways. Interestingly, a parallel kinase assay revealed that the CD40-mediated IKK activation was also enhanced upon CYLD knockdown (first panel). Consistent with this finding, anti-CD40 stimulated hyperactivation of NF-κB in the CYLD knockdown cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 6–8). Parallel assays revealed that in contrast to the activation of IKK and JNK, the activation of p38 was not affected by CYLD knockdown (Fig. 4A, fourth panel). To extend our studies to additional cell models, we employed a retroviral vector (pSUPER-retro-puro) to express a CYLD-specific small hairpin RNA. This approach allows gene suppression in cells with both high and low transfection efficiencies. Infection with CYLD-small hairpin RNA but not the empty pSUPER vector efficiently suppressed the expression of CYLD in BJAB B-cells (Fig. 4C, third panel). We also used the pSUPER small hairpin RNA system to knockdown CYLD in HeLa cells (Fig. 4D, third panel). As seen with the TNF-α and CD40 signaling pathways, CYLD knockdown greatly enhanced JNK activation by LPS and IL-1β (Fig. 4, C and D, second panels). The IKK activation was also promoted by CYLD knockdown in LPS- and IL-1β-stimulated cells (Fig. 4, C and D, top panels), although it was less prominent compared with the effect on JNK activation. Thus, JNK appears to be a primary downstream target of CYLD, but IKK is also negatively regulated by CYLD downstream of certain receptors. Tumor suppressor CYLD is a newly identified member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family. Although CYLD has been shown to inhibit the activation of NF-κB in reporter gene assays, its precise role in regulating signal transduction down-stream of different immune receptors is poorly defined. In this study, we have investigated the function of endogenous CYLD using RNAi-mediated CYLD knockdown. Our data suggest that CYLD functions as a key negative regulator of the JNK signaling pathway downstream of diverse immune stimuli. We have also shown that CYLD negatively regulates IKK, although this function of CYLD is receptor dependent. Consistent with the prior NF-κB reporter studies (4Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 5Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G.

Med. 2003; 198: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we have shown that CYLD inhibits the activation of IKK by certain cellular stimuli, including anti-CD40, LPS, and IL-1β (Fig. 4). To our surprise, however, the CYLD knockdown has no appreciable effect on the TNF-α-stimulated activation of IKK or NF-κB (Fig. 2). This result was not caused by variations in CYLD knockdown or cell stimulations because parallel kinase assays reveal a remarkable elevation of JNK activation caused by the CYLD deficiency (Fig. 2). How CYLD differentially regulates IKK and JNK is not completely understood, but one potential mechanism is attributed to the differential requirement of TRAFs in these signaling pathways. Gene knock-out studies suggest that TRAF2 gene deficiency only weakly inhibits TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation but largely abolishes the activation of JNK by TNF-α (33Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Because TRAF2 is an upstream target of CYLD (4Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 5Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G.

Nature. 2003; 424: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), these findings are consistent with our data that CYLD inhibits the activation of JNK but not NF-κB in TNF-α-stimulated cells (Fig. 2). Our results are also supported by two other studies that suggest an essential role for TRAF2 ubiquitination in TNF-α-stimulated activation of JNK (15Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15429-15434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16Habelhah H. Takahashi S. Cho S.G. Kadoya T. Watanabe T. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 2003; 23: 322-332Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar) but not that of IKK (16Habelhah H. Takahashi S. Cho S.G. Kadoya T. Watanabe T. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 2003; 23: 322-332Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The non-essential role of TRAF2 in NF-κB activation by TNF-α is likely caused by the functional compensation by another TRAF molecule, TRAF5, because TRAF2/TRAF5 doubly deficient cells have a severe defect in NF-κB activation by TNF-α (34Tada K. Okazaki T. Sakon S. Kobarai T. Kurosawa K. Yamaoka S. Hashimoto H. Mak T.W. Yagita H. Okumura K. Yeh W.C. Nakano H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36530-36534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because CYLD has no effect on TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation, it is tempting to speculate that the signaling function of TRAF5 is either not regulated by ubiquitination or is controlled by a different deubiquitinating enzyme. A recent study (35Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar) suggests that negative regulation of IKK in the TNF-α signaling pathway is mediated by A20, which acts by deubiquitinating the RIP kinase known to be essential for TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (36Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 37Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that downstream of the tumor necrosis factor receptor, CYLD and A20 regulate the JNK and IKK cascades by targeting deubiquitination of TRAF2 and RIP, respectively. However, the possibility that CYLD possesses additional targets cannot be excluded. In fact, the finding that CYLD negatively regulates the activation of JNK and IKK by LPS and IL-1β implicates a role for CYLD in negatively regulating the ubiquitination of TRAF6 because TRAF6 is an essential factor for the activation of these pathways downstream of both toll-like receptor 4 (receptor for LPS) and interleukin-1 receptor (38Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C.

Boyle W.J. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). At least under overexpression conditions, the ubiquitination of TRAF6 is inhibited by CYLD (5Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Courtois G.

Nature. 2003; 424: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The finding that CYLD negatively regulates JNK as well as IKK provides an insight into the tumor suppressor function of CYLD. The IKK/NF-κB pathway is well known for its involvement in cell survival and oncogenic transformation as well as immune responses (39Lin A. Karin M. Semin. Cancer. Biol. 2003; 13: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that JNK is also a critical factor involved in tumorigenesis (26Manning A.M. Davis R.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The JNK signaling pathway is constitutively activated in various tumor cells (24Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

Consistent with its oncogenic function, JNK has been shown to promote cell growth and survival (48Hess P. Pihan G. Sawyers C.L. Flavel R.A. Davis R.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 49Lamb J.A. Ventura J.J. Hess P. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, under certain conditions, JNK also functions as an inducer of apoptosis (25Lin A. Dibling B. Aging Cell. 2002; 1: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 52Liu Z.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 795-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 53Varfolomeev E.E.

Although the precise mechanism determining the pro-versus anti-apoptotic functions of JNK remains unclear, strong evidence suggests that prolonged activation of JNK promotes apoptosis (54Chen Y.R.

Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), whereas transient activation of JNK contributes to cell survival (49Lamb J.A. Ventura J.J. Hess P. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1479-1489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Of note, CYLD knock-down increases the magnitude of JNK transient activation but does not prolong the activation kinetics (Figs. 2B and 4). This finding supports the idea that CYLD deficiency promotes cell survival (4Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R. Nature. 2003; 424: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). In addition to its functions in oncogenesis and apoptosis regulation, JNK plays an important role in regulating immune and inflammatory responses (26Manning A.M. Davis R.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Given the important role of CYLD in regulating JNK and IKK downstream of diverse immune receptors (Figs. 2 and 4), it is tempting to speculate that this deubiquitinating enzyme may play an important role in immune regulation. Generations of CYLD knockout mice will be important for better understanding the biological function of CYLD-mediated regulation of JNK and other signaling pathways. One interesting observation of the present study is that CYLD knockdown results in a basal level of activation of JNK as well as IKK/NF-κB (Fig. 2, A and B, and Fig. 4). This result indicates that the loss of CYLD is sufficient for triggering a low level of constitutive cell signaling. However, because cell lines may secrete a low level of cytokines (51Himeno T. Watanabe N. Yamauchi N. Maeda M. Tsuji Y. Okamoto T. Neda H. Niitsu Y. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4941-4945PubMed Google Scholar), it is also possible that the constitutive kinase activity in CYLD knockdown cells is caused by the stimulatory action of endogenous cytokines. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that CYLD is a critical signaling regulator that prevents aberrant activation of JNK and IKK. We thank S. Ley for the 293-CD40 cells and the Sun laboratory members for fruitful discussion."

When expressed in human cells as biofluorescent chimera, TDP1 appeared more mobile than topoisomerase I, less accumulated in nucleoli, and not chromosome-bound at early mitosis. Upon exposure to camptothecin both proteins were cleared from nucleoli and rendered less mobile in the nucleoplasm. However, with TDP1 this happened much more slowly reflecting most likely the redistribution of nucleolar structures upon inhibition of rDNA transcription. Thus, a steady association of TDP1 with topoisomerase I seems unlikely, whereas its integration into repair complexes assembled subsequently to the stabilization of DNA·topoisomerase I intermediates is supported. Cells expressing GFP-tagged TDP1 > 100-fold in excess of endogenous TDP1 exhibited a significant reduction of DNA damage induced by the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin and could be selected by that drug. Surprisingly, DNA damage induced by the topoisomerase II poison VP-16 was also diminished to a similar extent, whereas DNA damage independent of topoisomerase I or II was not affected. Overexpression of the inactive mutant GFP-TDP1H263A at similar levels did not reduce DNA damage by camptothecin or VP-16. These observations confirm a requirement of active TDP1 for the repair of topoisomerase I-mediated DNA damage. Our data also suggest a role of TDP1 in the repair of DNA damage mediated by topoisomerase II, which is less clear. Since overexpression of TDP1 did not compromise cell proliferation, it could be a pleiotropic resistance mechanism in cancer therapy.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, yeast deletion mutations of TDP1 are deficient in the repair of DNA damage induced by camptothecin, a drug that stabilizes the transient topo I·DNA intermediate (2Pouliot J.J.

More precisely, TDP1 has been characterized in these studies as a non-exclusive effector upstream of Rad52 that removes structurally modified topo I adducts (7Debethune L. Kohlhagen G. Grandas A.

In mammals, TDP1 is (in addition or instead?) involved in an XRCC-dependent single-stranded DNA repair pathway also directed at topo I·DNA adducts (10Caldecott K.W.

Despite all the evidence of yeast deletion studies implying TDP1 in DNA repair, a familial disease caused by a mutation in the active site of the human ortholog of the enzyme exhibits a phenotype not at all typical for inadequate DNA repair, namely a slow onset of neuronal degeneration (13Takashima H.

This unexpected finding has prompted speculations that at least in mammals TDP1 could serve a much broader scope of functions, some of which may not even depend on catalytic activity. To further clarify the importance of TDP1 for mammalian DNA repair, we have here overexpressed GFP chimera of human TDP1 or its inactive mutant TDP1H263A (14Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) in human cells and studied the effects on the outcome of various types of DNA damage. Cloning and Cell Culture—Construction and characterization of cell lines supporting stable expression of GFP and GFP-topo I have been described previously (15Christensen M.O. Larsen M.K.

To enable simultaneous visualization of topo I and topo IIα, the GFP moiety in pMC-topo IIα-EGFP (15Christensen M.O. Larsen M.K. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R. Andersen C.L. Kjeldsen E. Knudsen B.R.

Using these two precursor plasmids, the tricistronic expression plasmid pMC-topo IIα-ECFP/EYFP-topo I was generated as described by Mielke et al. (17Mielke C. Tummler M. Schubeler D. von Hoegen I. Hauser H. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this plasmid, topo IIα-ECFP is located in the first, EYFP-topo I in the second, and the selection marker in the third cistron. An internal ribosome entry site from poliovirus mediates the translational initiation of the second and third cistron. The published cDNA sequence of human TDP1 (14Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Constructs bearing all four exchanges were found to be cytotoxic, whereas constructs corrected at positions 328, 389, and 548 to coding the amino acids delineated by FLJ11090 could be overexpressed. Accordingly, all experiments of this study were done with a version of full-length human TDP1, which differs from the protein encoded by FLJ11090 only by the amino acid exchange D322N. This sequence was inserted into pMC-EGFPP-N (16Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Feineis S. Knudsen B.R. Andersen A.H. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol.

The catalytically inactive mutant GFP-TDP1H263A was made by site-directed mutagenesis PCR of the GFP-TDP1 plasmid using primer pairs encoding the His to Ala point mutation at position 263 described by Interthal et al.

Briefly, cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with Glutamax-I (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Stable transgenic cell lines were selected after 2 days with 0.35 μg ml-1 puromycin or with a combination of 0.35 μg ml-1 puromycin and 50 nm camptothecin (for details, see Fig. 1A). Cells were then maintained under selection. Cells with a high expression of GFP-TDP1 were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared by adding to cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline an equal volume of 2-fold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 8 m urea, 20% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 10 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg ml-1 aprotinin, 10 μg ml-1 pepstatin A). Material equivalent to 5 × 105 cells was then applied to each slot of an SDS gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MD). The membranes were subsequently blocked with phosphate-buffered saline, containing 2% hydrolyzed casein, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20, and then incubated for 1 h with the primary antibodies diluted with the same buffer. Topo I, topo IIα, and topo IIβ were stained with rabbit peptide antibodies against C-terminal residues of the human enzymes (20Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.R. Hickson I.D. Kikuchi A. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). TDP1 was stained with a rabbit antiserum antibody obtained after immunization with full-length bacterially expressed human TDP1. GFP, YFP, and CFP were stained with mouse monoclonal antibodies (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany). After washing, the filters were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies diluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. Following extensive washing with the same buffer, labeled protein bands were finally visualized by chemoluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). For immunoband depletion, cells were first cultured with camptothecin (1-20 μm, 20 min to 1 h, as detailed in the legends to Figs. 5 and 6) or etoposide (10-50 μm, 20 min to 1 h, as detailed in the legends to Figs. 5 and 6), and the same concentration of drug was also added to the lysis buffer.Fig. 6Impact of VP-16 on topo I. A, immunoband depletion. Cells expressing GFP-TDP1 (left), GFP-TDP1H263A (middle), and untransfected (untransf.) cells (right) were treated for 1 h with 10 μm VP-16 (lanes 2, 5, and 8), 1 μm camptothecin (CPT) (lanes 3, 6, and 9), or left untreated (lanes 1, 4, and 7). Subsequently, the equivalent of 5 × 105 cells was subjected to Western blotting, and blots were probed with antibodies against topo I (bottom) or topo IIα (top). B, immunoblotting and immunoband depletion of 293 cells coexpressing YFP-topo I and topo IIα-CFP. Cells coexpressing YFP-topo I and topo IIα-CFP were treated for 20 min with 50 μm VP-16 (lane 4), 10 μm camptothecin (CPT) (lane 5) or were kept without drug (lanes 1-3). Western blots were probed with antibodies against topo I (left), topo IIα (middle), or YFP/CFP (right). C, impact of VP-16 on localization of YFP-topo I and topo IIα-CFP.

The plasmid pUC18 or catenated kinetoplast DNA from Crithidia fasciculata (400 ng per assay) served as substrates. For the assessment of topo II activity, the buffer was supplemented with 1 mm ATP. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (19Christensen M.O. Barthelmes H.U. Boege F. Mielke C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 7255-7263Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.R. Hickson I.D. Kikuchi A. Kreipe H. Boege F. J.

Reactions were terminated with 1% SDS, 0.1 mg ml-1 proteinase K. Reaction products were analyzed by submarine agarose gel electrophoresis. It was carried out in the presence of ethidium bromide (2 μg ml-1), when cleaved (open circular or linear) and uncleaved (closed circular) plasmid forms were to be separated. It was carried out in the absence of ethidium bromide when relaxed and supercoiled plasmid forms were to be separated. Life Cell Imaging—Images of epifluorescence were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted microscope, whereas confocal imaging and measurements of fluorescecence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) were done with a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope. A heated cell chamber (Bioptechs Inc., Butler, PA) and a heated 63×/1.4 NA oil-immersion objective were used with both microscopes to allow for culturing of the cells under the microscope precisely at 37 °C. For FRAP measurements, fluorescent images of a single optical section were taken at 1.6-s time intervals before (n = 5) and after bleaching of a circular area at 20 milliwatts nominal laser power with three iterations. Imaging scans were acquired with the laser power attenuated to 0.1-1% of the bleaching intensity. For a quantitative analysis of FRAP, fluorescence intensities of the bleached region and the entire cell nucleus were measured at each time point. Data were corrected for extracellular background intensity and for the overall loss in total intensity as a result of the bleach pulse itself and of the imaging scans. The relative intensity of the bleached area Irel was calculated according to Phair and Misteli (21Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Analysis of DNA Damage by Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (Comet Assay)—Alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis was performed according to (22Gedik C.M. Ewen S.W. Collins A.R. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1992; 62: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 106 cells ml-1 were incubated for 1 h in serum-containing medium in the presence or absence of the test compounds. Thereafter, aliquots (70 μl = 70,000 cells) were centrifuged (5 min, 200 × g), and the resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 65 μl of low melting agarose and distributed onto a frosted glass microscope slide precoated with a layer of normal melting agarose. The slides were covered with a glass slide and kept at 4 °C for 10 min to allow for solidification of the agarose. After removing the cover glass, slides were immersed for 1 h at 4 °C in lysis solution (89 ml of lysis stock solution, 1 ml of Triton X-100, and 10 ml of Me2SO). Subsequently, DNA was allowed to unwind (pH 13.5, 20 min, 4 °C), and then horizontal gel electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C for 20 min (25 V, 300 mA). Thereafter, the slides were washed three times with 0.4 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stained with ethidium bromide (50 μl, 10 μg ml-1). Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axioskop 20 (excitation: λ = 546 ± 12 nm; emission: λ ≥ 590 nm). Slides were subjected to computer aided image analysis (Comet Assay II System, Perceptive Instruments, Suffolk, Great Britain), scoring 50 images per slide randomly picked from each electrophoresis. For each drug concentration, two slides were processed and analyzed independently. The results were parameterized with respect to tail intensity (intensity of the DNA in the comet tail calculated as percentage of overall DNA intensity of the same cell). Such quantitative data were always derived from four independent sets of experiments and from the evaluation of 100 individual cells (50/slide) for each drug concentration and each experiment. For graphical representation, the local distribution of staining intensity was coded by false colors using in decreasing order yellow, dark blue, petrol, black, light blue, and red. Constitutive Expression of GFP-TDP1 or the Active Site Mutant GFP-TDP1H263A Is Tolerated at High Levels—Stable transfection with the chimeric cDNA of GFP-TDP1 gave rise to a large number of transgenic cell clones with GFP fluorescence of the cells ranging from 2-1000-fold above background (Fig. 1A, middle top). From these we enriched cells with a GFP fluorescence of 100-1000-fold above background (Fig. 1A, middle bottom). These cells could easily be maintained overextended periods of time without loss of fluorescence. It had a similar morphology and doubling time as the parental cell line, indicating that GFP-TDP1 was not toxic and did not interfere with cell proliferation. It should be noted that a population of transgenic cell clones with much higher expression levels of GFP-TDP1 could be selected by a combination of puromycin and camptothecin (Fig. 1A, bottom), suggesting that TDP1 overexpression counteracts topo I-mediated cell killing, which supports recent data obtained with yeast TDP1 (23Nivens M.C. Felder T. Galloway A.H. Pena M.M. Pouliot J.J. Spencer H.T. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2004; 53: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A cell population expressing the catalytically inactive mutant (14Interthal H. Pouliot J.J. Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12009-12014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) GFP-TDP1H263A established in a similar fashion did not profit from co-selection with puromycin and camptothecin (data not shown) suggesting that the mutant was indeed inactive in the cell. To control expression levels and integrity of GFP-TDP1 and GFP-TDP1H263A, Western blots of whole cell lysates were probed with antibodies against TDP1 or GFP. When probed with GFP antibodies (Fig. 1B, top), cells transfected with GFP-TDP1 (lane 2) or GFP-TDP1H263A (lane 3) showed a single band of expected size, whereas such a band was absent in untransfected cells (lane 1), and a much smaller band became apparent in cells expressing GFP alone (lane 4). Expression levels of GFP-TDP1 and GFP-TDP1H263A were similar (compare lanes 2 and 3), and by comparison with pure recombinant GFP (lanes 5-7), they were calculated in the range of 106 molecules per cell, whereas endogenous TDP1 expression is estimated in the range of 104 molecules per cell. When blots were probed with TDP1 antibodies (Fig. 1B, bottom), GFP-TDP1 and GFP-TDP1H263A became visible as bands of 100 kDa, which were at least 100-fold stronger than endogenous TDP1, visible as a faint band of about 70 kDa (compare upper and lower band in lanes 2 and 3). Summing up the data presented in Fig. 1, we ascertained that the chimeric transgenes were not rearranged in the cells, that green fluorescence of the transgenic cell lines was unambiguously due to GFP-TDP1 or GFP-TDP1H263A, respectively, and that constitutive expression of the biofluorescent TDP1 varieties exceeded that of the endogenous enzyme by a factor of at least 100. GFP-TDP1 and GFP-TDP1H263A Have a Similar Nuclear Pattern That Differs Markedly from Topo I—Fig. 2A shows cells cultured under the fluorescence microscope and imaged at interphase by phase contrast (left) or GFP fluorescence (right). Upon comparing cells expressing GFP-topo I (top), GFP-TDP1 (middle top), or GFP-TDP1H263A (middle bottom) to a cell expressing non-fused GFP (bottom), it becomes apparent that these proteins are exclusively localized in the cell nucleus, whereas GFP is localized in the nucleus and the cytosol. In contrast to GFP, GFP-TDP1, and the active site mutant GFP-TDP1H263A are uniformly distributed in the entire nuclear space and not excluded from the nucleoli. The similarity of the pattern suggests that the point mutation in GFP-TDP1H263A does not disrupt general properties such as folding or cellular targeting of the protein. Localization of both TDP1 varieties differs markedly from GFP-topo I, which is mostly nucleolar. Fig. 2B shows time-lapsed images of cells expressing GFP-TDP1 (left) or GFP-topo I (right) as they go through mitosis. Again, GFP-TDP1 differs from GFP-topo I, in as much as it does not associate with the chromatin until late telophase, whereas GFP-topo I remains DNA-bound during the entire mitotic cycle. Thus, GFP-topo I behaves like a DNA-associated protein, whereas GFP-TDP1 and GFP-TDP1H263A (data not shown) behave like diffusible nuclear passengers. The Impact of Camptothecin on Localization and Mobility of GFP-TDP1—The drug camptothecin binds and stabilizes covalent catalytic DNA-intermediates of topo I (24Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and attenuates the mobility of GFP-linked topo I in the cell, which can be measured by FRAP. Recently, such experiments have revealed that camptothecin targets topo I preferentially in the nucleoplasm, thus shifting the nuclear distribution equilibrium of the enzyme away from the nucleoli in a very rapid manner (16Christensen M.O.

Since DNA-linked topo I becomes eventually a substrate for TDP1 (1Yang S.W. Burgin Jr., A.B. Huizenga B.N. Robertson C.A. Yao K.C. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11534-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2Pouliot J.J. Yao K.C. Robertson C.A. Nash H.A.

Biol. 2003; 10: 139-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we expected GFP-TDP1 to follow topo I to the nucleoplasm and to also become less mobile when processing its immobilized substrate. However, the data shown in Fig. 3 lend only partial support to this hypothesis. Upon exposure to camptothecin, GFP-topo I (Fig. 3A, left) and GFP-TDP1 (Fig. 3A, middle) were both depleted from the nucleoli, and FRAP kinetics of both proteins obtained in the nucleoplasm became slower (Fig. 3B, left, compare open and closed triangles; Fig. 3B, right, compare open circles with closed boxes). However, nucleolar depletion of GFP-TDP1 was not as rapid as that of GFP-topo I itself (Fig. 3A, compare left and middle at 1′ and 5′). Moreover, the inactive mutant GFP-TDP1H263A was also cleared from nucleoli upon prolonged exposure to camptothecin (data not shown). These findings suggest that nucleolar clearance of TDP1 upon prolonged exposure to camptothecin does not stem from a comigration with topo I to the nucleoplasm but rather from the general disintegration and redistribution of nucleolar structures upon prolonged inhibition of rDNA transcription by camptothecin (25Christensen M.O. Krokowski R.M. Barthelmes H.U. Hock R. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21873-21882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This notion is also supported by the observation that exposure to the topo II-poison VP-16 did not induce nucleolar depletion of GFP-TDP1 (Fig. 3A, right). It should also be noted that FRAP kinetics of GFP-TDP1 were 10 times faster than those of GFP-topo I (Fig. 3B, compare open triangles in left diagram with open circles in right diagram), indicating TDP1 to be more freely diffusible than topo I. Enhanced TDP1 Expression Decreases DNA Damage by Poisons of Topo I and Topo II—In summary, the data in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that TDP1 and topo I are unlikely to be in constant association because they have a different mobility and different localization patterns in the living cell nucleus. However, upon exposure to camptothecin they become both less mobile in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 3B). This could reflect recruitment of GFP-TDP1 to multiprotein complexes dedicated to the repair of DNA-linked topo I. Since the cells express GFP-TDP1 at least 100-fold in excess of endogenous TDP1 (see Fig. 1), their capacity of repairing such lesions should be enhanced if TDP1 was a limiting factor of the respective repair pathway. To test this hypothesis, we measured the damage inflicted by camptothecin on the genome of cells overexpressing GFP-TDP1 in comparison with cells expressing similar levels of the active site mutant GFP-TDP1H263A (see Fig. 1B) or unfused GFP. This was done by a standardized procedure based on the quantification of DNA strand breaks via the size and intensity of the comet-shaped DNA tail emerging upon single cell gel electrophoresis from a cell harboring a damaged genome (22Gedik C.M. Ewen S.W. Collins A.R. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1992; 62: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In the absence of DNA-damaging drugs DNA comets were not apparent in any of the three cell lines (Fig. 4, left), indicating that overexpression of GFP, GFP-TDP1, or GFP-TDP1H263Aper se did not increase the fragility of the genome. Camptothecin-induced DNA tails were significantly smaller in cells overexpressing GFP-TDP1 than in control cells or in cells expressing GFP-TDP1H263A (Fig. 4, middle left). Thus, the capacity for repairing topo I·DNA adducts seemed to correlate with the expression of catalytically active TDP1, which fits the previous observation (Fig. 1A, bottom) that cells supporting a high expression of GFP-TDP1 can be selected with camptothecin. Taken together, these findings suggest TDP1 activity to be a limiting factor of the repair pathway. To our utter astonishment, a similar effect was seen upon exposure to the topo II poison etoposide (VP-16) initially meant as a negative control (Fig. 4, middle right). In cells expressing GFP alone, VP-16 created very large DNA tails, and DNA staining intensity in the nucleus decreased by 2 orders of intensity, indicating a more or less complete fragmentation"

Less well studied are the counterregulatory actions of glucagon on protein metabolism. In the present study, the effect of glucagon on amino acid-induced signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an important controller of the mRNA binding step in translation initiation, was examined using the perfused rat liver as an experimental model. The results show that amino acids enhance signaling through mTOR resulting in phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP)1, the 70-kDa ribosomal protein (rp)S6 kinase, S6K1, and rpS6. In contrast, glucagon repressed both basal and amino acid-induced signaling through mTOR, as assessed by changes in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1. The repression was associated with the activation of protein kinase A and enhanced phosphorylation of LKB1 and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Surprisingly, the phosphorylation of two S6K1 substrates, rpS6 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4B, was not repressed but instead was increased by glucagon treatment, regardless of the amino acid concentration. The latter finding could be explained by the glucagon-induced phosphorylation of the ERK1 and the 90-kDa rpS6 kinase p90rsk. Thus, glucagon represses phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 through the activation of a protein kinase A-LKB-AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway, while simultaneously enhancing phosphorylation of other downstream effectors of mTOR through the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1-p90rsk signaling pathway. Amino acids also enhance AMPK phosphorylation, although to a lesser extent than glucagon and amino acids combined.

Amino acids also enhance AMPK phosphorylation, although to a lesser extent than glucagon and amino acids combined. The counter-regulatory action of glucagon on insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism is well documented in the literature (1Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In contrast, few studies have examined the effects of the hormone on protein metabolism. Reports suggest that in vivo glucagon has an overall catabolic effect on protein metabolism, although the mechanisms through which it acts are unclear (2Couet C. Fukagawa N.K. Matthews D.E. Bier D.M. Young V.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E78-E85PubMed Google Scholar, 3Flakoll P.J. Borel M.J. Wentzel L.S. Williams P.E. Lacy D.B. Abumrad N.N.

Studies using a perfused rat liver preparation show that glucagon stimulates protein degradation, inhibits protein synthesis, and prevents completely the stimulation of protein synthesis induced by elevated levels of perfusate amino acid concentration (6Woodside K.H.

Studies using rat hepatocytes show that glucagon attenuates the stimulatory effect of epidermal growth factor on phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein (rp) 1The abbreviations used are: rp, ribosomal protein; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; BP, binding protein; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. S6 kinase S6K1 (7Dixon M. Agius L. Yeaman S.J. Day C.P. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1418-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In rat liver, the stimulation of S6K1 phosphorylation by hormones and nutrients is regulated through a signal transduction pathway involving a protein kinase referred to as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Phosphorylation activates S6K1, which then phosphorylates rpS6 (8Jeno P. Ballou L.M. Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4B (9Raught B. Peiretti F. Gingras A-C. Livingstone M. Shahbazian D. Mayeur G.L. Polakiewicz R.D. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), resulting in an enhanced translation of subsets of mRNA such as those containing an oligopyrimidine tract at the 5′-end of the message (reviewed in Ref. 10Meyuhas O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6321-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylating S6K1, mTOR also phosphorylates a protein termed 4E-BP1, which binds to and represses the function of the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E (11Gingras A-C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakeiwicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 results in the dissociation of the nonfunctional 4E-BP1·eIF4E complex, allowing eIF4E to bind to a second initiation factor, eIF4G, to form the active eIF4F complex that mediates the binding of mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit, a key regulatory step in translation initiation (12Gingras A-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Thus, one potential mechanism through which glucagon may regulate protein synthesis in liver is by repressing signaling through mTOR to proteins involved in the selection of mRNA for translation.

Cancer Cells. 2004; 6: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) have shown a decrease in signaling through mTOR under conditions that activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). As an example, administration of the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribonucleoside to rats in vivo results in a repression of signaling through mTOR as assessed by the decreased phosphorylation of mTOR on Ser-2448 and the diminished phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 (13Bolster D.R. Crozier S.J. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23977-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The activation of AMPK is mediated in part through the phosphorylation of the kinase on Thr-172 (reviewed in Ref. 18Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Until recently, the identity of the kinase that phosphorylates Thr-172 on AMPK was unknown. However, a recent report (19Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28.15-28.21Crossref Google Scholar) shows that the protein kinase referred to as LKB1 phosphorylates AMPK on Thr-172 both in vitro and in vivo. Earlier studies showing that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates LKB1 (20Collins S.P. Reoma J.L. Gamm D.M. Uhler M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 21Sapkota G.P. Kieloch A. Lizcano J.M. Lain S. Arthur J.S.C. Williams M.R. Morrice N. Deak M. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19469-19482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) provide a possible mechanism through which glucagon may repress signaling through mTOR. In such a model, the elevation of cAMP in response to glucagon would initiate a cascade of events starting with the activation of PKA, LKB1, and AMPK and ending in decreased mTOR signaling. An alternative mechanism through which glucagon may repress signaling through mTOR involves the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling pathway. In support of this possibility, glucagon activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-signaling pathway in cells in culture (22Jiang Y. Cypess A.M. Muse E.D. Wu C.-R. Unson C.G.

Bataille D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20345-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous reports have shown that activation of either the ERK or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling pathway results in phosphorylation of tuberin and that inhibition of ERK signaling prevents the epidermal growth factor-mediated activation of S6K1 (24Li Y. Inoki K. Vacratsis P. Guan K-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13663-13671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Tee A.R. Anjum R. Blenis J. J. Biol.

A. 2004; 101: 13489-13494Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases also phosphorylate the 90-kDa rpS6 protein kinase, p90rsk (reviewed in Ref. 27Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). However, although p90rsk phosphorylates rpS6 in in vitro reactions, its role as an rpS6 kinase in vivo has been questioned (reviewed in Ref. 28Jefferies H.B.J. Thomas G. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 30. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 389-409Google Scholar). Thus, glucagon may repress mTOR signaling through either the AMPK or mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways or both. In the present study, the effects of glucagon on basal and amino acid-induced signaling through mTOR were examined. The results showed that glucagon repressed amino acid-induced phosphorylation of two downstream targets of mTOR signaling, 4E-BP1 and S6K1. Moreover, glucagon stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK, LKB1, ERK1/2, and p90rsk independent of amino acid concentration. Surprisingly, glucagon also stimulated phosphorylation of the S6K1/S6K2 substrates rpS6 and eIF4B, suggesting that p90rsk may function to phosphorylate the two proteins under these conditions. Overall, the results demonstrated that glucagon repressed amino acid-induced signaling through mTOR but that activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway supersedes the inhibition of S6K1 and was associated with an increase in phosphorylation of proteins traditionally considered to be targets of S6K1.

In Situ Liver Perfusion—Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing ∼100–130 g at the time of experimentation were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with food (Harlan Teklad), and water was provided ad libitum (the experimental protocol used for the studies described herein was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine). Prior to experimentation, the rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital at 6 mg/100 g of body weight. Livers were perfused in situ with a non-recirculating medium at a flow rate of 7 ml/min, as described previously (30Exton J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 39: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Feldhoff R.C. Taylor J.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol.

The perfusion medium consisted of Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm glucose, 3% w/v bovine albumin, 33% washed bovine erythrocytes, and amino acids at 1 or 4× the concentrations found in the arterial plasma of postabsorptive rats (32Tolman E.L. Schworer C.M. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4552-4560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The perfusion medium was maintained at 37 °C and gassed with a mixture of 95% O2, 5% CO2. When present, glucagon (10 nm in 0.155 m NaCl (pH 3.0)) was infused directly into the inflow line at a rate of 0.2 ml/min for a final calculated concentration of 0.3 nm. Total perfusion time was 10 min. Immediately following perfusion, livers were excised and frozen between aluminum blocks that were precooled in liquid nitrogen, and the frozen liver was stored at –80 °C for future analysis. Measurement of PKA Activity—The phosphotransferase activity of PKA was measured using a PKA assay kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). For this purpose, 0.2 g of frozen liver tissue was homogenized in 7 volumes of 1× Assay Dilution Buffer consisting of 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm microcystin, and 10 μl/ml Sigma protease inhibitor mixture. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was measured using a kit from Bio-Rad. Supernatant containing 50 μg of protein was diluted to 5 μl with 1× Assay Dilution Buffer followed by the addition of 25 μl of assay mix (16 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 4 mm EGTA, 0.8 mm sodium vanadate, 80 μm dithiothreitol, 0.8 μm microcystin, 8 μl/ml Sigma protease inhibitor mixture, 100 μm Kemptide, 7.5 mm magnesium chloride, 100 μm [32P]ATP (1 μCi/μmol), 0.4 μm PKC inhibitor peptide, and 4 μm compound R24571 (a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor)). A duplicate sample of diluted supernatant was assayed using the same assay mix containing 1 μm PKA inhibitor peptide. Both assay mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, at which time 15 μl of each of the assay mixtures was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose filters. The phosphocellulose filters were washed subsequently with 0.75% phosphoric acid and acetone, as recommended in the manufacturer's instructions to the PKA assay kit, and the amount of radioactivity bound to the filters was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. PKA activity was calculated as the difference between the sample assayed in the absence of PKA inhibitor peptide and the sample assayed with the inhibitor. Western Blot Analysis—A portion (0.3–0.4 g) of frozen liver was homogenized in 7 volumes of buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 μl/ml Sigma protease inhibitor mixture using a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged immediately at 1000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C after which 200 μl of supernatant was added to an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min at 100 °C. The samples were then stored at –80 °C until analyzed. The electrophoretic mobility of the proteins analyzed in this study was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the following acrylamide concentrations: 7.5% for S6K1 and eIF4G, 10% for LKB1, AMPK, and eIF4B, 12.5% for rpS6, ERK1/2, and p90rsk, and 15% for 4E-BP1. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane that was then blocked for 1 h in a solution of 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween (pH 7.6). The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody followed the next day by a 1-h incubation in secondary antibody. The blots were developed using an ECL or ECL+ Western blotting kit as recommended by the manufacturer. The chemiluminescence signal was visualized and quantitated using a Gene-Gnome Bioimaging system (Syngene). Membranes probed with a phospho-specific primary antibody were then reprobed with an antibody that recognizes the protein independent of phosphorylation status after removing the phospho-specific antibody, according to the procedure recommended by GE Healthcare (TechTips no. 120). Measurement of Protein Phosphorylation State—Phosphorylation of S6K1, eIF4B, eIF4G, AMPK, 4E-BP1, ERK1/2, p90rsk, and rpS6 was measured in the supernatants centrifuged at 1000 × g by Western blot analysis as described above. Phosphorylation of LKB1 was measured in 1000 × g supernatants that had been cleared by preincubation with BioMag beads. One of the best characterized actions of glucagon is elevation of intracellular cAMP and subsequent activation of PKA (33Jelinek L.J. Lok S. Rosenberg G.B. Smith R.A. Grant F.J. Biggs S. Bensch P.A. Kuijper J.L. Sheppard P.O. Sprecher C.A. O'Hara P.J. Foster D. Walker K.M. Chen L.H.J. McKernan P.A. Kindsvogel W. Science. 1993; 259: 1614-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Therefore, PKA activity was used as an index of the effectiveness of the dose of the hormone and time of exposure utilized in the present study. As shown in Fig. 1, PKA activity was unaffected by changes in perfusate amino acid concentration. However, PKA activity was markedly greater in extracts of livers perfused in the presence of glucagon than livers perfused in the absence of the hormone. To assess amino acid- and glucagon-induced changes in signaling through mTOR, the phosphorylation of two mTOR substrates, 4E-BP1 and S6K1, was assessed. As shown in Fig. 2, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was enhanced in livers perfused with medium containing 4× compared with 1× amino acids. In contrast, glucagon repressed both basal and amino acid-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Similarly, phosphorylation of S6K1 was enhanced in livers perfused with 4× compared with 1× amino acids when assessed by either hyperphosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 3A) or phosphorylation of a specific residue, Thr-389 (Fig. 3B). Glucagon had no effect on basal S6K1 phosphorylation but repressed amino acid-induced phosphorylation of the protein. Thus, the data support the idea that glucagon attenuates amino acid-induced signaling through mTOR.Fig. 3Effect of amino acids and glucagon on phosphorylation of S6K1 in perfused rat liver. Rat livers were perfused as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A, hyperphosphorylation of S6K1 was assessed as the decreased migration of the protein during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Moreover, activation of PKA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by either forskolin or isoproterenol enhances phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr-172 (34Yin W. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43074-43080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the present study, the effect of glucagon treatment on AMPK phosphorylation was assessed. As shown in Fig. 4, perfusion of livers in the presence of 4× amino acids resulted in a 2-fold increase in the relative phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr-172 compared with livers perfused in the presence of 1× amino acid. Similarly, glucagon treatment increased AMPK(Thr-172) phosphorylation ∼2-fold in the presence of 1× amino acids and further enhanced the phosphorylation of the protein in livers exposed to 4× amino acids. To examine the possible involvement of the AMPK protein kinase LKB1 in the activation of AMPK by glucagon, the effects of amino acids and glucagon on LKB1 phosphorylation on Ser-428, a residue phosphorylated by PKA in vitro (20Collins S.P. Reoma J.L. Gamm D.M. Uhler M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), was assessed. As shown in Fig. 5, increasing amino acids from 1 to 4× had no effect on LKB1 phosphorylation, whereas glucagon significantly enhanced phosphorylation of Ser-428 on LKB1 independent of perfusate amino acid concentration. To further examine changes in signaling through mTOR, the phosphorylation state of two proteins downstream of S6K1, rpS6 and eIF4B, was assessed. Increasing perfusate amino acid concentrations from 1 to 4× had no significant effect on the phosphorylation of eIF4B (Fig. 6) or of rpS6 on Ser-235/Ser-236 (Fig. 7A), but phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser-240/Ser-244 was enhanced (Fig. 7B). Glucagon had no significant effect on rpS6(Ser-240/Ser-244) phosphorylation regardless of perfusate amino acid concentration. Surprisingly, glucagon enhanced the phosphorylation of both eIF4B and rpS6(Ser-235/Ser-236) in the presence of either 1 or 4× amino acids, suggesting that the hormone activates a kinase that can phosphorylate these two S6K1 substrates.Fig. 7Effect of amino acids and glucagon on rpS6 phosphorylation in perfused rat liver. Rat livers were perfused as described in the legend to Fig. 1, and rpS6 phosphorylation on Ser-235/Ser-236 (A) or Ser-240/Ser-244 (B) was assessed by Western blot analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results represent the mean ± S.E.

As shown in Fig. 8A, the phosphorylation of p90rsk was unaffected by changes in perfusate amino acid concentration. However, treatment with glucagon resulted in a decrease in migration of the kinase during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that glucagon enhanced the phosphorylation of p90rsk. Similarly, amino acids had no effect on the phosphorylation of the p90rsk upstream kinase ERK1 or ERK2 (Fig. 8B), whereas exposure to glucagon caused a decrease in ERK1 but not ERK2 migration during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that glucagon promotes activation of ERK1 in perfused rat liver. In the present study, the hypothesis that glucagon represses amino acid-induced signaling through mTOR was tested using the perfused rat liver as an experimental model system.

Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that amino acids and, in particular, the branched-chain amino acid leucine promote signaling through mTOR, as assessed by phosphorylation of the mTOR substrates 4E-BP1 and S6K1. In the present study, we confirmed the results of the earlier studies and showed that increasing the perfusate amino acid concentrations from those found in plasma of postabsorptive rats to four times those levels results in enhanced phosphorylation of both 4E-BP1 and S6K1, indicating that amino acids promote signaling through mTOR in perfused rat liver. We extended the earlier studies to show that co-administration of glucagon with amino acids prevents the amino acid-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1, supporting the hypothesis that glucagon represses amino acid-induced signaling through mTOR. The hypothesis is also supported by the results from a recent study (38Mothe-Satney I. Gautier N. Hinault C. Lawrence J.C. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42628-42637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that was published while the present study was being prepared for submission. In that study, it was found that glucagon attenuates amino acid- and insulin-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 in isolated rat hepatocytes and that the effect of glucagon on mTOR signaling appears to be independent of the phosphorylation of mTOR on Ser-2448, because all three treatments, amino acids, insulin, and glucagon, promote phosphorylation of that site.

A gene cloning approach was based on the assumption that PAM would resemble the well known plant enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase. A phenylalanine ammonia lyase-like sequence acquired from a Taxus cuspidata cDNA library was expressed functionally in Escherichia coli and confirmed as the target aminomutase that is virtually identical to the recombinant enzyme and clone from Taxus chinensis, acquired recently by a reverse genetics approach (Bristol-Myers Squibb (August 14, 2003) U. S. Patent WO 03/066871 A2). The full-length cDNA has an open reading frame of 2094 base pairs and encodes a protein of 698 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 76,530 Da. The recombinant mutase has a pH optimum of 8.5, a kcat value of 0.015 s–1, and a Km of 45 ± 8 μm for 2S-α-phenylalanine. The stereochemical mechanism of PAM involves the removal and interchange of the pro-3S hydrogen and the amino group, which rebonds at C-3 with retention of configuration. The recombinant enzyme appears to catalyze both the forward and reverse reactions with specificity for both 2S-α-phenylalanine and 3S- or 3R-β-phenylalanine substrates, respectively, whereas the related phenylpropanoids 2S-aminocyclohexanepropanoic acid, 2R-α-phenylalanine, and 2S-α-tyrosine are not converted to their β-isomers by the mutase.

The final stages of Taxol biosynthesis (see Fig. 1A) in yew species involve the assembly and attachment to C-13 of the taxane core of the N-benzoyl phenylisoserinoyl side chain, which is an important pharmacophoric descriptor of this anticancer drug (1He L.

Horwitz S.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the current practice of Taxol production, this side chain is attached by chemical semisynthesis to baccatin III, which is derived from 10-deacetylbaccatin III, a Taxus (yew) metabolite that is much more readily available than Taxol itself (3Holton R.A.

In the biosynthetic pathway, five steps are involved in the construction of the side chain. The first step is considered to be the conversion of 2S-α-phenylalanine to 3R-β-phenylalanine by an aminomutase that catalyzes an intramolecular migration of the amino group and a partial internal transfer of the pro-3S hydrogen (6, Walker, K.

This step is seemingly followed by the ligase-mediated activation to the corresponding CoA ester and then the transfer of β-phenylalanoyl to the C-13 hydroxyl of baccatin III. The resulting intermediate (designated β-phenylalanoyl baccatin III or N-debenzoyl-2′-deoxytaxol) then likely undergoes cytochrome P450-mediated hydroxylation at the side chain 2′-position to generate the isoserinoyl moiety and final N-benzoylation of this side chain (8Walker K. Long R. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9166-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) to complete the biosynthesis of Taxol. cDNAs encoding the two transferases involved in C-13 side chain assembly have been described previously (8Walker K.

Liu W. Toney M.D. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6062-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), an annotated expressed sequence tag library (23Jennewein S. Wildung M.R. Chau M. Walker K. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9149-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) prepared from mRNA isolated from T. cuspidata cells elicited with methyl jasmonate for increased Taxol production (10Ketchum R.E.B. Rithner C.D. Qiu D. Kim Y.S. Williams R.M. Croteau R.B. Phytochemistry. 2003; 62: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Hefner J. Ketchum R.E.B. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 360: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) was screened for PAL-like sequences. The library contained a 5′-truncated cDNA sequence (designated PAL1981) that was related closely (50–70% similarity) to functional PAL sequences (GenBank™ accession nos. X15473, AY443341, and M84466) and tyrosine aminomutase (GenBank™ accession no. AY048670) (see Fig. 2). The 5′-truncated PAL1981 cDNA in the original pBluescript vector was sequenced fully, and the full-length version was obtained by 5′-RACE (version 2.0, Invitrogen). Thus, from the sequence of the partial cDNA, three gene-specific reverse primers were designed and synthesized for nested PCR: 5′-CAA GAG TTT CCC CAG CCC-3′ (GSP1), 5′-GGC GAC TGC GAT GCG CAC GTA GTC-3′ (GSP2), and 5′-AAT TCG CAC CAT GGA GAG CCC-3′ (GSP3). The 5′-RACE abridged anchor forward primer (AAP) 5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT ACG GGI IGG GII GGG IIG-3′ was supplied by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Briefly, the product of first strand synthesis, using 5 μg of mRNA and 2 pmol of primer GSP1, was purified by gel permeation (spin column, Edge Biosystems) and employed for 3′-homopolymer-C tailing and second strand amplification with primers AAP and GSP1 and Taq polymerase (94 °C for 1 min and then 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45-s denaturation, 50 °C for 45-s annealing, and 72 °C for 2-min extension, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min). The PCR product of appropriate size was gel-purified, extracted (gel extraction kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and employed in second and third round PCR (same conditions), but reverse primers GSP2 and GSP3 were substituted, respectively, for GSP1, and then the PCR products were gel-purified as before. The final double-stranded cDNA product of the appropriate size (≥1000 bp) was excised and purified as before and ligated into PCR 2.1-TOPO to transform E. coli TOP 10′ cells for kanamycin selection and PCR-based insert screening using M13 forward and reverse primers as described by the manufacturer (TOPO TA cloning kit) (Invitrogen). Positive transformants were grown for plasmid preparation (miniprep kit) (Qiagen), sequencing, and analysis (version 10.0, GCG Wisconsin package, Madison, WI) to compare the newly acquired sequence with phenylalanine ammonia lyase sequences and the original partial PAL1981 gene sequence. Following verification, forward primer 1981FOR (5′-ATG GGG TTT GCC GTG GAA TCG CG-3′) and reverse primer 1981REV (5′-TCA CGC AGA TTT GTT CCA AAC ACT TTG GAA CGA CTC G-3′) were prepared to isolate the full-length gene from the original Taxus canadensis transcript pool. Reverse transcription was carried out as for the 5′-RACE procedure, except that primer 1981REV was used in place of GSP1. The full-length cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification of the single strand antisense product using the 1981FOR and 1981REV primers and Pfu polymerase (PCR conditions were essentially the same as before, except the extension time at 72 °C was increased to 4.5 min). The resulting amplicon (∼2000 bp) was gel-purified and excised as before. Heterologous Expression—For directional ligation of the full-length PAL1981 clone into pET32b(+), which was digested previously with NdeI and BamHI, sticky-end primers consisting of pair 1 (1981NDE1F (5′-TGG GGT TTG CCG TGG AAT CGC GTT C-3′) and 1981BAM1R (5′-GAT CCT CAC GCA GAT TTG TTC CAA ACA CTT TGG-3′) and pair 2 (1981NDE2F (5′-TAT GGG GTT TGC CGT GGA ATC GCG TTC-3′) and 1981BAM2R (5′-CTC ACG CAG ATT TGT TCC AAA CAC TTT GG-3′) were used to install 5′-NdeI and 3′-BamHI overhangs by a PCR method described previously (27Zeng G. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 788Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Additionally, primers 1981XHO1R (5′-TCG AGC GCA GAT TTG TTC CAA ACA CTT TGG-3′) and 1981XHO2R (5′-GCC CAG ATT TGT TCC AAA CAC TTT GG-3′) were used in place of 1981BAM1R and 1981BAM2R, respectively, to delete the stop codon and incorporate a 3′-XhoI overhang and to permit ligation into appropriately digested pET32b(+) for the expression of PAL1981 as an N-terminal His6-tagged fusion. pET vector containing the PAL1981 gene insert (designated pET1981 or pET1981His for expression as the His6 fusion) was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for ampicillin selection to provide BL21(DE3)/pET1981 or pET1981His. Positive transformants were grown for plasmid preparation, determination of proper insert orientation, and sequence verification (with T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers). For the overexpression of clone pET1981 or pET1981His, 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium (in a 3-liter flask) was inoculated with 1 ml of an E. coli culture, grown overnight, consisting of BL21(DE3)/pET1981 or pET1981His. The inoculum was grown in the medium for ∼3 h to A600 = 0.5 at 37 °C with ampicillin selection. Expression was then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactoside, and the transformed bacteria were grown for 18 h at 15 °C. Purification of Recombinant Aminomutase—The following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. After expression, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g (10 min), resuspended in 50 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and lysed by brief sonication (five 20-s bursts at 50% power (Misonix sonicator, Farmingdale, NY)) followed by removal of cellular debris by centrifugation at 45,100 × g (2 h). The supernatant was either dialyzed (using Spectra/Por 10,000-Da cut-off tubing (Spectrum, Rancho Domingez, CA)) against 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.5), concentrated (with a Stir Cell concentrator using a YM10, 10,000-Da cut-off membrane (Amicon)) to 3–5 ml without further purification, and used directly for assays, or the clarified supernatant containing overexpressed His6-tagged protein from pET1981His was purified by affinity chromatography using a His-Select nickel affinity gel (Qiagen) according to the batch procedure described by the manufacturer. The aminomutase was eluted from the affinity gel with 50 mm histidine, and then the eluant was dialyzed and concentrated as before. The protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations (∼2.5 μg/μl) were determined by the Bradford method or by Coomassie Blue staining (29Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—Typical assay mixtures contained 500 μm 2S-α-phenylalanine and 25–50 μg of enzyme and were supplemented with 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.5) to bring the volume to 500 μl. The assay mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 28 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 n NaOH (to pH >10), and the mixtures were then treated with 2.5 equivalents of acetic anhydride (undiluted) to N-acetylate the α- and β-phenylalanines. For stereochemical analysis of the β-phenylalanine product of the mutase reaction, chiral auxiliary (–)-camphanic acid chloride at 10 mg/ml in tetrahydrofuran was used in place of acetic anhydride as the acyl group donor. After derivatization, the mixture was acidified to pH 2 with HCl and extracted twice with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic fraction was treated with excess diazomethane to make the amino acid methyl esters. The organic solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was resuspended in 100 μl of ethyl acetate. A 1-μl aliquot of this material was loaded onto an HP 5HS GC column (0.25-mm inner diameter × 30 m, 0.25-μm film thickness) (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) mounted in a GC (model 6890N, Agilent) coupled to a mass selective detector (model 5973 inert®, Agilent). The GC conditions were as follows. Column temperature was programmed from 70 °C (3 min hold) to 320 °C at 10 °C/min and then a 3-min hold at 320 °C, splitless injection was selected, and helium was used as the carrier gas (1.2 ml/min). The mass detector was operated in the scan mode (50–380 atomic mass units) with 70 eV ionization potential. To calculate the isotopic abundance of the product isolated from mutase assays in which the substrates were deuterium-labeled, the ratios of diagnostic MS fragment ions (P – 1:P:P + 1) of the product were assessed by comparison with the natural abundance distribution of fragment ions of the authentic standard. Enzyme Characterization, Stereochemical Analysis, and Substrate Specificity—Assays were performed after evaluating the optimal protein concentration (1.5 μm) and reaction time between 45 min and 1 h to ensure linear reaction rates at the lowest substrate concentration. Kinetic parameters were obtained with KALEIDAGRAPH version 3.08 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) by fitting all initial rate data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression (R2 = 0.97). For determination of the pH optimum, single time point assays containing ∼50 μg of enzyme, purified by nickel affinity column chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma) and dialyzed as described, was diluted to 500 μl with 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.0 –9.0) or 25 mm CAPSO (pH 9.0 –10.5) buffer at increments of 0.5 pH units. To assess the conferred configuration at C-3 after amino group transfer from C-2 of 2S-α-phenylalanine and to track the fates of the hydrogens, (2S,3S)-[ring-2,3-2H7]-, (2SR)-[ring-2-2H6]-, (2SR,3RS)-[ring-3-2H6]-, and (2SR)-[ring-3,3-2H7]α-phenylalanines were employed as substrates at 500 μm in the standard assay. The cofactor dependence of the reactions was assessed by incubating the enzyme under standard conditions with 500 μm substrate and either ATP, S-adenosylmethionine and PLP, or PLP alone, each at 1 mm. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of PAM—Aminomutases are a subgroup of isomerases that typically catalyze the vicinal interchange of an amino group and hydrogen. These mutases cleave and form bonds during catalysis either via a radical-dependent homolytic mechanism or via an ion-dependent heterolytic mechanism. The former reaction requires pyridoxal phosphate and either cobalamin (30Rétey J. Kunz F. Arigoni D. Stadtman T.C. Helv. Chim.

Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 902-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or ATP (20Kurylo-Borowska Z. Abramsky T. Biochim. Biophys.

Soc. 1980; 102: 836-837Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or initiates mutase activity by the action of an internal electronegative MIO moiety formed autocatalytically from a conserved active site motif (Asp-Ser-Gly) and requires no external cofactors (21Christenson S.D. Liu W. Toney M.D. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6062-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The only MIO-dependent aminomutase described to date is the TAM, which shows significant homology (56% similarity) to several members of the well known ammonia lyase family but not to the cofactor-dependent aminomutases (21Christenson S.D. Liu W. Toney M.D. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6062-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PAM activity in cell-free extracts of Taxus requires no exogenous cofactors (6, Walker, K. (1997) The Use of Stereospecifically Labeled Phenylpropanoid Compounds to Determine the Steric Course of Key Reaction Steps in the Biosynthesis of Taxol, Hyoscyamine, and Cycloheptyl Fatty Acids. Ph.D. thesis, University of Washington (Seattle, WA)Google Scholar), suggesting a mechanism that is fundamentally different from that of cofactor-dependent aminomutases and more likely related to that of TAM. The evaluation of sequences in an expressed sequence tag library (23Jennewein S. Wildung M.R. Chau M. Walker K. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9149-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) derived from mRNA isolated from T. cuspidata cells (induced for taxoid biosynthesis with methyl jasmonate (10Ketchum R.E.B. Rithner C.D. Qiu D. Kim Y.S. Williams R.M. Croteau R.B. Phytochemistry. 2003; 62: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)) revealed an abundant but 5′-truncated PAL-like sequence designated PAL1981. The 5′-terminus of the partial PAL1981 was used to design primers for 5′-RACE to obtain the full-length cDNA (GenBank™ accession no. AY582743). Clone PAL1981 (shown subsequently to encode PAM, see below) has an open reading frame of 2094 base pairs, encodes a protein of 698 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 76,530 Da, and shares significant sequence homology (50–70% similarity) with several PAL and the TAM sequences deposited in the GenBank™ data base (Fig. 2). Expression, Purification, Functional Confirmation, and Stereochemical Analysis of the Recombinant PAM—PAL1981 was overexpressed as an N-terminal His6 fusion protein in E. coli BL21(DE3) and yielded approximately 10% of the target protein as inclusion bodies (as determined by SDS-PAGE) with approximately 20 mg of target protein/liter in operationally soluble form (migrating on SDS-PAGE with the expected size of ∼80 kDa). The recombinant protein was purified to near homogeneity by His-Select nickel affinity chromatography and shown to possess PAM activity by cofactor-independent conversion of α-phenylalanine to β-phenylalanine, as determined by GC-MS analysis of the derived N-acetyl methyl ester. The calculated Km value (Michaelis-Menten plotting and non-linear regression curve fitting (R2 = 0.97) (KALEIDAGRAPH version 3.08) for the recombinant enzyme was ∼45 ± 8 μm for 2S-α-phenylalanine, with a kcat value of 0.015 s–1 and a pH optimum at approximately pH 8.5, which is similar to the pH optima reported for TAM (21Christenson S.D. Liu W. Toney M.D. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6062-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and aromatic ammonia lyases (36Kyndt J.A. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). PAM seems to be highly specific for 2S-α-phenylalanine as a substrate; neither 2R-α-phenylalanine, S-α-tyrosine, nor S-α-aminocyclohexanepropanoic acid hydrate was detectably isomerized to the corresponding β-isomer by this recombinant enzyme. Furthermore, no significant change in activity was detectable when either pyridoxal phosphate, S-adenosylmethionine, or ATP, each at 1 mm, was added to PAM assays under standard conditions and compared with the activity observed in assays lacking these cofactors. Although the present data suggest that PLP is not required for catalysis, ongoing structurefunction analysis and mutagenesis of the phenylalanine aminomutase will ultimately provide additional information to investigate thoroughly whether PLP is cryptically present as a tightly bound prosthetic aldimine group situated at an active site lysine. To assign the absolute configuration of the enzymatically formed β-phenylalanine product, recombinant PAM was incubated with 2S-α-phenylalanine under standard assay conditions, and the resulting product mixture was treated with (–)-camphanic acid chloride and diazomethane to convert the amino acids to the corresponding (–)-camphanamide methyl esters for subsequent analysis by GC-MS. The sample contained an analyte with an identical retention time (21.35 min) and corresponding fragment ions, by GC-MS analysis, as that of authentic N-[(–)-ca"

Although research over the last few years has revealed the morphology and structural features of the amyloid form, knowledge about the thermodynamics of amyloid formation is limited. Here, we report for the first time a direct thermodynamic study of amyloid formation using isothermal titration calorimetry. β2-Microglobulin, a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, was used for extending amyloid fibrils in a seed-controlled reaction in the cell of the calorimeter. We investigated the enthalpy and heat capacity changes of the reaction, where the monomeric, acid-denatured molecules adopt an ordered, cross-β-sheet structure in the rigid amyloid fibrils. Despite the dramatic difference in morphology, β2-microglobulin exhibited a similar heat capacity change upon amyloid formation to that of the folding to the native globular state, whereas the enthalpy change of the reaction proved to be markedly lower. In comparison with the native state, the results outline the important structural features of the amyloid fibrils: a similar extent of surface burial even with the supramolecular architecture of amyloid fibrils, a lower level of internal packing, and the possible presence of unfavorable side chain contributions.

The increasing wealth of information accumulated in recent years has proven that the ability to form amyloid structures is a general property of the polypeptide chains. A large number of proteins and peptides have been shown to be capable of polymerization into amyloid fibrils in vitro under appropriate conditions, such as low pH, high temperature, or moderate concentrations of salts or co-solvents (1Rochet J.C.

Despite the numerous studies on protein misfolding and amyloidosis, knowledge on the thermodynamics of amyloid formation is limited. Several studies have reported the structural and thermodynamic requirements of fibril formation from the side of the amyloidogenic precursor, showing the role of the stability of the native state in the amyloidogenicity or the importance of the accumulation of intermediate states (11Chiti F.

However, it has been difficult to describe the thermodynamic properties of the amyloid form with these techniques because of the high stability of amyloid fibrils, the inhomogeneity of the aggregated samples, the irreversibility of the transitions, and problems with reproducibility.

However, we believe that the amyloid fibril formation is a reversible thermodynamic process, unless the extensive association of fibrils causes an irreversible aggregation. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a delicate method for the study of the heat effect of ligand binding to proteins or the study of protein association (23Leavitt S. Freire E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 24Lopez M.M. Makhatadze G.I. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 173: 121-126PubMed Google Scholar). Related to the problem of amyloid formation, Kim et al. (25Kim Y.S. Randolph T.W. Manning M.C. Stevens F.J. Carpenter J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10842-10850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) studied the binding of an amyloid-specific dye, Congo Red to an immunoglobulin light chain variable domain inducing partial unfolding into the amyloidogenic precursor state. Terzi et al. (26Terzi E. Holzemann G. Seelig J. J. Mol.

Holzemann G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1345-13450Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). There is great demand to explore using thermodynamic approaches the role of the different interactions such as hydration, nonpolar interactions, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges in the formation and stability of the amyloid fibrils. Here, we introduce a novel method for the direct thermodynamic study of amyloid formation by ITC. As a model system, we selected the amyloid fibril formation of β2-microglobulin (β2m), a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, a common and serious complication in patients receiving hemodialysis for more than 10 years (3Gejyo F. Yamada T. Odani S. Nakagawa Y. Arakawa M. Kunimoto T. Kataoka H. Suzuki M. Hirasawa Y. Shirahama T. Cohen A.S. Schmid K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 28Floege J. Ketteler M. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: S164-S171Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (144) Google Scholar). β2m is the light chain of the type I major histocompatibility complex and also appears in a monomeric form in the blood. In the native state, β2m adopts a typical immunoglobulin fold consisting of seven β-strands organized into two β-sheets connected by a single disulfide bridge (see Fig. 1A). The mechanism and the important factors of the in vivo amyloid formation of β2m are not yet well understood. We investigated the enthalpy (ΔH) and heat capacity (ΔCp) changes of the seed-dependent extension of β2m amyloid fibrils under acidic conditions and compared them with those of the folding of the native β2m. Protein, Amyloid Fibrils, and Seeds—Recombinant β2m was expressed and purified as described previously (29Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 1.91 × 104m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm. Amyloid fibril formation of β2m was carried out by the seed-dependent fibril extension method (30Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 31Naiki H. Gejyo F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The reaction was monitored by fluorometric analysis with ThT (31Naiki H. Gejyo F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Seeds (i.e. fragmented fibrils) were prepared by sonication of 200-μl aliquots from a 0.3 mg/ml fibril stock solution using a Microson sonicator (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY) at intensity level 2, forty 1-s pulses on ice. Estimation of the Monomeric β2m Concentration in the Fibril Solution—β2m fibrils were grown in reaction mixtures containing 0.1 mg/ml monomers and 30 μg/ml seeds at 10, 25, and 37 °C, in 50 mm sodium citrate, 100 mm NaCl (pH 2.5) buffer. The samples were incubated for 24 h, to reach fibril-monomer equilibrium. To separate the monomers from the fibrils, the samples were spun down at 40,000 rpm at the same temperatures as the extension in a CS 120GX ultracentrifuge (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min. In the case of studying solutions of low protein concentration adsorption of the protein to the surface of the vials, tubes may decrease the free protein concentration significantly and thus alter the results. To avoid the loss of the monomeric β2m component from the equilibrium fibril-monomer solution during the centrifugation through adsorption by the tube walls, the extension reactions were carried out in the centrifuge tubes providing sufficient monomers (0.1 mg/ml) at the beginning of the reactions to saturate the possible adsorption effect. The centrifugal force (60,000 × g) used is not able to sediment the monomer β2m. The monomer β2m concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a commercial immunoassay kit (Glazyme β2-microglobulin EIA test; Wako, Osaka, Japan). After separation of the monomer component, Tween 20 was added at a final concentration of 0.05% (v/v) to exclude any protein adsorption on the labware. Then 2-, 4-, 6-, and 10-fold dilution series of the samples were assayed using standard β2m solutions of 0, 50, 100, and 200 ng/ml as references. The assay presented a sensitive and quasi-linear concentration dependence in the 0–200 ng/ml range. CD Spectroscopy—Thermal unfolding of β2m was followed using a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Peltier cell holder. A quartz cell with a path length of 5 mm was used. The protein concentration was 0.06 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium citrate or 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer depending on the pH. The unfolding was followed at 220 nm using a heating rate of 30 °C/h. Calorimetry—DSC experiments were carried out with a VP-DSC instrument (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). The protein concentration was 0.3 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl. The thermal unfolding curves were analyzed using MicroCal Origin 7.0 software. ITC measurements to determine the enthalpy changes of the seed-dependent extension reaction of β2m fibrils were performed with a Microcal VP-ITC instrument. In one experimental set-up, the cell was filled with monomer β2m, and the syringe was filled with β2m amyloid seed solution. The reaction was started with a single injection of seeds into the cell at a final seed concentration of 15 μg/ml. The same buffer (50 mm sodium citrate at pH 2.5 containing 100 mm NaCl, pH 2.5) was used in both the syringe and the cell. In an inverse experimental set-up, the calorimeter cell was filled with a seed solution of 30 μg/ml. The extension reaction was initiated by the injection of monomer β2m into the cell. The concentration of monomer in the syringe was 0.57, 0.7, or 1.0 mg/ml. Experiments with five 10-μl injections were performed. 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 2.5) containing 100 mm NaCl was used in the cell. To avoid the spontaneous aggregation of β2m, no salt was used in the syringe. To remove any contamination of aggregated material, prior to the measurements all of the monomer samples in both experimental set-ups were spun down at 40,000 rpm for 30 min. Electron Microscopy—Electron micrographs of amyloid fibrils were taken as described before (29Chiba T. Hagihara Y. Higurashi T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47016-47024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thermal Unfolding of the Native State—Amyloid fibril formation of β2m is an association-induced misfolding process producing rigid amyloid fibrils with an ordered structure (Fig. 1). To discover the distinct thermodynamic properties in the amyloid state, it is important to compare the parameters of the amyloid state with those of the native state. The properties focused on are the enthalpy (ΔH) and heat capacity (ΔCp) changes of fibril formation and their contributions to the free energy change (ΔG). We first carried out the heat denaturation of the native state followed by CD at various pH values (Fig. 2A). β2m exhibited cooperative unfolding transition in the pH range 3.7–8.0. The advantage of this technique was that at a protein concentration as low as 0.06 mg/ml, the thermal unfolding of β2m was completely reversible in the pH range 5–8 and fairly reversible at pH < 5. At 37 °C, β2m is marginally stable or unstable at pH < 5, with the unfolding transition underway, so that the denatured state is significantly populated (Fig. 2A). Although the presence of intermediates in the thermal unfolding process cannot be excluded, a two-state model provided a good fitting, valuable for comparison with the amyloid formation process. The van't Hoff enthalpy changes (ΔHvH) of the unfolding transitions were calculated. The reversibility of all the samples was checked by a second scan. In the case of partly reversible transitions in the lower pH range, ΔHvH and the melting temperatures (Tm) of the second scans were found to be similar to those of the first scans within 10% and 0.5 °C, respectively. ΔHvH as a function of Tm showed a linear dependence (Fig. 2B). The slope of the fitted line provides ΔCp upon unfolding, which was found to be 5.6 ± 0.4 kJ·mol–1·K–1. To check the validity of the two-state model, we carried out a DSC measurement using 0.3 mg/ml β2m at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2C). The two-state fitting was in good agreement with the observed calorimetric curve. The calorimetric and van't Hoff enthalpy changes with a ratio of 0.98 are similar to ΔHvH obtained from the CD measurements (Fig. 2B). The reversibility determined from the calorimetric enthalpy change of the second scan was 85%. It was difficult to determine ΔCp directly from the DSC melting profile because of the slightly declining heat capacity curve after the unfolding transition, although a rough estimation of ΔCp at the melting temperature presented a similar value of 5.5 ± 1kJ·mol–1·K–1. In Table I, the main parameters of the native β2m at pH 7.0 are presented at three different temperatures.Table IUnfolding thermodynamic parameters of the native monomeric β2m and of the amyloid formTemperatureΔHΔG (native)ΔGapp (amyloid)[M]e (amyloid)-TΔSaCalculated by ΔG = ΔH - TΔS; for the amyloid form, the apparent ΔG values were used as an estimation.ΔCpbThe common values for different temperatures were obtained.NativeAmyloidNativeAmyloidNativeAmyloidkJ·mol-1kJ·mol-1kJ·mol-1nmkJ·mol-1kJ·mol-1·K-110 °C23.2 ± 5-14.2 ± 325.8 ± 1.838.4 ± 0.384 ± 102.6 ± 352.6 ± 325 °C107.2 ± 557.6 ± 223.9 ± 0.941.7 ± 0.250 ± 3-83.3 ± 4-15.9 ± 25.6 ± 0.44.78 ± 0.2137 °C174.7 ± 8124 ± 319.1 ± 0.443.9 ± 0.241 ± 3-155.6 ± 6.5-80 ± 3a Calculated by ΔG = ΔH - TΔS; for the amyloid form, the apparent ΔG values were used as an estimation.b The common values for different temperatures were obtained. Open table in a new tab Monomer-Fibril Equilibrium in the Solution—To measure the heat effects of fibril formation, we adapted the seed-dependent fibril extension method of Naiki et al. (30Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 31Naiki H. Gejyo F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) to ITC. At pH 2.5, monomeric β2m is disordered with a lack of significant amide-proton protection (32Hoshino M. Katou H. Hagihara Y. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and shows no thermal unfolding transition in the CD or DSC measurements (data not shown). The pH-dependent unfolding experiments by CD (Fig. 2, A and B) also verify this, showing that decreasing the pH to 3.75, monomeric β2m becomes unfolded even at room temperature. In the seed-dependent extension reaction at pH 2.5, fibrils are extended via the consecutive association of unfolded monomeric β2m onto the ends of the fibrils without a change in the number of fibrils (33Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The concentration of fibrils is determined by the number of seeds added to the solution to start the reaction (Fig. 1B). Although it is difficult to determine the exact number of seeds and thus the starting fibril/monomer ratio in the solution, under the conditions used in this study monomers extended the seeds resulting in 50-nm-long to 1-μm-long fibrils as also can be seen in Fig. 3. If the β2m monomer solution was free from any aggregated material, no spontaneous fibril formation occurred during the time course of the experiment. The seed-dependent extension of β2m fibrils has been validated experimentally by the following model (33Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1997; 4: 223-232Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 34Hasegawa K. Ono K. Yamada M. Naiki H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13489-13498Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar),[P]+[M]⇄k1k−1[P](Eq. 1) where [P] is the concentration of seed fibrils, [M] is the concentration of monomer β2m, and k1 and k–1 are the apparent rate constants for polymerization and depolymerization, respectively. In the equilibrium of association and dissociation.k1[M][P]=k−1[P](Eq. 2) As we can see, the equilibrium will be independent of [P] in this type of reaction, where the concentration of the fibrils (i.e. the concentration of the extendable fibril ends) does not change. We obtain the equilibrium monomer concentration (critical monomer concentration) [M]e as follows,[M]e=k−1/k1=1/K(Eq. 3) where K is the equilibrium association constant. By determining [M]e, we can obtain K. Then we can calculate the apparent free energy change (ΔGapp) of the extension reaction, i.e. ΔGapp upon the folding from the acid-denatured monomeric state into the amyloid state. To adapt the seed-dependent fibril extension to ITC, several factors had to be taken into account such as base-line stability, sensitivity of the instrument, response time of the instrument, and equilibration time of the system prior to the measurement. Among them, the evaluation of the [M]e value is essential for the set-up of the extension reaction in the calorimeter; the concentration of seeds in the monomer unit must be higher than [M]e. Otherwise, the seeds will depolymerize to monomers. To determine [M]e, extension reactions at 0.1 mg/ml β2m were carried out in the centrifuge tubes for 24 h at 37, 25, and 10 °C. Then the fibrils were removed from the solution by ultracentrifugation. The monomer concentrations of the supernatants, [M]e, which were too low to be detected by absorption, were determined quantitatively by immunoassay to be 84 nm at 10 °C, and the value decreased slightly with an increase in temperature (Table I). Although the ultracentrifugation procedure of removing the fibrils theoretically may leave small nonfibrillar oligomers in the solution, such oligomers supposed to be not involved in the seed-induced fibril extension reaction of β2m, where monomers extend the fibril ends (30Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 31Naiki H. Gejyo F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 33Naiki H. Hashimoto N. Suzuki S. Kimura H. Nakakuki K. Gejyo F. Amyloid Int. J. Exp. Clin.

Moreover, small oligomers could not be detected by analytical ultracentrifugation of β2m solutions at pH 2.5. 2J. Kardos, M. Sakai, and Y. Goto, unpublished results. The presence of such small oligomer contamination would mean that the equilibrium monomer concentration is even smaller than the value determined by the immunoassay. 30 μg/ml (∼2.5 μm β2m monomers) seed concentration, which is much higher than [M]e, was chosen for the ITC measurements of titrating the seed fibrils with monomers. We expect that our experimental conditions provide enough protein to reach the monomer-fibril equilibrium and to assure that all the injected monomers will be converted to fibrils in a rapid reaction. Fibril Extension Followed by ITC—The reaction started promptly with the addition of monomers to the seed solution or vice versa on injection of the seeds into the monomer solution. The electron microscopy image of β2m fibrils formed in the ITC cell showed typical straight amyloid fibrils, confirming the seed-dependent fibril extension (Fig. 3). Fig. 4A shows the extension reaction monitored by heat and its references when 75 μl of seed solution was injected at a final concentration of 15 μg/ml into the cell containing 0.1 mg/ml of monomer β2m solution. The areas of the peaks represent the ΔH values of the reactions. Both in the syringe and in the cell, 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 2.5) containing 100 mm NaCl was used. The net ΔH upon the amyloid formation was calculated as follows,ΔHu→f=ΔHSM−ΔHSB−ΔHBM+ΔHBB(Eq. 4) where SM, SB, BM, and BB are measurements of injections of seeds into the monomer solution (extension reaction), seeds into buffer, buffer into the monomer solution, and buffer into buffer, respectively, and normalized for the molar amount of associated monomers. The buffer to buffer effect is included in the subtracted ΔHSB and ΔHBM, so that the net effect is given by the addition of ΔHBB. The three references proved to be similar to one another and exhibited only ∼3% of ΔHu→f. The enthalpy change of the β2m amyloid fibril extension as an average of three measurements at 37 °C was –124 ± 3 kJ/mol. Fig. 4B represents ΔH of the reaction as a function of time by the integration of the ΔP peak of the reaction shown in Fig. 4A, corrected by the references. This represents the kinetics of the reaction via the enthalpy production, indicating the high accuracy and low noise of the measurement even without smoothing of the data. ΔH(t) could be fitted well by a single exponential decay with a time constant of 33 min. The slight deviation of the observed curve from the fitted curve may arise from: 1) the relatively slow response time (2–3 min) of the instrument; 2) a decreasing number of seeds (extendable fibril ends) in the long experiment by the aggregation of fibrils; and 3) the extension is not purely a single exponential for unknown reasons. Other spectroscopic methods are probably unable to point out such differences because of the larger fluctuations in the experimental data. The time course of the extension reaction was followed by ThT binding as a complementary method using the same seed and monomer concentrations (Fig. 4C). The seed and monomer solutions were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h, the approximate time needed for the equilibration of the ITC before starting the reaction. After starting the reaction, the ThT fluorescence intensity reached a maximum faster than ΔH monitored by ITC. The time constant on the basis of a single exponential decay was 12.5 min fitted for the first 40 min of the reaction (Fig. 4C). The reason might be the different sensitivity and selectivity for aggregates of the two methods. In the case of the ThT assay, a declination of the fluorescence intensity is often visible after reaching its maximum (35Kozhukh G.V. Hagihara Y. Kawakami T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Biol.

Glucose metabolism, through glycolysis and mitochondria, drives stimulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells (1Matschinsky F.M.

According to low lactate dehydrogenase activity in beta cells, glycolysis-derived electrons carried by NADH+H+ are mostly transferred to mitochondria through the NADH shuttle system. Therefore, NADH shuttles couple glycolysis to activation of mitochondrial energy metabolism, leading to insulin secretion. Moreover, low activity of NADH shuttles in beta cells has been found in type 2 diabetes models (3Novelli M. Fabregat M.E. Fernandez-Alvarez J. Gomis R. Masiello P. Mol. Cell.

In beta cells, the NADH shuttle system is composed essentially of the glycerophosphate and the malate-aspartate shuttles (5MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The respective importance of these shuttles is illustrated in pancreatic islets of mice with abrogation of NADH shuttle activities. Mice lacking mitochondrial glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase exhibit normal GSIS (6Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T.

However, additional inhibition of the malate-aspartate shuttle with aminooxyacetate strongly impairs the secretory response to glucose (6Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T.

This suggested that the malate-aspartate shuttle might play a key role in both mitochondrial metabolism and cytosolic redox state. Besides glycerophosphate and malate-aspartate shuttles, pyruvate-citrate shuttle also regenerates NAD+ necessary to maintain glycolysis. Pyruvate-citrate shuttle (7Farfari S. Schulz V. Corkey B.

In the mitochondria, NADH electrons are transferred to the electron transport chain, which in turn supplies the energy necessary to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane thereby creating a proton electrochemical gradient that drives ATP synthesis. In addition to ATP generation, mitochondrial membrane potential drives the transport of metabolites between mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments, including the transfer of mitochondrial factors participating in insulin secretion. Hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane relates to the proton export from the mitochondrial matrix and directly correlates with insulin secretion stimulated by different secretagogues (10Antinozzi P.A. Ishihara H. Newgard C.B. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11746-11755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion is limited by the inherent thermodynamic constraints of proton gradient formation (10Antinozzi P.A. Ishihara H. Newgard C.B. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11746-11755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that, in beta cells, NADH shuttles might control mitochondrial proton gradient formation upon glucose stimulation. Here, the role of the key member of the malate-aspartate NADH shuttle (see Fig. 1) was investigated for the first time in beta cells. We studied the effects of elevated aralar1 expression on glucose fate, mitochondrial activation, and insulin secretion in INS-1E beta cells and rat islets. Aralar1 (or aspartate/glutamate carrier 1, AGC1), a Ca2+ sensitive member of the malate-aspartate shuttle (11del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), was overexpressed to levels comparable with the brain by means of a recombinant adenovirus. Aralar1 and citrin are members of the subfamily of Ca2+-binding mitochondrial carriers and correspond to two isoforms of the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier (AGC1). These proteins are activated by Ca2+, acting on the external side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (11del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12Del Arco A. Agudo M. Satrustegui J. Biochem.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5060-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). We show here that Aralar1 is the isoform expressed in beta cells. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Aralar1 induced a metabolic switch, increasing glucose-induced mitochondrial activation and insulin secretion, while reducing lactate release. Cell Culture and Materials—INS-1E cells (14Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) were used as a well differentiated beta cell clone derived from the parental INS-1 cells (15Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). INS-1E cells (passages 55-80) were cultured in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in a medium composed of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (14Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium used for HEK-293 cells were obtained from Invitrogen. Reagents commonly used for the experiments were from Sigma. Secondary antibody and radioactive compounds were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and chemiluminescent reagent (Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate) from Pierce. An antibody against rat insulin was purchased from Linco (St. Louis, MO). Adenovirus Construction—Recombinant adenovirus was constructed as described previously (16Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). The expression unit to be introduced into the recombinant adenovirus was obtained from the pIRESAralar1, which contains the coding sequence of Aralar1 fused with a FLAG epitope at the C terminus and was cloned into the BamHI site of the pIRES expression vector (11del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The Aralar1 cDNA was cut with SmaI flanking the cloned Aralar1 cDNA and subcloned into the cosmid pAdCA (where AdCA corresponds to adeno-chicken actin promoter) and inserted into the unique SwaI site of the E1 substitution-type full-length adenovirus genome cloned in a cassette cosmid. The cassette bearing the expression unit was then co-transfected into HEK-293 cells together with the adenovirus DNA-terminal protein complex digested at several sites with EcoT22I. The Aralar1 insert (nucleotides 1-2060) of the previously reported mRNA (11del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) contained Aralar1 cDNA tagged in 3′ with the FLAG epitope. The presence of the insert was checked with the restriction enzyme ClaI and its correct orientation was checked by DNA sequencing. The cosmid containing the full coding sequence for human Aralar1 was called pAdCA-Aralar1. Cassette cosmid pAdCAAralar1 (8 μg) and 1 μg of the EcoT22I-digested DNA-terminal protein complex were co-transfected in a 6-cm dish using calcium phosphate (Cellfect Transfection Kit; Amersham Biosciences) in HEK-293 cells and 1 day later the cells were distributed into 96-well plates. The desired recombinant adenovirus was generated by overlapping recombination. At day 10 after transfection, the cell lysates from the selected viral clones were used to infect 24-well plates, the adenoviral DNA was extracted from these cells, and the DNA was analyzed by digestion with ClaI to check the presence of the Aralar1 insert. To amplify and purify the selected virus, the cell lysate containing the virus with full-length Aralar1 (AdCA-Aralar1) was used to infect two 138-mm dishes of HEK-293 cells. The AdCA-Aralar1 virus and the AdCA-LacZ virus (expressing the bacterial β-galactosidase and used as a control) were amplified and purified by CsCl ultracentrifugation. Adenovirus amplification was performed in HEK-293 cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 or 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Viral Treatment of INS-1E Cells—INS-1E cells were seeded in 24- or 12-well plates and cultured for 3-4 days prior to viral treatment. For infection, cells were incubated with medium containing different amounts of the recombinant adenovirus/cell for 90 min, washed, and further cultured in RPMI 1640 medium for 18-20 h before experiments to allow transgene expression. AdCA-LacZ, which expresses bacterial β-galactosidase, was used as a control adenovirus. Immunoblot Analysis—For detection of citrin and aralar1 protein, rat tissues, INS-1E cells, isolated rat islets, and FACS-sorted beta cells (17Pipeleers D.G. in't Veld P.A. Van de Winkel M. Maes E. Schuit F.C. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) were collected and lysed in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk. The membranes were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline/Tween at 22 °C. Membranes were probed with the aralar1-specific antibody overnight at 4 °C (1:2000) or anti-citrin (1:2000) (which recognize amino acids 12-343 of human aralar1 protein and 9-278 of human citrin, respectively) (11del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), before incubation for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000). The signal was detected by chemiluminescence. Immunostaining—For immunofluorescence, INS-1E cells were grown on polyornithine-treated glass coverslips for 3 days prior to infection with AdCA-LacZ or AdCA-Aralar1 for 90 min. The next day, cells were fixed as described (18Maechler P. Jornot L. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27905-27913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) before incubation with anti-aralar1 (1:200) and then goat anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:200) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) antibodies. Cells were viewed using a Axiocam microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). For mitochondrion-specific staining, living cells were incubated with 100 nm Mitotracker red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for 25 min at 37 °C and rinsed with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline before fixation. For immunofluorescence on transduced islets, rat islets were isolated and cultured for 24 h. Islets were then exposed to the adenoviruses AdCA-LacZ or AdCA-Aralar1 during 90 min. The following day the islets were either used for insulin secretion experiments or trypsinized and seeded on glass coverslips. The same day, cells were fixed before incubation with anti-aralar1 antibody (1:200) or mouse monoclonal anti-human insulin (1:1000), followed by secondary antibody labeling. Cells were viewed using Axiocam microscope. NAD(P)H Measurements—NAD(P)H generation was monitored as described (14Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) in attached cells stimulated with 15 mm glucose, after stabilization of the signal for 10 min in 2.5 mm glucose Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate Hepes buffer (KRBH, containing in mm: 135 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 NaHCO3, 0.5 NaH2PO4, 0.5 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2). Briefly, NAD(P)H autofluorescence was measured using excitation and emission filters set at 340 and 470 nm, respectively, in a plate reader fluorimeter (Fluostar Optima, BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany) at 37 °C with automated injectors for glucose (addition of 13 mm on top of basal 2.5 mm). NAD(P)H autofluorescence was normalized over a 10-min stimulation period by setting the fluorescence at 100% for cells maintained in basal 2.5 mm glucose. Maximal fluorescence changes were recorded after the addition of 5 μm rotenone used to inhibit complex-1 of the electron transport chain. Mitochondrial Calcium Concentrations ([Ca2+]m)—INS-1E cells were seeded in 24-well plates and 3-4 days later treated with AdCA-LacZ or AdCA-Aralar1 plus AdCA-mAeq adenoviruses. AdCA-mAeq enables expression of the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin targeted to the mitochondria. Twenty hours after viral treatment, cells were loaded with coelenterazine (2.5 μm) in glucose-free RPMI 1640 for 2 h, washed with KRBH, 2.5 mm glucose and the luminescence was monitored in the plate reader luminometer (Fluostar Optima) (14Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and ATP Levels—Cultured INS-1E cells were infected with AdCA-Aralar1 or AdCA-LacZ for 90 min and used for experiments the next day. Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was measured in cells previously preincubated with 10 μg/ml rhodamine-123 for 20 min at 37 °C in KRBH. The Δψm was monitored at 37 °C in a plate reader fluorimeter (Fluostar Optima) with excitation and emission filters set at 485 and 520 nm, respectively. Cellular ATP concentrations were determined in cells transduced with the AdCA-LacZ and AdCA-Aralar1 adenovirus, following a 10-min glucose stimulation, using the ATP Bioluminiscent assay kit (Roche). Glucose Utilization and Oxidation—Glucose utilization was measured in INS-1E cells as previously described (19Wang H. Maechler P. Hagenfeldt K.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6701-6713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 30 min with KRBH containing 2.5 or 15 mm glucose traced with 1 μCi of d-[5-3H]glucose (specific activity 15 Ci/mmol), then stopped on ice. Supernatants were collected, centrifuged to remove any detached cells, and 3H2O separated from d-[5-3H]glucose using a Dowex column. Proteins were determined and glucose utilization was expressed as nanomoles per mg of protein per hour. For glucose oxidation, INS-1E cells in 12-well plates were placed in a water bath at 37 °C, washed once with 1 ml of KRBH/bovine serum albumin and then preincubated for 30 min with 500 μl of KRBH/bovine serum albumin. The rate of glucose oxidation over a 2-h period was measured in attached cells as previously described (20Collins C.L. Bode B.P. Souba W.W. Abcouwer S.F. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We measured the amount of radiolabeled CO2 from cells, using [U-14C]glucose as substrate. Control incubations without INS-1E cells were run with each series. 14CO2 production was counted in an LS6500 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Glucose oxidation was expressed as percent of the basal oxidation rate at 2.5 mm glucose. Lactate and Glutamate Measurements—INS-1E cells cultured in 24-well plates were transduced with defined adenoviruses and media were changed the next day. Following a 24-h culture period, media were collected for lactate release measurements. Lactate concentrations were determined as NADH generated from NAD+ in the presence of an excess lactate dehydrogenase as described (21Everse J. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). NADH autofluorescence was monitored in a plate reader fluorimeter (Fluostar Optima) using excitation and emission filters set at 340 and 470 nm, respectively. Glutamate concentrations were determined following a 30-min incubation at 2.5 and 15 mm glucose as described previously (22Broca C. Brennan L. Petit P. Newsholme P. Maechler P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Insulin Secretion Assay—INS-1E cells cultured in 24-well plates were infected over a 90-min period with either AdCA-Aralar1 or AdCALacZ adenovirus and assayed the next day. The cells were washed and preincubated in glucose-free KRBH supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (KRBH/bovine serum albumin). Next, cells were stimulated for 30 min with different glucose concentrations, 2.5, 7.5, or 15 mm or pyruvate (in the presence of 2.5 mm glucose). Isolated rat islets were infected the day following isolation with either AdCA-Aralar1 or AdCA-LacZ adenovirus over a 90-min period and further cultured for 24 h. Then, hand-picked islets were distributed into 3-ml tubes in KRBH for the 30-min secretion assay. Insulin secretion was determined by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as standard (23Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Unless otherwise indicated, data are the mean ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Differences between groups were assessed by the Student's t test for unpaired data. Expression of Aralar1 and Citrin in Beta Cells—The expression of aralar1 and citrin was studied by immunoblot on protein extracts of adult rat tissues, INS-1E cells, isolated rat islets, and sorted beta cells. In accordance with a previous report (24del Arco A. Morcillo J. Martinez-Morales J.R. Galian C. Martos V. Bovolenta P. Satrustegui J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3313-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), there were high aralar1 levels in the brain, lower levels in kidney, lung, liver, and pancreatic islets, and hardly detectable levels in white adipose tissue (Fig. 2A). Citrin was present in kidney and liver, but also at very low levels in the lung. Aralar1 was the only isoform expressed in INS-1E cells, rat islets and, more specifically, FACS-sorted beta cells (Fig. 2B). This first set of data demonstrated that, between the two known forms of aspartate/glutamate carriers, aralar1 is the one expressed in beta cells. However, the levels of expression are lower compared with brain, another neuroendocrine tissue. This suggested the potential of increasing Aralar1 expression in beta cells within a physiological range. Aralar1 Overexpression and Subcellular Localization—The capacity of AdCA-Aralar1 to direct expression of Aralar1 in INS-1E cells was evaluated by immunoblot analysis on extracts from cells infected with AdCA-Aralar1. The conditions of infection are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoblotting revealed a band of the expected size (70 kDa) and the signal increased according to the viral titer, i.e. from 0 to 30 plaque forming units (pfu)/cell (Fig. 3D). An infection titer of 10 pfu/cell was used as optimum throughout the study. Next, we assessed the mitochondrial localization of the overexpressed Aralar1. Immunostaining with anti-aralar1 antibodies and visualization by fluorescence microscopy was carried out 20 h after transduction with the AdCA-Aralar1. The immunofluorescence (Fig. 3, A-C) revealed typical mitochondrial morphology. The presence of aralar1 in mitochondria was further confirmed by co-localization of the anti-aralar1 positive organelles with that of Mitotracker red CMXRos (Fig. 3, E-G), a mitochondrial-specific fluorescent vital dye (25Simpson P.B. Mehotra S. Lange G.D. Russell J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22654-22661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), as previously described (11del Arco A. Satrustegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Effects of Aralar1 on NAD(P)H Levels and [Ca2+]m—In beta cells, glucose-induced increases in NAD(P)H are mostly of mitochondrial origin (26Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Arkhammar P. Thastrup O. Piston D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Exposure of control INS-1E cells to stimulatory 15 mm glucose raised NAD(P)H levels (+53%, p < 0.05). Blockade of the respiratory chain complex-1 by 5 μm rotenone, used to maximally increase mitochondrial NADH, further enhanced autofluorescence and revealed the mitochondrial origin of the signal. In cells overexpressing Aralar1 glucose-induced elevations of NAD(P)H were potentiated by +37% (p < 0.05) versus AdCA-LacZ (Fig. 4A). Mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ concentrations are mostly determined by Ca2+ uniporter and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activities. Mitochondrial Ca2+ regulates NADH+H+ generating enzymes, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (27Zammit V.A. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28Hansford R.G. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As expected, glucose (15 mm) stimulation of control cells resulted in elevations of [Ca2+]m (Fig. 4B). There were no significant differences in [Ca2+]m when comparing control and aralar1 overexpressing cells. Therefore, augmentation of NAD(P)H associated with aralar1 overexpression cannot be attributed to mitochondrial Ca2+ changes. Effects of Aralar1 on Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—In control LacZ cells expressing β-galactosidase, the mitochondrial membrane was hyperpolarized by raising glucose from 2.5 to 15 mm, or by the addition of the mitochondrial substrate pyruvate (1 mm). The protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) collapsed Δψm (Fig. 5). INS-1E cells overexpressing Aralar1 exhibited marked potentiation of mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization upon glucose (15 mm) stimulation (Fig. 5A). Glycolysis and the associated NADH shuttles can be by-passed by the use of the mitochondrial substrate pyruvate. Stimulation with 1 mm pyruvate revealed no difference between the AdCA-LacZ- and AdCA-Aralar1-transduced cells (Fig. 5B). Glucose-induced ATP and Glutamate Generation in Aralar1 Overexpressing Cells—Activation of the electron transport chain, measured in Fig. 5 as the mitochondrial membrane potential, leads to the formation of ATP. Elevation of glucose from 2.5 to 15 mm glucose increased cellular ATP (+18%, p < 0.05) in control INS-1E cells (Fig. 6A). In Aralar1 overexpressing cells the -fold increase in cellular ATP concentrations upon glucose stimulation was (+36%, p < 0.01) higher compared with control cells (p < 0.05 versus LacZ). Therefore, Aralar1 overexpression amplified glucose-evoked augmentations of cellular ATP. In control cells, glutamate concentrations were increased 2.03-fold by glucose stimulation (15 mm) compared with low glucose (2.5 mm) exposure during 30 min (Fig. 6B). Aralar1 overexpression potentiated glucose-induced glutamate elevation by 23% (p < 0.05). Glucose Oxidation and Glucose Utilization in INS-1E Cells—[U-14C]Glucose oxidation was measured in cells over a 2-h stimulation period. In control cells, 15 mm glucose prompted 14CO2 production 5.1-fold (p < 0.01) versus 2.5 mm glucose. Overexpression of Aralar1 increased glucose oxidation (+33%, p < 0.05) at 15 mm glucose (Fig. 6C) compared with control cells. In AdCA-Aralar1-treated INS-1E cells, glucose utilization was not modified as measured by 3H2O formation from d-[5-3H]glucose (Fig. 7A). This suggests that the glycolytic rate was unchanged by Aralar1 overexpression. Lactate Production from INS-1E Cells—Having established the action of AdCA-Aralar1 in increasing glucose-induced mitochondrial activation as well as glucose oxidation, we evaluated the effect of Aralar1 on lactate release and insulin secretion. INS-1E cells were maintained in culture for 3-4 days, infected with AdCA-LacZ and AdCA-Aralar1, and further cultured for 20 h prior to the experiments or control of Aralar1 expression (Fig. 7B). Lactate release in the medium (containing 11.1 mm glucose) over a 24-h period was reduced by 68% (p < 0.05) in cells overexpressing Aralar1 compared with control cells (Fig. 7C). Effects of Aralar1 on Insulin Secretion in INS-1E Cells—Insulin secretion was determined over a stimulation period of 30 min (Fig. 8). In control INS-1E cells, 7.5 and 15 mm glucose caused 4.0- and 6.6-fold increases in insulin secretion, respectively, relative to a basal release at 2.5 mm glucose (p < 0.05). Transduction of INS-1E cells with the control virus AdCA-LacZ did not modify reported secretory responses of non-transduced INS-1E cells at the same glucose concentrations (14Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Cells treated with AdCA-Aralar1 exhibited 4.3- and 9.6-fold secretory responses to 7.5 and 15 mm glucose, respectively, showing that overexpression of Aralar1 modified GSIS. Indeed, at 15 mm glucose, the secretory response was increased by 45% (p < 0.01) versus control cells (Fig. 8). Next, pyruvate was used as a mitochondrial substrate by-passing glycolysis and the NADH shuttle system. Pyruvate (1 mm) stimulated insulin secretion in control cells,"
https://openalex.org/W2123022068,"Intestinal cholesterol absorption is an important regulator of serum cholesterol levels. Ezetimibe is a specific inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption recently introduced into medical practice; its mechanism of action, however, is still unknown. Ezetimibe neither influences the release of cholesterol from mixed micelles in the gut lumen nor the transfer of cholesterol to the enterocyte brush border membrane. With membrane-impermeable Ezetimibe analogues we could demonstrate that binding of cholesterol absorption inhibitors to the brush border membrane of small intestinal enterocytes from the gut lumen is sufficient for inhibition of cholesterol absorption. A 145-kDa integral membrane protein was identified as the molecular target for cholesterol absorption inhibitors in the enterocyte brush border membrane by photoaffinity labeling with photoreactive Ezetimibe analogues (Kramer, W., Glombik, H., Petry, S., Heuer, H., Schäfer, H.

The 145-kDa Ezetimibe-binding protein was purified by three different methods and sequencing revealed its identity with the membrane-bound ectoenzyme aminopeptidase N ((alanyl)aminopeptidase; EC 3.4.11.2; APN; leukemia antigen CD13). The enzymatic activity of APN was not influenced by Ezetimibe (analogues). The uptake of cholesterol delivered by mixed micelles by confluent CaCo-2 cells was partially inhibited by Ezetimibe and nonabsorbable Ezetimibe analogues. Preincubation of confluent CaCo-2 cells with Ezetimibe led to a strong decrease of fluorescent APN staining with a monoclonal antibody in the plasma membrane. Independent on its enzymatic activity, aminopeptidase N is involved in endocytotic processes like the uptake of viruses. Our findings suggest that binding of Ezetimibe to APN from the lumen of the small intestine blocks endocytosis of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, thereby limiting intestinal cholesterol absorption.

Investigations with CaCo2 cells have shown that cholesterol taken up from mixed cholesterol bile salt micelles is distributed into the brush border membrane and is moved to detergent-resistant microdomains (rafts) followed by transport from these microdomains to the endoplasmic reticulum for esterification and further assembly into chylomicron particles that are secreted by the enterocyte (11Field F.J. Born E. Murthy S. Mathur S.N. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1938-1950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that cholesterol absorption occurs by a complex process involving several proteins rather than by a single cholesterol transporter. Consequently, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in intestinal cholesterol absorption we attempted to identify the protein components of this machinery by photoaffinity labeling using photoreactive analogues of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor Ezetimibe (12Kramer W.

With photoreactive Ezetimibe derivatives we identified an integral 145-kDa membrane protein as the target protein for cholesterol absorption inhibitors in the enterocyte brush border membrane (12Kramer W.

The 145-kDa Ezetimibe-binding protein showed an exclusive affinity for cholesterol absorption inhibitors, but did not bind cholesterol or phytosterols. Vice versa, the 80-kDa cholesterol-binding protein only bound cholesterol and plant sterols without showing affinity for cholesterol absorption inhibitors. Both binding proteins have an identical tissue distribution restricted to the anatomical site of cholesterol absorption, the small intestine (13Kramer W. Girbig F. Corsiero D. Burger K. Fahrenholz F.

In the present article we localized the molecular mode of action of cholesterol absorption inhibitors to the luminal side of the small enterocyte brush border membrane and identified the 145-kDa target protein for Ezetimibe in the enterocyte brush border membrane as the ectoenzyme aminopeptidase N ((alanyl) aminopeptidase; EC 3.4.11.2; leukemia antigen CD13).Fig. 5Purification of the 145-kDa Ezetimibe-binding protein after photoaffinity labeling with the cholesterol absorption inhibitor [3H]C-1.

The uptake of [3H]cholesterol from mixed micelles by rabbit small intestinal BBMV was determined as described by Compassi et al. (25Compassi S. Werder M. Weber F.E. Bofelli D. Hauser H. Schulthess G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6643-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using mixed micelles prepared by mixing 10 μm [3H]cholesterol with a solution of 4 mm taurocholate and 0.6 mm sodium oleate in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl buffer, followed by sonification and evaporation of chloroform.

BBMV prepared from the indicated tissues were incubated with the indicated concentrations (see legends to figures) of Ezetimibe-photoaffinity probes in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm mannitol for 60 min at 20 °C in the dark followed by irradiation in a Rayonet-RPR-photochemical reactor RPR-100 (The Southern Ultraviolet Company, Hamden, CT) equipped with 4 RPR 2530-Å lamps for 30 s (C-1, C-4, C-5) or 120 s (C-2). Afterward, BBMV were diluted with 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 300 mm mannitol, 1 mm Pefabloc and washed with this buffer 3 times followed by SDS-PAGE. Solubilization of BBMV was performed at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml for 60 min at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% n-octyl glucoside, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Pefabloc (“solubilization buffer”) followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min.

After irradiation for 30 s ([3H]C-1) or 120 s ([3H]C-2) at 254 nm the samples were collected and after washing three times membrane proteins were solubilized with solubilization buffer. The supernatant containing solubilized membrane proteins was added to 0.5 ml of wheat germ lectin-agarose gel. After 60 min at 20 °C the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times with 2 ml of 10 mm PBS, 1% n-octyl glucoside. Adsorbed proteins were eluted with 4 portions of 1 ml of 10 mm PBS, 1% n-octyl glucoside, 300 mmN-acetyl-d-glucosamine each. The N-acetyl-d-glucosamine eluates were diluted to 10 ml with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside and applied to a hydroxylapatite column (self-filled, 10 cm height, 1 cm diameter; or Bio-Rad CHT-II columns) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min and collection of 1-ml fractions. Subsequently proteins were eluted as follows: 10 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1% (w/v) n-octyl glucoside followed by linear phosphate gradients in the above buffer.

After repeating this procedure twice, proteins were eluted from the streptavidin-agarose beads with 2 ml of the above buffer containing 6 mm biotin standing overnight at 4 °C, repeated with 2 ml for 1 h at 4 °C. Final purification was achieved by preparative SDS-gel electrophoresis (6% gel, 28 mm diameter, 5-cm gel length, Bio-Rad) at 500 V (40 mA, 6 W) and the eluates were fractionated into 0.6-ml fractions.

N-Acetyl-d-glucosamine eluates from wheat germ agglutinin chromatography were applied to the Ezetimibe affinity column at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min followed by elution with 10 ml of buffer and collection of 500-μl fractions. Bound proteins were eluted with 5 ml of PBS (pH 7.4), 3% Triton X-100. From all fractions aliquots were analyzed for the enzymatic activity of aminopeptidase N and sucrase as well as protein composition by SDS-gel electrophoresis. SDS-PAGE was carried out in vertical stab gels (20 × 17 × 0.15 cm) using an electrophoresis system LE 2/4 (Amersham Biosciences) with gel concentrations of 7–10.5% at a ratio of 97.2% acrylamide and 2.8% N,N-methylene bisacrylamide or in pre-casted NOVEX gels (4–12, 12, or 15%, Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) using an electrophoresis system XCell II from Novex (27Kramer W.

After electrophoresis the gels were fixed in 12.5% trichloroacetic acid followed by staining with Serva Blue R 250. For determination of the distribution of radioactivity, individual gel lanes were cut into 2-mm pieces, protein was hydrolyzed with 250 μl of tissue solubilizer Biolute S, and after addition of 4 ml of scintillator Quickszint 501 radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Western blotting and immunostaining was performed as described earlier (27Kramer W. Girbig F. Glombik H. Corsiero D. Stengelin S. Weyland C. J. Biol.

Caco-2 cells (ATCC HTB-37) were grown at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in culture medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen 41965), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen 16000), 1% l-glutamin (Invitrogen 25030), 1% nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen 11140), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Invitrogen 15140). To perform a cholesterol uptake assay, confluent Caco-2 cells from a 175-cm2 flask (BD Biosciences) were washed once with PBS (Invitrogen 14190), treated with 4 ml of trypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen 25300), resuspended in a 6-ml culture medium, and counted in a counting device (Schaerfe System, Casy TT). Cells were diluted in culture medium to a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Each well of a 24-well plate (Falcon 351147) was filled up with 1 ml of culture medium and a single cell culture insert (1.0 μm pore size, Falcon 353104). 300 μl of the Caco-2 cell suspension (300,000 cells) were seeded into each cell culture insert. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and 10% CO2 up to 21 days. During that period medium was replaced every 2–3 days. Confluent CaCo-2 cells cultivated for a further 11 or 20 days were used for the transport experiments. Cells were incubated either with culture medium (see above) (control), medium containing 150 μm of the cholesterol absorption inhibitors Ezetimibe or S 6130 and kept at 37 °C overnight. After 12 h of incubation 100 μl of mixed micelles containing 100 μm [3H]cholesterol, 4 mm taurocholate, and 0.6 mm sodium oleate in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl were added and [3H]cholesterol uptake was measured after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h of incubation. Medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with 10 mm Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.5), 300 mm mannitol, Pefabloc. After transfer to scintillation vials, 400 μl of tissue solubilizer Biolute S (Zinsser Analytic, Frankfurt, Germany) was added followed after 2 h by scintillator Picofluor 40 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and radioactivity was measured with a Wallac liquid scintillation counter. For immunofluorescence staining of CD13, CaCo-2 cells (3 days after post-confluence) were cultured on Lab-Tek™ sodium borosilicate coverslips (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). The cells were rinsed several times with Dulbecco's modified PBS (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Incubation either with vehicle (Dulbecco's PBS) or with 10 μm Ezetimibe at room temperature for 15 min was carried out before or after immunofluorescence staining of the cells with FITC-CD13 mAB. Following extensive washing the cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1) at -20 °C for 10 min and processed for confocal laser scanning microscopy according to standard protocols. Fluorescence staining was recorded at 488 nm excitation with an inverted TCS 4D confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Lasertechnik, Heidelberg, Germany), equipped with an Ar-Kr 75 mV mixed ion laser (Melles Griot Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and an acousto-optical transmission filter. Images in horizontal x-y sections were acquired by using the ScanWare instrument software. Image analysis was performed using the MetaMorph® software package (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were excised, destained (3 times for 30 min with 100 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0), and dried by acetonitrile. Gel pieces were rehydrated in 15 μl of trypsin solution (5 μg/ml) (rec., proteomics grade, Roche Diagnostics) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Peptide extracts (50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid) were pooled (3 × 30 μl), lyophilized, and reconstituted in 13 μl 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Analysis of the peptide samples was performed on a nano-ESI-LC-MS/MS system (LC Packings, Amsterdam, coupled to a LCQ Deka XP mass spectrometer, Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). 13 μl of sample were desalted on a C18 precolumn (PepMap, inner diameter 300 μm, 5-mm length); loading and washing of the sample"

Furthermore, in vitro studies have revealed that caspase-cleaved tau is more fibrillogenic than full-length tau. Considering these previous findings, the purpose of this study was to determine how the caspase cleavage of tau affected tau function and aggregation in a cell model system. The effects of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a well established tau kinase, on these processes also were examined. Tau or tau that had been truncated at Asp-421 to mimic caspase cleavage (Tau-D421) was transfected into cells with or without GSK3β, and phosphorylation, microtubule binding, and tau aggregation were examined. Tau-D421 was not as efficiently phosphorylated by GSK3β as full-length tau. Tau-D421 efficiently bound microtubules, and in contrast to the full-length tau, co-expression with GSK3β did not result in a reduction in the ability of Tau-D421 to bind microtubules. In the absence of GSK3β, neither Tau-D421 nor full-length tau formed Sarkosyl-insoluble inclusions. However, in the presence of GSK3β, Tau-D421, but not full-length tau, was present in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction and formed thioflavin-S-positive inclusions in the cell. Nonetheless, co-expression of GSK3β and Tau-D421 did not result in an enhancement of cell death. These data suggest that a combination of phosphorylation events and caspase activation contribute to the tau oligomerization process in Alzheimer's disease, with GSK3β-mediated tau phosphorylation preceding caspase cleavage.

These data suggest that a combination of phosphorylation events and caspase activation contribute to the tau oligomerization process in Alzheimer's disease, with GSK3β-mediated tau phosphorylation preceding caspase cleavage. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal cell loss, extracellular amyloid plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The relationship between these three hallmarks in the progression of Alzheimer's disease is not entirely clear; however, increased levels of Aβ42, which forms the amyloid plaques, is likely an initiating event (1Hardy J. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2003; 20: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 2Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10641) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment of cells with Aβ can result in the activation of caspases and apoptosis (3Ivins K.J. Thornton P.L. Rohn T.T. Cotman C.W. Neurobiol.

In addition to Aβ deposition, the accumulation of polymeric filaments of tau as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles is an essential feature of Alzheimer's disease brain. As a microtubule-associated protein, tau plays an essential role in maintaining microtubule stability; however, in Alzheimer's disease brain tau is aberrantly phosphorylated, and this results in an impairment of the normal functions of tau. Intriguingly, neurons from tau knockout mice are resistant to Aβ-induced toxicity, suggesting that tau plays a fundamental role in the pathogenic events that occur in Alzheimer's disease brain (14Rapoport M. Dawson H.N. Binder L.I. Vitek M.P. Ferreira A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6364-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In addition to impairing tau function, the phosphorylation of key sites on tau may also result in an increase in the fibrillogenic properties of tau, which may represent a toxic gain of function (15Abraha A. Ghoshal N. Gamblin T.C. Cryns V. Berry R.W. Kuret J. Binder L.I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3737-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the protein kinases that phosphorylate tau in vivo have not been unequivocally identified, a protein kinase that is likely to play a key role in regulating the phosphorylation state of tau is glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). 1The abbreviations used are: GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. In cell culture models there is clear evidence that tau is a substrate of GSK3β (16Johnson G.V. Hartigan J.A. J. Alzheimers Dis. 1999; 1: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Johnson G.V. Bailey C.D. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2002; 4: 375-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and in mouse models increased expression of GSK3β results in increased tau phosphorylation (18Spittaels K. Van den Haute C. Van Dorpe J. Geerts H. Mercken M. Bruynseels K. Lasrado R. Vandezande K. Laenen I. Boon T. Van Lint J. Vandenheede J. Moechars D. Loos R. Van Leuven F. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence for increased activation of GSK3β in Alzheimer's disease brain (20Leroy K. Boutajangout A. Authelet M. Woodgett J.R. Anderton B.H. Brion J.P. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 2002; 103: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Eldar-Finkelman H. Trends Mol.

Recent studies demonstrate that caspase-cleaved tau is present in Alzheimer's disease but not control brain (8Rohn T.T. Rissman R.A. Davis M.C. Kim Y.E. Cotman C.W. Head E. Neurobiol. Dis. 2002; 11: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 11Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10032-10037Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Additionally in in vitro assays, caspase-cleaved tau (i.e. tau that had been truncated at Asp-421) is more fibrillogenic than full-length tau (11Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10032-10037Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Considering these findings, the focus of the study was on determining how caspase cleavage of tau affects its ability to bind microtubules and aggregate in situ. Furthermore, the modulation of these processes by GSK3β was also examined. In these studies tau with exons 2, 3, and 10 (T4L) and tau without exons 2 and 3 (T4) were truncated at Asp-421 to mimic caspase cleavage (T4L-D421 and T4-D421, respectively). Intriguingly, both T4L-D421 and T4-D421 were not phosphorylated as efficiently by GSK3β as the full-length tau constructs both in situ and in vitro. The full-length and Asp-421-truncated tau constructs interacted with the cytoskeleton and bound microtubules to the same extent. In contrast, co-expression of GSK3β with full-length tau constructs resulted in the expected decrease in tau ability to bind microtubules, whereas the ability ofT4L-D421 and T4-D421 to bind microtubules was not affected by the presence of GSK3β. When either full-length or Asp-421-truncated tau was expressed alone, no tau was detected in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. However, when GSK3β was co-expressed with either T4L-D421 or T4-D421, there was a robust increase in the presence of tau in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction, and the tau in this fraction was phosphorylated. Furthermore, inclusions that were tau and thioflavin-S-positive were detected in cells transfected with GSK3β and T4L-D421 or T4-D421. Even in the presence of GSK3β, full-length tau was not detected in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction. In this model system expression of T4L-D421 or T4-D421 tau did not result in an increase in cell death. These data demonstrate for the first time that a combination of phosphorylation events and caspase cleavage results in formation of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau aggregates in an in situ model system. Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary cells were grown in F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 10 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were used at a confluency of 50-80% for all experiments. Plasmid Constructs—Preparation of the full-length tau construct containing exons 2, 3, and 10 (T4L) and the tau construct that does not contain exon 2 and 3 (T4) have been described previously (23Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 24Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To generate the T4L-D421 and T4-D421 constructs, T4 and T4L in pcDNA3.1(+) were used as templates, and PCR was performed using Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with forward primer 5′-CGC GGA TCC GCG ATG GCT GAG CCC CGC CAG GAG TTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTG CTC TAG AGC ATC AGT CTA CCA TGT CGA TGC TGC CGG TGG-3 to remove the last 20 amino acids of tau. Amplified fragments were digested with BamHI and XbaI and ligated into the same sites of pcDNA3.1(+). The integrity of T4L-D421 and T4-D421 was confirmed by sequence analysis. Hemagglutinin-GSK3β-S9A was constructed in pcDNA3.1(-) as described (23Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and is referred to as GSK3β throughout the text. Transient Transfections—T4L, T4L-D421, T4, or T4-D421 with or without GSK3β was transiently transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Thirty-three hours after transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then collected and processed as described below for the different assays. Immunoblotting—Cells were collected in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, and a 10 μg/ml concentration each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Lysates were sonicated on ice and centrifuged, and protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Samples were diluted with 2× SDS stop buffer (2% SDS, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) followed by incubation in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the indicated antibodies. The tau antibodies used in this study were: Tau5 (from Dr. L. Binder) and 5A6, which are phospho-independent tau antibodies (25Johnson G.V. Seubert P. Cox T.M. Motter R. Brown J.P. Galasko D. J.

Res. 1993; 34: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); and the following polyclonal antibodies from BIOSOURCE, which recognize the following specific phospho-tau epitopes: Ser(P)199, Thr(P)-205, Thr(P)-231, and Ser(P)-422. The monoclonal GSK3β antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories, and the monoclonal actin antibody was from Chemicon. After incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs), the blots were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro GSK3β Kinase Assay—Full-length (T4L) and truncated tau (T4L-D421) His-tagged constructs in pGT100/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) were generous gifts from Dr. R. Guttmann. His-tagged T4L and T4L-D421 were expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli and purified using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. For the kinase reaction, recombinant GSK3β (New England BioLabs) was incubated with the recombinant tau (0.1 μg/μl) in 30 μl of GSK3β buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP, 1.4 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP (Amersham Biosciences) at 30 °C for 5 or 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 2× SDS stop buffer and incubation in a boiling water bath for 5 min followed by separation on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were vacuum-dried, exposed to a phosphoscreen overnight, and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Separation into Soluble and Cytoskeletal-insoluble Fractions—Cell were rinsed once with warm PBS, scraped off the plate, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 μl of prewarmed extraction buffer (0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 80 mm PIPES/KOH, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 30% glycerol, pH 6.8) containing protease inhibitors (1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin pepstatin, and aprotinin) and a phosphatase inhibitor (0.5 μm okadaic acid) and incubated for 8 min at 37 °C, and the pellet (cytoskeletal-insoluble) and supernatant (soluble) fractions were separated by centrifugation (15 min at 15,000 × g and 25 °C). Samples were diluted with 2× SDS stop buffer and incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Equal amounts of pellet and supernatant factions were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted, and processed for immunodetection with anti-tau and anti-actin antibodies. Microtubule Binding Assay—The microtubule binding assay was carried out as described previously with a few modifications (23Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cells were collected and resuspended in 80 mm PIPES/KOH (pH 6.8)-containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (see above). Cell suspensions were briefly sonicated on ice and incubated on ice for 15 min. Samples were brought to 1.5 mm EGTA and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein lysate were used in each binding assay. Supernatants were adjusted to 1 mm GTP and 10 μm taxol and incubated with taxol-stabilized microtubules prepared from rat brain (31Davis P.K. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35686-35692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) for 10 min at 37 °C. The mixtures were centrifuged through 100 μl of 30% (w/v) sucrose cushions in 80 mm PIPES/KOH containing 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm GTP, and 10 μm taxol at 100,000 × g for 30 min in an Airfuge at room temperature. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μlof2× SDS stop buffer. The supernatant was diluted with 2× SDS stop buffer, and both the pellet (bound) and supernatant (unbound) fractions were incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the Tau5/5A6 antibodies. Sarkosyl Fractionation Assay—The assay was carried out as described previously with a few modifications (32DeTure M. Ko L.W. Easson C. Yen S.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1711-1722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cells were scraped off the plate, pelleted by spinning at 180 × g for 10 min, resuspended in Mes buffer (20 mm Mes at pH 6.8, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μm leupeptin), and then homogenized with 30 strokes using a tissue grinder (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ). The homogenates were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g to remove nuclei. Post-nuclear lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min to depolymerize the microtubules and then centrifuged for 30 min at 200, 000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, diluted with 2× SDS stop buffer, and incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min (soluble fraction). The pellets were resuspended in Mes buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, and 1% Sarkosyl (Sigma). The samples were vortexed for 30 min at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected in 2× SDS stop buffer (Sarkosyl-soluble fraction), and pellets were resuspended in 2× SDS stop buffer (Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction) and incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted for tau as described above. Immunocytochemistry—These procedures were modified from previously described protocols (24Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The cells were transiently transfected individually with each tau construct in the absence or presence of GSK3β using Fugene-6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent. Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed at room temperature for 1 h in fixation buffer (2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 30%(v/v) glycerol in 70 mm PIPES, pH 6.8). Cells were washed 3 times with PBS then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. After rinsing with PBS, cells were incubated in NaBH4 (10 mg/ml in PBS) for 7 min and rinsed with PBS. The cells were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min to reduce background before staining. The cells were incubated for 1.5 h with a tau rabbit polyclonal antibody (Dako Corporation) diluted in 0.4% bovine serum albumin. After extensive rinsing with PBS, the cells were incubated with Texas Red dye-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories) to visualize tau. Cells were then washed extensively in PBS before being incubated in a thioflavin-S solution (0.005%) (Sigma) for 10 min. The cells were then washed 3 times in 70% ethanol and once in water before mounting (33Sun A. Nguyen X.V. Bing G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were viewed with a Nikon Diaphot 200 epifluorescence microscope, and images were captured with a Digital spot camera (Diagnostic Instruments), digitally stored, and displayed using the accompanying software. Caspase Cleavage Assay—Chinese hamster ovary cells were transiently transfected with T4L alone or T4L and GSK3β and harvested in lysis buffer followed by incubation at 85 °C for 15 min to inactivate endogenous caspases. Protein concentrations were determined as described above, and 60 μg of total cell lysate was incubated in a final volume of 200 μl in a reaction mixture containing active recombinant caspase-3 (Calbiochem) (200 ng/ml), 20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, and 10% sucrose, pH 7.2. Incubations were carried out for 0, 5, 30, and 60 min at room temperature, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× stop buffer and incubation for 10 min in a boiling water bath. Aliquots from each sample were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the Tau5/5A6 antibodies. Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay—The release of the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase into the media was used as a quantitative measurement of cell viability. The media and cell lysate samples were collected 48 h after transfection of the tau constructs and/or GSK3β to measure levels of cell viability. The measurement of lactate dehydrogenase was carried out as described previously (34Davis P.K. Dudek S.M. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2338-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Truncation of Tau at Asp-421 Tau Attenuates GSK3β-mediated Phosphorylation—To mimic caspase cleavage, tau constructs truncated at Asp-421 (i.e. the last 20 amino acids were deleted) were made from T4L (plus exons 2, 3, and 10) and T4 (minus exons 2 and 3, plus exon 10) (11Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10032-10037Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) and are referred to as T4L-D421 and T4-D421, respectively. To determine the expression and GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of the constructs, cells were transfected with each tau construct alone or in combination with GSK3β. GSK3β-S9A (referred to as GSK3β in the text) was used in all experiments, because its activity cannot be inhibited by phosphorylation on Ser-9 (35Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of T4L or T4 resulted in a significant decrease in electrophoretic mobility in comparison to their mobility when they were expressed alone, indicating that the phosphorylation state was increased (Fig. 1A, Total tau). In contrast to what was observed with the full-length tau constructs, the electrophoretic mobility of T4L-D421 or T4-D421 decreased only slightly in the presence of GSK3β (Fig. 1A, Total tau). The extent of phosphorylation of T4L and T4 constructs by GSK3β at both the PHF1 and AT180 epitopes was substantially greater than that of T4L-D421 or T4-D421 (Fig. 1A). This was not unexpected for the PHF1 epitope (Ser-396/404) (28Otvos Jr., L. Feiner L. Lang E. Szendrei G.I. Goedert M. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) because it is in relative close proximity to the truncation site (Asp-421), and therefore, the ability of GSK3β to phosphorylate the site and/or the ability of the antibody to bind could be affected. However, it was unexpected for the AT180 epitope (Thr-231) (27Hoffmann R. Lee V.M. Leight S. Varga I. Otvos Jr., L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8114-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), which is quite distal from the C terminus. In all cases GSK3β was expressed at similar levels (Fig. 1A). To further analyze the differential phosphorylation of the full-length and Asp-421-truncated tau constructs by GSK3β, immunoblot analyses were carried out with additional phospho-tau antibodies. T4L-D421 and T4-D421 were phosphorylated less efficiently than T4L or T4 by GSK3β at Thr-205 and Ser-199 (Fig. 1B). Reactivity with the 12E8 antibody was the same in the absence or presence of GSK3β for all constructs, which was expected as Ser-262 is not phosphorylated by GSK3β (36Godemann R. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). To further evaluate the phosphorylation of tau and the Asp-421-truncated tau constructs by GSK3β, an in vitro phosphorylation assay was carried out. Recombinant T4L and T4L-D421 were incubated with recombinant GSK3β in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the extent of phosphorylation was analyzed. The representative autoradiograph shown in Fig. 1C clearly demonstrates that in vitro T4L was robustly phosphorylated by GSK3β, whereas under identical conditions T4L-D421 was phosphorylated by GSK3β to a much lesser extent. These data show that removal of the C terminus of tau at D421 diminishes the ability of tau to be phosphorylated by GSK3β. Phosphorylation of T4L-D421 and T4-D421 by GSK3β Does Not Result in a Decrease in Cytoskeletal Association—To investigate the effects of phosphorylation of either full-length tau or Asp-421-truncated tau on tau interaction with the cytoskeleton, cells were transfected with each tau construct in the absence or presence of GSK3β. The detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal component was separated from the soluble component to determine the amount of tau in the insoluble fraction relative to the amount of free tau. The insoluble fraction contains the cytoskeleton, which includes microtubules. Expression of all the tau constructs alone resulted in most of the tau being present in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 2), indicating that removal of the last 20 amino acids to mimic caspase cleavage does not alter tau interaction with the cytoskeleton. When full-length tau (T4L and T4) was co-transfected with GSK3β, tau shifted into the soluble fraction, and the amount of tau in the insoluble fraction decreased compared with when tau was expressed alone. In contrast, co-transfection of T4L-D421 or T4-D421 with GSK3β did not increase the amount of tau in the soluble fraction compared with the amount of tau in these fractions when the constructs were expressed alone (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of T4L-D421 and T4-D421 by GSK3β Does Not Result in a Decrease in Microtubule Binding—To investigate how truncation of tau at Asp-421 affects the ability of tau to binding microtubules, a microtubule binding assay was used. Supernatants from cells transfected with each tau construct alone or in combination with GSK3β were incubated with taxol-stabilized microtubules, and the amount of tau bound to the microtubules in the pellet and the amount of tau that remained unbound were measured. In the absence of GSK3β all the tau constructs showed equivalent microtubule binding. As expected, phosphorylation of full-length tau (T4L or T4) by GSK3β reduced the affinity of tau for microtubules and increased the amount of tau in the supernatant (unbound fraction) (Fig. 3). Interestingly, incubation of the Asp-421-truncated forms, T4L-D421 or T4-D421, with GSK3β did not result in"
https://openalex.org/W2026550637,"We have previously demonstrated that high concentrations of glucose stimulate insulin gene expression by causing hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin gene promoter. Furthermore, we have shown that the glucose-mediated hyperacetylation of histone H4 depends on the recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase p300 by the beta cell-specific transcription factor Pdx-1. In this study, we demonstrate that the histone deacetylases Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 are rapidly recruited to the insulin promoter in the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6 when cells are switched from high to low glucose media. Moreover, we demonstrate that the beta cell-specific homeodomain protein Pdx-1 interacts with histone deacetylases Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 at low levels of glucose. In vitro studies indicate that the interaction between Pdx-1 and Hdac-1 or Hdac-2 is direct and requires the C terminus of Pdx-1. Treatment of MIN6 cells with okadaic acid, which inhibits the activity of protein phosphatases, abolishes the interaction of Pdx-1 with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 on low levels of glucose, suggesting the requirement of a dephosphorylation event for this interaction to occur. These data indicate that insulin gene expression is decreased on low levels of glucose by recruitment of Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 to the insulin promoter by the transcription factor Pdx-1.

The production and secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells is regulated by changes in blood glucose levels, and defects in this regulatory process result in metabolic disorders such as diabetes. Insulin gene expression is up-regulated by increases in glucose concentration and involves several transcription factors including Pdx-1, 1The abbreviations used are: Pdx-1, pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1; MIN6, mouse insulinoma 6; Hdac-1/2, histone deacetylase 1/2; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ct, threshold cycle; HEK, human embryonic kidney cell; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein. 1The abbreviations used are: Pdx-1, pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1; MIN6, mouse insulinoma 6; Hdac-1/2, histone deacetylase 1/2; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ct, threshold cycle; HEK, human embryonic kidney cell; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein.

The homeodomain protein Pdx-1 is mainly expressed in the pancreatic beta cells and is required for the development and differentiation of the pancreas as well as for glucose stimulation of insulin gene transcription (6Edlund H.

Expression of Pdx-1 in the NES2Y cell line or in islets of the type 2 diabetes model Psammomys obesus, which are defective for expression of Pdx-1, restores their ability to stimulate insulin gene expression in response to increases in glucose levels (9Macfarlane W.M.

Modification of the N-terminal tails of histones by acetylation has been implicated in regulation of gene expression (13Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar). In general, hyperacetylation of histone tails is associated with increased gene expression, while hypoacetylation is associated with repression of transcription or silencing (14Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of histone deacetylase activity by treatment with trichostatin A leads to both activation and silencing of a subset of genes (15Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). Several histone acetyltransferases as well as histone deacetylases have been cloned to date and implicated in regulation of gene expression (16Goodman R.H. Smolik S.

A number of transcription factors, including NFkB and the muscle-specific transcription factor MEF2 have been shown to interact with both the histone acetyltransferases and decacetylases (18Zhong H.

However, the exact mechanisms that determine the interaction of a specific transcription factor with various histone-modifying enzymes are for the most part unknown. Histone deacetylases are divided into three different classes based on their homology, and Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 belong to the class I histone deacetylases together with Hdac-3 and Hdac-8 (17Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 22Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The class I histone deacetylases are ∼400–500 amino acid long and localized primarily to the nucleus. Histone deacetylases exist as large protein complexes, and Hdac-1/Hdac-2 have been shown to associate with co-repressor complexes Sin3A and Mi-2/NuRD (17Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 22Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell.

The presence of histone deacetylases in distinctive complexes with different transcription factors appears to contribute to their diverse biological activities. Multiple studies indicate that the histone deacetylase Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 contain several different post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and sumoylation (24Galasinski S.C. Resing K.A. Goodrich J.A. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19618-19626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25David G. Neptune M.A. DePinho R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, the exact role of these post-translational modifications in regulating the function and activity of these enzymes, and the tissue specificity of these modifications is unknown. The beta cell-specific transcription factor Pdx-1 has been previously shown to interact with the histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP, and this interaction has been demonstrated to be important for insulin gene expression (26Asahara H. Dutta S. Kao H-Y. Evans R.M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8219-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell.

We have recently demonstrated that induction of insulin gene expression by high concentrations of glucose involves the hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin gene promoter (29Mosley A.L. Özcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19660-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At low levels of glucose, insulin gene expression is down-regulated, which correlates with deacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin promoter. In this report, we demonstrate that the beta cell-specific transcription factor Pdx-1 interacts with histone deacetylases Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 at low levels of glucose. Furthermore, Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 are associated with the insulin promoter only when glucose levels are low. Therefore, it is likely that Pdx-1 recruits Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 to the insulin gene promoter to cause deacetylation of histone H4 and down-regulation of insulin gene expression when glucose levels are low. Cell Culture—Mouse insulinoma-6 (MIN6) cells of passage 22 through 30 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle media (DMEM) containing 5 mm glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol (30Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinol. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). For the glucose regulation experiments, MIN6 cells were grown overnight in DMEM with 5 mm glucose and then washed three times with 1× PBS and transferred to 3 or 30 mm glucose containing medium without serum for 2 h unless otherwise indicated. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Chromatin isolation was performed as previously published (29Mosley A.L. Özcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19660-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 31Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation in ChIP assays were Hdac-1 (sc-7872), Hdac-2 (sc-7899), and p300 (sc-584) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, tetraacetyl histone H4 from Upstate Biotech and Pdx-1 antibodies (gift from Dr. Chris Wright, Vanderbilt University). All PCR reactions were performed on a Robocycler Gradient 96 (Stratagene) in a 20-μl reaction volume as described previously (29Mosley A.L. Özcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19660-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The linear range for each primer pair was determined empirically, using different cycle numbers and by real-time PCR using the instrument Mx4000 (Stratagene). The primers used are GAAGGTCTCACCTTCTGG and GGGGGTTACTGGATGCC for the mouse insulin I promoter (from –10 to –281). PCR reactions were performed at least three independent times for each sample. The PCR products obtained with the immunoprecipitated DNA were normalized to the products obtained with the total input DNA. The bands were visualized using a ChemiDoc System Imager (Bio-Rad). The PCR products obtained had the expected molecular size, and their identity was confirmed by sequencing. Real-time PCR—The association of acetylated histone H4, Hdac-1, Hdac-2, p300, and Pdx-1 with the mouse insulin I promoter in cells incubated with 3 or 30 mm glucose was determined using the ChIP assay and quantified using real-time PCR with Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The primers used to amplify the insulin promoter are described above and were used at a final concentration of 150 nm. Real-time PCR reactions were performed on a Stratagene Mx4000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The threshold cycle (Ct) value for each PCR reaction was determined as the cycle at which the fluorescence was ten times higher that the mean of background levels. Real-time PCR data were analyzed as described previously (32Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 33Christenson L.K. Stouffer R.L. Strauss 3rd., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27392-27399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, to quantify the association of the various proteins with the insulin I promoter, a ΔCt value was calculated for each sample by subtracting the Ct value for the input (total DNA) from the Ct value obtained with the immunoprecipitated sample as template. The obtained ΔCt value for the samples immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies was subtracted from the ΔCt value of samples immunoprecipitated with rabbit IgG as control to give ΔΔCt. Fold differences were calculated using the formula 2ΔΔCt, since one cycle difference is equivalent to a 2-fold difference in amplification. Each sample was quantified in duplicate from three independent immunoprecipitations. A melt curve analysis was performed for each sample after PCR amplification to ensure that the melting curve characteristics were consistent with the presence of a single PCR product. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Co-immunoprecipitation Assay— Whole cell extracts from MIN6 cells incubated with 3 or 30 mm glucose were prepared as described previously using 1% Nonidet P-40 for lysis of the cells (28Mosley A.L. Corbett J.A. Özcan S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The extracts used in the co-immunoprecipitation assays were prepared in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation, the obtained supernatant was diluted with 4 volumes of dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitation with Pdx-1, Hdac-1 (sc-7872), Hdac-2 (sc-7899), and c-Myc (E910) antibodies was carried out overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) for 1–2 h. The pellets were washed six times in 1 ml of Wash buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) and resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. Rabbit or mouse IgG (Sigma) was used as a negative control for nonspecific binding. Proteins were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and Purification of His6-Pdx-1 and Hdac-1/2-GST Recombinant Proteins—The Hdac-1-GST and Hdac-2-GST constructs were kindly provided by Edward Seto, University of South Florida (34Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). For expression and purification of recombinant proteins, Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) R/L cells expressing the various proteins were cultured in 1 liter of TB medium at 37 °C to a density of about 0.6 at 600 nm, and expression of the recombinant proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. After harvesting the cells by centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by passage through a French press. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 2 h, and the obtained supernatant was applied on Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) to purify His6-Pdx-1 and washed with 15 bed volumes of the lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The His6-Pdx-1 protein was eluted from the resin with a gradient, starting at 20 mm imidazole and ending at 500 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. The Hdac-1-GST and Hdac-2-GST were expressed using the same procedure. The lysis buffer used was: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. GST fusion proteins were purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column and by eluting with a gradient starting at 1 mm and ending at 25 mm glutathione. The eluate was dialyzed against 1× PBS containing 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein concentration and purity was determined by separating the eluted proteins on 10% SDS-PAGE together with a bovine serum albumin standard (Promega) and by staining with Coomassie Blue (Sigma). In Vitro Interaction Assays—For pull-down experiments, 100 ng of recombinant GST proteins were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. After washing the beads four times with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2), 100 ng of the indicated His6-tagged proteins were added and incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed four times with binding buffer, and the proteins were subsequently eluted from the beads by boiling them for 10 min in 1× SDS loading buffer. The reverse pull-down experiments were performed using the same procedure but by incubating 100 ng of recombinant His6-Pdx-1 with Ni-NTA agarose. For these experiments the binding buffer also included 20 mm imidazole. Production of Recombinant Adenoviruses—The full-length Pdx-1 or Pdx-1Δ1–79 adenovirus, which lacks the first 79 N-terminal amino acids containing the activation domain, was constructed using the AdEasy adenoviral system as described previously (35Mosley A.L. Özcan S. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 83: 73-79PubMed Google Scholar, 36He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). To generate the Pdx-1 or Pdx-1Δ1–79 recombinant virus, the full-length mouse Pdx-1 cDNA or Pdx-1 lacking the first 237 bp was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pACCMV-myc vector in-frame with a triple Myc tag as BamHI/SalI fragment. The resultant plasmids were cut with HindIII to relieve Pdx-1 or Pdx-1Δ1–79 fused to Myc, and subcloned into the HindIII site of the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV (36He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The obtained plasmids were co-transformed into E. coli BJ5183 cells with pAdEasy-1 plasmid containing the adenoviral genome. After recombination in bacteria, the obtained plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH5α cells and the prepared plasmid DNA was linearized and used to transfect HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The HEK 293 cell lysate was used for additional viral amplification by several rounds of infection of HEK 293 cells. MIN6 cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 80–100 using a 2-h exposure to the adenovirus (35Mosley A.L. Özcan S. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 83: 73-79PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) Activity—Histone deacetylase activity associated with Pdx-1 or the dominant negative Pdx-1 protein was determined by incubating about 1 mg of MIN6 total cell extract with 2 μg of either mouse IgG, or c-Myc antibodies overnight. After addition of 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose, the mixture was incubated on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 1 h. The protein A-Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed four times with 1 ml of 1× PBS and resuspended in 40 μl of assay buffer. Histone deacetylase activity was quantified using the HDAC fluorescent activity Assay/Drug Discovery Kit (AK-500; BIOMOL Research Laboratories). Briefly, the immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with 100 μm acetylated substrate in 100 μl of assay buffer for 30 min at 37 °C and quantified using a fluorometer (excitation at 360 nm and emission at 450 nm) (37Heltweg B. Jung M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This assay system allows detection of a fluorescent signal upon deacetylation of a histone substrate when treated with developer (37Heltweg B. Jung M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 302: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Histone Deacetylases Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 Are Recruited to the Insulin Gene Promoter in the Presence of Low Concentrations of Glucose—We have previously shown that high concentrations of glucose stimulate insulin gene expression by causing the hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin gene promoter (28Mosley A.L. Corbett J.A. Özcan S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Mosley A.L. Özcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19660-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Exposure to low concentrations of glucose triggered the deacetylation of histone H4, which correlated with decreased insulin gene expression. Treatment with trichostatin A, which inhibits histone deacetylase activity, led to increased histone H4 acetylation and insulin gene expression even at low concentrations of glucose (29Mosley A.L. Özcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19660-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These data suggested a role for histone deacetylases in insulin gene expression at low (3 mm) glucose. To test this idea, we analyzed the recruitment of the Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 and the histone acetyltransferase p300 to the insulin gene promoter using the ChIP assay in the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6 incubated with low (3 mm) concentrations of glucose. For this purpose, the MIN6 cells were grown overnight on high (30 mm) glucose and shifted to 3 mm glucose for 30 min and used for ChIP assays with Hdac-1, Hdac-2, or p300 antibodies (Fig. 1A). We found that at time 0, the histone acetyltransferase p300 was present at the insulin gene promoter as observed previously (28Mosley A.L. Corbett J.A. Özcan S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After 30 min of exposure to low glucose concentrations, the amount of p300 at the insulin promoter decreased (Fig. 1A). The association of Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 with the insulin gene promoter was observed only 30 min after exposure to 3 mm glucose (Fig. 1A). The recruitment of Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 to the insulin promoter was confirmed using real-time PCR by amplifying the mouse insulin I promoter and correlated with the deacetylation of histone H4 (Fig. 1B). Since Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 are recruited to the insulin promoter only in the presence of low levels of glucose, we analyzed whether the abundance of these proteins was regulated by glucose. Extracts from MIN6 cells incubated with 3 or 30 mm glucose were used for immunoblotting with Hdac-1 or Hdac-2 and β-actin antibodies. We found that the levels of Hdac-1 or Hdac-2 were similar on 3 and 30 mm glucose (Fig. 1C). Pdx-1 Interacts with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 in a Glucose-dependent Manner in Vivo—Since the beta cell-specific transcription factor Pdx-1 is one the major players in glucose regulation of insulin gene transcription, we tested whether Pdx-1 is able to interact with the histone deacetylases Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 in vivo in a glucose-dependent fashion by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Extracts from MIN6 cells incubated with 3 or 30 mm glucose were prepared and used in co-immunoprecipitation experiments with Pdx-1 or Hdac-1/2 antibodies. Western blot analysis of proteins from Pdx-1 immunoprecipitates with Hdac-1 or Hdac-2 antibodies indicated that these proteins co-immunoprecipitate with Pdx-1 (Fig. 2A, upper panel). The interaction of Pdx-1 with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 was much stronger in the presence of low concentrations (3 mm) of glucose. Similar results were obtained in co-immunoprecipitation experiments with antibodies against Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 and by immunoblotting with Pdx-1 antibodies (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Since Pdx-1 interacts with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 mainly on low levels glucose, we determined the in vivo association of Pdx-1 with the insulin promoter on low or high concentrations of glucose using the ChIP assay with Pdx-1 antibodies (Fig. 2B). As previously reported, Pdx-1 is bound to the insulin promoter under both low and high levels of glucose (28Mosley A.L. Corbett J.A. Özcan S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo binding of Pdx-1 to the insulin promoter was increased by about 2-fold on 30 mm compared with 3 mm glucose in six independent experiments (Fig. 2B). We did not obtain any PCR products when rabbit IgG was used for immunoprecipitation or with primers that amplify the PEPCK promoter in Pdx-1 or IgG immunoprecipitated DNA samples (Fig. 2B). The PEPCK promoter serves as a negative control, since Pdx-1 does not bind to this promoter in vivo. Pdx-1 Interacts with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 in Vitro—In order to determine whether the interaction between Pdx-1 and the histone deacetylases Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 was direct, recombinant His6-Pdx-1, Hdac-1-GST, and Hdac-2-GST were produced and purified from bacteria. Approximately 100 ng of His6-Pdx-1 was incubated with equal concentrations of either Hdac-1-GST or Hdac-2-GST as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Pull-down assays were performed by adding Ni-NTA or glutathione beads to the reaction mixture. Pdx-1 was able to interact with both Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 in vitro and there was no interaction between Pdx-1 and GST alone (Fig. 3). These data indicate that Pdx-1 interacts with the histone deacetylase Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 directly. Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 Interact Constitutively with a Dominant Negative Form of Pdx-1—In order to determine whether the interaction of Pdx-1 with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 requires the activation domain of Pdx-1, MIN6 cells were infected with an adenovirus, which expresses an N-terminal-truncated version of Pdx-1 that lacks the first 79 amino acids containing the activation domain (Pdx-1Δ1–79). This truncated protein acts as a dominant negative, because it competes with the endogenous Pdx-1 for binding to the insulin promoter but is unable to activate transcription. The truncated Pdx-1 protein was tagged with a triple human c-Myc epitope at the C terminus. To test the interaction of Pdx-1Δ1–79 with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2, extracts from MIN6 cells incubated with 3 or 30 mm glucose were immunoprecipitated with human c-Myc, Hdac-1, or Hdac-2 antibodies. Western blot analysis of extracts immunoprecipitated with c-Myc antibodies revealed that Pdx-1Δ1–79 was able to interact with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 constitutively independent of the glucose concentration compared with the full-length Pdx-1 protein, which displayed interaction mainly on low glucose (Fig. 4A). Like the full-length Pdx-1, recombinant His6-Pdx-1Δ1–79 was able to interact with both, Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 in in vitro experiments (Fig. 4B). In support of the presented data, histone deacetylase activity associated with the full-length Pdx-1 was more than 4-fold higher in cells incubated with 3 versus 30 mm glucose (Fig. 4C). Moreover, in MIN6 cells overexpressing the dominant negative Pdx-1 protein, histone deacetylase activity associated with Pdx-1Δ1–79 was similar on 3 versus 30 mm glucose and was higher than that observed with the full-length Pdx-1 (Fig. 4C). The histone deacetylase activity associated with full-length and truncated Pdx-1 protein was determined by immunoprecipitation with the N-terminal Pdx-1 (deleted in Pdx-1Δ1–79) and c-Myc antibodies, respectively. The Interaction between Pdx-1 and Hdac-1 or Hdac-2 Is Regulated by a Dephosphorylation Event—Our previous data indicate that a phosphorylation event regulates the interaction of Pdx-1 with the histone acetyltransferase p300 in response to high concentrations of glucose and that treatment with okadaic acid causes a constitutive interaction of Pdx-1 with p300 (28Mosley A.L. Corbett J.A. Özcan S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Based on these data we speculated that high concentrations of glucose disrupt the interaction of Pdx-1 with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2, but causes the association of Pdx-1 with p300. To test the idea that a dephosphorylation event is required to mediate the interaction of Pdx-1 with Hdac-1/2, we incubated MIN6 cells in low glucose-containing media in the presence or absence of the 100 nm okadaic acid. After lysis of the cells, the extracts were used to immunoprecipitate Pdx-1 and the presence of Hdac-1 or Hdac-2 in Pdx-1 immunoprecipitates was detected by using antibodies against Hdac-1 or Hdac-2. The interaction between Pdx-1 and Hdac-1/2 was disrupted by treatment with okadaic acid (Fig. 5), suggesting the idea that a dephosphorylation event is required to enable the interaction of Pdx-1 with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2. Previous data indicate that Pdx-1 changes its subcellular localization in response to different concentrations of glucose (28Mosley A.L. Corbett J.A. Özcan S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 38Rafiq I. Kennedy H.J. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23241-23247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39Elrick L.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2244-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). At high levels of glucose, Pdx-1 is localized mainly to the cytoplasm and nuclear periphery and in response to low glucose it translocates to the nucleoplasm. Both, Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 appear to be localized to the nucleoplasm in the MIN6 cell line independent of the glucose concentration (data not shown). Modification of N-terminal tails of histones by acetylation has been correlated with increased gene expression (13Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar, 14Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that glucose induces insulin gene expression by causing hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin gene promoter (29Mosley A.L. Özcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19660-19666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that the hyperacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin promoter by high glucose requires the recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase p300 via its interaction with the beta cell specific transcription factor Pdx-1 (28Mosley A.L. Corbett J.A. Özcan S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that Pdx-1 interacts also with the histone deacetylases Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 in vivo mainly at low levels of glucose. The interaction of Pdx-1 with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 is disrupted by treatment with okadaic acid, which inhibits protein phosphatases such as PP1 and PP2A (40Maynes J.T. Bateman K.S. Cherney M.M. Das A.K. Luu H.A. Holmes C.F. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44078-44082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 are recruited to the insulin promoter when cells are switched from high to low levels of glucose and may be responsible for the hypoacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin promoter. Based on these and our previous data, we propose that at high concentrations of glucose, a phosphorylation event stimulates the interaction of Pdx-1 with the histone acetyltransferase p300, which becomes recruited to the insulin promoter and causes hyperacetylation of histone H4 at this promoter leading to up-regulation of insulin gene transcription (Fig. 6). At low levels of glucose, a dephosphorylation event causes Pdx-1 to dissociate from p300 and to interact with the histone deacetylases Hdac-1 and Hdac-2. Recruitment of Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 to the insulin promoter at low levels of glucose leads to hypoacetylation of histone H4, resulting in down-regulation of insulin gene expression (Fig. 6). Consistent with the idea that Pdx-1 regulates in insulin gene expression under low and high concentrations of glucose, Pdx-1 is associated with the insulin promoter in vivo under both conditions. However, the binding of Pdx-1 to the insulin promoter is about 2-fold increased in response to high glucose levels. It is possible that the association of Pdx-1 with the insulin promoter is enhanced by its interaction with the histone acetyltransferase p300. Alternatively, the initial acetylation of histone H4 at the insulin promoter may stabilize the binding of Pdx-1. Several other transcription factors have been shown to interact with both histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases in a regulated manner. The interaction of MyoD with Hdac-1 in undifferentiated cells represses the expression of muscle-specific genes (41Puri P.L. Iezzi S. Stiegler P. Chen T-T. Schiltz R.L. Muscat G.E. Giordano A. Kedes L. Wang J.Y. Sartorelli V. Mol. Cell. 2001; : 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). On the other hand, association of MyoD with the histone acetyltransferases p300 and PCAF is important for myogenesis (42Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. Yang X.J. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V.V. Howard B.H. Kedes L. Wang J.Y. Graessmann A. Nakatani Y. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) interacts with the histone deacetylases Hdac-1 (43Canettieri G. Morantte I. Guzman E. Asahara H. Herzig S. Anderson S.D. Yates 3rd, F.R. Montminy M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) as well as with the histone acetyltransferases CBP and p300 when it is phosphorylated (44Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 45Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the N-terminal activation domain of Pdx-1, which is required for its interaction with the histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP (26Asahara H. Dutta S. Kao H-Y. Evans R.M. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8219-8225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 27Qiu Y. Guo M. Huang S. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), is not essential for its interaction with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 in vitro as well as in vivo. Although several proteins have been shown to interact with Pdx-1 via its N-terminal activation domain, so far only one protein called PCIF1 has been identified to interact with Pdx-1 via its C terminus (46Liu A. Desai B.M. Stoffers D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4372-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that PCIF1 inhibits the ability of Pdx-1 to activate transcription (46Liu A. Desai B.M. Stoffers D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4372-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether PCIF1 is in a complex with Pdx-1 and Hdac-1/2. It also remains to be determined whether PCIF1 is able to interact with the histone deacetylases Hdac-1/2. Treatment of MIN6 cells with okadaic acid, which inhibits the activity of the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, disrupts the localization of Pdx-1 to nuclear periphery (28Mosley A.L. Corbett J.A. Özcan S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2279-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 38Rafiq I. Kennedy H.J. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23241-23247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39Elrick L.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2244-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and also inhibits its interaction with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 on low levels of glucose. Therefore it is possible that the localization of Pdx-1 to nuclear periphery is important for its interaction with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2. Alternatively, the localization of Pdx-1 to nuclear periphery and its interaction with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 at low concentrations of glucose may be independent processes, because Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 appear to be localized to the nucleoplasm independent of the glucose concentration (data not shown). Nevertheless, both the localization of Pdx-1 to nuclear periphery and its interaction with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 at low levels of glucose requires a dephosphorylation event. It is likely that Pdx-1 becomes phosphorylated at high concentrations of glucose which enables it to interact with the histone acetyltransferase p300 to up-regulate insulin gene expression (Fig. 6). At low concentrations of glucose, dephosphorylation of Pdx-1 may cause its dissociation from p300 and promote its interaction with Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 to down-regulate insulin gene expression (Fig. 6). In agreement with this proposed mechanism, we found that Pdx-1 is a phosphoprotein, however Pdx-1 appears to be phosphorylated independent of glucose levels (data not shown). It is likely that Pdx-1 becomes phosphorylated at different residues depending on the concentration of glucose, which may determine its interaction with p300 or Hdac-1/2. However, it is also possible that exposure to low levels of glucose causes the dephosphorylation of Hdac-1 and Hdac-2, which may promote their interaction with Pdx-1. Indeed, previous data indicate that Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 are phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2, which disrupts the complex formation between Hdac-1 and Hdac-2 with the co-repressor Sin3 (24Galasinski S.C.

Interestingly, like Pdx-1, the transcription factor CREB interacts with both histone acetyltransferases such as CBP and p300 as well as histone deacetylase Hdac-1. Phosphorylation of CREB by PKA at Ser-133 stimulates its interaction with histone acetyltransferases (44Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 45Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), while association of Hdac-1 with CREB in unstimulated cells, blocks the phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133 (43Canettieri G. Morantte I. Guzman E. Asahara H. Herzig S. Anderson S.D. Yates 3rd, F.R. Montminy M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that in unstimulated cells, Hdac-1 promotes the dephosphorylation of CREB by forming a stable complex with protein phosphatase PP1 (43Canettieri G. Morantte I. Guzman E. Asahara H. Herzig S. Anderson S.D. Yates 3rd, F.R. Montminy M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since okadaic acid is an inhibitor of PP1, it is possible that on low levels glucose, the interaction of Hdac-1 with Pdx-1 may stimulate the dephosphorylation of Pdx-1 and thereby disrupt its interaction with the histone acetyltransferase p300. As shown for the transcription factor CREB, association of Pdx-1 with Hdac-1 and PP1 or PP2A could result in coordinated dephosphorylation of Pdx-1 and deacetylation of histone H4 at the insulin promoter at low levels of glucose. This would result in down-regulation of insulin gene expression at low concentrations of glucose.

https://openalex.org/W2051282579,"The oxidative refolding of reduced, denatured hen egg white lysozyme in the presence of a mixed macromolecular crowding agent containing both bovine serum albumin (BSA) and polysaccharide has been studied from a physiological point of view. When the total concentration of the mixed crowding agent is 100 g/liter, in which the weight ratio of BSA to dextran 70 is 1:9, the refolding yield of lysozyme after refolding for 4 h under this condition increases 24% compared with that in the presence of BSA and 16% compared with dextran 70. A remarkable increase in the refolding yield of lysozyme by a mixed crowding agent containing BSA and Ficoll 70 is also observed. Further folding kinetics analyses show that these two mixed crowding agents accelerate the oxidative refolding of lysozyme remarkably, compared with single crowding agents. These results suggest that the stabilization effects of mixed macromolecular crowding agents are stronger than those of single polysaccharide crowding agents such as dextran 70 and Ficoll 70, whereas the excluded volume effects of mixed macromolecular crowding agents are weaker than those of single protein crowding agents such as BSA. Both the refolding yield and the rate of the oxidative refolding of lysozyme in these two mixed crowded solutions with suitable weight ratios are higher than those in single crowded solutions, indicating that mixed macromolecular crowding agents are more favorable to lysozyme folding and can be used to simulate the intracellular environments more accurately than single crowding agents do.

The main question that protein folding encountered in vivo is that the intracellular environment is highly crowded because of the presence of high concentrations of soluble and insoluble macromolecules, which include proteins, nucleic acids, ribosomes, and carbohydrates (polysaccharides) (1Fulton A.B.

It has been estimated that the concentration of macromolecules in cytoplasm is in the range of 80–400 g/liter (3Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Sci. 1998; 23: 190-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These media are termed “crowded” or “volume-occupied” rather than “concentrated” (7Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 8Hall D. Minton A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1649: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The biophysical theory of macromolecular crowding has been well developed by a thermodynamic approach (2Zimmerman S.B. Minton A.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 27-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 8Hall D. Minton A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1649: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 9Minton A.P. Biophys.

A. 1992; 89: 10504-10506Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The effect of excluded volume upon protein stability and conformation has been discussed using a simplified statistical thermodynamic model (11Minton A.P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 101-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). One pertinent prediction of this model is that intramolecular excluded volume will increase the chemical potential of the unfolded state relative to that of the native or compact non-native state, resulting in a relative stabilization of the native or compact non-native state relative to a fully unfolded state (12Sasahara K. McPhie P. Minton A.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Most of our knowledge about protein folding comes from biophysical studies of the refolding of pure denatured proteins at low concentrations in simple defined buffers carried out in the past three decades since the pioneering studies of Anfinsen (13Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar). However, intracellular environments differ much from test tubes because of the presence of macromolecular crowding. Crowding can be mimicked experimentally by adding high concentrations of inert synthetic or natural macromolecules, termed crowding agents or crowders, to the system in vitro (3Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 14Ellis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). In recent years it has gradually become recognized that macromolecular crowding can considerably alter the reactivity of individual macromolecules, both qualitatively and quantitatively. van den Berg et al. (15van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that refolding of oxidized lysozyme is hardly affected by crowding, whereas correct folding of reduced lysozyme is essentially abolished because of aggregation at high concentration of crowding agents in the absence of 2 m urea. Further kinetic analyses have suggested that under conditions resembling the intracellular environment, the rates of many protein folding processes are likely to be altered (16van den Berg B. Wain R. Dobson C.M. Ellis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3870-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Galan et al. (17Galan A. Sot B. Llorca O. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 957-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have reported that crowding modulates the oligomerization of GroEL subunits by increasing the tendency of refolded, monomeric GroEL to undergo self-association at equilibrium and modifying the relative rates of the two competing self-association reactions. Li et al. (18Li J. Zhang S. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34396-34401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have shown that the refolding of G6PDH changes from mono-phasic to biphasic first order reactions in the presence of crowding agents.

A. 2001; 98: 3150-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) have indicated that in the presence of high concentrations of crowders, both the weight average degree of FtsZ self-association and the range of FtsZ oligomer sizes present in significant abundance are increased substantially.

The experimental work of Eclock (21Elcock A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2340-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the efficient operation of the GroEL-GroES chaperonin machinery is sensitive to the presence of macromolecular crowding agents. The result from Sasahara et al. (12Sasahara K. McPhie P. Minton A.P. J. Mol.

Very recently, Tokuriki et al. (22Tokuriki N. Kinjo M. Negi S. Hoshino M. Goto Y. Urabe I. Yomo T. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) have found that the unfolded state of RNase A becomes native in conformation and compactness by the addition of a high concentration of macromolecular crowding agents. During the past decade, the effects of macromolecular crowding on the folding of several proteins have been extensively studied as described above, but it seems that the excluded volume effect on protein folding is very complex and diverse and depends on the nature of proteins, interactions, and crowding agents (18Li J. Zhang S. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34396-34401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). At present, it is not fully established which crowding agents simulate the intracellular environments most accurately, although the qualitative effects of macromolecular crowding on the refolding of lysozyme are not critically dependent on the nature of crowding agents employed (15van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Very recently, a workshop on macromolecular crowding (23Rivas G. Ferrone F. Herzfeld J. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) organized by John Ellis, Allen Minton, and Germán Rivas has demonstrated that many questions still need to be answered for a better understanding of the biological implications of macromolecular crowding. Two of the questions are whether high concentrations of “inert” macromolecules provide a good (valid) simulation of interior cells and whether there is a perfect crowder (23Rivas G. Ferrone F. Herzfeld J. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To illuminate the complex macromolecular architecture in eukaryotic cells (24Medalia O. Weber I. Frangakis A.S. Nicastro D. Gerisch G. Baumeister W. Science. 2002; 298: 1209-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) and answer the questions brought forward by the workshop, we added both protein crowding agent and polysaccharide to the refolding buffer, which is termed as “mixed crowding agents,” and tested the effect of such mixed macromolecular crowding on protein folding from a physiological point of view. Lysozyme is a small single chain protein which has been studied in detail in vitro both under conditions where the native disulfide bonds are maintained throughout the refolding reaction and under oxidative conditions (25Chaffotte A.F.

Biol. 1999; 290: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In contrast to the oxidized lysozyme, the reduced, denatured lysozyme is susceptible to aggregation (31Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). This makes it a particularly suitable system for our study, because the purpose of our study is to compare the effects of mixed macromolecular crowding on protein folding with those of single macromolecular crowding. In this study, the oxidative refolding of reduced, denatured hen egg white lysozyme in the presence of mixed macromolecular crowding agents was investigated. The experimental results indicate that mixed macromolecular crowding agents are more favorable to lysozyme folding and can be used to simulate the intracellular environments more accurately than single crowding agents do. Materials—Hen egg white lysozyme was obtained from Sigma and was used without further purification. Native and reduced lysozyme concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the A1%1cm values of 26.3 and 23.7 (30van den Berg B. Chung E.W. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), respectively. The crowding agents, bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol. dextran 70, and Ficoll 70, were purchased from Sigma. Urea was obtained from Promega (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell walls and reduced and oxidized glutathione were purchased from Sigma. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was a Biomol product (Biomol Co., Hamburg, Germany). All other chemicals used were made in China and were of analytical grade. The reagents were prepared in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) for reduction/denaturation and renaturation of lysozyme, and M. lysodeikticus cell walls were dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) for lysozyme activity assay. Preparing Reduced, Denatured Lysozyme—Reduced, denatured lysozyme was generated as described (30van den Berg B. Chung E.W. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Goldberg M.E. Rudolph R. Jaenicke R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Lysozyme (20 mg/ml) was dissolved in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Reduction and denaturation were achieved by incubation overnight at room temperature with 0.15 m DTT. The solution was acidified to pH 3.0 by the addition of 1 m HCl, dialyzed extensively against 0.1 m acetic acid at 4 °C and then lyophilized. The resulting protein was stored at –20 °C. Lysozyme Refolding—Lyophilized aliquots of reduced, denatured lysozyme (450–550 μm) were dissolved in formic acid at pH 2.0 immediately before use. Oxidative refolding of the reduced, denatured protein was initiated by a rapid 90–110-fold dilution of the concentrated solution into the refolding buffer, effected by vigorous agitation with a Vortex mixer for 3–5 s, giving reduced, denatured lysozyme a final concentration of 5 μm. The refolding buffer (pH 8.5), optimized to give the highest refolding yield (30van den Berg B. Chung E.W. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), consisted of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m urea (30van den Berg B. Chung E.W. Robinson C.V. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), reduced/oxidized glutathione, and different concentrations of mixed or single crowding agents. Stock solutions of reduced/oxidized glutathione in 100 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.5 were made immediately prior to use, and the final concentrations of reduced and oxidized glutathione in the refolding experiment were 1.33 and 0.27 mm, respectively. Lysozyme was denatured in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA overnight at room temperature, in the absence of DTT. The refolding of the denatured protein with four disulfides intact was initiated by 50-fold dilution into the refolding buffer, resulting in final concentrations of 160 mm urea and 5 μm lysozyme in the refolding buffer. All of the refolding experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Lysozyme Activity Assay—Refolding samples of reduced, denatured lysozyme were assayed after 4–6 h of refolding. Control experiments assayed after 24 and 48 h showed that enzymatic activities of the refolding samples increased very slightly after 6 h of refolding. When measuring the time dependence of the recovery of activity, aliquots of 100 μl refolding sample were taken, and the folding reactions were quenched by the addition of 4 μl of 2.5 m HCl, to give a pH value of ∼2. The enzymatic activity was assayed by mixing 10 μl of quenched lysozyme with 500 μl of 0.5 mg/ml M. lysodeikticus cell wall suspension in 100 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 and then by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 450 nm during 30 s and at 25 °C. All of the enzymatic activities were normalized against and expressed as a percentage of 5 μm solution of native lysozyme in refolding buffer. Control experiments were performed to ensure that the crowding agents had no influence on the activity assay. Determination of Kinetic Constants for Lysozyme Refolding—Because the oxidative refolding of reduced, denatured lysozyme takes place as a three-state system (the detailed explanation is shown in the “Results” for phase diagram), the kinetic parameters for the oxidative refolding were determined by fitting the increase in enzymatic activity versus time to a double exponential model (16van den Berg B. Wain R. Dobson C.M. Ellis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3870-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 18Li J. Zhang S. Wang C.C. J. Biol.

Here, Y is the refolding yield measured at the time t, Ymax,1 and Ymax,2 represent the maximal refolding yields for the fast track and the slow track of lysozyme refolding, respectively, and k1 and k2 are the rate constants for the fast track and the slow track, respectively. Refolding time constants, (t½)1 and (t½)2, are defined as the half-times for the fast track and the slow track of lysozyme refolding, respectively, where (t½)1 = 0.6931/k1 and (t½)2 = 0.6931/k2. Measurement of Protein Aggregation—Refolding samples of reduced, denatured lysozyme in the absence and presence of single or mixed crowding agents were transferred to 1-cm thermostatted quartz fluorescence cuvettes after 4–6 h of refolding, and their fluorescence was measured on a LS-55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 25 °C. An excitation wavelength of 450 nm was used with an emission wavelength of 455 nm (emission and excitation slit widths were 2.5 and 2.5 nm, respectively) to measure light scattering (15van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In all experiments, the blanks were subtracted to correct for scattering and absorbance of buffer components (including crowding agents). Intrinsic Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Reduced, denatured lysozyme sample was diluted at least 50-fold with the refolding buffer in the absence and presence of 100 g/liter mixed crowding agent (50 g/liter dextran 70 + 50 g/liter Ficoll 70), which had been transferred to a 1-cm thermostatted quartz fluorescence cuvette, and the intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy was recorded immediately on a LS-55 luminescence spectrometer using a kinetic scan method at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength at 295 nm was used, and the excitation and emission slits were predetermined by control experiment to make the intensity of fluorescence spectroscopy in a measurable region. The intrinsic fluorescence spectra were recorded between 300 and 420 nm during lysozyme refolding, and the scan speed was 250 nm min–1. The interval between scans for the first to the 30th scans was 1 min, and that after the 30th scan was 5 min. The intrinsic fluorescence intensity values measured on wavelengths 320 and 365 nm at different refolding times were used to construct the phase diagram of fluorescence. Phase Diagram Method of Fluorescence—The “phase diagram” method of fluorescence is a sensitive approach for the detection of unfolding/refolding intermediates of proteins (32Kuznetsova I.M.

The essence of this method is to build up the diagram of I(λ1) versus I(λ2), where I(λ1) and I(λ2) are the fluorescence intensity values measured on wave-lengths λ1 and λ2 under different experimental conditions for a protein under going structural transformations. Because fluorescence intensity is the extensive parameter, it will describe any two-component system by a simple relationship (32Kuznetsova I.M. Stepanenko O.V. Turoverov K.K. Zhu L. Zhou J.M.

In principle, λ1 and λ2 are arbitrary wave-lengths of the fluorescence spectrum, but in practice such diagrams will be more informative if λ1 and λ2 are on different slopes of the spectrum, such as 320 and 365 nm (32Kuznetsova I.M.

It has been noted that application of this method to protein unfolding/refolding predicts that the dependence of I320 versus I365 will be linear if changes in the protein environment lead to an all-or-none transition between two different conformations. Here, I320 and I365 are the intrinsic fluorescence intensity values measured on wavelengths 320 and 365 nm under different experimental conditions for a protein under going structural transformations. On the other hand, nonlinearity of this function reflects the sequential character of structural transformations. Moreover, each linear portion will describe an individual all-or-none transition. This method was employed here to detect the existence of intermediates during the refolding of both denatured lysozyme with disulfide-intact and reduced, denatured lysozyme in the presence of mixed macromolecular crowding agents. Effects of Concentrations of Macromolecular Crowding Agents on Lysozyme Refolding—The concentrations of crowding agents used in this study were in the same range as macromolecular concentrations found in the cytoplasm (5Swaminathan R.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 197-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 100 and 200 g/liter were chosen to test the effects of concentrations of macromolecular crowding agents on the oxidative refolding of reduced, denatured lysozyme. As shown in Fig. 1A, with increasing the concentration of dextran 70 from 0 to 200 g/liter, the refolding yield of reduced, denatured lysozyme, as measured by the extent of the recovery of enzymatic activity after refolding for 6 h, decreased from 74 to 34%. As shown in Fig. 1B and Table I, although much lower refolding yields for the fast track of lysozyme refolding were observed in the presence of high concentrations of crowding agents, the refolding rates for the fast track were faster than those in the absence of crowding agents.Table IKinetic parameters for the oxidative refolding of reduced, denatured lysozyme in the absence and presence of mixed or single crowding agentsCrowding agentConcentrationY max,1k 1(t½)1Y max,2k 2(t½)2Ymax,1 + Ymax,2g/liter%10-3 min-1min%10-3 min-1min%Absence066.5 ± 3.023.4 ± 1.329.6 ± 1.615.0 ± 2.35.3 ± 2.1130 ± 5181.5 ± 5.3BSA10030.1 ± 4.371.5 ± 8.69.7 ± 1.225.3 ± 3.63.5 ± 1.3200 ± 7455.4 ± 7.9Dextran10048.0 ± 3.752.5 ± 5.013.2 ± 1.310.7 ± 3.94.3 ± 1.0160 ± 3858.7 ± 7.6Dextran20020.7 ± 4.297.2 ± 2.07.1 ± 0.112.4 ± 3.62.8 ± 1.5250 ± 13033.1 ± 7.8Ficoll10042.4 ± 2.670.8 ± 5.79.8 ± 0.818.5 ± 1.83.8 ± 1.6180 ± 7860.9 ± 4.4Dextran + BSA10050.6 ± 3.579.5 ± 8.28.7 ± 0.928.4 ± 3.75.2 ± 2.6130 ± 6879.0 ± 7.2Ficoll + BSA10054.1 ± 3.482.7 ± 6.98.4 ± 0.723.4 ± 2.55.0 ± 2.7140 ± 7377.5 ± 5.9 Open table in a new tab Effects of Mixed Macromolecular Crowding Agents on Refolding Yield of Lysozyme—The advantage of using polysaccharide crowding agents, such as dextran 70 and Ficoll 70, is that they are inert and polar and do not interfere with some spectrum experiments. Protein crowding agents such as BSA are more relevant than polysaccharide crowding agents from a physiological point of view but may have interactions with refolding proteins in addition to the effects caused by excluded volume (7Minton A.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 11Minton A.P. Biophys.

In this study both BSA and polysaccharide, such as dextran 70 and Ficoll 70, were added to the refolding buffer, keeping the total concentration of the mixed crowding agent constant at 100 g/liter, whereas the weight ratio of BSA to polysaccharide varies gradually. As shown in Fig. 2A, the refolding yield of reduced, denatured lysozyme after refolding for 4 h changed nonlinearly, increased from 52 to 68% when the weight ratio of BSA to the mixed crowding agent (BSA + dextran 70) is between 0 and 10%, and then decreased gradually from 68 to 44% when the ratio is between 10 and 100%. In other words, when the total concentration of the mixed crowding agent is 100 g/liter, in which the weight ratio of BSA to dextran 70 is 1:9, the refolding yield of lysozyme under this condition increased 24% compared with that in the presence of BSA and 16% compared with dextran 70.

Recent studies have demonstrated a specific induction of E2F1 accumulation and a role for E2F1 in apoptosis upon DNA damage. Induction of E2F1 is mediated by phosphorylation events that are dependent on DNA damage-responsive protein kinases, such as ATM. How ATM phosphorylation leads to E2F1 stabilization is unknown. We now show that 14-3-3τ, a phosphoserine-binding protein, mediates E2F1 stabilization. 14-3-3τ interacts with ATM-phosphorylated E2F1 during DNA damage and inhibits E2F1 ubiquitination. Depletion of 14-3-3τ or E2F1, but not E2F2 or E2F3, blocks adriamycin-induced apoptosis. 14-3-3τ is also required for expression and induction of E2F1 apoptotic targets, such as p73, Apaf-1, and caspases, during DNA damage. Together, these data demonstrate a novel function for 14-3-3τ in the regulation of E2F1 protein stability and apoptosis during DNA damage.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). E2F1 also induces the expression of several other genes involved in apoptosis, such as p14ARF (10DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L.

Lazebnik Y. Bar-Sagi D. Lowe S.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The proapoptotic activity of E2F1 is probably mediated through the induction of these genes. The signaling events that lead to E2F1 induction upon DNA damage have also been delineated. ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) phosphorylate E2F1 at Ser31 but do not phosphorylate E2F2 or E2F3, and this specificity accounts for the selective induction of E2F1 among the E2F family during DNA damage (2Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). E2F1 is also phosphorylated by Chk2 (3Stevens C. Smith L. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Together, these phosphorylation events lead to stabilization and activation of E2F1. In addition to phosphorylation, acetylation has also been recognized to play a role in the activation and stabilization of E2F1 protein during DNA damage (4Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcellini A. Screpanti I. Balsano C. Alesse E. Gulino A. Levrero M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15Ianari A. Gallo R.

Thus, it appears that several DNA damage signaling pathways are involved in the induction of E2F1. However, the mechanism by which these modifications lead to E2F1 stabilization remains unclear. We now provide evidence that a member of the 14-3-3 family proteins, 14-3-3τ, plays a critical role in the regulation of E2F1 stability. 14-3-3 proteins are a family of dimeric phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding proteins, which are involved in a very diverse spectrum of signaling pathways (16Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). 14-3-3τ binds to Ser31-phosphorylated E2F1 and inhibits the ubiquitination of E2F1 during DNA damage. It is required for the expression and induction of several E2F1 apoptotic target genes as well as apoptosis during DNA damage. Our data suggest a model in which binding of 14-3-3τ to E2F1 interferes with the function of an E3 1The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription; 7-AAD, 7-amino-actinomycin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NCS, neocarzinostatin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast. ligase and therefore inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of E2F1. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and U2OS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate method or the Gene Pulser Xcell electroporation system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The N terminus of E2F1 (amino acids 1–109) in pAS2-1 vector was used as a bait to screen a HeLa cDNA library in pGADGH as described (17Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recombinant Plasmids—pCMV-SPORT6-14-3-3τ was obtained from ResGen. FLAG-tagged 14-3-3τ expression vector was constructed by excising the 14-3-3τ cDNA from pCMV-SPORT6-14-3-3τ by XhoI digestion and inserted into pCMV-Tag 2C. The KpnI/XhoI fragment of pCMV-SPORT6–14-3-3τ was moved to pCMV-Tag2 vector to construct FLAG-tagged ΔN14-3-3τ expression vector. The construction of pSUPER-siE2F1, siE2F2, and siE2F3 has been described (18Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The 19-nucleotide target sequence for si14-3-3τ is 5′-GGACTATCGGGAGAAAGTG-3′, and the sequence for si14-3-3τ-2 is 5′-CGAGGAGCGCAACCTGCTC-3′. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested with TNN buffer for immunoprecipitation as previously described (17Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG (M2) beads were purchased from Sigma. Anti-HA beads (HA.11 affinity matrix) were purchased from Covance. Specific signals were detected with appropriate antibodies. The antibodies specific to E2F1 (C-20 and KH95), E2F2 (C-20), E2F3 (C-18 and N-20), 14-3-3τ (C-17 and H-8), GST (B-14), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PC-10) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). β-Actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-green fluorescence protein (GFP) antibody was purchased from Clontech. The monoclonal antibody for 14-3-3τ was purchased from EMD Biosciences. The monoclonal antibody for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was purchased from Pharmingen. GST Pull-down Assay—The full-length cDNA of 14-3-3τ was inserted into an expression vector pGEX6P1, encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST). GST, GST-E2F1, and GST-14-3-3τ proteins were induced and purified from E. coli as previously described (2Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). The GST portion of GST-E2F1 was excised by PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). 2 μg of purified GST-14-3-3τ or GST was incubated at 4 °C overnight with purified E2F1 or the cellular lysates prepared from HEK293 cells, which had been transfected with pcDNA3-HA-E2F1 (wild-type) or pcDNA3-HA-E2F1(S31A) and lysed in TNN buffer. GST-14-3-3τ was pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose, and the bound E2F1 was analyzed by Western blotting as described (17Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In Vitro Peptide Binding Assay—A biotin-labeled nonphosphorylated peptide (biotin-RLLDSSQIVI) or phosphorylated peptide (biotin-RLLD-SpSQIVI; where pS represents phosphoserine) was synthesized by Sigma. Biotin-peptides (2 μg) were incubated with GST-14-3-3τ or GST protein (2 μg) in 1 ml of NETN-A buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C overnight. The mixtures were then incubated with either streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), or glutathione-Sepharose at 4°C for 3 h and washed with NETN-B buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) six times. The bound GST-14-3-3τ was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GST antibody. ELISA—A 96-well Immulon 4 flat bottom plate (VWR) was coated with biotin-labeled nonphosphorylated or phosphorylated peptides (5 μg/ml and 50 μl/well) at 4 °C overnight. The wells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1.5 h and then incubated with GST-14-3-3τ or GST (5 μg/ml and 50 μl/well) at 4 °C overnight. The wells were then washed with 0.5% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline. The bound GST or GST-14-3-3τ was detected by GST antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The plate was developed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) and read at OD450/650 in a spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). RT-PCR—HEK293 and U2OS cells were transfected with pSUPER or pSUPER-si14-3-3τ. The U2OS cells were treated with 300 ng/ml neocarzinostatin (NCS) for 0 or 5 h. The HEK293 cells were treated with 5 μm adriamycin for 0, 6, or 12 h. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent. RT-PCR was performed using the following primer pairs.

Cells were then treated with 5 μm adriamycin for 48 h and apoptosis was quantified by propidium iodide flow cytometry (17Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Alternatively, HEK293 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-GFP and pSUPER vectors and then treated with adriamycin. To assay apoptosis, cells were stained with annexin V-PE (Pharmigen) and 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) (Pharmingen) as described (18Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). At least 5000 GFP-positive cells were gated for each sample, and the annexin/7-AAD profile of these cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Annexin+, 7-AAD– and annexin +, 7-AAD+ cells were scored as apoptotic. Interaction between 14-3-3τ and E2F1 Is Induced by Phosphorylation of E2F1 at Ser31 by ATM upon DNA Damage— The N terminus of E2F1 contains Ser 31 which is phosphorylated by ATM and is required for E2F1 induction during DNA damage (2Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). We used fusion proteins composed of the N-terminal portion of E2F1 and the GAL4 DNA binding domain to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library. Seventeen positive clones encoding nearly full-length 14-3-3τ (amino acids 39–247) were isolated of 12 million clones screened. The interaction was verified by selective growth of yeast cells expressing both N terminus of E2F1 and 14-3-3τ on plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the interaction was significantly impaired when Ser31 of E2F1 was mutated to alanine, suggesting that an efficient interaction required a serine residue on that position. To confirm their direct physical interaction, we examined in vitro binding between purified E2F1 and GST-14-3-3τ proteins. E2F1 protein was incubated with GST or GST-14-3-3τ, and the GST-14-3-3τ protein was pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose. GST-14-3-3τ but not GST pulled down E2F1 (Fig. 1B), demonstrating a direct interaction between 14-3-3τ and E2F1. Next, we examined whether E2F1 interacted with 14-3-3τ in vivo. We detected an interaction between endogenous E2F1 and 14-3-3τ in 293T cells that had been treated with NCS, a radiomimetic chemical. The interaction between endogenous proteins in the absence of DNA damage was below detection in this experiment but was readily detectable upon NCS treatment (Fig. 1C). This result demonstrates that the interaction between endogenous E2F1 and 14-3-3τ is induced upon DNA damage. NCS activates ATM kinase and leads to E2F1 phosphorylation at the Ser31 residue (2Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event might directly induce the binding between 14-3-3τ and E2F1. To test this hypothesis, we prepared cellular lysates from HEK293 cells, which were transfected with the plasmid expressing either wild-type E2F1 or S31A-E2F1 and treated with NCS. We measured the amounts of E2F1 in each lysate by E2F1 immunoblotting. Consistent with previous observation (2Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar), the protein levels of wild-type E2F1, but not S31A mutant were induced by NCS (Fig. 2A). We then adjusted the amount of each input lysate, so that roughly equivalent amounts of E2F1 were incubated with GST or GST-14-3-3τ (Fig. 2B, bottom). GST-14-3-3τ pull-down was performed with glutathione-Sepharose. GST-14-3-3τ specifically interacted with wild-type E2F1, but not S31A mutant, and the interaction was enhanced upon NCS treatment (Fig. 2B, top). This result demonstrates that the interaction between E2F1 and 14-3-3τ is induced by Ser31 phosphorylation. Interestingly, there is weak interaction between 14-3-3τ and overexpressed HA-E2F1 even before NCS treatment (Fig. 2B, 0 h). To further test whether 14-3-3τ could bind to the region around Ser31, we incubated GST or GST-14-3-3τ with a biotinylated E2F1 peptide (biotin-RLLDSS31QIVI) or phosphopeptide (biotin-RLLDSpS31QIVI) and pulled down the peptides with streptavidin-Sepharose. GST-14-3-3τ interacted with the phosphopeptide but not with the nonphosphorylated peptide (Fig. 2C). The interaction was dependent on 14-3-3τ, since GST did not interact with the phosphopeptide. The binding between 14-3-3τ and phosphopeptide was also confirmed by an independent assay. The nonphosphopeptide or phosphopeptide was coated to plates and then incubated with either purified GST or GST-14-3-3τ. The bound protein was measured using ELISA. 14-3-3τ also specifically interacted with the phosphopeptide in this assay (Fig. 2D). Together, we conclude that 14-3-3τ binds to Ser31-phosphorylated E2F1. 14-3-3τ Is Required for the Stabilization of E2F1 Protein during DNA Damage—The phosphorylation of E2F1 at Ser31 by ATM kinase stabilizes the E2F1 protein (2Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of 14-3-3τ to phosphorylated E2F1 suggests a role for 14-3-3τ in the stabilization of E2F1. To test that, we knocked down the expression of 14-3-3τ by pSUPER vector-based small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (19Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3967) Google Scholar). Two 14-3-3τ siRNAs significantly inhibited the expression of cotransfected FLAG-14-3-3τ in HEK293 cells without affecting the levels of coexpressed GFP (Fig. 3A). The induction of HA-E2F1 by NCS treatment was inhibited by both 14-3-3τ siRNAs (Fig. 3B). It is worth noting that the transfection in these experiments was performed by calcium phosphate method, and the transfection efficiency in HEK293 cells by this method in our hands is at most 30% as assayed by the percentage of GFP-positive cells in the pcDNA3-GFP-transfected cells. Therefore, the extent of 14-3-3τ siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous 14-3-3τ within the transfected cells would be much greater than it looks. We also took an independent approach to inhibit the function of 14-3-3τ. Prior study had shown that a 14-3-3τ mutant lacking the N-terminal dimerization domain (ΔN14-3-3τ) could function as a dominant negative inhibitor of endogenous 14-3-3τ (20Seimiya H. Sawada H. Muramatsu Y. Shimizu M. Ohko K. Yamane K. Tsuruo T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2652-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This dominant negative mutant also inhibited the induction of HA-E2F1 by NCS treatment (Fig. 3C). In the course of experiments, we found that the transfection efficiency in HEK293 cells by our electroporation protocol can reach greater than 90% as assayed by the percentage of GFP-positive cells in the pcDNA3-GFP-transfected cells. Therefore, we utilized electroporation to carry out further transfection experiments to examine the role of 14-3-3τ in the induction of endogenous E2F1. 14-3-3τ siRNA significantly blocked the induction of endogenous E2F1 by adriamycin treatment (Fig. 4A). To further investigate whether 14-3-3τ siRNA inhibited the stabilization of E2F1, the E2F1 protein half-life was measured in HEK293 cells treated with cycloheximide in the absence or presence of adriamycin (Fig. 4, B and C). The half-life of endogenous E2F1 in the absence of adriamycin was between 80 and 100 min but was extended to over 300 min upon adriamycin treatment. The half-life of E2F1 in 14-3-3τ siRNA-transfected cells was shortened to between 40 and 60 min. Importantly, 14-3-3τ siRNA prevented the stabilization of E2F1 by adriamycin treatment. Taken together, these results establish a role for 14-3-3τ in the control of E2F1 protein stability. It is worth noting that TopBP1, a BRCT domain-containing protein, also interacts with E2F1, but their interaction regulates E2F1 activity rather than stability (17Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, TopBP1 siRNA does not inhibit the stabilization of E2F1 in response to DNA damage (18Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The half-life of E2F1 has been examined by several investigators and falls in the range of 1–3 h (3Stevens C. Smith L. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 15Ianari A. Gallo R. Palma M. Alesse E. Gulino A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2949-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Therefore, our measurement (80–100 min) is within the general range reported in the literature. The difference between different reports is probably the result of different cell types, growing conditions, and methods used by each investigator.Fig. 414-3-3τ is required for the stabilization of E2F1 protein upon DNA damage. A, knockdown of 14-3-3τ blocks the induction of endogenous E2F1 by adriamycin treatment. HEK293 cells were transfected with 14-3-3τ siRNA and treated with adriamycin (5 μm) for 0–24 h. Western blot analysis (IB) was performed using antibodies as indicated. B, 14-3-3τ siRNA inhibits adriamycin-induced prolongation of E2F1 half-life. HEK293 cells were transfected with an empty vector (upper panels) or 14-3-3τ siRNA (lower panels) and were either left untreated (left panels) or treated with adriamycin (5 μm) for 24 h (right panels). The cells were then treated with cycloheximide (CHX; 20 μg/ml) for the time periods as indicated. The endogenous E2F1 protein was detected by Western blot analysis. C, The E2F1 levels in B were quantified by densitometry, and the relative abundance of E2F1 following CHX treatment was compared with that seen without CHX treatment and plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 14-3-3τ Inhibits E2F1 Ubiquitination—E2F1 is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (21Martelli F.

To test whether 14-3-3τ inhibited E2F1 ubiquitination, we coexpressed HA-E2F1 and Myc-ubiquitin with increasing amounts of 14-3-3τ-expressing plasmids and measured E2F1 ubiquitination by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting assay in HEK293 cells. The effect of NCS on E2F1 ubiquitination was also tested. In order to visualize ubiquitinated E2F1, a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, was added. Overexpression of 14-3-3τ resulted in inhibition of E2F1 ubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). NCS treatment also inhibited E2F1 ubiquitination (Fig. 5A, right lane). We compared the S31A mutant E2F1 with wild-type E2F1 in the ubiquitination assay. Whereas 14-3-3τ greatly inhibited the ubiquitination of wild-type E2F1, it affected S31A-E2F1 to a much lesser degree (Fig. 5B), corresponding to the preferential binding of 14-3-3τ to wild-type E2F1 as compared with the S31A mutant (Fig. 2B). The ubiquitination of endogenous E2F1 in the 14-3-3τ knockdown cells was also examined (Fig. 5C). Consistent with the results described above, depletion of 14-3-3τ led to an increase of E2F1 ubiquitination. E2F1 ubiquitination was inhibited by NCS treatment, but the levels of ubiquitination in 14-3-3τ knockdown cells remained elevated even during NCS treatment. Therefore, we conclude that 14-3-3τ regulates E2F1 ubiquitination to control its stability. 14-3-3τ and E2F1 Are Required for DNA Damage-induced Apoptosis—Given the proapoptotic activity of E2F1 and the role of 14-3-3τ in E2F1 stabilization, 14-3-3τ may be required for apoptosis during DNA damage. We again utilized RNA interference to test that. We transfected HEK293 cells with 14-3-3τ siRNA constructs using the electroporation method, by which we achieved greater than 90% of transfection efficiency. Both siRNAs effectively inhibited the expression of endogenous 14-3-3τ without altering the expression of 14-3-3β (Fig. 6A).We treated mock-, empty vector-, or 14-3-3τ siRNA-transfected HEK293 cells with adriamycin and quantified the degree of apoptosis with propidium iodide/fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Whereas adriamycin induced extensive apoptosis in mock- and empty vector-transfected cells, apoptosis was significantly inhibited by both 14-3-3τ siRNAs (Fig. 6A). We also analyzed apoptosis by annexin V staining. In this experiment, pcDNA3-GFP expression vector was transiently cotransfected into HEK293 cells with pSUPER-si14-3-3τ, and the cells were treated with adriamycin. Apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V/7-AAD staining in GFP-positive cells. As shown in Fig. 6B, 14-3-3τ siRNA inhibited adriamycin-induced apoptosis. Together, these results clearly demonstrate a critical role for 14-3-3τ in DNA damage-induced apoptosis.Fig. 6A role for 14-3-3τ in adriamycin (Adr)-induced apoptosis. A, HEK293 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with pSUPER or pSUPER vectors expressing two different 14-3-3τ siRNAs and treated with adriamycin (5 μm) for 48 h. Apoptotic cells were counted by propidium iodide-flow cytometry. Inhibition of 14-3-3τ expression but not 14-3-3β expression in this experiment was confirmed by Western blot analysis (top).

https://openalex.org/W2119292197,"Granzyme M is a trypsin-fold serine protease that is specifically found in the granules of natural killer cells. This enzyme has been implicated recently in the induction of target cell death by cytotoxic lymphocytes, but unlike granzymes A and B, the molecular mechanism of action of granzyme M is unknown. We have characterized the extended substrate specificity of human granzyme M by using purified recombinant enzyme, several positional scanning libraries of coumarin substrates, and a panel of individual p-nitroanilide and coumarin substrates. In contrast to previous studies conducted using thiobenzyl ester substrates (Smyth, M. J., O'Connor, M. D., Trapani, J. A., Kershaw, M. H., and Brinkworth, R. I. (1996) J. Immunol. 156, 4174–4181), a strong preference for leucine at P1 over methionine was demonstrated. The extended substrate specificity was determined to be lysine = norleucine at P4, broad at P3, proline > alanine at P2, and leucine > norleucine > methionine at P1. The enzyme activity was found to be highly dependent on the length and sequence of substrates, indicative of a regulatory function for human granzyme M. Finally, the interaction between granzyme M and the serpins α1-antichymotrypsin, α1 -proteinase inhibitor, and proteinase inhibitor 9 was characterized by using a candidate-based approach to identify potential endogenous inhibitors. Proteinase inhibitor 9 was effectively hydrolyzed and inactivated by human granzyme M, raising the possibility that this orphan granzyme bypasses proteinase inhibitor 9 inhibition of granzyme B.

Death of target cells is predominantly mediated through granule exocytosis. In this process lysosome-like vesicles whose principal components are perforin and a family of serine proteases known as the granzymes are vectorially secreted toward the target cell. Perforin then facilitates entry of granzymes into the target cell, whereupon key protein substrates such as caspases are cleaved to induce death (2Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In addition to being important mediators of immunity, some granzymes may also represent potential drug targets for treatment of autoimmune disorders (3Tak P.P. Spaeny-Dekking L. Kraan M.C. Breedveld F.C. Froelich C.J. Hack C.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 116: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).The five known human granzymes have varied primary substrate specificities. Granzymes A and K cleave after basic residues (4Beresford P.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zweerink H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); granzyme H cleaves after aromatic residues (7Edwards K.M. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30468-30473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and granzyme M cleaves after long aliphatic residues such as methionine, norleucine, and leucine (1Smyth M.J. O'Connor M.D. Trapani J.A. Kershaw M.H. Brinkworth R.I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4174-4181PubMed Google Scholar). Granzyme M is unique among the family because it is specifically expressed in NK cells and thus may have evolved to serve a specialized function in innate immunity (8Sayers T.J. Brooks A.D. Ward J.M. Hoshino T. Bere W.E. Wiegand G.W. Kelly J.M. Smyth M.J. Kelley J.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that granzymes A and B serve as important effectors of lymphocyte cytotoxicity by inducing nuclear and non-nuclear damage in target cells (2Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 323-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In contrast, far less is known about the orphan human granzymes H, K, and M. Evidence has been presented for granzyme K and a chymase-like serine protease from human NK cells, presumably granzyme H, contributing to induction of target cell damage (9Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that treatment of target cells with purified granzyme M and sublytic quantities of perforin leads to lysis.Toward gaining a better understanding of the molecular function of granzyme M and its NK cell specificity, biochemical characterization of this enzyme is presented here with respect to its substrate specificity and interaction with three serpin macromolecular inhibitors. To obtain protease that is free from contaminating proteolytic activity, human granzyme M was recombinantly expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris and purified to homogeneity. The primary (P1) 2Nomenclature for the substrate amino acid preference is Pn, Pn-1,..., P2, P1, P1′, P2′,..., Pm-1′, Pm′, with amide bond hydrolysis occurring between P1 and P1′. The corresponding enzyme binding sites are denoted by Sn, Sn-1,..., S2, S1, S1′, S2′,..., Sm-1′, Sm′ (34Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Single substrates were then used for validation of library results and a more detailed kinetic characterization. Finally, in an attempt to explore how the activity of human granzyme M is controlled under physiological conditions, interaction of the enzyme with the serpins α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI), and proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI9) was characterized. These three serpins are known to inhibit other leukocyte proteases that display hydrophobic primary specificity such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, proteinase 3, and chymase (13Potempa J.

Acta. 1999; 1451: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and are thus good candidate physiological inhibitors of human granzyme M.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Expedite DNA synthesizer (Foster City, CA). Molecular weight markers for gel electrophoresis, restriction enzymes, and N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human granzyme B was a generous gift from Dr. Nancy Thornberry (Merck). Human granzyme A was recombinantly expressed and purified as described previously (15Bell J.K. Goetz D.H. Mahrus S. Harris J.L. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Human PI9 and anti-PI9 antibodies were prepared and purified as described previously (16Sprecher C.A. Morgenstern K.A. Mathewes S. Dahlen J.R. Schrader S.K. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. J. Biol.

Giegel D.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Human ACT and α1PI were purchased from Calbiochem. The p-nitroanilide (pNA) substrates Suc-AAPL-pNA, Suc-AAPn-pNA, Suc-AAPM-pNA, and Suc-AAPK-pNA, and the 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) substrates Ac-AAPA-AMC, Suc-AAPF-AMC, and Ac-IEPD-AMC were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA).Heterologous Expression of Human Granzyme M—The cDNA encoding mature human granzyme M was amplified from I.M.A.G.E. clone 112558 and subcloned into the yeast expression vector pPICZα A (Invitrogen). The resulting construct permitted the sequence of mature human granzyme M to immediately follow the Kex2 signal cleavage site of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-factor secretion signal. The vector was linearized with SacI and transformed into the X33 strain of Pichia pastoris. Clones with the integrated human granzyme M cDNA were selected by resistance to Zeocin™ (Invitrogen) and were used to inoculate 1-liter shaker flask cultures.Purification of Recombinant Human Granzyme M—After 3 days of induction with methanol, the conditioned media from the shaker flask cultures was isolated and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 4 column volumes of 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, and bound protein was eluted with 4 column volumes of 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 m NaCl. Eluted protein was concentrated, exchanged into 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, and loaded onto a Mono-S cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 4 column volumes of 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl, and bound protein was eluted with 50 column volumes of a linear gradient of 0.32 m NaCl to 0.48 m NaCl in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0. Fractions containing human granzyme M eluted between 0.38 and 0.45 m NaCl. These were pooled, concentrated, and exchanged into 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 50 mm NaCl. Purity of the preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, followed by densitometric analysis with a MultiImage™ Light Cabinet (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA).Preparation of Anti-human Granzyme M Antibodies—Surface loops of human granzyme M with low similarity to those of the other four human granzymes were identified, and the sequence analysis software package MacVector (Oxford Molecular, Madison, WI) was used to rank their antigenic potential. Peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of two loops were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems automated peptide synthesizer (Foster City, CA), purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Each peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits for polyclonal antiserum production (Covance Corp., Richmond, CA). Antibodies raised against the peptide corresponding to residues 98–109 of human granzyme M demonstrated good reactivity and selectivity against the recombinant enzyme and were used for subsequent studies.Immunoblot Analysis—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, washed with TBST, incubated in a dilution of anti-human granzyme M antibodies or anti-human PI9 antibodies in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk, washed with TBST, incubated in a dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk, and washed with TBST once again. Antibody-bound protein bands were then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Active Site Titration of Human Granzyme M and Other Proteases— Bovine trypsin was active site-titrated with 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate and was then used to determine the concentration of a solution of the macromolecular serine protease inhibitor ecotin using Suc-AAPK-pNA as the substrate. Ecotin was then used to active site-titrate human granzyme M and bovine chymotrypsin using Suc-AAPL-pNA as the substrate, human neutrophil elastase and porcine pancreatic elastase using Ac-AAPA-AMC as the substrate, and human neutrophil cathepsin G using Suc-AAPF-AMC as the substrate.Positional Scanning Synthetic Combinatorial Libraries—The preparation and characterization of the P1-diverse, P1-Leu, and P1-Met libraries of 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin (ACC) substrates used in this study are described elsewhere (12Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 18Dauber D.S. Ziermann R. Parkin N. Maly D.J. Mahrus S. Harris J.L. Ellman J.A. Petropoulos C. Craik C.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Screening of these libraries was also carried out as described previously. Briefly, ∼10-9 mol of each well of the P1-Leu or P1-Met stock libraries was added to 57 or 60 wells, respectively, of a 96-well Microfluor plate (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA), and 10-10 mol of each well of the P1-diverse stock library was added to 20 wells of a 96-well Microfluor plate. Final concentration of each substrate in the assay was ∼0.1 μm for the P1-Leu and P1-Met libraries and ∼0.01 μm for the P1-diverse library. Assays were initiated by addition of ∼500 nm enzyme and were conducted at 30 °C in assay buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, and 1% Me2SO. Hydrolysis of substrates was monitored fluorimetrically with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm on a Spectramax Gemini microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).Synthesis of Single Coumarin Substrates—Single ACC substrates were prepared as described previously (12Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.Single Substrate Kinetics—Enzyme activity was monitored at 25 °C in assay buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20. Human granzyme M concentration in assays ranged from 10 nm to 2 μm and substrate concentration ranged from 2 μm to 3 mm. Substrate stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO, and final Me2SO concentrations in assays never exceeded 2% because higher concentrations were found to be detrimental to enzyme activity. Hydrolysis of ACC substrates was monitored as described for library assays, and hydrolysis of pNA substrates was monitored spectrophotometrically at 405 nm on a Molecular Devices UVmax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).Analysis of Serpin-Granzyme M Complex Formation by SDS-PAGE— The concentration of human ACT and human α1PI were calculated using ϵ280 = 3.9 × 104 and 2.8 × 104m-1 cm-1, respectively. The concentration of human PI9 was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). ACT, α1PI, or PI9 were incubated at 25 °C with 1 μm human granzyme M at a 2:1 serpin to protease molar ratio in 50 μl of assay buffer for 24 h. Assay buffer was the same as described above for substrate kinetics, but 1 mm DTT was added for reactions between PI9 and granzyme M to prevent inactivation of the serpin following oxidation of cysteine 342 in the reactive center loop. After the incubation, all samples were deglycosylated using PNGase F and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.Titration of Granzyme M with Serpins—200 nm human granzyme M was incubated at 25 °C with 0–200 nm ACT in assay buffer for 24 h, 0–200 nm α1PI in assay buffer for 96 h, and with 0–8 μm PI9 in assay buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT for 24 h. The remaining enzymatic activity after these incubation times was determined using 100 μm Ac-KVPL-ACC. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored as described for library assays.Serpin Kinetics—The inhibition of human granzyme M by ACT, α1PI, and PI9 was characterized by monitoring the hydrolysis of 1 mm Ac-KVPL-ACC by 2 nm protease in the presence of varying serpin concentrations in assay buffer or assay buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT for reactions between PI9 and granzyme M. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored as described for library assays over the course of 2 h. Serpin concentrations ranged from 0.48 to 7.6 μm for ACT, 0.45 to 7.2 μm for α1PI, and 2.3 to 37.2 μm for PI9. Data from substrate hydrolysis progress curves were then fit to Equation 1 by using the program KaleidaGraph™ (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), P=vs+(vi−vs)(1−e−k′t)k′ (Eq. 1) where P represents arbitrary fluorescence units at time t; vi is the initial velocity; vs is the steady-state velocity, and k′ is an apparent first-order rate constant (19Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Along with inhibitor concentrations, these apparent rate constants were then fit to Equation 2, k′=koff[1+1Ki(1+[S]/Km)] (Eq. 2) where k′ is the apparent first-order rate constant; [S] is the substrate concentration; Km is the Michaelis constant for interaction of the substrate with the protease, and Ki = koff/kon is the overall inhibition constant (19Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The second-order association rate constants kon = ka for inhibition of human granzyme M by serpins were derived from the Ki and koff values obtained from this secondary fit.PI9 Inactivation—All reactions were carried out at 25 °C in 10 μl of activity buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT. 0.5 μm human granzyme B was incubated for 1 h with 1 μm PI9 or 1 μm PI9 that had been preincubated for 1 h at a concentration of 2 μm with 1 μm human granzyme M. These two samples and controls for each individual protein were then diluted hundredfold into water, and 7.5 μl of these diluted samples were used for SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblot analysis with anti-human PI9 antibodies. PI9 inactivation was also verified by using 200 μm Ac-IEPD-AMC to measure the relative activity of 10 nm human granzyme B following a 30-min incubation with 2 μm PI9, 2 μm PI9 and 10 nm human granzyme M, or 2 μm PI9 and 10 nm human granzyme M that had been preincubated for 30 min before addition of human granzyme B. Substrate hydrolysis was monitored as described for library assays in assay buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT.RESULTSExpression and Purification of Human Granzyme M—The gene for mature human granzyme M was subcloned from I.M.A.G.E. clone 112558 into pPICzα A for expression in the methylotropic yeast P. pastoris. The nucleic acid sequence of this gene was found to be identical to that first reported for human granzyme M (20Smyth M.J. Sayers T.J. Wiltrout T. Powers J.C. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6195-6205PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was expressed as a C-terminal fusion to the S. cerevisiae α-factor signal sequence, allowing for purification of the mature enzyme from the media following secretion and cleavage of the signal sequence by Kex2. Following induction with methanol, purification of mature human granzyme M from conditioned media was carried out using SP-Sepharose and Mono-S cation exchange chromatography. Typical yields of purified protein were between 0.2 and 1.0 mg/liter of culture.SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining indicated the recombinant enzyme was differentially glycosylated, migrating as a doublet between 33 and 48 kDa, and as a broad smear of hyperglycosylated enzyme between 48 and 83 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Glycosylation of human granzyme M in P. pastoris is expected because the enzyme contains three potential N-linked glycosylation consensus sites. Treatment with PNGase F caused all bands to decrease in apparent molecular weight and to coalesce at 26 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Densitometric analysis of this deglycosylated band indicated that the enzyme was greater than 98% pure. A polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 98–109 of human granzyme M recognized all glycosylated species and the single deglycosylated species of the recombinant enzyme (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2).P1 Substrate Specificity—The primary specificity of purified recombinant human granzyme M was profiled using a positional scanning synthetic combinatorial library of tetrapeptide coumarin substrates referred to as the P1-diverse library (12Harris J.L. Backes B.J. Leonetti F. Mahrus S. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7754-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). As described previously, this library is of general structure Ac-XXXP1-ACC and is composed of 20 wells in which the P1 position is sequentially fixed as 1 of 20 different amino acids (excluding cysteine and including the methionine isostere norleucine), although P4, P3, and P2 are randomized in all wells, resulting in 8,000 substrates/well. Human granzyme M only displayed activity with P1-Leu, P1-Nle, and P1-Met in the P1-diverse library, in agreement with previous studies conducted with thiobenzyl ester substrates, purified native rat enzyme from RNK-16 cells (21Smyth M.J. Wiltrout T. Trapani J.A. Ottaway K.S. Sowder R. Henderson L.E. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Young H.A. Sayers T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24418-24425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and supernatant from COS cells transiently transfected with human and mouse granzyme M (1Smyth M.J.

Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast to prior studies, human granzyme M displayed an extremely pronounced primary specificity for leucine, with relative activities of 100% for P1-Leu, 46% for P1-Nle, and 16% for P1-Met (Fig. 2A). When purified recombinant human granzyme M was assayed with p-nitroanilide substrates containing Leu, Nle, or Met at P1, activity was observed with all three substrates, but a clear preference for P1-Leu was apparent once again (Fig. 2B). In relative terms, the enzyme displayed 100% activity with Suc-AAPL-pNA, 52% activity with Suc-AAPn-pNA, and 37% activity with Suc-AAPM-pNA.Fig. 2P1 substrate specificity of human granzyme M.

The P1-Leu library is composed of three sub-libraries of general structures Ac-XXP2L-ACC, Ac-XP3XL-ACC, and Ac-P4XXL-ACC. Each of these is composed of 19 wells in which the P2, P3, or P4 position is sequentially fixed as 1 of 19 different amino acids (excluding cysteine and methionine and including the methionine isostere norleucine), whereas the remaining positions are randomized, resulting in 361 substrates/well. The P1-Met library is set up in an analogous manner, with the only difference being that, in contrast to the P1-Leu library, methionine is also present at randomized and fixed positions, resulting in 400 substrates/ well. Profiling of human granzyme M using the P1-Leu library revealed narrow specificity at P2, with a preference for proline over alanine, broad specificity at P3 with a preference for the aromatic residues phenylalanine and tyrosine, and intermediate specificity at P4 with a preference for lysine and the methionine isostere norleucine (Fig. 3). To validate these results and explore whether the specificity at P4-P2 is dependent on the identity of the P1 residue, human granzyme M was also profiled using the P1-Met library. Results at P2 and P4 with the P1-Met library were generally consistent with P1-Leu library results. Notably, specificity at P3 was different, with a preference for valine and glutamate instead of aromatic residues (Fig. 3).Fig. 3P4-P2 substrate specificity of human granzyme M. Profiles with the P1-Leu and P1-Met libraries, where the y axis represents activity relative to the P2 proline well, and the x axis represents the positioned P4, P3, or P2 amino acid (with norleucine represented by n). All rates can be normalized to the single well exhibiting highest activity in each library because a single experiment simultaneously collects data on all three subsites. Data represent the average from two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of Substrate Specificity with Single Substrates— Because the positional scanning libraries described above are composed of pools of substrates, activities reflect the average preferred residues at a particular site. Quantitative kinetic analysis to address issues such as cooperativity can only be carried out with single, purified substrates. To validate the results obtained using the positional scanning libraries and to analyze the extended substrate specificity of human granzyme M in more detail, a series of single ACC substrates was prepared and assayed (Table I). Out of all tested permutations of residues found to be preferred based on the P1-Leu and P1-Met library profiles, the enzyme exhibited the highest preference for Ac-KVPL-ACC, with a kcat/Km of 1,900 m-1 s-1. In contrast, the enzyme showed no detectable activity with Ac-GRLL-ACC, a substrate with sub-optimal P4-P2 residues, indicating the importance of primary sequence recognition for human granzyme M.

The present study reports that exposure to arsenic induced actin filament reorganization, resulting in lamellipodia and filopodia structures through the activation of Cdc42 in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. It was also found that arsenic induced the formation of the superoxide anion (O2⋅¯) in SVEC4-10 cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis demonstrated that arsenic stimulation induced serine phosphorylation of p47phox, a key component of NADPH oxidase, indicating that arsenic induces O2⋅¯ formation through NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of arsenic-induced actin filament reorganization by either overexpression of a dominant negative Cdc42 or pretreatment of an actin filament stabilizing regent, jasplakinolide, abrogated arsenic-induced NADPH oxidase activation, showing that the activation of NADPH oxidase was regulated by Cdc42-mediated actin filament reorganization. This study also showed that overexpression of a dominant negative Rac1 was sufficient to abolish arsenic-induced O2⋅¯ production, implying that Rac1 activities are required for Cdc42-mediated NADPH oxidase activation in response to arsenic stimulation. Furthermore, arsenic stimulation induced cell migration, which can be inhibited by the inactivation of either Cdc42 or NADPH oxidase. Taken together, the results indicate that arsenic is able to activate NADPH oxidase through Cdc42-mediated actin filament reorganization, leading to the induction of an increase in cell migration in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells.

Taken together, the results indicate that arsenic is able to activate NADPH oxidase through Cdc42-mediated actin filament reorganization, leading to the induction of an increase in cell migration in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. Arsenic has long been considered a toxic and carcinogenic metal. There is substantial evidence indicating that the exposure of humans to arsenic via contaminated air and drinking water causes cancer (1Hayes R.B. Cancer Causes Control. 1997; 8: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Both epidemiologic and clinical studies indicated that arsenic exposure is linked to the high incidence of skin, bladder, liver, kidney, and lung cancers, as well as other human diseases (2Bode A.M. Dong Z. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 42: 5-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Arsenic has been shown to induce carcinogenesis in vivo by inducing a wide spectrum of changes in cell signal transduction, including the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding region; Cdc42DN, dominant negative form of Cdc42 cells; DPI, diphenyleneiodonium; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB pathways, alterations in cell differential and proliferation, and the induction of apoptosis (3Qian Y. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2003; 96: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ROS is a collective term for the intermediates formed during oxidative metabolism, encompassing both oxygen radicals and non-radical reactive oxygen derivatives including superoxide anion (O2⋅¯), the hydroxyl radicals (·OH), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Mammalian cells have the antioxidant defense systems to remove low physiological concentrations of ROS. However, extremely high concentrations of ROS can cause DNA, protein, and lipid damage in cells. It has been proven that arsenic induces the formation of O2⋅¯ in several different kinds of cells, including vascular endothelial cells (4Barchowsky A. Klei L.R. Dudek E.J. Swartz H.M. James P.E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), human vascular smooth muscle cells (5Lynn S. Gurr J.R. Lai H.T. Jan K.Y. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (6Jing Y. Dai J. Chalmers-Redman R.M. Tatton W.G. Waxman S. Blood. 1999; 94: 2102-2111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), murine keratinocytes (7Corsini E. Asti L. Viviani B. Marinovich M. Galli C.L. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 760-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (8Zhou Y. Hileman E.O. Plunkett W. Keating M.J. Huang P. Blood. 2003; 101: 4098-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that ROS generated by arsenic-mediated reactions cause DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein modification as well as alterations of antioxidant defenses, which are associated with the alterations of cell signal transduction (3Qian Y. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2003; 96: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although increasing evidence shows that ROS play an important role in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis, its mechanism of formation remains to be investigated. Recent study has demonstrated that arsenic is able to up-regulate NADPH oxidase, which is the main source of arsenic-induced ROS generation (9Chou W.C. Jie C. Kenedy A.A. Jones R.J. Trush M.A. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4578-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The mechanism of arsenic-induced NADPH oxidase activation itself is not clear. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells. There are two different forms of actin, mono-actin (G-actin) and actin filaments (F-actin). Actin filaments are involved in a wide variety of cell functions, including cell motility, cell surface remodeling, cell shape changes during mitosis, cell contraction and separation during cytokinesis, cell-cell/cell-substrate interaction, cell signal transduction, angiogenesis, and endocytosis (10Qian Y.

Physiol. 2004; 286: C153-C163Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Actin filaments function in cellular processes by undergoing dynamic structural reorganization or remodeling to form discrete structures at the cell periphery that mediate attachment to the substratum (13Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). These discrete structures are lamellipodia, filopodia, membrane ruffles, and stress fibers (13Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). The formation of these structures is regulated by both extracellular and intracellular signals and is essential for cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction (11Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 13Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). Understanding arsenic-induced actin filament reorganization is important for elucidation of the overall mechanisms involved in arsenic-induced cellular injury. It is controversial as to whether the exposure of cells to arsenic will induce actin filament reorganization. Earlier reports indicated that arsenic exposure induces the dissociation of actin stress fibers and membrane perturbations in 3T3 cells (14Chou I.N. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1989; 2: 358-365PubMed Google Scholar, 15Li W. Chou I.N. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1992; 114: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). There is also a report showing that arsenic is unable to induce actin filament reorganization even at such a high concentration that causes a marked retardation of cell growth in Chinese hamster V79 lung fibroblast cells (16Ochi T. Nakajima F. Fukumori N. Arch. Toxicol. 1998; 72: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, the molecular mechanisms by which arsenic induces actin filament reorganization have not been elucidated, and little is known about the functional implications of arsenic-induced actin filament reorganization in cell signal transduction and cell metastasis. In this report, we sought to examine whether arsenic exposure would induce actin filament reorganization in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells and determine the underlying mechanisms involved. The present study also attempts to understand the mechanisms of arsenic-induced NADPH oxidase activation and cell migration with an emphasis on the involvement of Cdc42 and actin filament reorganization. We demonstrated that arsenic stimulation induced actin filament reorganization to form lamellipodia and filopodia structures through the activation of Cdc42 in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. We also found that arsenic stimulation produced superoxide anion (O2⋅¯) and activated NADPH oxidase, indicating that arsenic may induce O2⋅¯ through the activation of NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, we showed that the activation of NADPH oxidase was regulated by Cdc42-mediated actin filament reorganization upon arsenic stimulation. We also demonstrated that Rac activities were required for Cdc42-mediated O2⋅¯ production. Interestingly, the results obtained here also showed that the NADPH oxidase activity was involved in arsenic-stimulated cell migration via Cdc42-mediated actin filament reorganization in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. This study defined a unique cell-signaling pathway that may be involved in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. The results of this study also provided the first evidence showing that Cdc42-induced actin filament reorganization mediates the activation of NADPH oxidase.

Both phEFdnCdc42N14 and phEFdpCdc42V12 were transfected into SVEC4-10 cells with Lipofectin (Invitrogen), and the transfected cells were selected by G-418 to make stable transfected cell lines. Immunofluorescence Assay—SVEC4-10 cells were grown on coverslips. After treatment, cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (17Qian Y. Baisden J.M. Westin E.H. Guappone A.C. Koay T.C. Flynn D.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), followed by labeling with FITC-phalloidin for 30 min and mounting to the slides with Fluoromount (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). A Zeiss LSM 510 microscope was used to obtain images. Scale bars were generated and inserted by LSM software. Wound Healing Assay—The wound healing assays were performed according to the methods described previously (10Qian Y. Luo J. Leonard S.S. Harris G.K. Millecchia L. Flynn D.C. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16189-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Qian Y. Corum L. Meng Q. Blenis J. Zheng J.Z. Shi X. Flynn D.C. Jiang B.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C153-C163Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). SVEC4-10 cells were grown on coverslips to 100% confluent monolayers and then scratched to form a 100-μm “wound” using sterile pipette tips. The cells were then cultured with the different treatments in serum-free media for 8–12 h, fixed on coverslips with formalin, and stained with TRITC-phalloidin. A Zeiss LSM 510 microscope was used to obtain images. Scale bars were generated and inserted by LSM software. Cdc42 Activation Assay—Cdc42 activation assays were performed according to the method described by Edlund et al. (18Edlund S. Landstrom M. Heldin C.H. Aspenstrom P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 902-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2. After washing, the cells were lysed immediately with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2,10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were added with GST-WASP-CRIB in GST beads to pull-down active Cdc42 proteins, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 20 min. After incubation, the beads were washed two times with cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The Cdc42 protein was eluted with sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The Western blot analysis was performed using anti-Cdc42 polyclonal antibody. Protein bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Superoxide Anion (O2⋅¯) Assay in Adherent Cells—SVEC4-10 cells were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with 10 μm arsenic for different periods of time. During the stimulation periods, dihydroethidium was added at a final concentration of 5 μm for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on coverslips. A Zeiss LSM 510 microscope was used to obtain images. Scale bars were generated and inserted by LSM software. p67phox Translocation Assay—The p67phox protein translocation assay was performed according to the methods described by Zang et al. (19Zang Q. Frankel P. Foster D.A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1367-1373PubMed Google Scholar) and Zhao et al. (20Zhao Q. Slavkovich V. Zheng W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 149: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were sonicated for 4 s and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to pellet membrane fraction in the homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation, the membrane fraction (pellet) was resuspended in the homogenization buffer with 1% Triton X-100. The suspended mixture was sonicated for 4 s and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The membrane proteins were in the supernatants that were analyzed by Western blot assays. Measurement of NADPH Oxidase Activities—Measurement of the activity of NADPH oxidase was performed according to the method described by Dib et al. (21Dib K. Melander F. Axelsson L. Dagher M.C. Aspenstrom P. Andersson T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24181-24188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with 0.2% nitro blue tetrazolium during the last 10 min of the incubation. After the treatment, the adherent cells were scraped off and pelleted. The pellets were then resolved in N,N-dimethylformamide, and the supernatants were used in measuring the activities of NADPH oxidase with a spectrophotometer (515 nm). Arsenic Stimulation Induces Actin Filament Reorganization in SVEC4-10 Cells—Actin filaments play major roles in cell signal transduction and carcinogenesis. They have been indicated as being the targets for injury by the epigenetic carcinogenic metal compounds in the environment (14Chou I.N. Biomed. Environ. Sci. 1989; 2: 358-365PubMed Google Scholar). Arsenic is a toxic heavy metal that can induce stress-related cell signal transduction. We sought to clarify whether arsenic stimulation would induce actin filament reorganization. SVEC4-10 cells, an immortalized endothelial cell line, were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with 10 μm arsenic for different periods of time ranging from 3 min to 4 h. After the stimulation, the cells were immediately fixed, permeabilized, and stained with FITC-phalloidin, followed by morphological analysis of the cells using confocal microscopy. The unstimulated SVEC4-10 cells stretched out evenly, and no protrusions were found at the leading edge of the cells. The actin filaments were well organized, and few cell motile structures and rosette-like dots were found at the cell leading edge and cell body, respectively, indicating that the unstimulated SVEC4-10 cells do not undergo a significant reorganization of actin filaments (Fig. 1A). Upon stimulation with 10 μm arsenic for 3 min, the cell morphology was changed, and the actin filaments were remodeled (Fig. 1B). The cells began to round up. There were some actin protrusion structures at the leading edge of the cells. These protrusion structures are lamellipodia and filopodia. Some of the actin stress fibers were dissociated to form rosette-like structures around the cell body. These morphological changes indicate that the actin filaments were reorganized upon arsenic stimulation within 3 min in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. After the stimulation with arsenic for 10–30 min, a substantial number of lamellipodia and filopodia were found at the leading edge of the cells, and actin stress fibers were further dissociated, indicating that the actin filaments underwent a more profound reorganization (Fig. 1, C and D). Arsenic-induced actin filament reorganization lasted for >4 h (Fig. 1, E and F). Dose-dependent experiments demonstrated that the lowest concentration of arsenic that could induce the reorganization of actin filaments within 30 min of stimulation was 10 μm (data not shown). Our results demonstrated that arsenic stimulation was sufficient to induce actin filament reorganization to form lamellipodia and filopodia structures at the leading edge of the cells and rosette-like structures in the cell body in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells, indicating that actin cytoskeleton architecture is a molecular target of arsenic-induced stress injury in endothelial cells. Arsenic Stimulation Induces Actin Filament Reorganization through the Activation of Cdc42—The reorganization of actin filaments is tightly regulated during cell signal transduction. To investigate whether arsenic stimulation would activate the small Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42, the main actin filament regulatory proteins (13Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar), SVEC4-10 cells were stimulated with 10 μm arsenic for various periods of time ranging from 3 min to 4 h, and the cell lysates were subject to glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pull-down assays using GST-PAK-CRIB and GST-WASP-CRIB, respectively. Our results demonstrated that arsenic stimulation induced the activation of Cdc42 within 3 min, and the activation lasted ∼1 h (Fig. 2A). No Rac activation was found (data not shown). We then examined whether the activation of Cdc42 regulated arsenic-induced actin filament reorganization. A dominant negative form of Cdc42 was stably expressed into SVEC4-10 cells (SVEC-Cdc42DN) to inhibit the activity of Cdc42. Both SVEC4-10 cells and SVEC-Cdc42DN were stimulated with 10 μm arsenic for 30 min, and immunofluorescence assays were performed to analyze the integrity of actin filaments. The results showed that the inhibition of Cdc42 activity abrogated arsenic-induced actin filament reorganization (Fig. 2B). Taken together, the results demonstrated that arsenic-induced actin filament reorganization was regulated by the activation of Cdc42 in SVEC4-10 cells. Arsenic Stimulation Induces NADPH Oxidase Activation— Using confocal microscopy, we sought to determine whether stimulation with arsenic would induce the production of O2⋅¯ in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. SVEC4-10 cells were stimulated with 10 μm arsenic for different periods of time and then examined for the production of O2⋅¯ by staining the cells with 5 μm dihydroethidium during the last 30 min of stimulation. Dihydroethidium stains cells a blue color, which can be detected by confocal microscopy. When degraded by O2⋅¯, the dye changes color from blue to red. The red color was shown on the left side of each panel in Fig. 3, whereas the blue color was shown on the right side of each panel. Our results showed that the unstimulated SVEC4-10 cells exhibited the blue color and little or no red color (Fig. 3A, section 1), demonstrating that the unstimulated cells do not generate substantial amounts of the O2⋅¯ radical. Upon arsenic stimulation for 3 min, the blue color disappeared, and the cells were stained to a red color (Fig. 3A, sections 2–5), demonstrating the production of the O2⋅¯ radical. The arsenic-induced red color peaked at 30 min and lasted at least 4 h after stimulation. Our results indicate that arsenic stimulation induces the production of O2⋅¯ in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. NADPH oxidase is one of major enzymes that are involved in O2⋅¯ production (22Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that arsenic stimulation activated NADPH oxidase in endothelial cells (23Smith K.R. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L442-L449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether arsenic-induced O2⋅¯ production is through the activation of NADPH oxidase in SVEC4-10 cells. Serine phosphorylation of p47phox is an essential step in the activation of NADPH oxidase, and the induction of p47phox phosphorylation in serines is a strong indication of NADPH oxidase activation (22Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We performed both immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays using anti-p47phox and anti-phosphoserine antibodies to determine whether arsenic would stimulate serine phosphorylation of p47phox in SVEC4-10 cells. The results showed that arsenic stimulation induced an increase in serine phosphorylation of p47phox within 3 min, and the peak of the serine phosphorylation occurred ∼30 min after the stimulation. The phosphorylation lasted >4 h (Fig. 3B). The data presented here demonstrated that arsenic stimulation induced the activation of NADPH oxidase in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. Moreover, the profile of arsenic-induced serine phosphorylation of p47phox is similar to that of arsenic-induced O2⋅¯ production, indicating that NADPH oxidase is a major enzyme that produces O2⋅¯ upon arsenic stimulation in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. To further prove arsenic-induced activation of NADPH oxidase, we performed a p67phox translocation assay. The results showed that p67phox was translocated to the cell membrane fraction upon arsenic stimulation (Fig. 3C), which is one of hallmarks of NADPH oxidase activation (22Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the results demonstrated that arsenic induced the activation of NADPH oxidase in SVEC4-10 cells. Arsenic Stimulation Induces NADPH Oxidase Activities through the Activation of Cdc42 and the Reorganization of Actin Filaments—The major focus in this section is to investigate how arsenic stimulation induces the activation of NADPH oxidase in SVEC4-10 cells. In our previous report, we showed that the activation of Cdc42 mediated ethanol-induced ROS production in SVEC4-10 cells (10Qian Y. Luo J. Leonard S.S. Harris G.K. Millecchia L. Flynn D.C. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16189-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The present study investigates whether the induction of NADPH oxidase activity was mediated by Cdc42 activation upon arsenic stimulation in the same cells. Both SVEC4-10 cells and SVEC-Cdc42DN cells were stimulated with 10 μm arsenic for 30 min, and then the production of superoxide-induced formazan was measured to determine the activity of NADPH oxidase (21Dib K. Melander F. Axelsson L. Dagher M.C. Aspenstrom P. Andersson T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24181-24188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results showed that arsenic stimulation induced an increase in superoxide-induced formazan production in SVEC4-10 cells that was abolished by the disruption of Cdc42 activity, indicating that the activation of Cdc42 mediates arsenic-induced O2⋅¯ production in SVEC4-10 cells (Fig. 4A). We also pretreated the cells with superoxide dismutase, a superoxide-specific scavenger, to examine whether superoxide dismutase would abrogate the superoxide-induced formazan formation. The results showed that the pretreatment of superoxide dismutase inhibited arsenic-induced formation of formazan (Fig. 4A), proving that Cdc42 specifically mediates arsenic-induced O2⋅¯ production. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that the disruption of Cdc42 abrogated arsenic-induced serine phosphorylation of p47phox in SVEC4-10 cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that Cdc42 regulates NADPH oxidase activation in response to arsenic stimulation. We further examined whether Cdc42 regulated the activation of NADPH oxidase through the reorganization of actin filaments. SVEC4-10 cells were pretreated with the actin filament inhibitors jasplakinolide or cytochalasin D, respectively, and were then stimulated with arsenic for 30 min. Jasplakinolide is an inhibitor of actin filament reorganization that stabilizes actin filaments, and cytochalasin D is an actin filament inhibitor that disrupts the structures of actin filaments (24Fenteany G. Zhu S. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 593-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). They induce the opposite morphological changes in actin filaments. Cytochalasin D, to a lesser extent, mimics the effects of Cdc42 on actin filaments in terms of disruption of actin filament structure. Our immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis showed that pretreatment with jasplakinolide abolished arsenic-induced NADPH oxidase activation, whereas pretreatment with cytochalasin D only partially inhibited arsenic-induced NADPH oxidase activation (Fig 4B), indicating that Cdc42-mediated actin filament reorganization might regulate NADPH oxidase activation in response to arsenic stimulation. To further prove the effects of actin filament reorganization on NADPH oxidase activation, the pretreated SVEC4-10 cells were stimulated with arsenic followed by staining with dihydroethidium dye. SVEC-Cdc42DN cells were set as a negative control. The results demonstrated that arsenic-induced O2⋅¯ production was abolished by either the disruption of Cdc42 activity or the inhibition of actin filament reorganization with jasplakinolide pretreatment (Fig. 4C). The pretreatment of cytochalasin D had a small effect on arsenic-induced O2⋅¯ production (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Arsenic-induced activation (Arn) of NADPH oxidase is regulated by Cdc42-mediated actin filament reorganization. A, arsenic stimulation activates NADPH oxidase through Cdc42. Both SVEC 4-10 cells and SVEC-Cdc42DN cells were preincubated with 0.1% nitro blue tetrazolium and then treated with 10 μm arsenic for 30 min as indicated. Both SVEC4-10 cells alone and SVEC4-10 cells with superoxide dismutase (SOD) pretreatment (500 units/ml/h) were set as the negative controls. After the treatments, the cells were lysed, and the supernatants of the lysates were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide. The amount of formazan in the supernatants was detected by a spectrophotometer at 515 nm, which represents the amount of superoxide formation. The data are from three independent experiments. An asterisk indicates a significant difference from controls (p < 0.01, n = 3). B, arsenic-induced increase in serine phosphorylation of p47phox is mediated by Cdc42 and actin"
https://openalex.org/W2081755366,"Given the simplicity of the DNA sequence that mediates binding of GATA transcription factors, GATA motifs reside throughout chromosomal DNA. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis has revealed that GATA-1 discriminates exquisitely among these sites. GATA-2 selectively occupies the –2.8-kilobase (kb) region of the GATA-2 locus in the active state despite there being numerous GATA motifs throughout the locus. The GATA-1-mediated displacement of GATA-2 is tightly coupled to repression of GATA-2 transcription. We have used high resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation to show that GATA-1 and GATA-2 occupy two additional regions, –3.9 and –1.8 kb of the GATA-2 locus. GATA-1 and GATA-2 had distinct preferences for occupancy at these regions, with GATA-1 and GATA-2 occupancy highest at the –3.9- and –1.8-kb regions, respectively. Activation of an estrogen receptor fusion to GATA-1 (ER-GATA-1) induced similar kinetics of ER-GATA-1 occupancy and GATA-2 displacement at the sites. In the transcriptionally active state, DNase I hypersensitive sites (HSs) were detected at the –3.9- and –1.8-kb regions, with a weak HS at the –2.8-kb region. Whereas ER-GATA-1-instigated repression abolished the –1.8-kb HS, the –3.9-kb HS persisted in the repressed state. Transient transfection analysis provided evidence that the –3.9-kb region functions distinctly from the –2.8- and –1.8-kb regions. We propose that GATA-2 transcription is regulated via the collective actions of complexes assembled at the –2.8- and –1.8-kb regions, which share similar properties, and through a qualitatively distinct activity of the –3.9-kb complex.

GATA-2 expression is down-regulated and GATA-1 expression increases as hematopoietic precursor cells differentiate into erythroid cells (4Orlic D. Anderson S. Biesecker L.G. Sorrentino B.P.

Although major questions remain unanswered regarding the exact consequences of GATA-2 down-regulation, this appears to be important for differentiation, as sustained expression of GATA-2 alters hematopoiesis (14Briegel K.

Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 19Pal S. Cantor A.B. Johnson K.D. Moran T.

These studies showed that GATA-2 occupies a conserved upstream region of the GATA-2 locus (–2.8 kb) in the active state. GATA-1-mediated repression of GATA-2 transcription was tightly coupled to GATA-1 occupancy and GATA-2 displacement from the –2.8-kb site. Endogenous GATA-1 displaced endogenous GATA-2 upon reintroduction of FOG-1 into FOG-1-null hematopoietic precursors, indicating that the “GATA switch” does not require GATA factor overexpression. FOG-1 co-localized with GATA-1 and GATA-2 at the –2.8-kb region, and FOG-1 was required for the GATA switch. Another component of the chromatin-associated GATA-2·FOG-1 complex is the histone acetyltransferase CBP (18Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). CBP occupied the –2.8- and –1.8-kb regions in the active state, and occupancy was reduced upon GATA-1 binding, which correlated with reduced di-acetylated histone H3 and multiacetylated histone H4 acetylation at the GATA-2 1S promoter and throughout the GATA-2 gene. The level of histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 at the GATA-2 domain was similar in the active and inactive state. These findings support a bimodal repression mechanism in which positive autoregulation conferred by GATA-2 binding to the –2.8-kb region is abrogated by GATA-1-mediated displacement of GATA-2. Subsequent to this GATA switch, complexes assemble that deacetylate the GATA-2 locus, thereby reducing chromatin accessibility and repressing transcription. Our previous analysis that revealed highly restricted GATA-1 occupancy of the –2.8-kb region of the GATA-2 locus utilized primer sets that amplified ∼100-bp DNA fragments residing ∼1 kb apart (18Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Because the input chromatin fragments averaged ∼500 bp, we reasoned that this primer set density would provide sufficient coverage of the locus for a first-generation analysis. Herein, we describe a high resolution analysis with an increased primer set density. This analysis confirmed the results of the previous GATA-2 analysis and work with the β-globin locus (20Johnson K.D. Grass J.D. Boyer M.E. Kiekhaefer C.M. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11760-11765Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), revealing considerable discrimination among the numerous GATA motifs in the genome. Most importantly, GATA-1 was shown to occupy an additional region of the GATA-2 locus, the –3.9-kb region, which contains two conserved GATA motifs. In the previous analysis (18Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), GATA-2 occupancy was only analyzed at the –2.8-kb region and at the 1S and 1G promoters; occupancy was detected solely at the –2.8-kb region. The high resolution analysis detected low GATA-2 occupancy at the –3.9-kb region. GATA-2 strongly occupied the –1.8-kb region, in which GATA-1 occupancy was lower than at the –3.9- and –2.8-kb regions. Combined with DNase I HS and functional analyses, these results considerably extend the previous analysis of the native nucleoprotein structure of the endogenous GATA-2 locus. These results are discussed vis à vis a model of GATA-2 transcriptional regulation involving dynamic GATA factor interplay at multiple upstream conserved regions.

RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RNA was prepared from the same cultures used for ChIP. Total RNA was purified with TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared by annealing RNA (1 μg) with 250 ng of a 5:1 mixture of random and oligo(dT) primers heated at 68 °C for 10 min. This was followed by incubation with 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) combined with 10 mm dithiothreitol (Invitrogen), 20 units of RNasin (Promega), and 0.5 mm dNTPs at 42 °C for 1 h.

Real-time PCR reactions (15 μl) contained 2 μl of cDNA, 7.5 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and the appropriate primers. Product accumulation was monitored by SYBR Green fluorescence. Control reactions lacking reverse transcriptase yielded very low or no signals.

Chromatin fragments averaged ∼500 bp for cells cross-linked with 0.4% formaldehyde, and larger fragments were isolated from the 1% formaldehyde cross-linked cells. Before tamoxifen treatment, cells were grown for 24 h in medium containing 15% charcoal-stripped FBS. Cells were then grown in 7.5% FBS, 7.5% charcoal-stripped FBS for 24 h and treated with 1 μm tamoxifen (Sigma) for the indicated times. In Fig. 1, cells were grown in medium containing 7.5% FBS, 7.5% charcoal-stripped FBS with or without 1 μm tamoxifen for 10 h.

In Fig. 3B, cells were treated for 12 h with 0, 8, 40, and 200 nm tamoxifen. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR (ABI Prism 7000, PE Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed by PRIMER EXPRESS 1.0 (PE Applied Biosystems) to amplify 50–150-bp amplicons and were based on GenBank™ accession number AB009272 and sequences in Ensembl (www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/geneview?gene=ENSMUSG00000015053). Samples from three or more immunoprecipitations were analyzed. Product was measured by SYBR green fluorescence in 15-μl reactions with 1 μl of sample.

Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—For transfection of G1E cells, DNA (4 μg) was diluted into 500 μl of Opti-MEM1-reduced serum medium per well. DMRIE-C reagent (4 μl) (Invitrogen) was diluted into 500 μl of Opti-MEM1-reduced serum medium per well. The DNA solution was combined with the DMRIE-C solution and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. G1E and MEL cells were isolated via centrifugation at 240 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. Cells were diluted to 5 × 106 per ml with Opti-MEM1-reduced serum medium. One million cells were added per well and incubated for 4.5 h at 37 °C. Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 15% FBS (for G1E cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% FBS and 7.5% calf serum (for MEL cells) was added (2 ml), and cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Cells were isolated by centrifugation at 240 × g at 4 °C and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity and protein concentration, and luciferase activity was normalized by the protein concentration of the lysate. Plasmid Construction—Upstream GATA-2 sequences were cloned from murine 129SV Bacterial Artificial Chromosome DNA isolated by Research Genetics/Invitrogen (Huntsville, AL). The integrity of cloned sequences was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The 1S promoter region was amplified with the following primers (5′ to 3′): F, TTTTC-CGCTCGAGGCCAGAAAGCCCCTGTCTG; R, TTTTGGAAGATCTGG-GAGACCTGAGCAGTGAGCT. The amplified fragment was digested with XhoI and BglII and ligated into the multiple cloning site of pGL3 to yield 1SLuc. The –3.9-kb region was amplified with the following primers: F, TTTTGGTACCACGCGAAGCCGCCAGGTGG; R, TTTTGA-GCTCACACAGCCCAGCCCGCCG. The amplified fragment was digested with KpnI and SacI and ligated into 1SLuc. The –2.8-kb region was amplified with the following primers: F, TTTTCGGGGTACCCCG-ACCCACGTGTTCCTCCAAA; R, TTTTCCGCTCGAGCGGTGGTGGA-GACGGGCA. The amplified fragment was digested with KpnI and XhoI and then ligated into 1SLuc. The –1.8-kb region was amplified with the following primers: F, TTTTCGGGGTACCCATATCCCTACCCAATAG-GAAGGG; R, TTTTCCGCTCGAGCTGTAGCCAGGGTTACTCTATGT-CTG. The amplified fragment was digested with KpnI and XhoI and then ligated into 1SLuc. The (–1.8mt)1S Luc construct lacking the double-GATA motif was generated by replacing the double-GATA motif (AGATAAGGCTTATCA) with a SalI site (GTCGAC). The (–2.8mt)1S Luc construct was generated by mutating each of the five GATA motifs as follows (5′ to 3′): TTATCA to TGCAAA (1); CGATAA to CAGACA (2); AGATAA to AAGACA (3); AGATAA to ATAATA (4); TTATCT to TATGAA (5). The sequence between GATA motifs 4 and 5 was changed from GATTGGCTATTC to GATAAGCTTTTC to insert a HindIII site. The (–3.9mt)1S Luc construct was generated by replacing the AGATAG site with an XbaI site (TCTAGA) and the CTATCT with a BamHI site (GGATCC). DNase I Hypersensitive Site Analysis—G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells were treated with or without 1 μm tamoxifen for 23 h. 2 × 107 cells per condition were collected by centrifugation at 240 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1.5 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5) and incubated for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 1.5 volumes of nuclei wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5), and collected again by centrifugation. Nuclei were then resuspended in 1 ml of nuclei wash buffer. Nuclei were divided into 200-μl aliquots, DNase I digestion was initiated by the addition of 0, 5, 7.5, or 15 units of DNase I (Worthington) for G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells and 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 units of DNase I for 3T3 cells. Reactions were incubated for 8 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of SDS stop buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 8.0) with vigorous mixing. Proteinase K (Promega) was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml, and reactions were incubated for at least 15 h at 37 °C. Purified genomic DNA (20 μg) was digested with 5 units/μg of EcoRI in a volume of 100 μl for 15 h at 37 °C. Chromosomal DNA fragments were used as size controls. The fragments were generated by sequential digestion of genomic DNA with EcoRI followed by BanI, MluI, or XhoI. Equal amounts of DNA (20 or 4 μg for size controls) were resolved on a 1.0% agarose gel and then analyzed by Southern blotting with a high specific activity random-primed 32P-labeled probe. After high stringency washing, radioactivity was measured by PhosphorImager analysis with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The probe, spanning the –1157-bp to –658-bp region of the GATA-2 locus, was generated by PCR amplification of plasmid DNA containing a portion of the upstream sequence of the GATA-2 locus using the primers (5′ to 3′) GCATGCCTAGATATATACACAAATGTAC (F) and CATTCCTTATAT-TATCCTAAACCCCT (R). Protein Analysis—Total protein was prepared by boiling cells for 10 min in SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) (1 × 107 cells/ml buffer). Extracts from 1.5 × 105 cells were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore), and analyzed by Western blotting for GATA-1. GATA-1 immunoreactivity was visualized using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Distinct Preferences for GATA-1 and GATA-2 Occupancy of Chromosomal Regions within the Endogenous GATA-2 Locus— The GATA-2 1S promoter (Fig. 1A) is active only in certain hematopoietic cell types, whereas the 1G promoter is active in these hematopoietic cells and in diverse cell types (26Menegishi N. Ohta J. Suwabe N. Nakauchi H. Ishihara H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3625-3634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To identify further determinants of hematopoietic specificity, we analyzed the sequence conservation of the GATA-2 locus using the VISTA program (27Mayor C. Brudno M. Schwartz J.R. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Pachter L.S. Dubchak I. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1046-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Three regions upstream of the 1S promoter exhibit greater than 75% sequence identity from mouse to man (Fig. 1A). These regions were designated –3.9, –2.8, and –1.8 kb based on their distance upstream of the 1S transcription start site. The –2.8-kb region corresponds to the region occupied by GATA-2 and GATA-1 in the active and inactive states of the locus, respectively (18Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Our previous ChIP analysis also detected low level GATA-1 occupancy at the –1.8-kb region; GATA-2 occupancy was not measured at this site nor at the –3.9-kb region (18Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A high resolution quantitative ChIP analysis was conducted to assess GATA-1 occupancy of upstream sequences of the GATA-2 locus in tamoxifen-treated G1E cells that stably express ER-GATA-1 (G1E-ER-GATA-1). GATA-2 occupancy was measured in untreated G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells, which express endogenous GATA-2. PCR amplicons spanned the 11 conserved GATA and WGATAR motifs from –4.7 to +0.7 kb (Fig. 1, A and B) as well as additional sequences containing nonconserved or no GATA motifs. Similar to our previous analysis (18Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), ER-GATA-1 occupancy was detected at the –2.8-kb amplicon and at the nearby –3.0-kb amplicon. Low level occupancy was detected at the –1.8-kb amplicon (Fig. 1C). High level occupancy was detected at the –3.9-kb amplicon, which contained two conserved WGATAR motifs. Previously, we had assessed occupancy near the –3.9-kb region with a primer set that amplified a sequence ∼300 bp upstream of the two GATA motifs (at –4.2 kb) (18Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Only low enrichments relative to the preimmune control were detected with the –4.2-kb primer set, which highlights the need to design amplicons as close as possible to prospective binding sequences, despite the size of chromatin fragments (∼500 bp). Additional weak signals were obtained at certain additional amplicons, but these signals were considerably lower than at the –2.8-kb region (Fig. 1C). In our previous analysis (18Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) GATA-2 occupancy was assessed at three regions, the –2.8-kb region and the 1S and 1G promoters. In the active state, GATA-2 occupied the –2.8-kb region but not the 1S and 1G promoters, and ER-GATA-1 rapidly abrogated GATA-2 occupancy. High resolution analysis of GATA-2 occupancy revealed strong enrichments at the –3.0-, –2.8-, and –1.8-kb amplicons (Fig. 1D). A considerably lower enrichment was detected at the –3.9-kb amplicon, where a high ER-GATA-1 enrichment was detected. No significant enrichments were detected at multiple additional amplicons. Importantly, these results indicate that the patterns of ER-GATA-1 and GATA-2 cross-linking to regions of the GATA-2 locus differ. Furthermore, these results reinforce our previous conclusion (18Grass J.A. Boyer M.E. Paul S. Wu J. Weiss M.J. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) that GATA factors discriminate exquisitely among the many GATA motifs of the GATA-2 locus. The distinct patterns of ER-GATA-1 and GATA-2 cross-linking might result from differential DNA recognition by ER-GATA-1 and GATA-2 or from differential stabilities of the prote"

As aspartyl protease inhibitors, these compounds all possess a core peptidomimetic structure together with flanking hydrophobic moieties. To determine the molecular basis for GLUT4 inhibition, a family of related oligopeptides containing structural elements found in PIs was screened for their ability to inhibit 2-deoxyglucose transport in primary rat adipocytes. The peptide oxybenzylcarbonyl-His-Phe-Phe-O-ethyl ester (zHFFe) was identified as a potent inhibitor of zero-trans glucose flux with a Ki of 26 μm. Similar to PIs, transport inhibition by this peptide was acute, noncompetitive, and reversible. Within a Xenopus oocyte expression system, zHFFe acutely and reversibly inhibited GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake, whereas GLUT1 activity was unaffected at concentrations as high as 1 mm. The related photoactivatable peptide zHFF-p-benzoylphenylalanine-[125I]Tyr-O-ethyl ester selectively labeled GLUT4 in rat adipocytes and indinavir effectively protected against photolabeling. Furthermore, GLUT4 bound to a peptide affinity column containing the zHFF sequence and was eluted by indinavir. These data establish a structural basis for PI effects on GLUT4 activity and support the direct binding of PIs to the transport protein as the mechanism for acute inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.

However, it is now recognized that these drugs directly contribute to several metabolic changes that significantly increase the risk of developing diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (2Carr A.

Insulin resistance appears early in the development of this dysmetabolic syndrome and can occur in the absence of lipodystrophy or hyperlipidemia (4Noor M. Lo J.C. Mulligan K. Halvorsen R. Schwarz J.M. Shambelan M. Grunfeld C. Antiviral Therapy. 2000; 5: 8Google Scholar). Although the complexity of drug regimens used during highly active antiretroviral therapy has complicated efforts to characterize adverse effects that are the direct result of PI use, a definitive link to the development of insulin resistance has been established by both in vitro and in vivo studies (5Murata H.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to mediate PI-induced insulin resistance including changes in insulin signaling (8Cammalleri C. Germinario R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 103-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Schutt M. Meier M. Meyer M. Klein J. Aries S.P. Klein H.H.

Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our previous studies establishing that the insulin-responsive facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 is acutely inhibited by PIs at pharmacologically relevant drug levels (12Murata H. Hruz P. Mueckler M. AIDS. 2002; 16: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) have identified a direct molecular target for the cellular effects of these drugs. Several observations support the hypothesis that GLUT4 inhibition is produced by direct, noncovalent binding of PIs to a unique structural domain within the transport molecule. 1) Inhibition of glucose transport by low micromolar concentrations of PIs is observed following maximal insulin stimulation with GLUT4 already translocated to the cell membrane. 2) Inhibition is also observed in a heterologous Xenopus oocyte expression system that is not insulinresponsive. 3) In this same system, GLUT1-mediated transport is unaffected by millimolar concentrations of the PI indinavir. 4) These effects are observed on a time scale of seconds to minutes and would thus be incompatible with changes in gene or protein expression. 5) The inhibitory effects in vitro and in vivo are readily reversible following removal of the drug. Despite these data, without direct evidence that PIs bind to GLUT4, it remains possible that the effects of PIs on GLUT4 activity are indirect. For example, the drugs could interact with a unique regulatory molecule that either binds to GLUT4 or reversibly alters its structure such as through phosphorylation. Elucidation of the specific structural features of PIs that confer their ability to inhibit GLUT4 would not only facilitate efforts to define the molecular mechanism for this effect but could also provide a rationale for a way to design newer generations of PIs that retain their efficacy in treating HIV infection without producing insulin resistance. We report here the identification of acute, potent, and isoform-selective peptide inhibitors of GLUT4 and provide evidence that this inhibition is because of direct binding of these compounds to the transporter protein.

Unless otherwise specified, all other reagents were acquired from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake Measurements in Primary Rat Adipocytes— Adipocytes were prepared from rat epididymal fat pads as described previously (8Cammalleri C. Germinario R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 103-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Adipocytes were stimulated with the addition of 1 μm insulin for 30 min at 37 °C immediately prior to use. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake measurements were performed by adding 200 μl of the cell suspension to 200 μl of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate Hepes buffer (KRB) (120 mm NaCl, 4 mm KH2 PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm NaHCO3, 200 nm adenosine, 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin together with the indicated concentration of peptide or indinavir in 5-ml plastic scintillation vials. After incubating the mixture for 1 min at 37 °C, the assay was initiated with the addition of 20 μl of [3H]2-deoxyglucose (final 2-deoxyglucose concentration of 50–200 μm; 0.5 μCi/assay). After 1 min at 37 °C, the assay was quenched by adding cytochalasin B to a final concentration of 40 μm. The cells were then immediately separated from labeling mix by spinning the reaction through dinonylphthalate as described previously (8Cammalleri C. Germinario R.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 103-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the intracellular radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Glucose Transport Activity in X. laevis Oocytes—X. laevis oocytes were prepared and microinjected as described previously with 50 ng of Glut isoform mRNA synthesized in vitro (9Schutt M. Meier M. Meyer M. Klein J. Aries S.P. Klein H.H. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Measurement of [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake was performed on groups of 15–20 oocytes in Barth's saline at 22 °C for 30 min. All assays were performed using 50 μm 2-deoxyglucose, 0.5 μCi/assay unless otherwise indicated. Peptides were added to the assay mixture 6 min prior to the initiation of uptake assays. Reactions were terminated by washing the oocytes with ice-cold Barth's saline containing 20 mm phloretin. Each oocyte was then transferred to an individual scintillation vial, solubilized in 1% SDS, and incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Radioiodination of z-His-Phe-Phe-Bpa-Tyr-O-Et—A 100 μm solution of z-His-Phe-Phe-Bpa-Tyr-O-Et in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (2.5 ml) was incubated with two Iodobeads and 100 μCi of Na125I at room temperature with gentle agitation for 30 min. The beads were then removed and the solution was applied to a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge pre-equilibrated with distilled water. The cartridge was washed 3 times with 5 ml of water, and the peptide was eluted with 1 ml of Me2SO. Yield and purity were assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis in comparison to a known amount of z-His-Phe-Phe-O-Et labeled with cold NaI. The amount of 125I-labeled peptide was assessed by liquid scintillation counting, and the efficiency of labeling was estimated from the yield of radiolabeled peptide divided by the total peptide concentration. Affinity Labeling of Primary Rat Adipocytes—Primary rat adipocytes were incubated with 1–20 μm radiolabeled z-His-Phe-Phe-Bpa-[125I]Tyr-O-Et in KRB at room temperature in a 60-mm Petri dish. The photolabel was activated by exposure to 254 nm UV light with three successive cycles of 30 s of light followed by 30 s of darkness (total UV exposure 90 s). The adipocytes were then collected on ice into a 5-ml centrifuge tube containing PE200 tubing and spun at 200 rpm for 4 min. The layer below the floating adipocytes was removed via the PE200 tubing, and the adipocytes were washed three times with 4 ml of ice-cold KRB to remove any unreacted peptide. Samples were then stored at –20 °C. Peptide Affinity Chromatography—The peptide z-His-Phe-Phe-Phe-Lys was attached via amide linkage to aminolink-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's specifications. Prior to each experiment, the column was equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Purified primary rat adipocytes were lysed by rapid freeze thawing in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% decylmaltoside and Sigma protease inhibitor mixture, centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant fatty layer was carefully removed. The remaining cell lysate was applied to the peptide column, which was then washed with 3-column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. The bound transporter was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 μm indinavir. The column effluent was collected in 0.5-ml fractions. The protein in each fraction was quantified by the BCA assay. SDS PAGE was performed by loading 5 μg of protein onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Protein staining was assessed with Ruby Red dye. GLUT4 content was assessed by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody directed toward the carboxyl terminus of rat GLUT4. Aromatic Peptide Effects on GLUT4 Activity—All HIV protease inhibitors share a similar core structure that resembles the aromatic peptide backbone that acts as the native substrate for the HIV type 1 protease (Fig. 1). We therefore hypothesized that synthetic peptides containing this basic structure would serve as effective inhibitors of glucose transport. To test this hypothesis we screened a family of aromatic di- and tripeptides for their affects on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in primary rat adipocytes, which predominately express the insulin-responsive facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 (13Holman G.D. Kozka I.J. Clark A.E. Flower C.J. Saltis J. Habberfield A.D. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18172-18179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the addition of 200 μm each peptide to primary rat adipocytes, four compounds were identified with significant inhibitory effects on zero-trans 2-deoxyglucose flux (Fig. 2). Like PIs, all four of these peptides contain a highly aromatic core peptide structure flanked by hydrophobic moieties. None of the peptides with charged amino or carboxyl termini affected transport activity. The most potent inhibitor of glucose transport identified in this screen was z-His-Phe-Phe-O-Et (zHFFe), which is also a known substrate for the aspartyl protease pepsin (14Inouye K. Voynick I.M. Delpierre G.R. Fruton J.S. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 2473-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Inhibition of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by aromatic peptides in primary rat adipocytes. Aromatic peptides (200 μm) were added 1 min prior to measuring [3H]2-deoxyglucose transport activity (50 μm, 1 min at 37 °C).

Asterisks (*) indicate p < 0.05 as determined by an analysis of variance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetic Characterization of the Inhibition of GLUT4 by z-His-Phe-Phe-O-Et—The ability of zHFFe to impair glucose transport was further investigated by studying the concentration dependence for inhibition in both primary rat adipocytes and Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing the rat GLUT4 transporter isoform. As the Dixon plots shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate, this peptide acutely inhibited glucose transport in a concentration-dependent manner in both cell types. The apparent binding affinities for the peptide differed considerably between the adipocytes and oocytes, with Kis of 26 ± 2 and 205 ± 5 μm, respectively. This difference is comparable with that seen with indinavir-mediated inhibition of glucose uptake in these two cell types (5Murata H. Hruz P.W. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20251-20254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 12Murata H. Hruz P. Mueckler M. AIDS. 2002; 16: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The intercept on the negative x-axis is indicative of noncompetitive inhibition under the kinetic conditions used, which is also identical to the inhibition pattern observed for indinavir in primary rat and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (12Murata H. Hruz P. Mueckler M. AIDS. 2002; 16: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Because of the rapidity of the inhibitory effects of zHFFe (occurring within minutes after adding the drug) in adipocytes following insulin stimulation, it is unlikely that zHFFe produces its effect through alterations in insulin signaling or GLUT4 translocation. This is further supported by the inhibitory effect of this peptide in the Xenopus oocyte system, in which cell surface expression of the glucose transporter is independent of insulin signaling (15Keller K. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18884-18889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isoform Selectivity and Reversibility of zHFFe Effects on Glucose Transport—One of the distinguishing features of PI-mediated effects on glucose transport is their selectivity for inhibition of GLUT4. In the Xenopus oocyte system, GLUT1 is resistant to inhibition by indinavir at millimolar concentrations, whereas GLUT4 is highly sensitive with a Ki of ∼50 μm (12Murata H. Hruz P. Mueckler M. AIDS. 2002; 16: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To determine the isoform selectivity of zHFFe, oocytes injected with mRNA for GLUTs 1–4 were tested for their sensitivity to acute and reversible inhibition of zero-trans 2-deoxyglucose transport. As shown in Fig. 4A, only GLUT4 was inhibited by 250 μm peptide, whereas concentrations of zH-FFe up to 1 mm had no effect on GLUT1 or GLUT3. A small (32%) but statistically insignificant (p = 0.087) reduction in GLUT2 activity was observed with 1 mm zHFFe. This compares favorably with the behavior of PIs, which have been shown to inhibit GLUT2 at high concentrations in Xenopus oocytes (12Murata H. Hruz P. Mueckler M. AIDS. 2002; 16: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, acute inhibition of GLUT4 was fully reversible following removal of the peptide. Full restoration of transport activity was observed irrespective of the time in which the oocytes were exposed to drug (1–30 min, data not shown). Photolabeling with a Reactive Peptide Derivative—Having identified zHFFe as a peptide-based inhibitor of GLUT4 that shares inhibitory characteristics identical to those observed with the PI indinavir, a radiolabeled and photoreactive derivative of this peptide was synthesized and used to test the hypothesis that transport inhibition is due to a direct binding of the drug to the transport protein. The peptide z-His-Phe-Phe-Bpa-Tyr-O-Et was found to effectively inhibit glucose transport in primary rat adipocytes with a binding affinity comparable with the parent zHFFe compound (Fig. 5A). When the adipocytes were exposed to UV light to activate the Bpa residue, a concentration-dependent and irreversible inhibition of transport activity by the photactivatable peptide was observed (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 6A, UV light exposure resulted in the photolabeling of a 50-kDa protein that corresponded precisely with the molecular mass of GLUT4. The degree of labeling directly correlated with the time of exposure to the UV light and was specific for this protein with up to 3 min of light exposure (data not shown). Because a large radioactive signal was present at the bottom of the gel, reflecting unbound peptide, it was not possible to definitively exclude the additional modification of a small molecular mass protein <10 kDa. Although initial attempts to immunoprecipitate the radiolabeled protein with polyclonal antibody directed toward the carboxyl terminus of GLUT4 were unsuccessful, the radiolabeled protein was effectively immunoprecipitated by affinity-purified polyclonal GLUT4 antibody recognizing epitopes throughout the transporter Fig. 6B. Moreover, indinavir effectively protected against photolabeling. Together, these observations support the conclusion that the photolabel is bound to the same GLUT4 site as PIs.Fig. 6Photoaffinity labeling of GLUT4 with z-His-Phe-Phe-Bpa-[125I]Tyr-O-Et. A, SDS-PAGE analysis of primary rat adipocytes treated with 4 μm of photoactivated z-His-Phe-Phe-Bpa-[125I]Tyr-O-Et in the presence or absence of 500 μm indinavir. Total cell homogenates (10 μg/lane) were analyzed by Western blot analysis with polyclonal antibody directed toward the carboxyl terminus of GLUT4 (Western) or autoradiography (Autorad) to determine incorporated 125I label. B, the total cellular homogenates from photolabeled rat adipocytes were immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed toward partially purified GLUT4 and subjected to either Western blot analysis using the GLUT4 carboxyl-terminal antibody or autoradiography. Each lane contains 20 μg of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Peptide Affinity Chromatography—The relative ease in modifying the core zHFF epitope that confers selective binding to GLUT4 provided a means to further investigate the relationship between aromatic peptide and PI-mediated inhibition of glucose transport. The peptide z-His-Phe-Phe-Phe-Lys, which contains the zHFF epitope, was linked to an agarose resin to generate an affinity column which could bind GLUT4. As shown in Fig. 7, when homogenates of primary rat adipocytes were applied to this resin, immunoreactive GLUT4 was found to bind to this column and could be selectively eluted with 500 μm indinavir. The native structure of GLUT4 appeared to be necessary for this interaction, because boiling of the adipocytes homogenate prior to loading the peptide column resulted in no immunodetectable GLUT4 binding to the column (data not shown). Given the crystal-structure based rationale design of PIs, which target an aspartyl protease that selectively cleaves Phe-Pro and Tyr-Pro bonds in a large polyprotein precursor of the developing HIV virus, it is not surprising that all of the currently available PIs contain some elementary aromatic peptidomimetic structure. The ability of these compounds to alter the intrinsic activity of facilitative glucose transporters, however, was an entirely unforeseen effect of these drugs. Because of the indisputable clinical utility of PIs in reducing HIV-associated morbidity and mortality (17Schwarcz S.K. Hsu L.C. Vittinghoff E. Katz M.H. Am. J. Epidemiol. 2000; 152: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), PIs are likely to remain a corner-stone of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Continuing efforts are clearly needed to design newer generations of PIs that retain their clinical utility without producing their adverse effects on glucose disposal. Although millimolar concentrations of dipeptide metalloproteinase substrates have previously been reported to inhibit glucose uptake into rat adipocytes (18Aiello L.P. Wessling-Resnick M. Pilch P.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3944-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the relatively high concentrations of peptides required to inhibit transport in these studies made it difficult to determine whether this effect was because of nonspecific cellular changes. The identification of high affinity, isoform-selective, reversible peptide-based inhibitors of facilitative glucose transport proteins together with the successful photolabeling of GLUT4 with a derivative of this peptide identifies a direct molecular mechanism for the inhibition of GLUT4 by these peptides and PIs. Because the peptidomimetic phenylalanine moiety is the only feature that is consistently shared between PIs and the newly identified peptide inhibitors, this structure is likely to be a primary determinant in conferring the ability to inhibit GLUT4 activity. The shared participation of this structural feature in the binding of PIs to both the HIV protease and GLUT4 may present a challenge in new drug design. Attempts to change this core structure to prevent GLUT4 inactivation may render the candidate drug ineffective in inactivating the HIV protease. The recent development of atazanavir, a PI that does not appear to alter glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (19Wang S. Mulvey R. Laing N. Leet J. Flint J. Parker R.A. Antiviral Therapy. 2002; 7 (abstr.): L6Google Scholar), provides optimism that the problem of GLUT4 inactivation by PIs can be circumvented. Reflecting the close correlation between the effects of PIs on GLUT4 activity in vitro and insulin sensitivity in vivo, atazanavir does not appear to contribute to changes in glucose homeostasis in HIV-infected patients who have been treated with this drug (20Murphy, R., Pokrovsky, V., and Rozenbaum, W. (2003) in Proceedings and Abstracts of the 10th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (Boston), February 10–14, 2003, Abstract 555, Foundation for Retrovirology and Human Health, Alexandria, VAGoogle Scholar). Atazanavir differs from the other available PIs in several respects. Although atazanavir contains a similar peptide-like core, with two phenylalanine-like structures arranged in a unique C-2 axis of symmetry, an additional pyridine ring is attached to one of the phenylalanine residues (Fig. 1). Although the location of the GLUT4 domain involved in PI binding remains to be identified, it is possible that this additional ring structure sterically prevents access of the drug to this region of the protein. Atazanavir also differs from other PIs by lacking the same degree of hydrophobicity in the flanking structural domains. Although the mechanism by which these hydrophobic moieties contribute to GLUT4 inhibition remains to be determined, all of the peptide inhibitors identified in this study contain an oxobenzylcarbonyl group at the amino terminus of the peptide. It is possible that this hydrophobicity facilitates entry of the drugs into the cell, thereby allowing access to a GLUT4 binding domain on the cytosolic surface of the transporter. The involvement of a cytosolic binding domain is suggested by our observation that the affinity-labeled transporter could not be immunoprecipitated using an antibody directed toward the carboxyl terminus. This could either be because of direct steric interference of the affinity label or an inhibitor-induced change in the protein conformation that leads to masking of this epitope. Because the epitope was recognized in the denatured protein on Western blots, the latter appears more likely. Unmasking of the carboxyl terminus of GLUT4 in response to insulin treatment has previously been reported in both primary rat adipocytes (21Smith R.M. Charron M.J. Shah N. Lodish H.F. Jarett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6893-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle (22Wang W. Hansen P.A. Marshall B.A. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 415-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that this unmasking may contribute, together with GLUT4 translocation, to the activation of this transporter following insulin stimulation. The identification of peptide inhibitors thus raises the interesting possibility that an endogenous protein or peptide interacts at this same location to regulate GLUT4 intrinsic activity. Although the current study supports the hypothesis that PIs directly bind to GLUT4 in vitro, it remains possible that these drugs also interact with other molecules in vivo to alter glucose homeostasis and/or contribute to the other adverse metabolic effects observed during PI containing highly active antiretroviral therapy. Several recent studies have implied direct effects of PIs on glucose stimulated insulin release (16Woerle H.J. Mariuz P.R. Meyer C. Reichman R.C. Popa E.M. Dostou J.M. Welle S.L. Gerich J.E. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 918-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Koster J.C. Remedi M.S. Qiu H. Nichols C.G. Hruz P.W. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1695-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although the differences observed in the ability of PIs and the peptide inhibitors to inhibit GLUT4 when measured in primary adipocytes versus oocytes may be merely reflective of differences in the assay procedures used, it is also possible that GLUT4 sensitivity is dependent upon the membrane environment of the transporter. If this is true, significant effects of zHFFe on GLUT2 activity in β-cells and/or hepatocytes may still occur at pharmacologically relevant drug levels. Future studies will be needed to determine whether these newly identified peptide inhibitors or related proteins are capable of photoaffinity labeling glucose transporters and/or other proteins in other tissues involved in glucoregulation, including skeletal muscle. In addition to their utility in assisting the development of newer and safer PIs, the relative ease in designing and modifying peptide-based GLUT inhibitors provides a new approach to the development of reagents to study facilitative glucose transport. The unique selectivity of PIs and the newly identified peptide inhibitors of GLUT4 provide a facile way to acutely and reversibly induce insulin resistance in cell culture and whole animal model systems. With a more detailed understanding of the structural basis for PI binding to GLUT4, it may be possible to design additional reagents that selectively interact with other GLUT isoforms."

Among these proteins is ecm29p, a 200-kDa yeast protein that contains numerous HEAT repeats as well as a putative VHS domain. Higher eukaryotes possess a well conserved homolog of yeast ecm29p, and we produced antibodies to three peptides in the human Ecm29 sequence. The antibodies show that Ecm29 is present exclusively on 26 S proteasomes in HeLa cells and that Ecm29 levels vary markedly among mouse organs. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy localizes Ecm29 to the centrosome and a subset of secretory compartments including endosomes, the ER and the ERGIC. Ecm29 is up-regulated 2-3-fold in toxinresistant mutant CHO cells exhibiting increased rates of ER-associated degradation.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2733-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), the selective degradation of proteins is the principal way in which Ub controls cellular processes (12Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The exquisite selectivity exhibited by Ub-mediated proteolysis is provided by several hundred Ub ligases, the E3 recognition components of the system (13Fang S. Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar, 15Ulrich H.D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 268: 137-174PubMed Google Scholar). The Ub ligases collaborate with a smaller number of Ub carrier proteins, the E2s, to add poly(Ub) chains onto ϵ-amino groups of lysines in the protein substrates. The poly(Ub) chains in turn target the marked proteins to the 26 S proteasome, a large ATP-dependent protease, for degradation. The 26 S proteasome is formed by the binding of 19 S regulatory complexes (RCs) to one or both ends of the cylindrical 20 S proteasome, the proteolytic component of the 26 S enzyme. The 19 S RC provides subunits that recognize, unfold, and transfer substrate polypeptides to the central chamber of the 20 S proteasome where they are degraded (16Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The foregoing account would suggest that there are only two forms of the 26 S proteasome, one with a single 19 S RC cap and one doubly capped. However, a number of proteins associate either with the 19 S RC or with the 20 S proteasome. In eukaryotes, PA200 and PA28 (or REG) are two proteasome activators that, like the RC, bind the ends of the 20 S proteasome (17Rechsteiner M. Realini C. Ustrell V. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Ustrell V. Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3403-3412Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Since there are two ends to the cylindrical 20 S proteasome, the enzyme can simultaneously bind a PA200 or a PA28 and a 19 S RC, thereby forming hybrid proteasomes (19Hendil K.B. Khan S. Tanaka K. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The 19 S RC associates with a larger set of proteins, many of which are components of the Ub system. For example, Ub isopeptidases form reasonably stable associations with the 26 S proteasome (20Glickman M.H. Adir N. PloS. Biol. 2004; 2: E13Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and several Ub ligases interact with 26 S proteasomes (21Corn P.G. McDonald E.R. Herman 3rd J.G. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Sakata E. Yamaguchi Y. Kurimoto E. Kikuchi J. Yokoyama S. Yamada S. Kawahara H. Yokosawa H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Tanaka K.

Aoki T. Tamura T.A. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23369-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An even larger number of proteins have been identified as interacting partners of individual RC subunits, especially the ATPases (25Ferrell K. Wilkinson C.R. Dubiel W. Gordon C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Whereas some of these proteins may be substrates, others may function as adaptors that recruit substrates to the 26 S proteasome or localize the enzyme within cells (26Hartmann-Petersen R. Seeger M. Gordon C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 26-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It now appears that 26 S proteasomes have a dynamic composition in which a core of about 30 different subunits associates with perhaps a greater number of accessory proteins that assist in substrate degradation. Recently, several proteomic screens identified the yeast protein ecm29p as a 26 S proteasome-associated component (27Gavin A.C. Bösche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J.

Two days after transfection, cells were fixed with methanol and stained with anti-His (1:40) monoclonal antibodies (Novagen) and rabbit anti-Ecm29-3 antiserum. African Green Monkey COS7 were transfected with the ataxin-7-Q86 plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000™ and intranuclear polyQ aggregates were detected with rabbit anti-His (1:50) polyclonal antibodies (abcam). Expression of Tagged Versions of Mouse Ecm29 in Cultured Cells—A cDNA encoding mouse Ecm29 (96% identity to human Ecm29) cloned into the pXY vector was purchased from Open Biosystems and used as template for the polymerase chain reaction. The resulting DNA was subcloned at the BamHI/SalI sites of pFLAG-CMV (Sigma) or pGFP-N1 (Clontech). Transfections of HeLa, HEK293, and COS7 cells were performed with Lipofectamine 2000™ according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunofluorescence, HeLa and COS7 cells grown on coverslips were transfected with 5 μg of total plasmid DNA, fixed in methanol at -20 °C 2 days after transfection and processed as described below. HEK293 cells grown on T-25 flasks (Corning) were transfected with 10 μg of pFLAG-CMV-Ecm29 and harvested 19 h after transfection. Cells were homogenized in buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose and sedimented through a 5-ml 10-30% glycerol gradient as described above. Fractions were assayed for peptidase activity in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP and analyzed by denaturing or non-denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2™ monoclonal antibodies (1:400). Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells grown on coverslips were washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 10 min or in 2 or 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C. When cells were fixed in methanol, Ecm29 antibodies were used at dilution of 1:100 for anti-Ecm29-1, 1:50 for anti-Ecm29-2 or 1:200 for anti-Ecm29-3. Conversely, when cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde anti-Ecm29-1 and anti-Ecm29-2 were used at a dilution of 1:10. Antibodies to subcellular compartments were used as followed: anti-ERGIC-53, 1:500; anti-golgin-97, 1:25; anti-KDEL, 1:100; anti-mannose-6-phosphate receptor, 1:50; anti-transferrin receptor, 1:25; and anti-γ-tubulin, 1:10,000. Endocytic vesicles were stained by continuous labeling in the presence of 1 mg/ml Alexa® 488-dextran conjugate for 30 or 60 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Polyclonal antibodies to S7 were used at 1:10 whereas anti-β3 was used at 1:25. After paraformaldehyde fixation, cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 10% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0 with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated with primary or secondary antibodies in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Fluorescent secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:500. After incubation with antibodies, cells were washed six times in TBST for 5 min each at room temperature. Fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on an Olympus FVX confocal microscope equipped with argon 488 and krypton 568/647 lasers using a 60X PlanApo 1.4 NA oil objective and Fluoview 2.13.9 software. The relative amounts of Ecm29 and cellular markers at specific subcellular locations were estimated using Volocity v2.0, a volume rendering and three-dimensional quantification software (Improvision). Amino Acid Sequence of Human Ecm29 (hEcm29)—From the human genome data base and EST libraries we assembled a putative full-length sequence for human Ecm29 (Fig. 1A) that is identical to the KIAA0368 protein reported in the latest GenBank™ release. Human Ecm29 is 1839 amino acids long, and Prosite analysis reveals the presence of a possible bipartite nuclear targeting signal (highlighted green in Fig. 1A). The N-terminal sequence of human Ecm29 (highlighted black in Fig. 1A) is one of three alternative N-terminal sequences encoded by human, mouse, and rat ESTs derived from brain, retina, testis, and ovary: MYHIDCRDqler (most highly represented); MAAAAASASQDELNqler; and METGSDSDqler. All known Ecm29 sequences exhibit an apparent modular structure consisting of HEAT repeats (at least 23 in hEcm29; diamonds in Fig. 1B) (35Kajava A.V. Gorbea C. Ortega J. Rechsteiner M. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a region with sequence homology to VHS domains (36Lohi O. Poussu A. Mao Y. Quiocho F. Lehto V-P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (highlighted pink in Fig. 1A), and two potential helical regions with homology to conserved sequences in β-adaptins (highlighted orange in Fig. 1A) that we call HANT domains (homology to adaptins Nterminus). PSI-BLAST reiterative analysis of the GenBank™ data base using the entire human Ecm29 sequence revealed that HEAT repeats within the C-terminal half of Ecm29 show highest similarity to HEAT motifs of the translational activator GCN1 and importin β2 (E values < e-60 after 5 iterations) (35Kajava A.V. Gorbea C. Ortega J. Rechsteiner M. Steven A.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 47Andrade M.A. Petosa C. O'Donoghue S.I. Müller C.W. Bork P J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). A similar computational analysis indicated highest similarity between the VHS-like region of human Ecm29 (residues 893-1038; pink rectangle in Fig. 1B) and the VHS domain of hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) (E values e-07-e-10 after 5 iterations). However, unlike the VHS domain of Hrs and other proteins, the VHS-like region of Ecm29 is not present at the N terminus of the molecule (Fig. 1). Antibodies to Human Ecm29 —Antibodies were generated to synthetic peptides corresponding to the three sequences underlined in red in Fig. 1. Western blots of HeLa cell extracts using the resulting antisera identified a 205-kilodalton polypeptide, the size expected for hEcm29 (Fig. 2A). A survey of mouse organs using the three anti-peptide antibodies revealed that the levels of Ecm29 vary considerably, being particularly high in testis and brain, low in liver, and almost undetectable in heart or kidney (Fig. 2B). By contrast, the levels of S10b, a 19 S RC ATPase, were highest in testis, lowest in pancreas, and relatively uniform in the rest of the organs (Fig. 2 B). Two of the three antisera recognized a slower migrating form of Ecm29 in brain (arrows in Fig. 2B) and some mouse and human brain ESTs contain open reading frames extending beyond the initial Met residue of Ecm29 (not shown). Presumably, alternative splicing gives rise to a longer form as well as smaller Ecm29 species present in brain. The patterns generated by the three antibodies were similar in testis, lung, and spleen and in other organs (pancreas, liver, and kidney) differed at most in minor aspects leaving little doubt that Ecm29 is the protein that was detected by the three anti-peptide antibodies. Association of hEcm29 with the 26 S Proteasome Is Detergent-sensitive and Reversible—To determine if human Ecm29 associates with the 26 S proteasome, HeLa cells were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, and the distribution of proteasome activity was determined after sedimentation of the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction on a 10-30% glycerol gradient. Samples from the various fractions were subjected to native or SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, virtually all HeLa Ecm29 is bound to the 26 S proteasome after homogenization in sucrose. This is particularly clear by comparing the location of 26 S proteasomes evident from fluorogenic peptide overlay (second panel) with the Western blot of the same gel (third panel). Except for a minor immunoreactive band (possibly the 19 S RC), directly below the two enzymatically active species of 26 S proteasome, HeLa Ecm29 migrated with the large, ATP-dependent protease. A Western blot of SDS-PAGE transfers (bottom panel) confirmed that the immunoreactivity on the native gel transfer is present as the 205-kilodalton polypeptide expected for Ecm29 (Fig. 3A, bottom panel). A much different distribution of Ecm29 was observed after extraction of HeLa cells in buffer containing Triton X-100. Ecm29 was no longer associated with the 26 S proteasome but sedimented with apparent molecular weights ranging from 200 to 600 kDa (Fig. 3B). Western blots of native gel transfers showed several forms of hEcm29 that migrated as a smear on native gels; faster sedimenting species present in fractions 15-20 barely entered the gel whereas slower sedimenting species found in fractions 21-25 formed a distinct band. During partial purification of Ecm29 from detergent extracts of bovine brain, the protein exhibited similar properties. Ecm29 from more purified preparations (i.e. after Mono-Q chromatography) sedimented as a monomer on a sucrose gradient and migrated fastest on a native gel (Fig. 3, C and D). Presumably, slower migrating and faster sedimenting detergent-released Ecm29 molecules either form multimers or are associated with proteasome subcomplexes or possibly with other cellular components. Fractions containing proteasome-free hEcm29 were pooled, dialyzed, concentrated, and mixed with detergent-stripped HeLa 26 S proteasomes. Following re-centrifugation substantial amounts of Ecm29 once again sedimented with the 26 S proteasome, indicating that detergent extraction does not prevent reassociation of Ecm29 with the 26 S proteasome (Fig. 3E). Subcellular Localization of Mammalian Ecm29 —Staining of HeLa cells with anti-Ecm29-1 or anti-Ecm29-3 resulted in predominantly cytoplasmic fluorescence that was virtually absent in cells stained with preimmune serum and was blocked by preincubation with the cognate peptide (Fig. 4). At low PMT/gain exposures there was intense juxtanuclear staining in most HeLa cells. Confocal images of cells stained with both anti-Ecm29 and anti-γ-tubulin identified this region as the centrosome (Fig. 5, A-C). In addition to the centrosomal location, higher PMT/gain exposures showed that HeLa Ecm29 was present in a cytoplasmic vesicular pattern. To determine whether Ecm29 was localized to a particular set of membrane compartments we collected confocal images from HeLa cells stained with anti-Ecm29 and various compartment-specific antibodies. The images in Fig. 5, D-L show that Ecm29 partially overlapped with anti-KDEL, a monoclonal antibody against the retention signal of ER-resident proteins, and with ERGIC-53, a marker of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (37Hauri H.P. Nufer O. Breuza L. Tekaya H.B. Liang L. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; 69: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The extent of overlap between Ecm29 and the ER/ERGIC compartments increased substantially when both anti-KDEL and anti-ERGIC-53 were incubated simultaneously with anti-Ecm29 (Fig. 5, J-L) indicating that Ecm29 is present"
https://openalex.org/W2059592563,"PIB-type ATPases have an essential role maintaining copper homeostasis. Metal transport by these membrane proteins requires the presence of a transmembrane metal occlusion/binding site. Previous studies showed that Cys residues in the H6 transmembrane segment are required for metal transport. In this study, the participation in metal binding of conserved residues located in transmembrane segments H7 and H8 was tested using CopA, a model Cu+-ATPase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Four invariant amino acids in the central portion of H7 (Tyr682 and Asn683) and H8 (Met711 and Ser715) were identified as required for Cu+ binding. Replacement of these residues abolished enzyme activity. These proteins did not undergo Cu+-dependent phosphorylation by ATP but were phosphorylated by Pi in the absence of Cu+. Moreover, the presence of Cu+ could not prevent the enzyme phosphorylation by Pi. Other conserved residues in the H7-H8 region were not required for metal binding. Mutation of two invariant Pro residues had little effect on enzyme function. Replacement of residues located close to the cytoplasmic end of H7-H8 led to inactive enzymes. However, these were able to interact with Cu+ and undergo phosphorylation. This suggests that the integrity of this region is necessary for conformational transitions but not for ligand binding. These data support the presence of a unique transmembrane Cu+ binding/translocation site constituted by Tyr-Asn in H7, Met and Ser in H8, and two Cys in H6 of Cu+-ATPases. The likely Cu+ coordination during transport appears distinct from that observed in Cu+ chaperone proteins or catalytic/redox metal binding sites.

Cu+-ATPases play an essential role maintaining copper homeostasis. For instance, mutations of the human Cu+-ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B, leads to Menkes' and Wilson's disease, respectively (1Hsi G.

Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these, occluded cations are bound within the structure of the protein and cannot exchange with cations in the media. Assuming a common mechanism, a transmembrane site transiently binding/coordinating the metal during transport can be postulated as a required component of Cu+-ATPases. This Cu+ transport site is likely to bind the metal in a distinct manner from those observed in N-MBDs and Cu+ chaperones or other proteins where metals play a catalytic or structural function. The current understanding of heavy metal binding by transmembrane transporters is limited. By analogy with organometallic complexes or known metalloprotein structures, it can be hypothesized that histidyl, sulfydryl, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups might participate in metal coordination during transport. In this direction, the involvement of conserved transmembrane His, Glu, and Ser in Fe2+ binding by Arabidopsis IRT1 (a member of the ZIP family of transporters) has been proposed (28Rogers E.E. Eide D.J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12356-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar).

These enzymes coordinate the occluded cations via oxygen atoms in side chains of conserved amino acids located in TMs flanking the large cytoplasmic loop (H4, H5, and H6). These TMs would be equivalent to H6, H7, and H8 in the Cu+-ATPases (8Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 41Palmgren M.G.

For instance, replacement of Cys in the CPC of Escherichia coli CopA resulted in loss of copper resistance, transport, and phosphoenzyme formation (10Fan B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46987-46992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Similar replacements in Archaeoglobus fulgidus CopA produced inactive enzymes that bind the nucleotide but are unable to form the phosphorylated intermediate in the presence of Cu+ and ATP (13Mandal A.K. Argüello J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11040-11047Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, it might be considered that all enzymes transporting either monovalent (Cu+ and Ag+) or divalent (Zn2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+) metals carry the CPC in their H6 (3Hirayama T. Kieber J.J. Hirayama N.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3712-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Consequently, other residues must also interact with the metal in order to confer enzyme selectivity. In this direction, we have recently proposed that conserved residues in H7 and H8 also contribute to metal coordination (9Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Analysis of conserved residues in the PIB-type ATPase transmembrane region revealed unique invariant sequences in H7-H8 that appear associated with distinct metal selectivity. These signature sequences allowed the classification of these ATPases into at least five separate subgroups (PIB-1–PIB-5) (9Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the case of Cu+-ATPases, the sequence NX(6)YNX(4)PX(5,25)PX(6)MXXSSXXVXX[NS] is conserved in more than 100 analyzed proteins (PIB-1 subgroup). Here, the variable region (X(5,25)) corresponds to the extracellular/luminal loop joining H7 and H8. The two flanking Pro are likely close to the extracellular/luminal loop, whereas there would be an Asn (or Ser) near the cytoplasmic end of H7 and H8 (Fig. 2). This hypothetical distribution places side chains suitable for metal coordination, the Tyr-Asn pair in H7 and the Met and two Ser in H8, in a central position close to the Cys in H6 already postulated as part of the transmembrane Cu+ binding sites. In this work, we have tested the hypothesis that conserved residues in the H7-H8 hairpin of Cu+-ATPases are required for metal coordination during transport. We used CopA, a Cu+-ATPase from the thermophile A. fulgidus, as a model for these studies. We have shown that this protein can be heterologously expressed in E. coli, isolated in a soluble form, and functionally characterized in detail (11Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 13Mandal A.K. Argüello J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11040-11047Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Studies of CopA have described the regulatory role of metal binding to its N-MBD and the required presence of Cys in its H6 (13Mandal A.K. Argüello J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11040-11047Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Those amino acids conserved in all Cu+-ATPases H7-H8, as well as some variable residues, were replaced by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting mutant proteins were functionally characterized. Our findings indicate that amino acids both in the central region of H7 and H8 and in the cytoplasmic end of these TMs are required for enzyme function. Moreover, four of them (Asn and Tyr in H7, Met and Ser in H8) probably participate in metal coordination. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Protein Expression—A. fulgidus CopA cDNA cloned into pCRT7/NT-TOPO/His vector (Invitrogen) was used as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers were designed to introduce the following modifications: N675A, Y682A, Y682S, N683A, N683Q, I685E, I685T, L686A, P688A, P704A, M711A, M711C, S714A, S714T, S715A, S715T, V718E, and N721A. Mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. BL21Star™ (DE3)pLysS E. coli cells (Invitrogen) carrying vector pSJS1240 encoding for rare tRNAs (tRNAAGA/AGGArg and tRNAAUAIle) (47Kim R. Sandler S.J. Goldman S. Yokota H. Clark A.J. Kim S-H. Biotech. Lett. 1988; 20: 207-210Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar), were used for expressing the substituted proteins after induction with 0.75 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Enzyme Preparation—Enzyme was prepared as described before (11Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were isolated from cells expressing the wild type (WT) CopA or the indicated mutants and treated with 0.75% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM). The solubilized His6-tagged proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column. All procedures were performed at 0–4 °C. Protein was measured in accordance with Bradford (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211864) Google Scholar). After purification, proteins were stored in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% DDM, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at -80 °C. Functional Assays—Cu+-dependent ATPase activity and phosphorylation by ATP assays were performed as described earlier (11Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity assay was performed at 75 °C in a medium containing 50 mm Tris, pH (75 °C) 6.1, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 20 mm cysteine, 0.01% asolectin, 0.01% DDM, 400 mm NaCl, 50 μm CuSO4, 2.5 mm DTT, and 0.01 mg/ml purified enzyme. Enzyme phosphorylation with ATP was carried out at 37 °C in a medium containing 50 mm Tris, pH (20 °C) 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 0.04 mm EGTA, 20 mm cysteine, 0.01% asolectin, 0.01% DDM, 400 mm NaCl, 20% Me2SO, 100 μm CuSO4, 2.5 mm DTT, and 0.05 mg/ml purified enzyme. Enzyme phosphorylation with Pi was carried out at 37 °C during 10 min in a medium containing 50 mm Tris, pH (20 °C) 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2,1 μm [32P]Pi, 0.04 mm EGTA, 20 mm cysteine, 0.01% asolectin, 0.01% DDM, 400 mm NaCl, 20% Me2SO, and 0.1 mg/ml purified enzyme. The effect of Cu+ on the E2P formation in the presence of Pi was tested by including 100 μm CuSO4 and 2.5 mm DTT in the phosphorylation medium. The reactions were initiated by the addition of [32P]Pi. Phosphorylation was stopped with five volumes of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, 1 mm Pi. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in acidic SDS-PAGE loading buffer (5 mm Tris-PO4, pH (20 °C) 5.8, 6.7 m urea, 0.4 m DTT, 5% SDS, and 0.014% bromphenol blue) and resolved by SDS-PAGE in an 8% acidic gel (49Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Foldes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were dried, and radioactivity was monitored and quantified in a PhosphorImager. Data Analysis and Structural Modeling—Curves of ATPase activity versus Cu+ were fit to v = VmaxL/(L + K½), where L is the concentration of variable ligand. Data analysis was done using the KaleidaGraph software (Synergy, Reading, PA). The reported S.E. values for Cu+ K½ are asymptotic S.E. values reported by the fitting program. Homology modeling of CopA TMs was performed using the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase SERCA1a structure file, Protein Data Bank code 1EUL (39Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar), as a template and the Deep View Swiss-Pdb Viewer (available on the World Wide Web at us.expasy.org/spdbv/) (50Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9395) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment was manually modified to align CopA H7 and H8 with the Ca-ATPase TMs H5 and H6. Analysis of Cu+-ATPase sequences indicates that specific amino acids in their last two transmembrane segments are fully conserved and consequently might play important functional roles including metal coordination (9Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the A. fulgidus CopA sequence, these residues are Asn675, Tyr682, Asn683, and Pro688 in H7 and Pro704, Met711, Ser714, and Ser715 in H8 (Fig. 2). In addition, position 721 appears to require either Asn or Ser. Interestingly, the hydrophobic Val718 is also conserved in all Cu+-ATPases, suggesting that it might have an important structural role. The indicated residues were the targets of these studies. They were subjected to conservative (Ser, Thr, Gln, or Cys) and nonconservative (Ala) replacements by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting proteins were functionally characterized. As controls for probable nonspecific functional alterations introduced by structural perturbations in the H7-H8 hairpin, enzymes carrying mutations of residues Ile685 and Leu686 were also included in these studies. In order to simplify data presentation and analysis, results are grouped by the likely position of targeted amino acids with respect to the membrane. In this way, findings associated with the centrally located Tyr682, Asn683, Met711, Ser714, and Ser715 are jointly presented, whereas functional effects of replacing Ile685, Leu686, Pro688, and Pro704 (close to the H7-H8 extracellular end) are shown together, and data corresponding to Asn675 are described alongside those from Val718 and Asn721 (residues adjacent to the H7-H8 cytoplasmic ends). Functional Role of Amino Acids Located in the Central Region of H7-H8: Tyr682, Asn683, Met711, Ser714, and Ser715— Enzymes carrying replacements of these amino acids, with the exception of S714A- and S714T-substituted proteins, were largely inactive (Fig. 3A). Further analysis of Ser714 mutants indicated that the replacements did not affect the enzyme apparent affinity for Cu+, assessed as the Cu+ K½ for ATPase activation (WT, 2.7 ± 0.3 μm; S714A, 2.3 ± 0.3 μm; S714T, 1.0 ± 0.5 μm; see Supplemental Data). These data suggest that Ser714 is not required for Cu+ binding. On the other hand, considering their locations it can be proposed that Tyr682, Asn683, Met711, and Ser715 are probably responsible for Cu+ binding. Toward testing this hypothesis, it was relevant to determine the ability of the corresponding enzymes to interact with ligands and undergo catalytic conformational transitions, although they were unable to hydrolyze ATP at a measurable rate. To explore these characteristics, partial reactions that are either Cu+-dependent (phosphorylation by ATP) or -independent (“backdoor” phosphorylation by Pi) (Fig. 1) were measured. Fig. 3B shows that enzymes carrying mutations of Tyr682, Asn683, Met711, and Ser715 were not significantly phosphorylated by ATP in the presence of 100 μm Cu+, a concentration 25 times higher than the Cu+ K½ for this partial reaction (11Mandal A.K. Cheung W.D. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7201-7208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As a control, enzymes mutated at position Ser714 were largely capable of forming a phosphorylated intermediary in the presence of Cu+ and ATP (Fig. 3B). Although the lack of activity and catalytic phosphorylation are probably related to the inability of these proteins to bind Cu+ at the transmembrane binding site, nonspecific structural alterations preventing the formation of stable phosphointermediaries might yield similar observations. Contrary to this latter possibility, enzymes mutated at positions Tyr682, Asn683, Met711, and Ser715 were able to undergo Cu+-independent phosphorylation by Pi (Fig. 3C). Most of these proteins, including Ser714 mutants, reached phosphoenzyme levels that were 35–60% of those in the WT enzyme. Moreover, Met711-substituted proteins yielded phosphoenzyme levels similar to or even higher (60%) than those of WT. Mutation Y682S appeared fully inactive, and no enzymatic characteristic could be tested in this mutant. The capacity to undergo phosphorylation by Pi provided an additional tool to test Cu+ binding to transport sites in these enzymes. Cu+, by shifting the conformational equilibrium toward E1, prevents enzyme phosphorylation by Pi (Fig. 1). Fig. 3D shows that in contrast to the WT and Ser714 mutants, Tyr682-, Asn683-, Met711-, and Ser715-substituted proteins were largely insensitive to 100 μm Cu+; i.e. similar phosphoenzyme levels (within S.E. values) were observed in the absence and presence of the metal. These results further support the postulated role of Tyr682, Asn683, Met711, and Ser715 probably participating in Cu+ coordination during transport. Functional Effects of Replacing Amino Acids Located Close to the Extracellular End of H7-H8: Ile685, Leu686, Pro688, and Pro704—Mutation of these residues led to relatively minor effects on enzyme function. For instance, their overall Cu+-ATPase activity was similar to that of the WT enzyme, except in the case of Ile685 substitutions, where significant reductions in activity were observed (76–48%) (Fig. 4A). Similarly, these mutations had small effects on the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Cu+ (Cu+ K½ for ATPase activation: WT, 2.7 ± 0.3 μm; I685E, 1.3 ± 0.4 μm; I685T, 2.3 ± 0.8 μm; L686A, 3.8 ± 0.6 μm; P688A, 2.3 ± 0.5 μm; P704A, 0.9 ± 0.4 μm; see Supplemental Data). Considering that conserved Pro might be required for conformational stabilization or have a role not evident in the overall ATPase activity determinations, enzyme phosphorylation was measured. Fig. 4B shows that I685T, L686A, and P688A mutations allowed significant levels of phosphoenzyme formation by ATP in the presence of Cu+. Under similar conditions, low phosphoenzyme levels were detected in the case of I685E and P704A proteins. However, I685E- and P704A-substituted proteins, as the other mutants, were largely phosphorylated by Pi (Fig. 4C). Considering the different phosphoenzyme levels observed for I685E and P704A proteins, it is apparent that these mutations might lead to unstable E1P(Cu+)/E2P forms under the forward phosphorylation assay conditions and a larger formal turnover if calculated as Vmax/EP. However, most importantly, the data indicate that amino acids close to the H7-H8 joining loop are not required for ligand binding to the enzyme. Functional Roles of Amino Acids Proximal to the Cytoplasmic End of H7-H8: Asn675, Val718, and Asn721—Replacement of these residues had significant effects on enzyme function, since proteins carrying substitutions N675A, V718E, and N721A lacked ATPase activity. However, these enzymes showed phosphoenzyme levels comparable with the WT when the phosphorylation in the presence of ATP and Cu+ was tested (Fig. 5A). Although this suggests that the lack of function is not associated with alterations in Cu+ or ATP binding or disruption of the phosphorylation step (Fig. 1), the capability of the Asn675-, Val718-, and Asn721-substituted enzymes to interact with substrates was further tested by analyzing phosphorylation of the E2 form by Pi (Fig. 5B). In these conditions, V718E protein was not able to undergo phosphorylation, whereas N675A and N721A mutants yielded phosphoenzyme levels much lower than that of WT enzyme. These observations might be due to a preference of the mutated enzymes to remain in E1 conformations, consequently preventing “backdoor” phosphorylation without largely affecting phosphorylation by ATP. This was corroborated when the sensitivity of the E2 + Pi → E2P partial reaction in the presence of Cu+ was analyzed. Fig. 4C shows that despite their modest “backdoor” phosphorylation, N675A and N721A enzymes presented high ratios for the phosphorylation in the absence and presence of Cu+. The absence of significant “backdoor” phosphorylation in V718E mutants prevented this particular analysis. The characteristics of these mutants suggest that whereas Asn675, Val718, and Asn721 do not participate in metal coordination, their replacements “lock” the resulting enzymes in an E1 (or E1P) conformation, which in turn prevents turnover at a measurable rate. We have previously proposed that conserved residues in TMs H7 and H8 of Cu+ transporting ATPases are required for metal binding during metal translocation across the membrane (9Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In this work, site-directed mutagenesis in combination with functional characterization was used to test this hypothesis. Four amino acids (Tyr682, Asn683, Met711, and Ser715) that probably participate in metal coordination were identified. These residues, together with two Cys in H6, probably form a transmembrane site with a distinct Cu+ coordination required for the transient binding and subsequent vectorial release. Various findings support these ideas. Tyr682, Asn683, Met711, and Ser715 are fully conserved in Cu+-ATPases and Cu2+-ATPases (in the latter, a His replaces a Cys in H6) (9Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 51Mana-Capelli S. Mandal A.K. Argüello J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40534-40541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Replacement of any of these four residues led to inactive CopA enzymes. Similarly, mutation of the relevant Ser in H8 of the human ATP7B (S1363F) has been identified in Wilson's disease patients (52Loudianos G. Dessi V. Lovicu M. Angius A. Altuntas B. Giacchino R. Marazzi M. Marcellini M. Sartorelli M.R. Sturniolo G.C. Kocak N. Yuce A. Akar N. Pirastu M. Cao A. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 36: 833-836PubMed Google Scholar). These mutant CopA proteins were unable to perform Cu+-dependent partial reactions, although their structural integrity was apparent from their capacity to undergo “backdoor” phosphorylation by Pi. These were specific effects of Tyr682, Asn683, Met711, and Ser715 mutations, since they were not observed in proteins mutated in neighboring positions. Moreover, mutagenesis studies targeting polar amino acids conserved in several eukaryote Cu+-ATPases (but not in all Cu+-ATPases if noneukaryotes are also considered) and located close to the borders of TMs H3–H6 did not observe alterations in Cu+-dependent functions (44Lowe J. Vieyra A. Catty P. Guillain F. Mintz E. Cuillel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25986-25994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Considering alternative explanations for the observed results, it could be speculated that while binding Cu+, Tyr682-, Asn683-, Met711-, and Ser715-mutated proteins might be incapable of undergoing the subsequent conformational transitions and thus unable to sustain catalytic phosphorylation by ATP or prevent phosphorylation by Pi. However, the most parsimonious model to rationalize our findings is one in which these four amino acids participate in metal coordination and consequently yield mutants unable to bind Cu+. The position of putative Cu+ binding residues in the center of H6, H7, and H8 has remarkable similarity with the cation binding sites in the Na,K-ATPase and Ca-ATPase (32Argüello J.M. Kaplan J.H. J.

In both cases, amino acids in the central portion of the TMs flanking the large cytoplasmic loop contribute side chain atoms for metal coordination. Expanding this hypothesis, Fig. 6 shows a model of CopA H6, H7, and H8 based on one of the described Ca-ATPase structures, 1EUL (39Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The low homology of CopA and SERCA1a in the region of interest limits the specific information to be inferred from the model; nevertheless, it suggests similar transport mechanisms in PIB and PII-type ATPases, involving comparable conformational changes influencing the geometry of these TMs (40Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 53Mikhailova L. Mandal A.K. Argüello J.M.

Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Whereas it is tempting to speculate on the arrangement of Cys380, Cys382, Tyr682, Asn683, Met711, and Ser715 forming a metal binding site, key information is still missing. In particular, it might be considered that the stoichiometry of transport remains to be established. The distinct requirements for coordination of one or two Cu+ are clear. In addition, whereas some of the identified residues might be required for ion occlusion, others might be necessary for metal access to its binding site or alternatively required for metal delivery to the trans-side of the membrane. Fig. 6 also shows the spatial relation of the putative Cu+ binding residues with other conserved amino acids in H7-H8 and provides a framework for interpreting the similar findings observed in proximal residues located in different TMs. For instance, Pro688 and Pro704 are probably located at the ends of the H7 and H8 helixes, respectively. Replacement of these Pro residues has no major effect on enzyme function, and clearly, they do not participate in Cu+ binding. Pro are frequently present in the equivalent loop of other P-type ATPases. Mutation of Pro in the same region of the Na,K-ATPase has little functional effect (55Geibel S. Kaplan J.H. Bamberg E. Friedrich T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, these seem necessary for proper insertion of the corresponding hairpin into the membrane (57Homareda H. Kawakami K. Nagano K. Matsui H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), supporting a structural role introducing bends required to form the joining loop. The model presented in Fig. 6 also reinforces the importance of residues in the cytoplasmic ends of H7 and H8. In the case of CopA, Asn675, Val718, and Asn721 substitutions lead to alterations compatible with the mutant enzymes being “locked” in an E1 conformation and thus largely inactive and undergoing little or none “backdoor” phosphorylation. Significant functional alterations have also been shown by previous work characterizing mutations of conserved polar amino acids located in the equivalent region of the Na,K-ATPase (58Argüello J.M.

Depending on the model protein and the introduced mutation, lack of activity, high activity in the absence of contra-ion (Na-ATPase), enzyme uncoupling, and reduced phosphoenzyme levels have been reported. The stringent structural requirements of H5-H6 (PII-type ATPases) and H7-H8 (CopA) cytoplasmic ends are perhaps not surprising, considering that the corresponding hairpins participate in critical conformation transitions (53Mikhailova L.

In summary, amino acids Tyr682, Asn683, Met711, and Ser715, together with Cys380 and Cys382, probably participate in Cu+ coordination during transport by a Cu+-ATPase. These findings advance our understanding of heavy metal binding sites not only in PIB-type ATPases but also in other heavy metal transmembrane transporters. In addition, they support our previous hypothesis (9Argüello J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 195: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) concerning metal selectivity mechanisms and provide a basis to test alternative ideas on the transient binding heavy metals during their transport.

https://openalex.org/W1989397082,"Recently, we reported that ouabain kills renal epithelial and vascular endothelial cells independently of elevation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio. These observations raised the possibility of finding cardiotonic steroids (CTS) that inhibit the Na+,K+ pump without attenuating cell survival and vice versa. To test this hypothesis, we compared CTS action on Na+,K+ pump, [Na+]i content, and survival of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. At a concentration of 1 μm, ouabain and other tested cardenolides, as well as bufadienolides such as bufalin, cinobufagin, cinobufotalin, and telobufotoxin, led to ∼10-fold inhibition of the Na+,K+ pump, a 2-3-fold decrease in staining with dimethylthiazol-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT), and massive death indicated by detachment of ∼80% of cells and caspase-3 activation. In contrast, Na+,K+ pump inhibition and elevation of [Na+]i seen in the presence of 3 μm marinobufagenin (MBG) and marinobufotoxin did not affect MTT staining and cell survival. Inhibition of the Na+,Rb+ pump in K+-free medium was not accompanied by a decline of MTT staining and cell detachment but increased sensitivity to CTS. In K+-free medium, half-maximal inhibition of 86Rb influx was observed in the presence of 0.04 μm ouabain and 0.1 μm MBG, whereas half-maximal detachment and decline of MTT staining were detected at 0.03 and 0.004 μm of ouabain versus 10 and 3 μm of MBG, respectively. Both ouabain binding and ouabain-induced [Na+]i,[K+]i-independent signaling were suppressed in the presence of MBG. Thus, our results show that CTS exhibit distinctly different potency in Na+,K+ pump inhibition and triggering of [Na+]i/[K+]i-independent signaling, including cell death.

Na+/K+-ATPase is an ubiquitous plasma membrane heterodimer detected in all types of animal cells. Its larger α-subunit (∼110 kDa) provides ATP hydrolysis coupled to the transport of three Na+ and two K+ ions against their electrochemical gradients, whereas its β-subunit (∼35 kDa) is mainly involved in plasma membrane delivery and assembly of the enzyme (1Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar, 2Therien A.G. Blostien R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its unique enzymatic properties, the Na+/K+-ATPase α-subunit is the only known target of cardiotonic steroids (CTS) 1The abbreviations used are: CTS, cardiotonic steroids; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MTT, dimethylthiazol-diphenyltetrazolium; MBG, marinobufagenin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1The abbreviations used are: CTS, cardiotonic steroids; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; MTT, dimethylthiazol-diphenyltetrazolium; MBG, marinobufagenin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. initially extracted from the leaves of Digitalis purpurea and Digitalis lanata plants and termed as digitalis. Since the report of Sir William Withering in 1789, glycosides have played a prominent role in the treatment of congestive heart failure (3Dmitrieva R.I. Doris P.A. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 561-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Later on, ouabain was extracted from Strophanthus gratus, and because of much higher water solubility, it was employed in an overwhelming number of animal and in vitro studies (for more details, see Ref. 4Schoner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2440-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Side-by-side with plant-derived cardenolides, other members of the CTS superfamily, bufadienolides, have been isolated from amphibians (5Krenn L. Kopp B. Phytochemistry. 1998; 48: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Moreover, augmented levels of CTS indistinguishable from cardenolides (ouabain and digoxin) and bufadienolides (marinobufagenin (MBG)) have been found in the plasma of hypertensive subjects and animals with volume-expanded hypertension (6Kawamura A. Guo J. Itagaki Y. Bell C. Wang Y. Haupert J. Garner T. Magil S. Gallagher R.T. Berova N. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In myocytes, inhibition of the electrogenic Na+/K+ pump by CTS leads to depolarization, elevation of [Na+]i, activation of electrogenic [Ca2+]o/3[Na+]i exchanger, and the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that results in elevation of [Ca2+]i, contraction of cardiomyocytes, and augments the sensitivity of vascular smooth muscle cells to endogenous constrictors (9Glitsch H.G.

Recently, several research teams proposed that CTS are also involved in Na+-independent signaling. This hypothesis was based on data showing that at lower concentrations CTS augment cell proliferation (11Dmitrieva R.I. Doris P.A. J. Biol.

More direct evidence of [Na+]i-independent signaling was obtained in a study of epithelial cells from the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK). In these cells, long term exposure to ouabain at concentrations sufficient to completely inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase resulted in attenuated staining with dimethylthiazol-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) (17Pchejetski D. der Taurin S. Sarkissian S. Lopina O.D. Pshezhetsky A.V. Tremblay J. DeBlois D. Hamet P. Orlov S.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), commonly used to estimate the relative number of alive cells and their redox state (18Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), and massive detachment of dead cells (19Contreras R.G. Shoshani L. Flores-Maldonado C. Lazaro A. Cereijido M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The death of ouabain-treated C7-MDCK cells shares markers with apoptosis (caspase-3 activation) and necrosis (cell swelling and smear pattern of DNA degradation) and, in contrast to “classic” apoptosis, is resistant to the pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (17Pchejetski D. der Taurin S. Sarkissian S. Lopina O.D. Pshezhetsky A.V. Tremblay J. DeBlois D. Hamet P. Orlov S.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Importantly, both a decline of MTT staining and death were triggered by ouabain in the absence of a transmembrane gradient of monovalent cations (17Pchejetski D. der Taurin S. Sarkissian S. Lopina O.D. Pshezhetsky A.V. Tremblay J. DeBlois D. Hamet P. Orlov S.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained under analysis of the ouabain action on primary cultures of endothelial cells from the porcine aorta (20Orlov S.N. Thorin-Trescases N. Pchejetski D. Taurin S. Farhat N. Tremblay J. Thorin E. Hamet P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 448: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This intriguing discovery raises the possibility of finding CTS that trigger [Na+]i/[K+]i-independent signaling without significant modulation of intracellular ion homeostasis and vice versa. Here, we confirm the hypothesis and demonstrate that MBG and marinobufotoxin do not affect MTT staining and survival of C7-MDCK cells at concentrations sufficient to inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase and augment the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio to the same extent as ouabain and other CTS under investigation. Cell Culture—C7-MDCK cells resembling principal cells from collecting ducts (21Gekle M. Wunsch S. Oberleithner H. Silbernagl S. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 428: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Michel Gekle (University of Warzburg, Warzburg, Germany) and maintained in culture as described previously (17Pchejetski D. der Taurin S. Sarkissian S. Lopina O.D. Pshezhetsky A.V. Tremblay J. DeBlois D. Hamet P. Orlov S.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Before the experiments, the cells were seeded in 12-, 24-, or 96-well plates and grown until confluency in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cell morphology was evaluated by phase contrast microscopy at ×100 magnification without preliminary fixation. To estimate cell attachment, cells growing in 24-well plates in the absence or presence of CTS were washed four times with medium W containing 100 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4), and the protein content of attached cells was measured by the modified Lowry method (22Hartee E.I. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Staining with MTT was performed in cells seeded in 96-well microplates and grown to confluence as described in detail previously (17Pchejetski D. der Taurin S. Sarkissian S. Lopina O.D. Pshezhetsky A.V. Tremblay J. DeBlois D. Hamet P. Orlov S.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The optical density of the resulting solution was measured at 590 nm. Caspase-3 activity in cells growing in 6-well plates was measured as the rate of the caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO)-sensitive component of caspase-3 fluorescent substrate (DEVD-AMC, N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC) hydrolysis according to a previously described protocol (23Orlov S.N. Thorin-Trescases N. Dulin N.O. Dam T-V. Fortuno M.A. Tremblay J. Hamet P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Na+,K+Pump Activity—Na+,K+ pump activity was studied as a CTS-sensitive component of the rate of 86Rb influx. To measure maximal Na+,K+ pump activity, the cells were preloaded with Na+ in accordance with the protocol described previously (17Pchejetski D. der Taurin S. Sarkissian S. Lopina O.D. Pshezhetsky A.V. Tremblay J. DeBlois D. Hamet P. Orlov S.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, C7-MDCK cells seeded in 24-well plates were washed twice with 2-ml aliquots of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in K+-free medium A containing 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mmd-glucose, and 20 mm HEPES-Tris buffer (pH 7.4). Isotope uptake was measured in medium A containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5 or 2 mm KCl, and 1 μCi/ml 86Rb with or without the CTS. To inhibit 86Rb influx mediated by Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport, bumetanide was added at a final concentration of 10 μm. To measure base-line Na+,K+-ATPase activity, preincubation in K+-free medium was omitted. In these experiments, the cells were incubated with 86Rb in DMEM-like medium containing 104.4 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 29.8 mm NaHCO3, 0.9 mm NaH2PO4, 8.4 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm glucose, and vitamins and amino acids at concentrations indicated in the DMEM recipe. In the absence of CTS, the kinetics of isotope uptake were linear up to 20-25 min of incubation (data not presented). Keeping this in mind, we limited incubation time to 15 min. Then the cells were transferred onto ice, washed four times with 2-ml aliquots of medium W, and lysed with 0.5 ml of 1% SDS, 4 mm EDTA mixture. Radioactivity of the incubation medium and cell lysate was measured with a liquid scintillation analyzer, and the rate of 86Rb influx was calculated as V = A/amt, where A was the radioactivity of the samples (cpm), a was the specific radioactivity of 86Rb calculated from the total concentration of K (up to 80 mm) and Rb (up to 10 μm) (cpm/nmol), m was the protein content (mg), and t was incubation time with the isotope. Intracellular Content of Exchangeable Na+—Intracellular content of exchangeable Na+ was measured as the steady-state distribution of extracellular and intracellular 22Na (17Pchejetski D. der Taurin S. Sarkissian S. Lopina O.D. Pshezhetsky A.V. Tremblay J. DeBlois D. Hamet P. Orlov S.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the cells were incubated for 5 h in physiologically balanced medium containing 2 mm KCl and 2 μCi/ml 22NaCl with or without CTS. Then the cells were transferred onto ice, washed four times with 2 ml of ice-cold medium W, and lysed with SDS/EDTA mixture. The radioactivity of the incubation medium and cell lysate was measured, and intracellular cation content was calculated as A/am, where A was the radioactivity of the samples (cpm), a was the specific radioactivity of Na+ in the medium (cpm/nmol), and m was the protein content (mg). [3H]Ouabain Binding—Cells grown in 24-well plates were incubated for 3 h in complete or K+-free DMEM-like medium in the presence of [3H]ouabain at concentrations <0.5 μCi/ml and other compounds mentioned in the table and figure legends. Then the cells were transferred on ice, washed four times with 2 ml of ice-cold medium W, and lysed for the measurement of radioactivity as indicated above. At a concentration of 3 mm, [3H]ouabain binding was not affected by [K+]o elevation from 0 to 80 mm, indicating nonspecific (Na+,K+-ATPase-independent) binding. These values (dpm/mg protein) were subtracted from [3H]ouabain binding measured at concentrations below 1 μm. Chemicals—Ouabain was from ICN (Irvine, CA); digoxin, digitoxin, digoxigenin, digitoxigenin, strophanthidin, bufalin, cinobufotalin and cinobufagin, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were from Sigma. Marinobufotoxin and telobufotoxin were kind gifts from Dr. V. P. Butler (Columbia University, New York, NY). Cortexolone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, dihydrodeoxycotricosterone, and acetylandrosol were synthesized at the Institute of Organic Chemistry (Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russia). MBG was purified from the venom of Bufo marinus as described in detail elsewhere (24Bagrov A.Y. Roukoyatkina N.I. Dmitrieva R.I. Pinaev A.G. Fedorova O.V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 274: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The chemical structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1. DEVD-AMC and DEVD-CHO were from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA); 86Rb and 22Na were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [21,22-3H]ouabain (specific activity, 17 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and the remaining chemicals were from Sigma, Invitrogen, and Anachemia (Montreal, Canada). Stock solutions of steroids (5 mm of each) were prepared in water (ouabain), ethanol (digoxin), ethanol:chloroform (1:1, v/v) (digitoxin), methanol (digoxigenin and digitoxigenin), or dimethylsulfoxide (other compounds) and kept at -20 °C. Screening of CTS—The addition of cardenolides at a concentration of 1 μm resulted in 2-4-fold inhibition of maximal Na+,K+-ATPase pump activity measured as the rate of bumetanide-resistant 86Rb influx in Na+-loaded cells (Table I). About the same Na+,K+ pump inhibition was detected in cells treated with 1 μm of marinobufotoxin, MBG, cinobufotalin or telobufotoxin, whereas bufalin and cinobufagin suppressed its activity by 10-fold (Table I).Table IEffect of cardenolides and bufadienolides on the rate of K+ (86Rb) influx, cell attachment, and MTT staining of C7-MDCK cellsCompoundsMaximal Na+,K+ pump activityCell attachmentMTT staining%%%None (control)100100100CardenolidesOuabain (1 μm45.2 ± 1.132.4 ± 2.146.3 ± 1.5Digoxin (1 μmμm57.3 ± 0.845.0 ± 0.758.9 ± 3.6Digitoxin (1 μm33.5 ± 1.030.3 ± 3.640.1 ± 5.0Digoxigenin (1 μm)33.4 ± 0.627.3 ± 3.343.5 ± 0.9Digitoxigenin (10 μm)24.1 ± 0.320.8 ± 1.142.0 ± 1.8Strophanthidin (1 μm)26.0 ± 0.123.1 ± 1.739.8 ± 2.2BufadienolidesBufalin (1 μm)10.5 ± 1.110.0 ± 6.017.3 ± 1.8Cinobufagin (1 μm)10.3 ± 0.420.3 ± 2.854.7 ± 1.8Cinobufotalin (1 μm)53.5 ± 1.529.5 ± 1.751.2 ± 4.4Telobufotoxin (1 μm)74.3 ± 18.335.6 ± 3.058.1 ± 4.7MBG (1 μm)41.9 ± 0.492.4 ± 3.391.2 ± 11.8Marinobufotoxin (1 μm)51.1 ± 2.089.6 ± 5.1107 ± 14 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2A shows that in the presence of 1 μm ouabain accumulation of 22Na reached a plateau in 2 h of ouabain addition, whereas the death of C7-MDCK cells, indicated by detachment and the appearance of rounded, floating cells (Fig. 3), was detected after 10 h of ouabain addition. In contrast to the delayed kinetics of cell detachment seen, significant attenuation of MTT staining was observed in 30 min with a 2-3-fold decrease of optical density in 6 h (Fig. 2B). The second phase of MTT staining decline, detected in 10 h of ouabain addition, was in proportion to the reduced number of attached cells. Based on these results, we compared the potency of CTS as modulators of MTT staining and triggers of cell detachment after 6 and 24 h, respectively.Fig. 3Phase contrast microscopy of C7-MDCK cells after 24-h incubation in DMEM containing 1 μm ouabain, MBG, and marinobufotoxin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similarly to ouabain, the addition of other cardenolides as well as bufalin, cinobufagin, cinobufotalin, and telobufotoxin led to a 2-3-fold decrease of MTT staining and cell detachment (Table I). In contrast, neither MBG nor marinobufotoxin affected MTT staining and attachment of C7-MDCK cells (Table I and Fig. 3). Dose Dependences of Ouabain and MBG—To examine mechanism(s) of the low sensitivity of MTT staining and cell attachment to two bufadienolides compared with other CTS under investigation, we focused on a comparison of MBG and ouabain. At [K+]o = 5 mm, ouabain inhibited base-line activity of the Na+,K+ pump, increased intracellular Na content, attenuated MTT staining, and detached cells with ID50 values of ∼0.1, 0.3, 0.03, and 0.3 μm, respectively. The half-maximal action of MBG on 86Rb influx and [Na+]i content was detected at 0.5 and 1 μm, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). Neither MTT staining nor cell survival was significantly affected by MBG at concentrations under 3 μm (Figs. 3 and 4, C and D). At 10 μm, MBG decreased MTT staining and cell attachment by 20-25% only (Fig. 4, C and D). The low potency of MBG and marinobufotoxin in the triggering of death signal was further confirmed by measurement of caspase-3 activity (Table II).Table IIEffect of ouabain, MBG, and marinobufotoxin on caspase-3 activity in C7-MDCK cellsIncubation mediumAddition of CTSCaspase-3 activitynmol (mg protein)-1 h-1DMEM-likeNone (control)0.37 ± 0.04DMEM-likeOuabain (1 μm)4.03 ± 0.35ap < 0.001 compared with control.DMEM-likeMarinobufotoxin (1 μm)0.34 ± 0.03DMEM-likeMarinobufotoxin (3 μm)0.69 ± 0.11bp < 0.05 compared with control.DMEM-likeMBG (1 μm)0.41 ± 0.08DMEM-likeMBG (3 μm)0.38 ± 0.04DMEM-likeMBG (10 μm)0.87 ± 0.18bp < 0.05 compared with control.K+-freeNone0.33 ± 0.07a p < 0.001 compared with control.b p < 0.05 compared with control. Open table in a new tab Effect of Extracellular K+—In K+-free medium containing 4.1 μm Rb, the rate of ouabain-sensitive 86Rb influx was decreased by ∼30-fold compared with medium containing 5 mm KCl (Fig. 5A). Na+,K+ pump inhibition seen in K+-free medium resulted in ∼10-fold elevation of [Na+]i content (Fig. 5B). About the same [Na+]i elevation was observed in cells treated with 1 μm ouabain in the presence of [K+]o. However, in contrast to ouabain, Na+,K+ pump inhibition in K+-free medium did not affect cell survival estimated by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 6), cell attachment (Fig. 5D), caspase-3 activity (Table II), and slightly augmented rather than attenuated MTT staining (Fig. 5C).Fig. 6Phase contrast microscopy of C7-MDCK cells after 24 h of incubation in control ([K+]o = 5 mm) and K+-free DMEM-like medium in the absence or presence of 10 μm MBG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well documented that affinity of the Na+/K+ pump for ouabain is increased in K+-depleted medium (25Akera T.

Indeed, in K+-free medium, ouabain and MBG inhibited 86Rb influx with ID50 values of 0.04 and 0.2 μm, respectively (Fig. 7A). In this medium, a half-maximal decline of MTT staining and cell attachment were revealed at ouabain concentrations of ∼0.004 and 0.03 μm, respectively (Fig. 7, B and C). Elevation of MBG in the range from 0.3 to 10 μm resulted in a modest reduction of MTT staining (Fig. 7B) and sharp cell detachment (Fig. 7C) compared with K+-containing medium (Fig. 4D). The distinct effect of 10 μm MBG on attachment of cells in control and K+-free medium was confirmed by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 6). Effect of MBG on Ouabain Binding and Signaling—Scatchard plot analysis showed that at [K+]o = 5 mm, ouabain binding was fit by a single component of hyperbolic saturation with Kd and Bmax values of ∼40 nm and 3.5 pmol/mg protein, respectively (Fig. 8B). Incubation in K+-free medium increased ouabain affinity (Kd = ∼4 nm) but did not affect the number of binding sites (Fig. 8). Recently, Ward et al. (28Ward S.C. Hamilton B.P. Hamlyn J.M. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that side by side with “classic” extracellular K+-inhibited sites, bovine adrenocortical cells exhibit high affinity ouabain binding sites in the presence of 20 mm KCl, i.e. under conditions when its binding with Na+,K+-ATPase is negligible. Keeping these data in mind, we examined the effect of [K+]o on ouabain binding in the range from 0.6 to 10 nm (Fig. 9). We observed that [K+]o elevation up to 20 mm led to further suppression of ouabain binding compared with control and K+-free medium. These results are in contrast to the presence of high affinity ouabain-binding sites distinct from the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit in C7-MDCK cells. MBG dose-dependently inhibited ouabain binding (Fig. 10). The inhibitory action of MBG was in inverse proportion to ouabain concentration, indicating their competition for the same binding sites. Indeed, binding of 0.1 μm ouabain was suppressed by 10 μm MBG by ∼10-fold, whereas at 1 μm ouabain MBG attenuated its binding by only 2-fold (Fig. 10B). In contrast to CTS, we observed slight inhibition of ouabain binding and 86Rb influx by 100 μm acetylandrosol, whereas the other tested steroids were completely inactive (Table III).Table IIIEffect of digoxin, bufalin, MBG, and steroids distinct from CTS on ouabain binding and 86Rb influx in C7-MDCK cellsAddition of steroids[3H]Ouabain binding86Rb influx%%None (control)100100Digoxin (10 μm)7.8 ± 1.113 ± 3Bufalin (1 μm)2.5 ± 0.57 ± 2MBG (10 μm)16.0 ± 5.59 ± 3Prednisolone (100 μm)98.0 ± 11.1116 ± 15Acetylandrosol (100 μm)65.1 ± 16.484.5 ± 9.7Cortexolone (10 μm)ND106 ± 17Hydrocortisone (10 μm)ND122 ± 29Dihydrodeoxycoticosterone (100 μm)ND115 ± 21 Open table in a new tab In the presence of 5 mm K+, ouabain triggered a full scale decline of MTT staining and cell detachment at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 μm, respectively (Fig. 4). Table IV shows that both ouabain-induced signals were attenuated in the presence of 10 μm MBG. Neither base-line MTT staining and cell attachment nor the decline of these parameters triggered by ouabain was affected by steroids distinct of CTS and listed in Table II (data not shown).Table IVEffect marinobufagenin on ouabain-induced decline of MTT staining and cell attachmentAddition of steroidsMTT stainingCell attachment%%1.

Both the decline of MTT staining and cell detachment of CTS-treated cells were independent of the inhibition of Na+,K+ pump-mediated ion fluxes and elevation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio. [Na+]i,[K+]i-independent signaling triggered by CTS is probably mediated by their interaction with the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit. However, the potency of CTS in triggering of [Na+]i,[K+]i-independent signaling is not proportional to their potency in inhibiting the Na+,K+ pump. [Na+]i,[K+]i-independent mechanisms of decreased staining with MTT and death of CTS-treated cells are supported by several observations. First, in K+-free medium, Na+,K+ pump activity measured as the rate of ouabain-sensitive 86Rb influx was ∼2 orders of magnitude lower than in control medium containing 5 mm KCl (Fig. 5A). Similarly to ouabain, 5 h of incubation in K+-free medium resulted in ∼6-fold elevation of [Na+]i content (Fig. 5B) and massive loss of intracellular K+ (20Orlov S.N. Thorin-Trescases N. Pchejetski D. Taurin S. Farhat N. Tremblay J. Thorin E. Hamet P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 448: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, neither decreased MTT staining nor cell detachment was detected in K+-free medium (Fig. 5, C and D). Second, at [K+]o = 5mm, maximal decrement of MTT staining was seen at 0.1 μm ouabain (Fig. 4C). At this concentration, ouabain did not significantly affect [Na+]i content (Fig. 4B). Third, MBG and marinobufotoxin caused about the same Na+,K+ pump inhibition as was detected with other tested CTS (Table I and Fig. 4A). At a concentration of 3 μm, MBG led to ∼6-fold elevation of [Na+]i content; the same effect was observed with 1 μm ouabain. (Fig. 4B). However, in contrast to cardenolides and other bufadienolides, MBG and marinobufotoxin did not decrease MTT staining and only slightly affected cell attachment (Table I and Figs. 3 and 4, C and D). During the last two decades, the MTT assay was widely employed to assess the redox state as a marker of mitochondrial function and/or cell viability (18Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Keeping these data in mind, decreased MTT staining in CTS-treated cells might be considered as an early marker of induction of the cell death machinery. It should be underlined, however, that in control as well as in K+-free medium, maximal decrement of MTT staining occurred at lower concentrations of ouabain than triggering of cell detachment (Figs. 4 and 7). In contrast, in K+-free medium, 3 μm marinobufagenin evoked detachment of cells without significant modulation of MTT staining (Fig. 7). Thus, additional experiments should be performed to study the mechanism of reduced MTT staining in CTS-treated cells and its relevance to the triggering of death signal. It may be proposed that [Na+]i,[K+]i-independent signaling triggered by CTS is mediated by a target distinct from the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit. This hypothesis contradicts several observations. First, Scatchard analyses revealed the single class of [3H]ouabain-binding sites (Fig. 8). Second, both ouabain binding (Fig. 8) and Na+,K+ pump inhibition by ouabain (Figs. 4A and 7A) were suppressed under [K+]o elevation, which is consistent with previously reported data (25Akera T. Ng Y.-C. Shien I.-S. Bero E. Brody T.M. Braselton W.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 111: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Wallick E.T. Schwartz A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Lingrel J.B. Croyle M.L. Woo A.L. Argüello J.M. Acta. Physiol. Scand. 1998; 163: 69-77Google Scholar). The same left-hand shift was detected in the effect of ouabain and MBG on cell detachment and MTT staining (Figs. 4, 6, and 7). Third, neither cell attachment nor MTT staining was affected by steroids distinct from cardenolides and bufadienolides. This observation is consistent with the negligible effect of these compounds on ouabain binding and 86Rb influx (Table III). Our data show that being potent inhibitors of Na+,K+-ATPase, MBG, and marinobufotoxin are much less potent inducers of [Na+]i,[K+]i-independent cell death machinery and reduced MTT staining than the other CTS tested. Previously, it was shown that substitution of the amino by the hydroxy group at the 14β position of the ouabain analogue, compound LDN-623, sharply increased its ability to inhibit Na+,K+-ATPase but attenuated its cytotoxic action (29Maxient J-M. Leliévre L. Berrebi-Betrand I. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1998; 12: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Daniel et al. (30Daniel D. Süsal C. Kopp B. Opelz G. Terness P. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2003; 3: 1791-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported that incorporation of the 14,15-epoxy group in bufadienolide derivatives reduced their cytotoxicity. This observation is consistent with our data disclosing that the presence of the 14,15-epoxy group in the absence of the 16-acetoxy group (Fig. 1) determines the attenuated cytotoxicity of MBG and marinobufotoxin. Several crucial questions should be answered to clarify the novel function of Na+,K+-ATPase as a receptor differentially affected by CTS. We do not know whether or not [Na+]i,[K+]i-independent actions of CTS are limited to their interaction with the α1 Na+,K+-ATPase subunit, i.e. the only isoform detected in the renal epithelium, or whether the cell death signal can be also generated by cell type-specific α2-α4 subunits. Moreover, we do not know whether or not sharp differences in the efficiency of CTS, as triggers of these signaling pathways revealed in C7-MDCK cells, are applicable to other cell types abundant with α1 Na+,K+-ATPase. Indeed, the cell type-specific effect of CTS on Na+,K+ pump activity and cell survival has been detected in comparison of wild type and mutated cell lines (31Ho C.K. Chen S.M. Wang S.Y. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Apart from cell type- and tissue-specific differences, CTS interaction with the Na+,K+ pump is affected by hypertension-induced cardiovascular remodeling (32Fedorova O.V. Talan M.I. Agalakova N.I. Lakatta E.G. Bagrov A.Y. J. Hypertens. 2004; 22: 1-9Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and extracellular stimuli, such as dietary salt (33Fedorova O.V. Talan M.I. Agalakova N.I. Droy-Lefaix M.T. Lakatta E.G. Bagrov A.Y. Hypertension. 2003; 41: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and modulators of protein kinase C activity (33Fedorova O.V. Talan M.I. Agalakova N.I.

The role of these stimuli in the regulation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i-mediated and -independent signaling triggered by CTS should be examined further. The editorial help of Ovid Da Silva is appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2043778148,"During skeletal muscle regeneration caused by injury, muscle satellite cells proliferate and migrate toward the site of muscle injury. This migration is mainly induced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) secreted by intact myofibers and also released from injured muscle. However, the intracellular machinery for the satellite cell migration has not been elucidated. To examine the mechanisms of satellite cell migration, we utilized satellite cell-derived mouse C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. HGF induced reorganization of actin cytoskeleton to form lamellipodia in C2C12 myoblasts. HGF treatment facilitated both nondirectional migration of the myoblasts in phagokinetic track assay and directional chemotactic migration toward HGF in a three-dimensional migration chamber assay. Endogenous N-WASP and WAVE2 were concentrated in the lamellipodia at the leading edge of the migrating cells. Moreover, exogenous expression of wild-type N-WASP or WAVE2 promoted lamellipodial formation and migration. By contrast, expression of the dominant-negative mutant of N-WASP or WAVE2 and knockdown of N-WASP or WAVE2 expression by the RNA interference prevented the HGF-induced lamellipodial formation and migration. When the cells were treated with LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the HGF-induced lamellipodial formation and migration were abrogated. These results imply that both N-WASP and WAVE2, which are activated downstream of phosphati-dylinositol 3-kinase, are required for the migration through the lamellipodial formation of C2C12 cells induced by HGF.

Migration of myogenic cells is essential for myogenesis in vertebrates during embryonic development. Particularly, muscle precursor cells delaminate from hypaxial dermomyotome and migrate long distance to sites of muscle formation including limbs, tongue, and diaphragm (1Birchmeier C. Brohmann H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 2Buckingham M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 3Bailey P.

Myogenic cell migration is not restricted to the embryonic stage but required for muscle regeneration in adult. Adult skeletal muscle contains satellite cells, a specialized population of myogenic stem cells (4Bischoff R. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. 2nd Ed. Myology. 2.

The satellite cells are situated adjacently to a mature myofiber and surrounded by basal lamina together with the myofiber. They are mitotically quiescent in normal adult muscle but activated to proliferate in response to diverse stimuli such as injury, denervation, exercise, or stretching. These cells migrate to the injured regions of myofibers by chemotaxis within or beyond the basal lamina and proliferate. Then they fuse each other or with preexisting myotubes or myofibers to regenerate muscle. The mechanisms of satellite cell activation, proliferation, and migration have been under examination. Several growth factors and cytokines, which are released from damaged myofibers, infiltrating macrophages, or satellite cells by themselves, are involved in particular steps of a series of these processes during regeneration (5Seale P. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 6Hawke T.J. Garry D.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 534-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar).

HGF is present in uninjured myofibers and may be secreted from them to the extracellular matrix surrounding myofibers. Upon muscle injury, it may be released from myofibers and the extracellular matrix (5Seale P. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 9Tatsumi R. Anderson J.E. Nevoret C.J. Halevy O. Allen R.E. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 114-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In addition, it is likely to be secreted at least in part by satellite cells and quickly acts on satellite cells in an autocrine manner in response to muscle injury (9Tatsumi R. Anderson J.E. Nevoret C.J. Halevy O. Allen R.E. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 114-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 14Sheehan S.M. Tatsumi R. Temm-Grove C.J. Allen R.E. Muscle Nerve. 2000; 23: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The quiescent satellite cells already express the HGF receptor Met, whereas the MyoD family muscle regulatory factors, Myf5 and MyoD, are expressed after the satellite cell activation, and myogenin and MRF4 are expressed after the beginning of their differentiation program (15Cornelison D.D.W. Wold B.J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). HGF induces via its receptor Met a variety of cellular responses including cell proliferation, chemotactic migration, invasion, branching morphogenesis, and cell survival in diverse or particular types of cells (16Birchmeier C.

When HGF binds to Met receptor tyrosine kinase, its cytoplasmic Tyr residues are autophosphorylated and bind the scaffolding adaptor protein Gab1 as well as the adaptor protein Grb2. For migration or scattering of MDCK epithelial cells, the signaling pathways lead to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ras-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (21Royal I.

Cdc42 as well as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) binds to its target protein N-WASP and induces rapid actin polymerization through activating Arp2/3 complex, resulting in filopodial formation in migrating cells (27Miki H.

By contrast, Rac1 activates WAVE2, a ubiquitously expressed member of WAVE proteins (30Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), indirectly via the target protein IRSp53 (31Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T.

The binding to WAVE2 of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), which is produced by PI3K, is necessary for the lamellipodial formation, probably by recruiting WAVE2 to the polarized plasma membrane (34Oikawa T.

Although cell migration in vivo occurs in most cases in three-dimensional extracellular matrix, the mechanisms of cell migration under three-dimensional conditions have not been well examined. Recent investigations have revealed that N-WASP plays important roles in HGF-induced three-dimensional migration, invasion, and tubulogenesis in MDCK cells (42Yamaguchi H. Miki H. Takenawa T. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2503-2509PubMed Google Scholar). In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, WAVE2 is essential for the lamellipodial formation at the leading edge for directional chemotactic migration induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) regardless of the presence of extracellular matrix, whereas WAVE1 is required for the migration in extracellular matrix (43Suetsugu S.

Although the roles of HGF and Met in satellite cells during muscle regeneration are evident, the signaling mechanisms for each step in regeneration remain to be determined. To elucidate the signal transduction pathways for the migration of satellite cells, we applied the mouse satellite cell-derived C2C12 cells. The myoblasts treated with HGF formed lamellipodia at the leading edges and migrated toward HGF by chemotaxis. Here we show that both N-WASP and WAVE2, which act downstream of PI3K, play essential roles in the lamellipodial formation and migration of C2C12 cells induced by HGF. Cell Culture—Mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 (44Blau H.M. Chiu C-P. Webster C. Cell. 1983; 32: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) is a subclone of C2 cells (45Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) derived from satellite cells. The cells were maintained as proliferating myoblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (growth medium). For the stimulation with HGF, the cells were first subjected to serum starvation by culturing for 24 h in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FBS (low serum medium) and then treated with 50 ng/ml recombinant human HGF (PeproTech, Inc.). The PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 (Sigma) and its noninhibitory analogue LY303511 (Sigma) were added to the medium at the concentration of 10 or 30 μm together with HGF. Phagokinetic Track Assay—Phagokinetic track assay was conducted as described previously (46Tsubakimoto K. Matsumoto K. Abe H. Ishii J. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Endo T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2431-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Gold colloid particles were prepared and glass coverslips were coated with the particles according to Albrecht-Buehler (47Albrecht-Buehler G. Cell. 1977; 11: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The serum-starved C2C12 cells were plated on the gold particle-coated glass coverslips and cultured for 24 h in the low serum medium supplemented with or without HGF. The specimens were observed and photographed by dark field microscopy. The area of migration was calculated by Openlab software (Improvision). Three-dimensional Migration Chamber Assay—Three-dimensional migration was assayed with Cell Culture Insert (6-mm diameter, 8 μm pore size, BD Falcon). The upper surface of the membrane was coated with 50 μg/ml collagen (Cellgen, Koken). C2C12 cells were serum-starved as stated above, and 1 × 104 cells were replated on the membrane. The well contained the low serum medium supplemented with or without 50 ng/ml HGF. After the incubation for 5 h at 37 °C, nonmigrated cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. The migrated cells through the pores were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and stained with 0.4% Crystal Violet in 10% ethanol for 30 min. They were examined with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope, and their number was counted for quantitation. Immunoblotting—Cultured cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed with the lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was treated with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore). They were incubated with the anti-N-WASP, anti-WAVE1, and anti-WAVE2 polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) (48Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 49Yamazaki D. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Kataoka Y. Nishikawa S. Fujiwara T. Yoshida N. Takenawa T.

Klymkowsky M.W. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). They were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). Immunological reactions were detected with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. They were incubated with anti-N-WASP and anti-WAVE2 pAbs and then with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Actin filaments were detected by the staining with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.). The specimens were observed with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with phase-contrast and fluorescence optics or with a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope. Transduction with Adenoviral Vectors—Recombinant adenoviral vectors containing cDNAs of wild-type (wt) N-WASP and dominant-negative N-WASP(Δcof) in addition to lacZ gene were constructed by homologous recombination between the expression cosmid cassette pAxCAwt and the parental viral genome as described previously (51Miyake S.

Recombinant adenoviral vectors containing the cDNAs of wt WAVE2 and dominant-negative WAVE2(ΔV) together with that of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were constructed by use of the AdEasy system (49Yamazaki D. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Kataoka Y. Nishikawa S. Fujiwara T. Yoshida N. Takenawa T. Nature. 2003; 424: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 53He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar). The vectors were amplified in HEK293 cells and recovered from the cells according to He et al. (53He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells grown on culture dishes were infected with the viral particles at a multiplicity of infection of 50-100 in the low serum medium for 3 h. Twenty-four hours after the transduction, the cells were used for each assay. RNA Interference (RNAi)—RNAi of N-WASP and WAVE2 was conducted with pSuper vector (54Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3967) Google Scholar) (Oligo Engine) as described previously (43Suetsugu S. Yamazaki D. Kurisu S. Takenawa T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 595-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The target sequences of mouse N-WASP and WAVE2 were 5′-AAGACGAGATGCTCCAAATGG-3′ (nucleotides 434-454 from the start codon) and 5′-AAGTGCCTTTGCCTCCCGAGT-3′ (nucleotides 174-194 from the start codon), respectively. Cells were transfected with the pSuper vectors targeting these sequences by using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours after the first transfection, the cells were retransfected to elevate the transfection efficiency. To monitor the short interfering RNA (siRNA)-expressing cells, one-tenth of the amount of pEGFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech) encoding EGFP was cotransfected with the pSuper vectors. HGF Induces Lamellipodial Formation and Migration in C2C12 Cells—During skeletal muscle regeneration, satellite cells are activated and migrate by chemotaxis to injured regions of myofibers, from which HGF is released. To elucidate the intracellular machinery for the satellite cell migration, we utilized satellite cell-derived C2C12 cells. When the myoblasts were cultured for 24 h under a low serum condition in 0.5% FBS, most cells were flattened and elongated and only ∼10% of the cells had lamellipodial processes (Fig. 1A, panels a and c). Treatment of these serum-starved myoblasts with 50 ng/ml HGF for 30 min induced polarized cell shape and lamellipodial formation in ∼40% of the cells (Fig. 1A, panels b and c). Next, we conducted phagokinetic track assay to examine whether the HGF treatment led to nondirectional cell migration. The serum-starved cells were replated on gold particle-coated cover-slips and cultured for 24 h in the low serum medium supplemented with or without HGF (Fig. 1B, panels a and b). The tracks free of particles generated by phagokinetic ingestion or attachment of the particles on the cell surface correspond to migration trails. The area of migration was increased ∼1.6-fold by the treatment with HGF (Fig. 1B, panel c). We further analyzed by three-dimensional migration chamber assay whether the HGF treatment was also responsible for the directional cell migration or chemotaxis. The serum-starved cells were replated on the collagen-coated membrane of the migration chamber and cultured for 5 h in the low serum medium supplemented with or without HGF supplied in the well (Fig. 1C, panels a and b). The number of cells migrated through the pores and toward the opposite side (HGF side) of the membrane was elevated ∼3-fold by the incubation with HGF (Fig. 1C, panel c). Taken together, these results indicate that HGF induce both nondirectional and directional cell migration in C2C12 cells probably by forming lamellipodia at the leading edges. N-WASP and WAVE2 Are Concentrated in the Lamellipodia—N-WASP and WAVE proteins play essential roles in actin polymerization to form filopodia and lamellipodia, respectively, leading to cell migration in at least certain types of cells (29Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Yamaguchi H. Miki H. Takenawa T. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2503-2509PubMed Google Scholar, 43Suetsugu S. Yamazaki D. Kurisu S.

Takenawa T. Nature. 2003; 424: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In MDCK epithelial cells, N-WASP is required for HGF-induced three-dimensional migration, invasion, and tubulogenesis (42Yamaguchi H. Miki H. Takenawa T. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2503-2509PubMed Google Scholar), although implication of WAVEs in these functions has not been examined. In addition, it remains to be clarified whether N-WASP and WAVEs are involved in HGF-induced migration in other types of cells. Thus, we addressed whether N-WASP and WAVEs were implicated in HGF-induced lamellipodial formation and migration in C2C12 cells. First, we determined which proteins among the N-WASP and WAVEs were present in the myoblasts. Immunoblotting with specific antibodies showed that N-WASP and WAVE2 were present both in serum-starved C2C12 myoblasts and in those stimulated with HGF for 1 h in equivalent amounts as well as in the cells cultured in the growth medium containing 10% FBS (Fig. 2A). In contrast, WAVE1 was scarcely detected in the cells under either condition. These results are consistent with the previous reports that N-WASP and WAVE2 are ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues and cells, whereas WAVE1 is predominantly expressed in brain (30Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 48Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 55Soderling S.H. Langeberg L.K. Soderling J.A. Davee S.M. Simerly R. Raber J. Scott J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3343-3352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we concentrated on N-WASP and WAVE2 for the analyses of lamellipodial formation and migration of C2C12 cells hereafter. Confocal optical sections (XY planes) and three-dimensional reconstitutions of the orthogonal planes derived from these sections (XZ planes) showed that lamellipodia formed at the leading edges of HGF-treated migrating cells contained actin filament networks (Fig. 2B, panels a and e). Both N-WASP and WAVE2 were highly concentrated in the lamellipodia (Fig. 2B, panels b and f) and colocalized with the actin filament networks in the lamellipodia (Fig. 2B, panels c and g), in addition to their diffuse distribution throughout the cytoplasm and nuclei. Although N-WASP was well colocalized with the actin filament networks even at a higher magnification (Fig. 2B, panel d), WAVE2 was located also at the very front of the lamellipodia, 0.2-0.5 μm wide, where actin filament networks were absent (Fig. 2B, panel h, arrows). These results suggest that both N-WASP and WAVE2 are involved in lamellipodial formation and migration in HGF-treated C2C12 cells by acting sequentially or cooperating with each other in slightly different locations. N-WASP and WAVE2 Are Required for the Lamellipodial Formation and Cell Migration—To examine whether N-WASP and WAVE2 actually participate in the lamellipodial formation and cell migration in HGF-treated C2C12 cells, the cells were transduced with cDNAs encoding wt and dominant-negative mutants of N-WASP and WAVE2 via adenoviral vectors and then treated with HGF. Mock transduction with the viral vectors harboring lacZ or EGFP interfered with the lamellipodial formation to some degree, but transduction with either wt N-WASP or WAVE2 facilitated the lamellipodial formation 1.6-1.8-fold (Fig. 3, A and C). By contrast, transduction of the dominant-negative N-WASP(Δcof) (28Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which lacks its cofilin homology domain involved in the binding of Arp2/3 complex, suppressed the lamellipodial formation to ∼30% of the level induced by wt N-WASP expression (Fig. 3, A and C). Furthermore, transduction of the dominant-negative WAVE2(ΔV) (49Yamazaki D. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Kataoka Y. Nishikawa S. Fujiwara T. Yoshida N. Takenawa T. Nature. 2003; 424: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which lacks its verprolin homology domain required for the binding of G-actin, markedly abrogated the lamellipodial formation to ∼17% of the level induced by wt WAVE2 expression (Fig. 3, A and C). The number of migrated cells toward HGF increased ∼1.5-fold by the transduction with either wt N-WASP or WAVE2 in three-dimensional migration chamber assay (Fig. 3, B and D). On the contrary, transduction of N-WASP(Δcof) and WAVE2(ΔV) reduced the number of migrated cells to ∼40 and ∼30% of that of the wt N-WASP- and WAVE2-transduced cells, respec"
https://openalex.org/W2079282642,"5-Nitroimidazole-based antibiotics are compounds extensively used for treating infections in humans and animals caused by several important pathogens. They are administered as prodrugs, and their activation depends upon an anaerobic 1-electron reduction of the nitro group by a reduction pathway in the cells. Bacterial resistance toward these drugs is thought to be caused by decreased drug uptake and/or an altered reduction efficiency. One class of resistant strains, identified in Bacteroides, has been shown to carry Nim genes (NimA, -B, -C, -D, and -E), which encode for reductases that convert the nitro group on the antibiotic into a non-bactericidal amine. In this paper, we have described the crystal structure of NimA from Deinococcus radiodurans (drNimA) at 1.6 Å resolution. We have shown that drNimA is a homodimer in which each monomer adopts a β-barrel fold. We have identified the catalytically important His-71 along with the cofactor pyruvate and antibiotic binding sites, all of which are found at the monomer-monomer interface. We have reported three additional crystal structures of drNimA, one in which the antibiotic metronidazole is bound to the protein, one with pyruvate covalently bound to His-71, and one with lactate covalently bound to His-71. Based on these structures, a reaction mechanism has been proposed in which the 2-electron reduction of the antibiotic prevents accumulation of the toxic nitro radical. This mechanism suggests that Nim proteins form a new class of reductases, conferring resistance against 5-nitroimidazole-based antibiotics. 5-Nitroimidazole-based antibiotics are compounds extensively used for treating infections in humans and animals caused by several important pathogens.

This mechanism suggests that Nim proteins form a new class of reductases, conferring resistance against 5-nitroimidazole-based antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem throughout the developed world, and knowledge about different resistance mechanisms is important for efficient treatment of bacterial infections. One important class of antibiotics, the 5-nitroimidazole (5-Ni) 1The abbreviations used are: 5-Ni, 5-nitroimidazole; drNimA, 5-nitroimidazole antibiotic-resistant protein from D. radiodurans; bfNimA, NimA from B. fragilis; MTR, 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole-1-ethanol (metronidazole); DMZ, 1,2-dimethyl-5-nitroimidazole (dimetridazole); TNZ, 2-ethylsulfonyl 1-ethyl 2-methyl 5-nitroimidazole (tinidazole); PFOR, pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase; FMN, flavin mononucleotide; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PNPO, pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase; Pyr, pyruvate, Lac, lactate; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. drug derivatives, includes metronidazole (MTR), dimetridazole (DMZ), and tinidazole (TNZ). MTR is extensively used in the treatment of anaerobic infections caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba histolytica, Enterococcus species, Giardia lamblia, Clostridium species, and Bacteroides (1Edwards D.I. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1993; 31: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 2Edwards D.I. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1993; 31: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3Rafii F.

Hensen E.F. Craen A.J. Rauws E.A. Tytgat G.N. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 13: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The mode of action for the 5-Ni antibiotics, as illustrated in Fig. 1, has been shown to be similar in different pathogens (6Kulda J. Int. J. Parasitol. 1999; 29: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 7Lockerby D.L. Rabin H.R. Laishley E.J. Antimicrob.

Microbiol. 1998; 28: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The inactive prodrug enters cells by simple diffusion and is then reduced in a 1-electron reduction into the toxic compound, the short-lived radical anion R-N⋅O2−. This reaction is mediated by ferredoxin, which receives an electron from the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) complex via conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A (9Ragsdale S.W. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2333-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The resulting nitro radical anion probably causes DNA strand breaks, DNA helix destabilization, unwinding of DNA, and finally cell death (1Edwards D.I. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1993; 31: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 2Edwards D.I. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1993; 31: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Declerck P.J.

FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and damage to other vital cell systems is also possible (6Kulda J. Int. J. Parasitol. 1999; 29: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The success of such drugs depends on the reductive activation of the nitro group on the 5-Ni drug, which is controlled by the redox system of the target cell. As a consequence, species with altered, absent, or elevated redox potential pathways are resistant to 5-Ni drugs (see Ref. 12Kwon D.H. El-Zaatari F.A. Kato M. Osato M.S. Reddy R. Yamaoka Y. Graham D.Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2133-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar and references therein). For H. pylori, the most convincing data regarding MTR resistance relate to inactivation of the RdxA gene, which encodes an oxygen-insensitive NADPH nitroreductase (13Marais A. Bilardi C. Cantet F. Mendz G.L. Megraud F. Res. Microbiol. 2003; 154: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Still, resistance has been found in H. pylori strains with an intact RdxA gene (14Jenks P.J. Ferrero R.L. Labigne A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1999; 43: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In T. vaginalis, a reduced amount of available ferredoxin as an electron acceptor/donor is thought to be responsible for drug resistance (15Quon D.V. d'Oliveira C.E. Johnson P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4402-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but strains with knock-out ferredoxin genes are not resistant under aerobic or anaerobic conditions (16Land K.M. Delgadillo-Correa M.G. Tachezy J. Vanacova S. Hsieh C.L. Sutak R. Johnson P.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that multiple pathways lead to both activation and resistance of the MTR and other 5-Ni drugs. The 5-Ni resistance of some of Bacteroides fragilis strains was shown to be mediated by specific genes, named Nim, located either on the chromosome (NimB) or on small mobilizable plasmids, e.g. pIP417 (NimA), pIP419 (NimC), and pIP421 (NimD) (17Breuil J. Dublanchet A. Truffaut N. Sebald M. Plasmid. 1989; 21: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Haggoud A. Reysset G. Azeddoug H. Sebald M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Haggoud A. Reysset G. Sebald M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 74: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Trinh S. Haggoud A. Reysset G. Sebald M. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A fifth Nim gene, NimE, was discovered that confers resistance to high MTR concentrations in strains from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. fragilis, and Bacteroides ovatus (21Stubbs S.L. Brazier J.S. Talbot P.R. Duerden B.I. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of the Nim gene products was deduced by comparing the metabolism of a 5-Ni-susceptible strain with the same strain harboring a plasmid containing the NimA sequence from B. fragilis (bfNimA) (22Carlier J.P. Sellier N. Rager M.N. Reysset G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the sensitive strain, the classic reduction of DMZ to its nitro radical anion was observed in agreement with the general scheme (see Fig. 1). However, in the resistant strain, DMZ was reduced to its amine derivative (R-NH2) through a low redox potential reaction. The addition of pyruvate, which can act as an electron donor through the PFOR complex (Fig. 1), increased the drug uptake (22Carlier J.P. Sellier N. Rager M.N. Reysset G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it was proposed that Nim proteins are 5-Ni reductases, which possibly use ferredoxin as the electron donor (22Carlier J.P. Sellier N. Rager M.N. Reysset G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the increasing availability of new bacterial genome sequences, it emerges that Nim homologues are present in other genera of bacteria, including Deinococcus radiodurans, B. fragilis, Helicobacter hepaticus, Clostridium sp., Salmonella typhi, Streptomyces avermitilis, as well as in Archaea Methanosarcina sp. (Fig. 2). Although the underlying physiological function of the Nim homologues in these organisms is unknown, it seems likely that the Nim gene family is ancient and widespread. More importantly, because of its unstable nature on mobilizable plasmids, Nim gene-based resistance poses a real threat to the existing applications of 5-Ni drugs. Indeed, a recent study identified seven Bacteroides-resistant strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >32 μg/ml, all containing Nim genes (23Jamal W.Y. Rotimi V.O. Brazier J.S. Johny M. Wetieh W.M. Duerden B.I. Med. Princ. Pract. 2004; 13: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present the first crystal structure of a Nim enzyme, the NimA from D. radiodurans (drNimA, DR0842) at 1.6 Å resolution as well as its complexes with the MTR antibiotic, covalently bound pyruvate and covalently bound lactate. drNimA shares 28% sequence identity and 54% sequence homology with bfNimA, and should thus be representative of the Nim family as a whole. Taken together with previous studies on NimA from B. fragilis and comparison with other closely related enzymes, our observations suggest that Nim proteins do indeed function as reductases. We propose a mechanism for the reduction of 5-Ni compounds by Nim enzymes that leads to generation of non-toxic derivatives and confers resistance against these antibiotics. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification of DR0842—The gene DR0842 (drNimA, 21.9 kDa), was cloned from genomic D. radiodurans DNA into the Gateway destination vector pDEST17 (Invitrogen) by the company Protein'eXpert SA, Grenoble, France. The correct sequence with an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag (sequence MSYYHHHHHHLESTSLYKKAG) has been confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) transformed with pDEST17-drNimA were grown at 37 °C in rich broth 2×YT medium (16 g/liter bacto-tryptone, 10 g/liter bacto-yeast extract, 10 g/liter NaCl) with 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol, and at A600 of 0.5, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. The harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) supplemented with DNaseI, Lysozyme, and Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche) and lysed by sonication, and the soluble lysate was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole at a concentration of from 10 to 500 mm. Fractions containing drNimA were de-salted (HiTrap desalting column, Pharmacia Corporation) and loaded onto a MonoQ column (Amersham Bioscience) and further eluted with a NaCl gradient (0-1 m) in which drNimA eluted at around 0.1 m NaCl. Fractions with drNimA were pooled and further purified by analytical gel filtration (Superdex 200, Pharmacia Corporation) in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA. The peak fractions were concentrated to 20 mg/ml. Electrospray mass spectrometry of the purified drNimA confirmed the molecular mass of ∼24 kDa (drNimA 21.9 kDa + His-tag 2.5 kDa). Oligomeric State and Cross-linking—An additional gel filtration run (in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) was also carried out with drNimA and the standard molecular mass markers, albumin (67 kDa) and chymotrypsin (25 kDa), to correlate the elution volume of drNimA to the molecular mass of the protein in solution. One run with only the molecular mass marker, ovalbumin (43 kDa), was also performed. All four proteins were at concentrations of ∼1 mg/ml. Another analytical gel filtration run (Superdex 200 (Pharmacia Corporation) in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA) with the pure drNimA protein was performed to change the buffer from Tris to Hepes, and this elution curve is given in Fig. 4a. The main peak from this run was used for the cross-linking experiments. A series of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, and 5.0 mm cross-linker, ethylene glycol-bis (succinic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (Sigma) in Me2SO was added to the protein and left for 20 min on the bench, and then Tris was added to a final concentration of 60 mm. The series was analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (see Fig. 4b). Crystallization, Soaking, Data Collection, and Structure Solution—Initial screening for suitable crystallization conditions was carried out by the hanging drop method using standard commercial screening solutions. The final crystallization conditions at 4 °C had 4-μl hanging drops consisting of a 1:1 mixture of protein (6 mg/ml) and reservoir solution with 0.65-0.9 m sodium acetate and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, citrate, or MES buffered at pH 5.5-6.0. The crystals grew as rosettes with plate-like “fingers,” which were cracked, and the resulting plates with an approximate size of 100 × 30 × 5 μm3 were used for data collection. For structure solution purposes, a mercury derivative (drNimA-Hg) was prepared by soaking the crystal in a solution with 1 mm ethyl mercury thiosalisylate, 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, and 30% polyethylene glycol 4000 at 4 °C for 20 min. The complex structures described in this paper were prepared by soaking the native crystals in solution containing 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, and 30% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 1, 5, or 10 mm MTR or TNZ (both from Sigma) at 4 °C. As will be seen, soaking for 2 h in 10 mm MTR produced a structure with drNimA in complex with MTR (drNimA-MTR), whereas soaking for 20 h in 1 mm TNZ yielded a complex with covalently bound pyruvate (drNimA-Pyr), and soaking for 23 h in 1 mm MTR produced a complex with drNimA and covalently bound lactate (drNimA-Lac). All diffraction data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France, using crystals cooled to 100 K. Cryo-protection for the native crystals was effected by leaving the crystals for ∼20 s in a solution with 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, and 30% polyethylene glycol 4000. Crystals of the mercury derivative and of the various complexes could all be frozen straight from their soaking solutions. The crystals of drNimA (including the substrate soaks) showed great sensitivity to ambient temperatures; therefore all manipulations described above and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen were preformed in a cold room maintained at 4 °C. All crystals belong to the space group C2, and the unit cell dimensions for the native crystal were a = 99.86 Å, b = 38.95 Å, c = 59.81 Å, and β = 114.25° (see Table I for further details). All data were integrated using MOSFLM, scaled with SCALA, and structure factors obtained using TRUNCATE software (24Collaborative Computational Project No 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Phase improvement and extension to 1.6 Å resolution were carried out with RESOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) was then used to produce an initial model for drNimA (192 of the final 224 residues). There is one monomer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit resulting in a solvent content of 43% and a Matthews coefficient of 2.2 Å3/Da. Phases were improved by iterative cycles of refinement in the REFMAC program (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The structures of the drNimA complexes described here were obtained by using the final model of the native structure (drNimA) stripped for solvent molecules as the starting point for the refinement, and model improvement was carried out as for the native structure.

Open table in a new tab Structure, Fold, and Dimerization of drNimA—The crystal structure of drNimA comprises one monomer in the asymmetric unit, and the final model of the native structure (drNimA) comprises 10 of the 21 residues in the amino-terminal His-tag, including the six histidines, 194 of 195 residues of the protein itself, one acetate ion, one pyruvate molecule, and 334 water molecules. The approximate dimensions of the monomer (Fig. 3a) are 65 × 45 × 25 Å3. The structure consists of a central six-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel with strand order β1, β2, β3, β6, β5, β4. The β-barrel is non-symmetric with β-strands β4, β5, and β6 elongating the barrel toward both the amino and carboxyl termini of the protein. These three extended strands are perpendicular to the helix α1 (from Asp-24 to Arg-33) that locks the bottom of the β-barrel as shown in Fig. 3a. Opposite the expanded strands, two helices (α2, α3) flank the β-barrel. Analytical gel filtration and cross-linking experiments clearly indicate that drNimA is a homodimer (Fig. 4). This homodimer is, in the crystals, formed by the crystallographic 2-fold axis. When the dimer is being formed, it buries a surface area of 2314 Å2 that is 18% of the area in a monomer. In the dimer, the long β-strands (β4, β5, β6) of one monomer grip onto the β-barrel of the other monomer forming a β-propeller with ten strands (Fig. 3, c and e) with approximate dimensions of 75 × 47 × 43 Å3. The two drNimA monomers are held together by 10 hydrogen bonds, including a salt bridge between Arg-38 and the carboxyl group of Glu-91, some aromatic interactions, and several water-mediated interactions at the dimer interface. Native Structure—During the refinement of the drNimA structure, a flat, X-shaped portion of difference electron density was observed in a solvent-exposed pocket on the monomer-monomer interface (Fig. 5a). This density is at hydrogen-binding distance to the absolutely conserved residue His-71 (Fig. 2). To form an interpretation of this electron density, several possible molecules were tested for suitability. Only molecules satisfying the constraints of size and shape placed by the difference electron density, and also conforming to the chemical environment available, were considered. Ultimately, the most satisfactory explanation of the residual difference density was obtained by the incorporation of a pyruvate moiety into the model. The assignment of a pyruvate molecule here seems to be reasonable, because all three oxygen atoms are involved in hydrogen binding networks (Fig. 5b), and the hydrophobic methyl group (of the pyruvate) is facing Phe-140 from one molecule and Phe-98′ from the second monomer (Fig. 5b, where the “′” implies residues from the second monomer in the homodimer). The refined pyruvate moiety fits within the observed electron density (Fig. 6a), it has reasonable bond lengths and bonds angles, and no difference density was observed when the structure refinement was completed.Fig. 6Electron density maps.

B, the active site of the complex with pyruvate and the MTR antibiotic (drNimA-MTR). The 2Fo - Fc map (1.0σ) is contoured together with some inter-atomic distances. The orientation is slightly different from panel A, but the sizes are identical. C, shown are the soaks, which resulted in a covalently bound pyruvate (drNimA-Pyr) with the corresponding 2Fo - Fc map (1.2σ). D, shown is the covalently bound lactate molecule (drNimA-Lac) with its 2Fo - Fc map (1.1σ). In panel D, the His-71-Pyr residue of the drNimA-Pyr structure is included as solid black bonds. The orientation of panels B-D are identical, but the sizes are bigger in panels C and D to focus on the covalent links. All figures have Fo - Fc maps at +4σ (green) and -4σ (red) and were made using BobScript (42Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref Scopus (1795) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the final native structure, the pyruvate is located between the β2 and β3 strands, and O-1 in the carboxyl group is 2.38 Å away from His-71 Nϵ-2. The three oxygen atoms of the pyruvate are hydrogen bound to the four water molecules W-1, W-2, W-3, and W-5. The amino acids Val-139 and Leu-107′, along with Phe-140 and Phe-98′, also contribute to the binding site (Figs. 3f and 6a). Comparison of Sequence and Structural Homologues—To search for sequence and structural homologues, the drNimA sequence and coordinates were used with the BLAST (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) and DALI servers (31Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). BLAST identified a number of sequence homologues in the data base, which included sequences from the Clostridium species, Bacteroides species, H. hepaticus and S. typhi, and Archaea (Methanosarcina mazei). The sequence identity of drNimA toward the sequences included in Fig. 2 is 14-23%, and the homology is 46-55%. Two sequence motifs were found in the Conserved Domain Database (32Marchler-Bauer A.

The DALI server confirmed these results by identifying other proteins with similar β-barrel fold as drNimA, which are all FMN-binding proteins. They include the human pyridoxine 5′-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1nrg, Z-score 4.0, root mean square deviation 2.15 Å over 97 Cα atoms), the FMN-binding protein from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (PDB code 1axj, Z-score 8.2, r.m.s.d. 2.3 Å over 83 Cα atoms), and ferric reductase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (PDB code 1i0r, Z-score 5.3, r.m.s.d. 2.5 Å for 83 Cα atoms). Comparison of drNimA with a monomer of these structures shows that drNimA contains some unique structural elements, namely the orientation of helix α2 and α3 and the extension of α4, α5, and α6 (compare Fig. 3, a and b, which are in the same orientation). In drNimA, the helices α2 and α3 are involved in the pyruvate binding site, whereas the strand extensions stabilize the homodimer (Fig. 3a). Superposition of these enzymes reveals that the location of the active sites are all on the same side of the barrel, and this region in drNimA contains His-71, which appears to be important for enzymatic activity of the Nim enzymes. Interestingly, the PNPO structure di"

However, the associated signaling mechanisms remain unclear. Utilizing neonatal cardiomyocytes, we demonstrated that RA suppressed the hypertrophic features induced by cyclic stretch or angiotensin II (Ang II). Cyclic stretch- or Ang II-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) was dose- and time-dependently inhibited by RA. Significant inhibition was observed by 5 μm RA, from 8 to 24 h of pretreatment. This inhibitory effect was not mediated at the level of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MKKs), because RA had no effect on stretch- or Ang II-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2, MKK4, and MKK3/6. However, the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate reversed the inhibitory effect of RA on MAP kinases and protein synthesis. RA up-regulated the expression level of MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and MKP-2, and the time course was correlated with the inhibitory effect of RA on activation of MAP kinases. Overexpression of wild-type MKP-1 inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 in cardiomyocytes. These data indicated that MKPs were involved in the inhibitory effect of RA on MAP kinases. Using specific RAR and RXR antagonists, we demonstrated that both RARs and RXRs were involved in regulating stretch- or Ang II-induced activation of MAP kinases.

These studies demonstrate that retinoid-dependent pathways are involved in promoting the ventricular phenotype in embryonic heart, and indicate that retinoids may have an important role in maintaining the normal ventricular phenotype in the postnatal state. Although the anti-hypertrophic effect of RA in neonatal cardiomyocytes has been demonstrated, the signaling mechanisms of RA action are not well understood.Cardiac hypertrophy is associated with the activation of numerous signal transduction factors, including G protein-coupled receptors, receptor-tyrosine kinases, protein kinase C, and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling cascade (14Komuro I.

MAP kinases are serine/threonine kinases that target substrates in a multilayered signaling network composed of the MAP kinases, the MAP kinase kinases (MKKs), and the MEK kinases (MEKKs). MAP kinases can be divided into three major subfamilies: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAP kinase. A large number of in vitro and in vivo studies have identified important roles for the three branches of the MAP kinase signaling pathway in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (19Sugden P.H. Clerk A.

In response to MAP kinase activation, a family of dual-specificity phosphatases, MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), become transcriptionally induced, leading to the specific dephosphorylation and inactivation of MAP kinases (31Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MKP-1 is an important member of the dual-specificity phosphatase family that is expressed in the heart, where it regulates inactivation of p38, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2 (32Chu Y. Solski P.A.

RA inhibits serum-induced phosphorylation of JNK, which is associated with a post-translational increase in the level of MKP-1 protein in tumor cells (37Lee H.Y. Sueoka N. Hong W.K. Mangelsdorf D.J. Claret F.X. Kurie J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of MKP-1 and inhibition of JNK phosphorylation is involved in the antiapoptotic effect of RA on H2O2-exposed mesangial cells (38Xu Q. Konta T. Furusu A. Nakayama K. Lucio-Cazana J.

Although these observations clearly suggest a potential link between retinoids and MAP kinase signaling, the mechanisms involved, particularly in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, have not been elucidated.In the present study, we determined the effects of RA on cyclic stretch- or Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and the associated signaling mechanisms. Our results show that RA had inhibitory effects on the activation of MAP kinases induced by cyclic stretch or Ang II, and that the up-regulation of MKPs by RA was involved. These results identify a mechanism whereby RA regulates expression of MKPs and inhibition of MAP kinases, which play an important role in the anti-hypertrophic effects of RA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture reagents (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 Medium, horse serum, fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics) were from Invitrogen (Baltimore, MD).

Chem. 2002; 9: 591-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Cell Cultures—Monolayer cultures of neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared from the ventricles of 1-3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups, as previously described (40Kodama H. Fukuda K. Pan J. Makino S. Baba A. Hori S. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and were cultured in 5% horse serum, 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine (prevent proliferation of nonmyocytes) for 48 h at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in 100-mm culture dishes (for immunostaining in response to Ang II, in 2-well chamber slide) or in laminin-coated six-well BioFlex culture plates (Flex Cell International Corporation). Cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to intervention. For the cyclic stretch model, serum-starved cells were subjected to cyclic stretch using the Flexcell 3000 Strain Unit. The vacuum produced a 15% elongation on the flexible bottom membranes at a frequency of 60 cycles/min. Culture plates not subjected to cyclic stretch were used as controls.Adenovirus Generation—The replication-defective adenovirus-encoding wild-type MKP-1 (AdMKP-1, a gift from Dr. Molkentin, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH) was plaque purified, and amplified using HEK293 cells. The multiplicity of viral infection (MOI) for each virus was determined by dilution assay in HEK293 cells. Cardiomyocytes were infected with adenovirus at a MOI of 25-50 plaque-forming units for 8 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 media for an additional 24 h before treatment or analysis.Leucine Incorporation—Serum-starved cardiomyocytes were subjected to cyclic stretch or exposed to Ang II for 24 h. [3H]Leucine (1μCi/ml) was added 4 h before harvest. The total radioactivity of incorporated [3H]leucine into proteins was measured by liquid scintillation counting, as described previously (41Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Quantification of Total Cell Protein Content—The total protein content per cell number was determined as previously described (13Wang H.J. Zhu Y.C. Yao T. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 2162-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the same amount of cardiomyocytes were cultured in laminincoated 6-well BioFlex culture plates. After 24 h of serum starvation, cardiomyocytes were pretreated, with or without RA (5 μm) for 24 h, and subjected to cyclic stretch (24 h) or exposed to Ang II (1 μm, 36 h). Cells were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and dissolved in 2% SDS. Protein concentrations were measured using a DC protein assay (Bio-Rad).Immunocytochemistry—After 24 h of cyclic stretch or Ang II stimulation, cardiomyocytes were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with Texas Red-X phalloidin (1:40). Immunostained cardiomyocytes were viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Quantitation of cell surface area was performed on actin-stained cardiomyocytes.Western Blot Analysis—Cardiomyocytes were lysed in lysis buffer as previously described (40Kodama H. Fukuda K. Pan J. Makino S. Baba A. Hori S. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 42Pan J. Fukuda K. Saito M. Matsuzaki J. Kodama H. Sano M. Takahashi T. Kato T. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of extracted proteins (50 μg) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the Western blots probed with anti-MKP-1, MKP-2, or MKP-3 antibody or antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of MEK1, MKK3, MKK4, ERK1/2, JNK, or p38. Membranes were reprobed with unphosphorylated forms of corresponding antibodies to confirm equal loading. Primary antibody binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Extraction of Nuclear Proteins and the Expression of RARs and RXRs—Cardiomyocytes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and scraped into the same buffer. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to standard methods described previously (40Kodama H. Fukuda K. Pan J. Makino S. Baba A. Hori S. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 43Kodama H. Fukuda K. Pan J. Makino S. Sano M. Takahashi T. Hori S. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of extracted nuclear proteins (20 μg) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The expression level of RARs and RXRs was determined using anti-RARα, -β, -γ, RXRα, -β, and -γ antibodies. Another set of samples was probed with anti-histone antibody, as a control for equal protein loading.Gel Mobility Shift Assay—To determine the transcriptional activation of RAR and RXR, gel shift assay was performed as described previously (40Kodama H. Fukuda K. Pan J. Makino S. Baba A. Hori S. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of nuclear extract were incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) and radiolabeled probes (∼10,000 cpm) in 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol for 30 min at 25 °C. The probes were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and their sequences have been described (RAR: 5′-AGGGTAGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACTC-3′, RAR mutant: 5′-AGGG TAGGGAACACCGAAAGTTCACTC-3′; RXR: 5′-AGCTTCAGGTCAGAGGTCAGAGAG CT-3′, and RXR mutant: AGCTTCAGCACAGAGCACAGAGAGCT-3′). The oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions were resolved on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel containing 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA) for 3 h at 150 V in 4 °C. The gel was dried, and exposed to x-ray film.Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical differences were determined using a Student's t test (p < 0.05).RESULTSRA Inhibits Cyclic Stretch- and Ang II-induced Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy—To determine the effects of RA on cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyocytes were pretreated with or without RA for 24 h, and subjected to cyclic stretch or exposed to Ang II for an additional 24 h. Cell morphological changes were observed. Cyclic stretch and Ang II stimulation induced a marked increase in cell size, which was significantly inhibited by RA (Fig. 1, A and B). RA treatment also reduced the accumulation of sarcomeric fibers and the myofibrillar reorganization in response to Ang II and cyclic stretch (Fig. 1A). RA alone had no effect on myocardial cell phenotype, indicating that the effect of RA was not secondary to a toxic cellular effect. In addition to the specific effects on cell morphology, cardiac hypertrophy is accompanied by an increase in protein synthesis. In an effort to determine the effects of RA on protein synthesis, we performed [3H]leucine incorporation, which is an index of protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 1C, cyclic stretch and Ang II stimulation resulted in a significant increase in [3H]leucine incorporation, which was inhibited by RA. RA alone had little inhibitory effect on the basal level, but no significant difference compared with control. We also determined the effect of RA on total protein content. As shown in Fig. 1D, 24 h of stretching or 36 h of Ang II stimulation induced approximately a 40 and 35% increase in total protein content, respectively (compared with control), which was inhibited by RA pretreatment. Total protein content increased about 8% in the myocytes incubated with 5 μm RA alone, but there was no significant difference compared with control. These results suggest that RA suppresses cyclic stretch- or Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy.RA Inhibits Cyclic Stretch-induced Activation of MAP Kinases—Accumulating data have shown that MAP kinases are important mediators in cardiac hypertrophy. We determined the involvement of MAP kinases in the anti-hypertrophic effect of RA. Cardiomyocytes were pretreated with or without RA for different times and subjected to cyclic stretch for 8 min. ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase activity was determined by Western blot analysis, using specific antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2, -JNK1/2, and p38. RA time-dependently inhibited stretch-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 (Fig. 2A). Although the inhibitory effect was observed beginning at 2 h of RA pretreatment (p > 0.05, compared with stretch, bottom panel), the most significant inhibition was observed from 8 to 24 h (p < 0.05, compared with stretch). Stretch-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases was also dose-dependently inhibited by 24 h of RA pretreatment (Fig. 2B). The phosphorylation of MAP kinases was significantly inhibited by 5-10 μm of RA (p < 0.05, compared with stretch, bottom panel), whereas a low dose of RA (0.1-1 μm) had no effect. The involvement of MAP kinases in stretch-induced cardiac hypertrophy was further determined using specific inhibitors for ERK (PD98059, PD), JNK (SP600125, SP), and p38 (SB202190, SB). Cardiomyocytes were subjected to stretch for 24 h, in the presence or absence of inhibitors. [3H]leucine incorporation was performed. As shown in Fig. 2C, the stretch-induced increase in leucine incorporation was significantly inhibited by 70, 50, and 40%, respectively, in PD98059-, SP600125-, or SB202190-treated cardiomyocytes, indicating that all three MAP kinases were involved in the stretch-mediated hypertrophic process. Taken together, our results suggested that MAP kinase pathways were involved in the inhibitory effects of RA on cyclic stretch-induced cardiac hypertrophy.Fig. 2RA inhibits cyclic stretch-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A, cardiomyocytes were pretreated with or without RA (5 μm) for different times, then subjected to cyclic stretch for 8 min. Cell extracts (50 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody specific for phospho-ERK1/2, -JNK, or -p38 MAP kinase. Membranes were stripped and reprobed for total ERK1/2, JNK1, or p38, as a control for equal protein loading (upper panel). B, cardiomyocytes were pretreated with different doses of RA for 24 h as indicated, and subjected to stretch for 8 min. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 was determined (upper panel). Phosphorylated levels of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, or p38 were quantified by densitometric scanning, and normalized to the level of total ERK, JNK, or p38 (A and B, bottom panel).

Zhu Y.C. Yao T. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 2162-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined whether MAP kinases were also involved in RA action. As shown in Fig. 3A, Ang II induced rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 at 2 min, which was sustained to 60 min, and returned to a basal level at 120 min. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 in response to Ang II, was observed from 2 min, with peak phosphorylation observed at 40-60 min. The involvement of MAP kinases in Ang II-induced protein synthesis was determined. Cardiomyocytes were exposed to Ang II for 24 h, in the presence or absence of PD98059, SP600125, or SB202190, and [3H] leucine incorporation was determined. The Ang II-induced increase in leucine incorporation was inhibited by PD98059, SP600125, or SB202190 (inhibited by 60, 45, and 30%, respectively, compared with Ang II). We further determined the effect of RA on Ang II-induced activation of MAP kinases. Western blot analysis demonstrated that RA pretreatment inhibited Ang II-induced activation of MAP kinases, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Significant inhibition by RA was observed from 8 to 24 h, at a dose of 5-10 μm (p < 0.05, compared with Ang II, Fig. 3, C and D). RA pretreatment for 2-4 h at 0.1-1 μm did not significantly inhibit Ang II-induced activation of MAP kinases (p > 0.05, Fig. 3, C and D, bottom panel).Fig. 3RA inhibits Ang II-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A, Ang II induces phosphorylation of MAP kinases. Cardiomyocytes were exposed to Ang II (0.1 μm) for the times indicated. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 was determined, as described in Fig. 2A. B, cardiomyocytes were exposed to Ang II for 24 h, in the presence or absence of PD98059 (PD, 50 μm), SB202190 (SB, 10 μm), or SP600125 (SP, 20 μm), and [3H]leucine incorporation was measured.

D, cardiomyocytes were pretreated with different doses of RA for 24 h, exposed to Ang II for 3 min (ERK and p38), or 40 min (JNK), and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 determined by Western blotting (upper panel).

https://openalex.org/W2151706268,"In Corynebacterium glutamicum, the activity of aconitase is 2.5-4-fold higher on propionate, citrate, or acetate than on glucose. Here we show that this variation is caused by transcriptional regulation. In search for putative regulators, a gene (acnR) encoding a TetR-type transcriptional regulator was found to be encoded immediately downstream of the aconitase gene (acn) in C. glutamicum. Deletion of the acnR gene led to a 5-fold increased acn-mRNA level and a 5-fold increased aconitase activity, suggesting that AcnR functions as repressor of acn expression. DNA microarray analyses indicated that acn is the primary target gene of AcnR in the C. glutamicum genome. Purified AcnR was shown to be a homodimer, which binds to the acn promoter in the region from -11 to -28 relative to the transcription start. It thus presumably acts by interfering with the binding of RNA polymerase. The acn-acnR organization is conserved in all corynebacteria and mycobacteria with known genome sequence and a putative AcnR consensus binding motif (CAGNACnnncGTACTG) was identified in the corresponding acn upstream regions. Mutations within this motif inhibited AcnR binding. Because the activities of citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase were previously reported not to be increased during growth on acetate, our data indicate that aconitase is a major control point of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity in C. glutamicum, and they identify AcnR as the first transcriptional regulator of a tricarboxylic acid cycle gene in the Corynebacterianeae.

Biotechnol. 2003; 104: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and because of its emerging role as a model organism for the Corynebacterineae, a suborder of the actinomycetes, which also includes the genus Mycobacterium (6Stackebrandt E. Rainey F.A. WardRainey N.L. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 479-491Crossref Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). The tricarboxylic acid cycle is of central importance for the metabolism of C. glutamicum because it provides energy and biosynthetic precursors and therefore the flux through this cycle is an important aspect for the production of amino acids of the aspartate and glutamate family. Thus, it is not surprising that several tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes of C. glutamicum have been studied biochemically and/or genetically in the past, i.e. citrate synthase (gltA, Ref. 7Eikmanns B.J. Thum-Schmitz N. Eggeling L. Lüdtke K.U. Sahm H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd, Ref. 8Eikmanns B.J. Rittmann D. Sahm H.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6884-6891Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, no information is available hitherto on the genetic regulation of this pathway in C. glutamicum, although there is evidence that it differs from that of the model bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, since e.g. glucose and acetate are consumed in parallel rather than successively (12Wendisch V.F. de Graaf A.A. Sahm H. Eikmanns B.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3088-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). No studies have been performed yet in C. glutamicum on aconitase (EC 4.2.1.3), which catalyzes the stereospecific and reversible isomerization of citrate to isocitrate via cis-aconitate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and in the glyoxylate cycle. It is an unusual enzyme in that it contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster, which is not involved in electron transfer, but in binding of the substrate (13Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Besides their catalytic function, a certain class of aconitases can also have a regulatory function by binding to certain mRNAs and inhibiting or increasing their translation into protein (14Alen C. Sonenshein A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10412-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1817-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This regulatory function is carried out by a catalytically inactive form of aconitase, which is formed under conditions of iron starvation or oxidative stress, when the iron-sulfur cluster is disassembled and the apoprotein is formed. In many bacteria, expression of the aconitase genes is controlled by transcriptional regulators (see “Discussion”). Here, we provide evidence that this is also the case for the C. glutamicum aconitase gene (acn) 1The abbreviations used are: acn, C. glutamicum aconitase gene; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; AcnR, TetR-type repressor protein. 1The abbreviations used are: acn, C. glutamicum aconitase gene; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; AcnR, TetR-type repressor protein. and describe the identification and characterization of the TetR-type repressor protein AcnR. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—All strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in Table I. C. glutamicum strain ATCC13032 was used as wild type in this study. Strain ΔacnR is a derivative containing an in-frame deletion of the acnR gene. For cultivation of C. glutamicum in liquid media, 5 ml of CGIII medium (19Menkel E. Thierbach G. Eggeling L. Sahm H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 684-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or brain heart infusion (BHI) medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI), both supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose, were inoculated with colonies from a fresh Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plate (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and incubated overnight at 30 °C and 170 rpm. This first preculture was used to inoculate 60 ml of CGXII minimal medium (21Keilhauer C. Eggeling L. Sahm H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5595-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a 500-ml shake flask with two baffles. The second preculture was incubated overnight at 30 °C and 120 rpm and then used to inoculate the main culture, for which the same conditions were applied as for the second preculture. The CGXII minimal medium contained as a carbon source either 222 mm glucose, 244 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm sodium citrate, or 104 mm sodium propionate. When citrate was used as carbon source, the medium contained in addition 100 mm MgCl2. When appropriate, the medium was supplemented with 25 μg of kanamycin/ml. C. glutamicum strains carrying plasmid pEKEx2 and derivatives thereof were cultivated in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. For cloning purposes, E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) was used and grown at 37 °C in LB medium (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) (22Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar) was used for overproduction of the C. glutamicum AcnR protein with expression plasmids based on pET24 or pET28 (Novagen, Madison, WI).Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyStrains or plasmidsRelevant characteristicsSource or Ref.StrainsC. glutamicumATCC13032Biotin-auxotrophic wild type(1)13032ΔacnRIn-frame deletion of the acnR geneThis workE. coliDH5αsupE44 ΔlacU169 (ф80lacZΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1InvitrogenBL21(DE3)ompT hsdSB(rB- mB-) gal dcm (DE3)(22) NovagenPlasmidspK19mobsacBKanR; vector for allelic exchange in C. glutamicum; (pK18 oriVE.c., sacB, lacZα)(27)pK19mobsacB-ΔacnRKanR; pK19mobsacB derivative containing a crossover PCR product covering the up- and downstream regions of acnRThis workpET24bKanR; vector for overexpression of genes in E. coli, adding a C-terminal hexahistidine affinity tag to the synthesized protein (pBR322 oriVE.c., PT7, lacI)NovagenpET24b-StreptagKanR; pET24b derivative adding a C-terminal StrepTag-II to the synthesized proteinMeyer and BottaUnpublished data.pET24b-acnR-CKanR; pET24b-Streptag derivative for over-production of AcnR with a C-terminal StrepTag-IIThis studypET28aKanR; vector for overexpression of genes in E. coli, adding an N-terminal or a C-terminal hexahistidine tag to the synthesized protein (pBR322 oriVE.c., PT7,lacI)NovagenpET28a-StreptagKanR; pET28a derivative adding an N-terminal StrepTag-II to the synthesized protein(29)pET28a-acnR-NKanR; pET28a-Streptag derivative for over-production of AcnR with an N-terminal StrepTag-IIThis studypEKEx2KanR; C. glutamicum/E. coli shuttle vector for regulated gene expression (Ptac, lacIQ, pBL1 oriVC.g., pUC18 oriVE.c.)(63)pEKEx2-acnRKanR; pEKEx2 derivative containing the acnR gene from C. glutamicum under the control of the tac promoterThis studypEKEx2-acnR60KanR; pEKEx2 derivative containing a shortened version of the acnR gene (first 180 bp) from C. glutamicum under the control of the tac promoterThis studypEKEx2-acnR89KanR; pEKEx2 derivative containing a shortened version of the acnR gene (first 267 bp) from C. glutamicum under the control of the tac promoterThis studypEKEx2-acnR-C-StrepKanR; pEKEx2 derivative containing the acnR gene with a C-terminal StrepTag-II from C. glutamicum under the control of the tac promoterThis studya Unpublished data. Open table in a new tab Determination of Aconitase Activity—For the determination of the aconitase activity, cells from the CGXII main culture (∼25 ml) were harvested with ∼25 g of crushed ice (precooled to -20 °C) by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 900 μl of Tris-HCl (90 mm; pH 8.0), and the cells were mechanically disrupted by 3× 20 s bead beating with 1 g of zirconia-silica beads (diameter 0.1 mm; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) using a Silamat S5 (Vivadent, Ellwangen, Germany). After centrifugation (5 min; 18,320 × g; 4 °C), the supernatant was used immediately for the enzyme assay. Aconitase activity was assayed by following the formation of cis-aconitate from isocitrate (23Henson C.P. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3833-3838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 20 °C. The assay mixture contained 950-995 μl of 90 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 20 mmdl-trisodium isocitrate. The reaction was started by the addition of 5-50 μl of cell extract, and cis-aconitate formation was determined by measuring the absorbance increase at 240 nm using a Jasco V560 spectrophotometer. An extinction coefficient for cis-aconitate of 3.6 mm-1 cm-1 at 240 nm was used. One unit of activity corresponds to 1 μmol of isocitrate converted to cis-aconitate per min. Recombinant DNA Work—The enzymes for recombinant DNA work were obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany) or New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany). The oligonucleotides used in this study were obtained from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) and are listed in Table II. Routine methods like PCR, restriction, or ligation were carried out according to standard protocols (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA from C. glutamicum was prepared as described (7Eikmanns B.J. Thum-Schmitz N. Eggeling L. Lüdtke K.U. Sahm H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Plasmids from E. coli were isolated with the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). E. coli was transformed by the RbCl method (24Hanahan D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. 1. IRL-Press, Oxford/Washington D. C.1985: 109-135Google Scholar), C. glutamicum by electroporation (25van der Rest M.E. Lange C. Molenaar D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 52: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed with a Licor 4200 sequencer (Licor Inc., Lincoln, NB). Sequencing reactions were carried out with the Thermo Sequenase Primer Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany).Table IIOligonucleotides used in this studyOligonucleotideSequence (5′ → 3′) and propertiesaIn some cases oligonucleotides were designed to introduce recognition sites for restriction endonucleases (recognition sites underlined, restriction endonucleases indicated in parentheses) or complementary 21mer sequences for generating crossover PCR products (printed in italics).tetR-A-forTAT ATA GAA TTC TGC AGT TCC CTG CAG GCG AAT C (EcoRI)tetR-B-revCCC ATC CAC TAA ACT TAA ACA GCC TGC CGC TAC GGA CAC AAT GtetR-C-forTGT TTA AGT TTA GTG GAT GGG GAT CTG GTC GAG GGA ACT GTC CGtetR-D-revTAT ATA AAG CTT GTT AGC AAC ACT GTG GTG GCG CC (HindIII)tetR-amp-forCTA AGG GCA CTA ACC TGC TCG GtetR-amp-revTTG CCA ACA CCA CGT GTC CAG GacnR-FP-forTAT ATA CAT ATG TCC GTA GCG GCA GGC GAC AAA C (NdeI)acnR-FP28-revTAT ATA CTC GAG TTA GTC GCG TTT ACG GAC AGT TC (XhoI)acnR-FP24-revTAT ATA CTC GAG GTC GCG TTT ACG GAC AGT TC (XhoI)acn-PEK-forCCT TCA TTA GTG TCG GGC TCA CGacn-PEK-revGGA TTT CGA TGC TTG GAT CGG AAGacn-PE1*IRD800-GGG TGC TCT TAG CAT TGA AGG AGacn-PE3*IRD800-GTG AGA TTT CGC GAC GGC GTC TGacn-FP1*IRD800-GAA AGT CAC ATC ACG CAC GTA CCRT-1-forCAG GCG ACA AAC CAA CAA ATA GCCRT-1-revCTC GAC CAG ATC CAA TAC TTC GGRT-2-forCGA GAC TCC TAA GAC TGT CAA GGRT-2-revGTT GCT TCT TCC AGT CGG CGT ACRT-3-forCAG AAC CAG CTG GTT GAC ATC GCRT-3-revCAT CTG ACG CAG CAC GTA CTG CacnR-forTAT ATA GGA TCC AAG GAG ATA TAG ATG TGT CCG TAG CGG CAG GCG AC (BamHI)acnR-revTAT ATA GAA TTC GTC ACG TCG CTC AGC TGC GGC (EcoRI)acnR-strep-revTAT ATA GAA TTC TTA CTT CTC GAA CTG CGG GTG GCT CCA CTC GAG GTC GCG TTT ACG GAC AGT TCC (EcoRI)acnR-rev-60TAT ATA GAA TTC TAG GAA CAG GTT TTC TTT GTC ACC G (EcoRI)acnR-rev-89TAT ATA GAA TTC ATC TTC CAG CAT TCC TCG CAT C (EcoRI)RT-dnaE-fwTGC CCT TCC GGC GAT GTG CAART-dnaE-rvCTG GAA CCA TGT CGT CCC AGA GBS-1-forTCC GAC AAA ACC GCT GCC TAG GBS-1-revGGC GTC TGC TTC GGC TGA GCCBS-2-forAGA CGT AGG GTC CTT TTC CAC AGBS-2-revTCA TTA TCC TAA CAG TAC AAG CGT TBS-3-forCAA CTT TCC CGC CAG AAC GCT TGBS-3-revGGG TTC TTG GCG CGT CAA TAA CGBS-4*-forCAA CTT TCC CGC CAG ATG GCT TCA ACT GTT AGG ABS-5*-forCAA CTT TCC CGC GTG AAC GCT TGT ACA CTT AGG ATA ATBS-6*-forCAA CTT TCG GGC CAG AAC GCT TGT ACT GTT TCG ATA ATG AAGBS-7*-forCAA CTT TCC CGC CAG AAC CGA AGT ACT GTT AGa In some cases oligonucleotides were designed to introduce recognition sites for restriction endonucleases (recognition sites underlined, restriction endonucleases indicated in parentheses) or complementary 21mer sequences for generating crossover PCR products (printed in italics). Open table in a new tab An in-frame acnR deletion mutant of C. glutamicum was constructed via a two-step homologous recombination procedure as described previously (26Niebisch A. Bott M. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The acnR up- and downstream regions (∼500 bp each) were amplified using the oligonucleotide pairs tetR-A-for/tetR-B-rev and tetR-C-for/tetR-d-rev, respectively, followed by a crossover PCR with oligonucleotides tetR-A-for and tetR-d-rev. The resulting PCR product of ∼1 kb was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and cloned into pK19mobsacB (27Schäfer A. Tauch A. Jäger W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Pühler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar) cut with the same enzymes. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the cloned PCR product did not contain spurious mutations. Transfer of the resulting plasmid pK19mobsacB-ΔacnR into C. glutamicum and screening for the first and second recombination event was performed as described previously (26Niebisch A. Bott M. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The genomic structure of the mutant was first checked by PCR analysis of chromosomal DNA with the primer pair tetR-amp-for/tetR-amp-rev (Table II). The PCR products obtained with wild-type DNA (1.6 kb) and ΔacnR mutant DNA (1.1 kb) had the expected sizes. Furthermore, the mutant was controlled by Southern blot analysis (26Niebisch A. Bott M. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using EcoRI-digested DNA and a digoxigenin-labeled PCR product covering the acnR gene and the 500-bp up- and downstream DNA as probe. The expected fragment sizes were obtained for wild type (1.8 kb) and the ΔacnR mutant (1.3 kb), confirming the successful acnR deletion (data not shown). For the purification of AcnR with a C-terminal StrepTag-II (28Skerra A. Schmidt T.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 326: 271-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the acnR coding region was amplified using the Expand High Fidelity polymerase mix (Roche Diagnostics) and oligonucleotides that introduced an NdeI restriction site overlapping the start codon (acnR-FP-for) and an XhoI restriction site preceding the stop codon (acnR-FP-24rev). The purified PCR product was cloned into the expression vector pET24b-Streptag cut with NdeI and XhoI. The AcnR protein encoded by the pET24 derivative (AcnR-C) contains ten additional amino acid residues (LEWSHPQFEK) at the C terminus. For the purification of AcnR with an N-terminal StrepTag-II, the acnR coding region was amplified with the primers acnR-FP-for and acnR-FP-28rev, and the PCR product was cloned into pET28a-Streptag (29Engels S. Schweitzer J.E. Ludwig C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) cut with NdeI and XhoI. The AcnR protein encoded by the pET28 derivative (AcnR-N) contains 14 additional amino acid residues (MASWSHPQFEKGAH) at the N terminus. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the AcnR coding sequence of the resulting plasmids pET24b-acnR-C and pET28aacnR-N did not contain spurious mutations. For the overproduction of the streptagged AcnR derivatives, the plasmids were transferred into E. coli BL21(DE3). In order to construct plasmids pEKEx2-acnR, pEKEx2-acnR60, pEKEx2-acnR89, and pEKEx2-acnR-C-Strep, the acnR fragments were amplified with oligonucleotide acnR-for as forward primer and acnR-rev, acnR-rev-60, acnR-rev-89, or acnR-strep-rev, respectively, as reverse primers. After digestion with BamHI and EcoRI, the purified PCR products were cloned into the vector pEKEx2 cut with the same enzymes. All PCR-derived parts of the resulting plasmids were checked by DNA sequence analysis in order to exclude unwanted mutations. Preparation of Total RNA—Cultures of the wild type and the ΔacnR mutant were grown in CGXII minimal medium containing 4% (w/v) glucose. In the exponential growth phase at an OD600 of 5-6, 25 ml of the cultures were used for the preparation of total RNA as described previously (30Wendisch V.F. Zimmer D.P. Khodursky A. Peter B. Cozzarelli N. Kustu S. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 290: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Möker N. Brocker M. Schaffer S. Krämer R. Morbach S. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 420-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Isolated RNA samples were analyzed for quantity and quality by UV spectrophotometry and denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), respectively, and stored at -70 °C until use. DNA Microarray Analyses—The generation of whole genome DNA microarrays (32Wendisch V.F. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 104: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), synthesis of fluorescent-labeled cDNA from total RNA, microarray hybridization, washing, and data analysis were performed as described previously (33Polen T. Rittmann D. Wendisch V.F. Sahm H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 1759-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Lange C. Rittmann D. Wendisch V.F. Bott M. Sahm H. Appl. Environ.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4519-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Genes that exhibited significantly changed mRNA levels (p < 0.05 in a Student's t test) by at least a factor of three were determined in four series of DNA microarray experiments: (i) 10 comparisons of the wild type and the ΔacnR mutant cultivated in regular CGXII minimal medium with 4% (w/v) glucose (contains 36 μm iron before autoclaving and ∼8 μm iron after autoclaving); (ii) four comparisons of the wild type and the ΔacnR mutant cultivated in CGXII-glucose medium with an elevated iron concentration (addition of 100 or 500 μm FeSO4 after autoclaving); (iii) three comparisons of the wild type grown with ∼8 μm iron and with 508 μm iron; (iv) three comparisons of the ΔacnR mutant grown with ∼8 μm iron and with 508 μm iron. The 34 genes that were differentially expressed in one or more of these series of experiments were subjected to a hierarchical cluster analysis (36Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13079) Google Scholar) as described previously (33Polen T. Rittmann D. Wendisch V.F. Sahm H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 1759-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Ishige T. Krause M. Bott M. Wendisch V.F. Sahm H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4519-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Primer Extension Analysis—Non-radioactive primer extension analysis was performed using the IRD800-labeled oligonucleotides acn-PE1* and acn-PE3* (Table II) and 15 μg of total RNA as described previously (29Engels S. Schweitzer J.E. Ludwig C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The length of the primer extension products was determined by running the four lanes of a DNA sequencing reaction set up with the same oligonucleotide as used for primer extension alongside the primer extension products on the denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A PCR product obtained with the primer pair acn-PEK-fw/acn-PEK-rev was used as template for the DNA sequencing reaction. Overproduction and Purification of Streptagged AcnR—E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pET24b-acnR-C was cultivated in 100 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin in a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask at 30 °C until the OD600 reached a value between 0.3 and 0.5. Synthesis of the AcnR-C was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was incubated for another 3 h. Cells (final OD600 ∼1) were washed once and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer W (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). After addition of 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, the cell suspension was passed three times through a French pressure cell (SLM Aminco, Spectronic Instruments, Rochester) at 207 MPa. Intact cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (20 min, 5,000 × g, 4 °C). The cell-free extract was subjected to ultracentrifugation (1 h, 150,000 × g, 4 °C) and the supernatant applied to a StrepTactin Sepharose column with a bed volume of 1 ml (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer W and streptagged AcnR was eluted with 10 × 1 ml buffer W containing 15 mm desthiobiotin (Sigma-Aldrich). Fractions containing AcnR-C were pooled, and the elution buffer was exchanged against 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol by gel filtration with Sephadex G-25 (PD-10 column, Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The purity of the protein preparation was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and subsequent protein detection with Gel Code blue stain reagent (Pierce). Using this protocol, about 1 mg of AcnR-C was purified to apparent homogeneity. The same procedure as described above was used for the isolation of AcnR with an N-terminal StrepTag-II using E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET28a-acnR-N. Size Exclusion Chromatography—The size of purified AcnR-C and AcnR-N was estimated by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences) integrated into an Äkta Explorer system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-buffer pH 8.0 containing 300 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After application of 0.5-1 mg of purified protein, elution was performed at 4 °C with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The column was calibrated with a premixed protein molecular mass marker (MWGF-200, Sigma). DNase I Footprinting Assays—The binding site of purified AcnR protein at the acn promoter was analyzed by DNase I footprinting as described previously (29Engels S. Schweitzer J.E. Ludwig C. Bott M. Schaffer S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 285-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). PCR products covering the acn promotor region from position -346 to +52 or from position -268 to +241 relative to the proposed TTG start codon were obtained with the primer pairs acn-PEK-for/acn-PE1* (labeled non-template strand) and acn-FP1*/acn-PEK-rev (labeled template strand) respectively. The primers with an asterisk were IRD800-labeled at the 5′-end. The DNA-AcnR mixtures were treated with DNase I, and the reaction products were separated by denaturing PAGE. The regions, which were protected from DNase I digestion, were localized by running besides the footprinting reactions the four lanes of a DNA sequencing reaction set up with the oligonucleotide acn-PE1* or acn-FP1* and a PCR product obtained with the primer pair acn-PEK-for/acn-PEK-rev as template. Gel Shift Assays—Purified AcnR-C (500 nm) was mixed with ∼50 nm DNA fragments (80-300 bp) covering the acn promoter region in a total volume of 20 μl. The buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mm CaCl2. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the samples were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis with Tris acetate/EDTA buffer (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning.

https://openalex.org/W2055748044,"The cytosolic yeast Hsp40 Ydj1 contains a conserved zinc finger-like region (ZFLR), which has two zinc-binding domains (ZBD), that helps regulate and specify Hsp70 function. To investigate the mechanism for Ydj1 ZFLR action, ZBDI and ZBDII mutants were constructed and characterized. ZBDII mutants exhibited temperature-sensitive growth defects, but yeast tolerated mutation of ZBDI. However, ZBDI and ZBDII mutants were defective at facilitating androgen receptor (AR) folding. Defective AR folding was associated with the accumulation of complexes between AR and Ydj1 ZFLR mutants and a reduction in Hsp70.AR complex formation. Purified Ydj1 ZBDI and ZBDII mutants could bind non-native polypeptides but could not deliver luciferase to Hsp70 and were defective at luciferase refolding. Interestingly, the ability of Ydj1 to synergize with Hsp70 to suppress thermally induced protein aggregation was blocked by mutation of ZBDII, but not ZBDI. Hence, ZBDII is required for yeast to survive heat stress because it is essential for Ydj1 to cooperate with Hsp70 to suppress protein aggregation. On the other hand, protein folding is dependent upon the action of both ZBDI and ZBDII because each is required for Hsp70 to capture non-native polypeptides from Ydj1."
https://openalex.org/W1980018864,"Thrombin formation results from cleavage of prothrombin following Arg271 and Arg320. Both bonds are accessible for cleavage, yet the sequential action of prothrombinase on Arg320 followed by Arg271 is implied by the intermediate observed during prothrombin activation. We have studied the individual cleavage reactions catalyzed by prothrombinase by using a series of recombinant derivatives: wild type prothrombin (IIWT) contained both cleavage sites; IIQ271 contained a single cleavable site at Arg320; IIQ320 and IIA320 contained a single cleavable site at Arg271; and IIQQ was resistant to cleavage. Cleavage at Arg320 in IIQ271 could account for the initial cleavage reaction leading to the consumption of either plasma prothrombin or IIWT, whereas cleavage at Arg271 in either IIQ320 or IIA320 was found to be ∼30-fold slower. Equivalent kinetic constants were obtained for three of the four possible half-reactions. Slow cleavage at Arg271 in intact prothrombin resulted from an ∼30-fold reduction in Vmax. Thus, the observed pathway of bond cleavage by prothrombinase can be explained by the kinetic constants for the four possible individual cleavage reactions. IIQ320 was a competitive inhibitor of IIQ271 cleavage, and IIQQ was a competitive inhibitor for each reaction with Ki ≈ Km. The data are inconsistent with previous proposals and suggest a model in which substrates for each of the four possible half-reactions bind in a mutually exclusive manner and with equal affinity to prothrombinase in a cleavage site-independent way. Despite equivalent exosite binding interactions between all four possible substrates and the enzyme, we propose that ordered bond cleavage results from the constraints associated with the binding of substrates in one of two conformations to a single form of prothrombinase.

Within detection limits, bond cleavage in this order appears to quantitatively account for thrombin formation catalyzed by prothrombinase (9Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1983; 258: 5386-5391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The individual bonds in both intermediates are cleaved by prothrombinase (Scheme I, Reactions 2 or 4) with approximately equal catalytic efficiency (9Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6755-6764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consequently, an explanation for ordered bond cleavage by prothrombinase requires that Arg271 and Arg320 in intact prothrombin are cleaved with different catalytic efficiencies. Therefore, formal consideration of the reactions of prothrombin activation requires a distinction to be made between cleavage at Arg271 before and after Arg320 cleavage (Arg271and Arg271*, Scheme I) or at Arg320 before and after Arg271 cleavage (Arg320 and Arg320*, Scheme I). As previous measurements have established that recognition and cleavage at Arg320 are independent of prior cleavage at Arg271 (11Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6755-6764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), apparently ordered bond cleavage by prothrombinase can only result if cleavage at Arg271 is slow in comparison to cleavage at Arg271* (11Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6755-6764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite general agreement with this logical construct, comparable kinetic constants have been reported for the action of prothrombinase on each of the four individual cleavage reactions assessed using recombinant derivatives of prothrombin (12Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6755-6764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Kinetic discrepancies have also led to the suggestion that a significant or large fraction of thrombin is produced by channeling without intermediate release (14Boskovic D.S. Bajzar L.S. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28686-28693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Weinreb G.E. Mukhopadhyay K. Majumder R. Lentz B.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21864-21873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with recombinant human prothrombin derivatives have yielded the novel suggestion that the two bonds in the substrate are recognized and cleaved by kinetically distinct and slowly interconverting conformers of prothrombinase (12Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6755-6764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Yet binding studies indicate that all possible substrates and product bind competitively through exosite interactions to prothrombinase with affinities that are independent of the active site of the enzyme (17Boskovic D.S. Troxler T. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20786-20793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These contradictory findings point to difficulties in providing a valid explanation for the action of prothrombinase on prothrombin by using kinetic models such as Scheme I. They are also inconsistent with models implicating a major role for exosite binding in substrate recognition (18Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

We have studied the action of human prothrombinase on a series of recombinant derivatives of human prothrombin to investigate these contradictory ideas. We present a model that adequately explains the pathway for prothrombin cleavage on the basis of the kinetic constants for the four possible enzyme-catalyzed reactions illustrated in Scheme I. Our findings are inconsistent with the previous proposal (12Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6755-6764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and instead suggest equivalent exosite binding interactions between all four possible substrate species and prothrombinase. We propose that ordered cleavage of the two bonds is driven by interactions between a single form of prothrombinase and two distinct conformations of substrate generated in the pathway for cleavage. Materials—Hen egg l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) and porcine brain l-α-phosphatidylserine (PS) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL); 6-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The proteinase inhibitors d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone (FPR-CH2Cl, Calbiochem), p-amidinophenylmethane-sulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and dansyl-l-arginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA, Hematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT) were obtained from the sources indicated. The acetothioacetyl derivative of FPR-CH2Cl (ATA-FPR-CH2Cl) was prepared by the method of Bock (22Bock P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 478-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and quality controlled as described. The peptidyl substrate, H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (S2238) was from Chromogenix (West Chester, OH). Reagents for recombinant DNA manipulation were from Invitrogen as were cell culture media and most media supplements. Fetal bovine serum and G418 were obtained from Cellgro (Herndon, VA). Small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles composed of 25% PS and 75% PC (PCPS) were prepared and characterized as described (11Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For initial velocity studies, large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles of the same composition (PCPSLUV) were prepared by repeated extrusion (25 times) through 400-nm polycarbonate filters (Liposofast, Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) and clarification by centrifugation (90,000 × g, 45 min). Quasi-elastic light scattering (Nicomp 380, Nicomp, Santa Barbara, CA) of a typical PCPSLUV preparation yielded a monodisperse Gaussian distribution centered at d = 299 ± 72 nm. Human plasma used for the isolation of proteins was a generous gift of the Plasmapheresis Unit of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. All kinetic measurements were conducted in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm Ca2+, 0.1% (w/v) PEG-8000, pH 7.5 (Assay Buffer), at 25 °C. Recombinant Proteins—Prothrombin variants were cloned into pcDNA 3.1(+) by using the Gateway Cloning System (Invitrogen) (23Landy A. Annu. Rev.

Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2087-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), followed by unidirectional cloning into the TOPO-adapted pENTR entry vector, yielded a cassette containing a Kozak sequence, translation start site, signal, propeptide, and mature protein sequence followed by a 3′-untranslated sequence (97 bases) extending to the polyadenylation site. This cassette was used as a template for further mutagenesis using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenic primers were used to introduce a codon for Gln in place of Arg271 for the expression of IIQ271, Gln in place of Arg320 for the expression of IIQ320,or Ala in place of Arg320 for preparation of IIA320. Mutagenesis using the cDNA encoding IIQ271 as template was used to generate an expression cassette encoding a prothrombin variant containing codons for Gln in place of both Arg271 and Arg320 (IIQQ). The integrity of each construct was established by DNA sequencing. Each variant cassette was subjected to λ phage integrase-mediated recombination into an adapted pCDNA 3.1(+) destination vector. Final expression constructs were sequenced again before transfection. HEK 293 cells in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) were transfected by treating with 7.5 μg of plasmid DNA and 30 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen)/3 × 105 cells for 4–5 h followed by the addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 15 mm Hepes, 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 1 mm l-glutamine. Stable cell lines, generated by selection in media containing G418 (0.5 mg/ml), were screened for protein production using an immunoassay (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and by a functional assay for thrombin produced following the addition of prothrombinase or ecarin. Typical production levels ranged from 4 to 7 μg/ml prothrombin/24 h in a confluent T-25 flask with 10 ml of serum-free medium. Stable cell lines were expanded into cell factories (Nunclon, Nunc), and large scale protein production was conducted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media without phenol red containing 15 mm Hepes, 5 μg/ml insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite supplement (Invitrogen), 1 mm l-glutamine, and 10 μg/ml reduced vitamin K (Abbott). Conditioned media, harvested daily, were treated with 5 mm benzamidine and stored at -20 °C. Conditioned media (10 liters) were thawed, pooled, and applied at room temperature to a 4.8 × 6 cm column of Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5. After washing with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, bound protein was eluted with 20 mm Hepes, 0.6 m NaCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing protein were pooled, cooled to 4 °C, and treated with 11 mm Na3citrate followed by the addition of 1 m BaCl2 over 15 min to a final concentration of 74.1 mm. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved with 0.2 m EDTA, pH 8.0, dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5, and applied to a HQ POROS column (10 × 100 mm) (Applied Biosystems) equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Bound protein was eluted with a gradient of increasing NaCl (0–1.0 m, 15 ml/min, 100 min) in the same buffer. Fractions containing prothrombin were pooled, dialyzed against 1 mm NaPi, pH 6.8, applied to a ceramic hydroxyapatite matrix, CHT5-I (10 × 64 mm) (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in the same buffer, and eluted with a gradient of increasing NaPi, pH 6.8 (1–500 mm, 3.0 ml/min, 17 min). Under- or un-carboxylated prothrombin elutes early in this gradient separated from fully carboxylated material that elutes at higher ionic strength. 4S. J. Orcutt and S. Krishnaswamy, unpublished observations. Fractions were pooled to minimize contamination with under-carboxylated prothrombin, precipitated with solid (NH4)2SO4 (80% saturation), collected by centrifugation (56,000 × g, 30 min), dissolved in 50% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at -20 °C. Final yields of all prothrombin derivatives were typically ∼2 mg per liter of conditioned media.

Methods Enzymol. 1967; 19: 20-27Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar) yielded 0.96–1.22 mol of active sites/mol of factor Xa. Further quality control of factor Va preparations was performed by fluorescence binding measurements assessing its ability to assemble into prothrombinase as described previously (26Buddai S.K.

Prostaglandin E2 exerts an immunosuppressive function in the context of mycobacterial infection. Because cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, there is a need to delineate the mechanisms through which pathogenic mycobacteria regulate COX-2 expression in macrophages. Our studies demonstrate that the NF-κB and CRE elements of the COX-2 promoter are critical to Mycobacterium avium-induced COX-2 gene expression. M. avium-triggered signaling originates at the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Ras associates with TLR2 and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), whereas tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)/transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-dependent signaling activates p38 MAPK. Both ERK and p38 MAPK activation converge to regulate the activation of mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1). MSK1 mediates the phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB accounting for its stimulatory effect on CRE-dependent gene expression. M. avium-triggered cytoplasmic NF-κB activation following IκB phosphorylation is necessary but not sufficient for COX-2 promoter-driven gene expression. MSK1 activation is also essential for M. avium-triggered NF-κB-dependent gene expression, presumably mediating nucleosomal modifications. These studies demonstrate that the nuclear kinase MSK1 is necessary in regulating the pathogen-driven expression of a gene by controlling two transcription factors. The attenuation of MSK1 may therefore have potential benefit in restricting survival of pathogenic mycobacteria in macrophages.

To design novel therapeutics and to rationalize vaccination strategies against mycobacterial diseases, it is of foremost importance to understand the mechanisms by which mycobacteria subvert the protective immune response. The response of macrophages to invasion by intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria depends on the signals triggered during the initial contact of the bacterium with the macrophages.

PGE2 interferes with T lymphocyte responses by inhibiting the production of interleukin-2 (1Chouaib S. Welte K. Mertelsmann R. Dupont B. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1172-1179PubMed Google Scholar). PGE2 also inhibits the secretion of interferon-γ, which is important in activating T cells and macrophages (2Hasler F. Bluestein H.G. Zvaifler N.J. Epstein L.B. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 768-772PubMed Google Scholar). Cooper and colleagues (3Tse H.M. Josephy S.I. Chan E.D. Fouts D. Cooper A.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported that the ability of the virulent Mycobacterium avium to attenuate macrophage activation was dependent on its ability to trigger p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent production of PGE2. These observations were supported by a case report in which monocytes from a child with disseminated M. avium infection demonstrated a defect in bactericidal activity which could be offset by treatment with indomethacin (4Ridgway D. Wolff L. Wall M. Borzy M. Kirkpatrick C. J. Clin. Immunol. 1991; 11: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The critical role of PGE2 is also supported by a report that human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein (gp120) can enhance M. avium replication within macrophages by induction of PGE2 (5Denis M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 98: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the inducible production of prostaglandins. COX-2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2, which is then metabolized by terminal synthases to a variety of biologically active prostanoids (6Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). COX-2 gene expression is regulated at the level of transcription as well as post-transcriptionally. The regulation of the COX-2 promoter in macrophages is complex and involves different promoter elements. The transcriptional activation of the COX-2 gene depends on the stimulus-coupled binding of transcription factors (7Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar), including NF-κB, C/EBPβ, and AP-1 (8Caivano M. Cohen P. J.

The CRE-element is the most generally required promoter element, being essential for both basal and induced COX-2 transcription in a variety of cell types (13Thomas B. Berenbaum F. Humbert L. Bian H.

Considering that COX-2 is likely to play a critical role in M. avium-triggered PGE2 release from macrophages, we set out to explore the signaling cascades and the cis-regulatory elements governing COX-2 induction from M. avium-challenged macrophages. Our results demonstrate that TLR2-dependent ERK and p38 activation converge upon the activation of mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1), which is instrumental in controlling both NF-κB- and CRE-driven transcription of the COX-2 gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the role of MSK1 in controlling pathogen-driven gene expression of COX-2, a molecule that plays a central role in pathogenesis.

The supernatant (nuclear extract) was immediately frozen and stored at –70 °C. Typically, 15 μg of nuclear extract was incubated on ice for 5 min in the absence or presence of competitor DNA in a volume of 20 μl containing 4 μl of 5× binding buffer (125 mm HEPES, pH 8, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol), and 0.75 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor DNA. The 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (60,000 cpm per reaction) containing the COX-2 gene-specific NF-κB binding site (5′-GGTGAGGGGGATTCCCTTAGTTA-3′) (or the mutated oligonucleotide with the sites of mutation (GA → CC) in boldface) or the COX-2-specific CRE site (5′-GTCACCACTACGTCACGTGGAG-3′) (or the mutated oligonucleotide with the sites of mutation (ACG → GAT) in boldface) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. The DNA-protein complex formed was separated from the oligonucleotide on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p50, p65 (for NF-κB), or CREB (for CRE) or no antibody before incubation with the radiolabeled probe. Luciferase reporter assays—Cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid. Transfected cells were challenged with M. avium, washed once with PBS, and scraped into luciferase lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 70 mm K2HPO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were rapidly mixed, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and stored at –80 °C. For promoter activation analysis, luciferase activity assays were performed in a luminometer, and the results were normalized for transfection efficiencies by assay of β-galactosidase activity. Ras Activity Assay—Ras activity was measured by assaying for Ras proteins bound to the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 expressed as a GST fusion protein (18Taylor S.J. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 106) after treatment were washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged. Lysate was incubated with 5 μg of Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 (Raf-1 RBD) at 4 °C for 3 h with gentle agitation, and the beads were washed thrice in lysis buffer. Bound Ras proteins were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and detected by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-Ras antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation of Ras with TLR2—RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with FLAG-Ras expressing vector and challenged with M. avium for the indicated time periods. The cells were harvested, lysed in lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 300 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and centrifuged. The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-agarose. The immunoprecipitated beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The samples were fractionated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for TLR2. MSK1 Assay—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 m sucrose, 0.1%(v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm Pefabloc. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C). MSK1 was immunoprecipitated by incubation with anti-MSK1 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). Beads were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 30 μm substrate peptide: EILSR-RPSYRK (CREBTIDE) and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (20,0000 cpm/pmol). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the incorporation of phosphates in CREBTIDE was determined using p81 phosphocellulose paper (19Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leever S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). M. avium Stimulates PGE2 Release from RAW264.7 Macrophages—Considering that PGE2 release is one of the mechanisms used by virulent M. avium to down-regulate macrophage activation (3Tse H.M. Josephy S.I. Chan E.D. Fouts D. Cooper A.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate the mechanisms of M. avium-stimulated PGE2 release from RAW264.7 macrophages. The levels of PGE2 released from RAW264.7 cells were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Challenge of macrophages with M. avium for 8 h induced a rise in PGE2 levels (Fig. 1A). Members of the TLR protein family are key regulators of innate immune activation induced by pathogenic mycobacteria (20Basu J. Curr. Sci. 2004; 86: 103-110Google Scholar). M. avium signals in macrophages through TLR2 (21Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33419-33425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role of TLR2-dependent signaling in M. avium-stimulated PGE2 release, transfection of RAW264.7 cells with dominant-negative TLR2, led to abrogation of PGE2 release following M. avium challenge (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, cells transfected with dominant-negative TLR4 (TLR4 harboring the mutation P712H) still showed release of PGE2 when challenged with M. avium. In results described in Fig. 5, we have validated that TLR4(P712H) does function as a dominantnegative in the present context. TLR4 therefore did not appear to play any role in M. avium-mediated PGE2 release.Fig. 5M. avium stimulates COX-2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter expression in RAW264.7. RAW264.7 cells were transfected with the COX-2 promoter (–891 to +9)-luciferase reporter and β-galactosidase constructs. A, transfected cells were left untreated or treated with U0126 (15 μm), or SB203580 (5 μm), or H89 (10 μm), or a combination of U0126 and SB203580. Cells were then challenged for 6 h with M. avium or with M. avium preincubated with polymyxin B (10 μg/ml). In addition to the constructs mentioned above, cells were co-transfected (B and E) with empty vectors or constructs as indicated; followed by challenge with M. avium (B) or with E. coli LPS (E) for 6 h. C and D, cells were transfected with the 4× κB-luciferase construct (C) or the 6× CRE-luciferase construct (D) instead of the COX-2 promoter-luciferase construct. Transfected cells were treated with inhibitors (C and D) as described above. Cells were then left untreated or incubated with E. coli LPS or with M. avium (as indicated in the panels) for 6 h. Following incubations, luciferase reporter activities in the cell extracts were measured using luciferin as substrate. In each case, the level of induction of luciferase activity was compared with that of untreated cells. The activities shown represent data that have been normalized with β-galactosidase activity. Results represent the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) M. avium-stimulated PGE2 Release Depends on the ERK and p38 MAPKs—PGE2 release from M. avium-challenged cells was inhibited when cells were pretreated with pharmacological inhibitors of ERK and p38 MAPKs, U0126 and SB203580, respectively (Fig. 1A). Although other effectors such as bacterial peptidoglycan have been reported to modulate PGE2 release by activating COX-2 expression in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin had no effect on PGE2 release in the present instance. The ERK and p38 MAPKs appeared to regulate PGE2 release in a synergistic manner, because a combination of the inhibitors U0126 and SB203580 led to a complete inhibition of PGE2 release (Fig. 1A). Besides their ability to phosphorylate and activate transcription factors, both ERK and p38 MAPK also transduce signals by activating down-stream kinases such as mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), which in turn phosphorylates transcription factors. Cells pretreated with H89, a pharmacological inhibitor of MSK1, at the dose used led to a complete inhibition of PGE2 release (Fig. 1A), suggesting a role of MSK1 in PGE2 release. M. avium Stimulates COX-2 Expression—COX-2 converts arachidonic acid released from the cell lipids by the action of phospholipase A2 to prostaglandin H2, the common precursor of all prostaglandins. To examine whether elevated PGE2 synthesis is associated with increased COX-2 expression we studied the M. avium-induced expression of COX-2. Western analysis showed that M. avium challenge resulted in a time-dependent increase in the expression of COX-2 in RAW264.7 (Fig. 1C) COX-2 expression is regulated by, among others, transcriptional mechanisms (7Smith W.L.

We therefore analyzed the expression of the COX-2 gene in M. avium-challenged macrophages by reverse transcription-PCR. Compared with untreated cells, the steady-state COX-2 mRNA levels increased in cells treated with M. avium (Fig. 1E). Taken together, our results on activation of COX-2 at the level of t"

Because the viral protease NS2B/NS3 is essential for replication, it is attracting attention as a potential therapeutic target, although there are currently no antiviral inhibitors for any flavivirus. This paper focuses on elucidating interactions between a hexapeptide substrate (Ac-KPGLKR-p-nitroanilide) and residues at S1 and S2 in the active site of WNV protease by comparing the catalytic activities of selected mutant recombinant proteases in vitro. Homology modeling enabled the predictions of key mutations in WNV NS3 protease at S1 (V115A/F, D129A/E/N, S135A, Y150A/F, S160A, and S163A) and S2 (N152A) that might influence substrate recognition and catalytic efficiency. Key conclusions are that the substrate P1 Arg strongly interacts with S1 residues Asp-129, Tyr-150, and Ser-163 and, to a lesser extent, Ser-160, and P2 Lys makes an essential interaction with Asn-152 at S2. The inferred substrate-enzyme interactions provide a basis for rational protease inhibitor design and optimization. High sequence conservation within flavivirus proteases means that this study may also be relevant to design of protease inhibitors for other flavivirus proteases.

West Nile virus (WNV) 1The abbreviations used are: WNV, West Nile virus; pNA, p-nitroanilide; HCV, hepatitis C virus; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Rt, retention time. is a member of the Flavivirus genus and is transmitted by mosquitoes, primarily Culex species (1Hayes C.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 951: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), between avian reservoir hosts and vertebrate dead-end hosts including humans and horses. Many viruses within this genus are medically important pathogens, including dengue, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and yellow fever viruses. WNV was first isolated in 1937 in Uganda's West Nile province and was subsequently found in regions of Africa, the Middle East, Europe, Russia, South-western Asia, and Australia (less severe subtype, Kunjin) (2Brinton M.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 371-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Human infection is generally asymptomatic or causes a mild febrile disease, West Nile fever (1Hayes C.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 951: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, in a small number of cases, predominantly in the elderly, the infection with WNV results in encephalitis or meningitis that can be fatal (1Hayes C.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 951: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Over the last decade, there has been an increase in the frequency of human outbreaks and severity of disease with recent epidemics in Israel (1998), Romania (1999), Russia (1999), and New York (1999) (3Lanciotti R.S. Roehrig J.T. Deubel V. Smith J. Parker M. Steele K. Crise B. Volpe K.E. Crabtree M.B. Scherret J.H. Hall R.A. MacKenzie J.S. Cropp C.B. Panigrahy B. Ostlund E. Schmitt B. Malkinson M. Banet C. Weissman J. Komar N. Savage H.M. Stone W. McNamara T. Gubler D.J. Science. 1999; 286: 2333-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Since the introduction of WNV into New York in 1999, it has spread rapidly throughout the United States (4,156 infections and 284 deaths in 44 states in 2002, 9862 infections and 264 deaths in 2003) (reported in 2000 by the CDC, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Disease: West Nile Virus, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm), Canada, and Mexico and has recently appeared in the United Kingdom (5Buckley A. Dawson A. Moss S.R. Hinsley S.A. Bellamy P.E. Gould E.A. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2807-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). There is currently no vaccine or antiviral treatment available for human WNV infection. However, a chimeric live vaccine is in clinical trials and a veterinary vaccine is licensed for use in equines and exotic zoo birds (6Tesh R.B. Arroyo J. Travassos Da Rosa A.P. Guzman H. Xiao S.Y. Monath T.P. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2002; 8: 1392-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Flaviviruses are small enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome of 10–11 kb with a single large open reading frame encoding a polyprotein precursor of ∼3400 amino acids. Gene expression requires both host and a virally encoded protease to process the polyprotein precursor into the individual functional proteins. They comprise three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (7Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The viral protease encoded within the N-terminal third of NS3 is responsible for cleavage at the NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A, and NS4B/NS5 gene junctions and also at a site near the C terminus of the C protein to promote efficient generation of prM (Fig. 1) (8Chambers T.J. Weir R.C. Grakoui A. McCourt D.W. Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Rice C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 9Lobigs M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6218-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues at any of these cleavage sites in the related yellow fever virus was shown to prevent efficient cleavage and abolished virus infectivity in cell culture (10Amberg S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8083-8094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lin C. Chambers T.J. Rice C.M. Virology. 1993; 192: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Nestorowicz A. Chambers T.J.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1600-1605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), highlighting a vital role for the NS3 protease in replication. The essential nature of this protease in the virus life cycle is the basis for interest in NS3 as a possible target for developing antiviral inhibitors. NS3 is a multifunctional protein in which the N-terminal 184 amino acids encode for the protease and the C-terminal region encodes a nucleotide triphosphatase, an RNA triphosphatase, and a helicase (14Gorbalenya A.E. Donchenko A.P. Koonin E.V. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 15Wengler G.

The NS3 protease is a trypsin-like serine protease with a classic catalytic triad (His-51, Asp-75, and Ser-135) (17Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Virology. 1989; 171: 637-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Protease activity has been shown for a number of related flaviviruses to be dependent on the association of NS2B as a cofactor (18Falgout B. Pethel M. Zhang Y.M. Lai C.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2467-2475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A central 40 amino acid hydrophilic domain within the largely hydrophobic NS2B protein has been shown to be sufficient for cofactor activity (19Leung D. Schroder K. White H. Fang N.X. Stoermer M.J.

Virol. 1993; 67: 2034-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flanking hydrophobic domains within NS2B are likely to function in promoting membrane association of NS2B-NS3 (21Clum S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30715-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Brinkworth R.I. Fairlie D.P. Leung D. Young P.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NS2B-NS3pro has high specificity for substrate processing requiring a dibasic recognition sequence (P2-Lys, P1-Arg) that is conserved throughout the flaviruses (7Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). This relatively unusual substrate specificity suggests that inhibitors could be somewhat selective over most host serine proteases (19Leung D. Schroder K. White H. Fang N.X. Stoermer M.J.

Fundamental to the design of a specific inhibitor is a detailed understanding of the interactions between protease residues in the active site and substrates. The structure of the WNV NS3 protease is unknown, but there are reported crystal structures for related NS3 proteases of hepatitis C virus (HCV) with a cofactor (23Love R.A. Parge H.E. Wickersham J.A. Hostomsky Z. Habuka N. Moomaw E.W. Adachi T. Margosiak S. Dagostino E. Hostomska Z. Clin. Diagn.

In this study, a homology-modeled structure of the WNV NS3 protease, created through sequence comparison with the HCV and Dengue-2 virus NS3 protease structures, was used to predict residues in the S1 and S2 binding pockets that probably make important interactions with substrate residues (25Nall T. Chappell K.J. Stoermer M.J. Fang N-X. Tyndall J.D.A. Young P.R. Fairlie D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48535-48542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Identified residues were then mutated in a recombinant catalytically active construct by site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic parameters for the mutant WNV proteases were determined and compared. General Methods—Protected amino acids and resins were obtained from Auspep, Novabiochem, and PepChem. Trifluoroacetic acid, piperidine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, dichloromethane, and N,N-dimethylformamide (peptide synthesis grade) were purchased from Auspep. All of the other materials were of reagent grade unless otherwise stated. Crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac C18 column (10–15 μm, 300 Å, 50 × 250 mm) using a gradient mixture of solvent (A) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water and (B) 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/10% water/90% acetonitrile. Analytical reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography was performed on a Waters system equipped with a 717 plus autosampler, 660 controller, and a 996 photodiode array detector using a reversed-phase Phenomenex Luna C18 column (5 μm, 100 Å, 250 × 4.6 mm). Purified peptides were characterized by analytical reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (linear gradient 0–100% B over 30 min), mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The molecular mass of the peptides was determined by electrospray mass spectrometry on a Micromass LCT mass spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on samples containing 4 mm peptide in Me2SO-d6 (550 μl) on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer at 298 K. Proton assignments were determined by TOCSY (80 ms of mixing time), DQF-COSY, ECOSY, and NOESY (350 ms of mixing time) spectra using the sequential assignment method (26Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar).

In the first round of PCR, two separate PCR reactions were performed with the primer pairs WNV CF40aa.FBamHI/WNV Mutation.R and WNV Mutation.F/WNV NS3pro.RHindIII to amplify products flanked by overlapping sequences incorporating the site-directed mutation. Table I shows the primer sequences. These products were then joined in the second round of PCR using the outer primers WNV CF40aa.FBamHI and WNV NS3pro.RHindIII. The resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into pQE9.

Cultures of the Escherichia coli strain SG13009 transformed with the expression plasmid were grown in 500 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until the A600 nm reached 0.5. The expression of the recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranose to a final concentration of 0.3 mm and incubated for an additional 3 h at 22 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -20 °C. For protein purification, cell pellets were thawed, resuspended in lysis buffer (5 ml/g wet pellet, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol) and protease inhibitors were added (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml benzamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml TCLK, all final concentrations) in an attempt to minimize proteolytic cleavage of recombinant protein. Subsequent analyses have found that these standard serine protease inhibitors do not inhibit WNV CF40.Gly.NS3pro (25Nall T. Chappell K.J. Stoermer M.J. Fang N-X. Tyndall J.D.A. Young P.R.

Resuspended cells were lysed by three passages through a French press (1000 Pascals) and then centrifuged (27,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The recombinant proteases, each with a N-terminal hexahistidine tag, were purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose 1-cm column (Qiagen) that had been preequilibrated (50 mm HEPES buffer (30 ml), pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol). Resin was then removed, mixed with the supernatant fraction of cell lysates, and incubated at 4 °C on a rotator for 30 min to allow the His-tagged protein to bind to the Ni2+ resin. The column was repacked and washed with 30 ml of buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and the proteins were eluted into 6 × 1-ml fractions with buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The pre- and post-isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranose induction samples, soluble and insoluble fractions, and the elution fractions were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE.

High resolution electrospray mass spectrometry was calculated for C39H65N13O9 ([M + H]+ = 860.5101, found 860.5061; [M + 2H]/2 = 430.7587, found 430.7617). Enzyme Kinetics—The recombinant WNV protease (WNV CF40.Gly.NS3pro) and site-directed mutants (V115A, V115F, D129A, D129E, D129N, S135A, Y150A, Y150F, N152A, S160A, and S163A) were assayed against a hexapeptide substrate corresponding to P6-P1 of the known endogenous cleavage site NS4B-NS5 (Ac-KPGLKR-pNA) with a chromogenic pNA group in the P1′ position. The cleavage of the pNA chromophore from the peptide substrate by the WNV proteases produced a detectable color change at 405 nm, allowing protease activity to be measured. The assay was conducted in a 96-well plate with a final reaction volume of 200 μl containing 0.5 μm recombinant protease and 1 mm Ac-KPGLKR-pNA and with optimal processing conditions described by Nall et al.

After preincubation of buffered protease and substrate in separate wells (10 min, 37 °C), catalysis was initiated by mixing substrate with enzyme-buffer solution by automatic shaking. The optical density was measured at 405 nm every 30 s for 10 min in a SpectraMax 250 reader, and the average change in millioptical density/min was calculated. Assays were carried out in triplicate, and a control assay containing no enzyme was also conducted. Those proteases that were found to possess significant activity (greater than the negative control) were re-assayed in triplicate against eight different substrate concentrations ranging from 62.5 μm to 1 mm for determination of kinetic constants. To obtain accurate kinetic data for the D129A site-directed mutant, which possessed only slightly higher activity than the negative control, it was assayed in quadruplicate at the higher enzyme concentration of 2.5 μm and eight higher substrate concentrations ranging from 125 μm to 2 mm. Kinetic parameters were calculated from weighted non-linear regression of the initial velocities as a function of the eight substrate concentrations using GraphPad Prism 4 software. The kcat/Km values were calculated assuming that Michaelis-Menten kinetics v = Vmax[S]/([S] + Km). Triplicate measurements were taken for each data point. The data are reported as the means ± S.E.

Morgenstern K.A. Lin C. Fox T. Dwyer M.D. Landro J.A. Chambers S.P. Markland W. Lepre C.A. O'Malley E.T. Harbeson S.L. Rice C.M. Murcko M.A. Caron P.R. Thomson J.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 343-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The HCV NS3pro structure was included to enable the modeling of the WNV NS3pro in the context of its NS2B cofactor. The electrostatic surface map of WNV NS3pro is shown in Fig. 2A, highlighting acidic (red), basic (blue), and hydrophobic (white) regions with a previously reported substrate (P3-P1′ section, Leu-Lys-Arg-Gly corresponding to the WNV NS4B/NS5 cleavage site) docked in the active site. Based on homology with HCV NS3pro, the cofactor threads through the protease with the basic region in the upper left quadrant of Fig. 2A showing one end of the putative cofactor-binding domain. The substrate-binding active site is located in or on a largely hydrophobic region of the enzyme flanked by two acidic regions at Asp-129 and Asp-75 (shown in Fig. 2B). The model revealed that the S1 site was the largest pocket, that the S2 and subsites beyond were very shallow, and that the substrate must spreadeagle itself on the surface of the protease (Fig. 2B). Residues Val-115, Asp-129, Tyr-150, Ser-160, and Ser-163 are predicted to line the enzyme S1 subsite, whereas Asn-152 is predicted to be a key residue in the S2 subsite (Fig. 2, C and D), and these were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis. The S1 pocket was the major focus of our mutagenesis study as it appears to be the most promising site for targeting with a competitive inhibitor. Tyr-150 and Ser-163 are analogous to residues in the S1 subsite of the Dengue-2 virus NS3 protease that have been suggested to interact with P1 substituents of its substrate (24Murthy H.M. Clum S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5573-5580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Murthy H.M. Judge K. DeLucas L. Padmanabhan R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and Tyr-150 has been identified by mutagenesis as important for the activity of Dengue-2 virus protease activity (38Valle R.P. Falgout B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 624-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to make the corresponding Y150A and Y150F mutant WNV NS3 proteases to test whether a π-cation interaction with the P1 Arg is crucial for substrate recognition and processing. The S160A and S163A mutants were made to test the possible hydrogen-bonding interaction of these residues in S1 with Arg at P1 of the substrate. Asp-129 is highly conserved among the flaviviruses and corresponds to Asp-189 of trypsin, a critical residue that sits at the base of the substrate binding pocket and forms an electrostatic bond with the P1 Lys or Arg of the trypsin cleavage site (30Graf L. Craik C.S. Patthy A. Roczniak S. Fletterick R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2616-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, as noted above, Tyr-150 takes up this position in the flavivirus NS3 protease with Asp-129 located more peripherally at the outer edge of the S1 site (see Fig. 2A). Despite its high level of conservation across the flaviviruses, previous cell-based mutagenesis studies appeared to show that Asp-129 could be relatively freely substituted with retention of significant activity (38Valle R.P. Falgout B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 624-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, crystallographic data for the Dengue-2 virus NS3 suggest that Asp-129 does not appear to interact with the P1 Lys but to only interact with a P1 Arg in one of two conformations (29Murthy H.M. Judge K. DeLucas L. Padmanabhan R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We decided to test more accurately the importance of Asp-129 for substrate processing by making three mutant WNV CF40.Gly.NS3pro enzyme constructs (D129A, D129E, and D129N). Conservative mutants D129E (no change in charge) and D129N (isosteric replacement but loss of charge) together with D129A (loss of charge and bulk) at S1 would clarify whether a charged group is important for interaction with Arg at P1 of the substrate. The mutations of V115F and V115A were made to clarify the importance of Tyr-150 and determine the actual size of the S1 pocket. The rationale behind these two mutations was that V115F could fill the space available for the binding of a basic residue while bei"

Hyperphosphorylation and pathological aggregation of microtubule-associated protein tau is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases with axonal degeneration including Alzheimer's disease. We have therefore analyzed tau phosphorylation, solubility and distribution in the brainstem of rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Tau was hyperphosphorylated at several sites also phosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease and became partially detergent-insoluble in EAE brains. Morphological examination demonstrated accumulation of amorphous deposits of abnormally phosphorylated tau in the cell body and axons of neurons within demyelinating plaques. Hyperphosphorylation of tau was accompanied by up-regulation of p25, an activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5. Phosphorylation of tau, activation of cdk5, and axonal pathology were significantly reduced when diseased rats were treated with prednisolone, a standard therapy of acute relapses in MS. Hyperphosphorylation of tau was not observed in a genetic or nutritional model of axonal degeneration or demyelination, suggesting that inflammation as detected in the brains of rats with EAE is the specific trigger of tau pathology. In summary, our data provide evidence that axonal damage in EAE and possibly MS is linked to tau pathology.

There is increasing evidence that axonal damage is the major morphological correlate of permanent neurological deficits in patients with MS (3Bjartmar C. Trapp B.D. Curr. Opin.

Studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging have suggested that neurodegeneration starts already at the onset of the disease (5Matthews P.M. De Stefano N. Narayanan S. Francis G.S. Wolinsky J.S. Antel J.P. Arnold D.L. Semin. Neurol. 1998; 18: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Accordingly, neuropathological studies revealed significant axonal injury in early disease stages (6Ferguson B. Matyszak M.K. Esiri M.M. Perry V.H. Brain. 1997; 120: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 7Trapp B.D. Peterson J. Ransohoff R.M. Rudick R. Mork S. Bo L. N. Engl. J.

The finding that intralesional axonal damage is related to the degree of inflammation in the lesions has led to the conclusion that inflammation is not only responsible for demyelination but also for axonal injury (10Neumann H. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2003; 16: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Axonal degeneration in MS is defined by characteristic morphological signs such as axonal swellings and spheroids (6Ferguson B. Matyszak M.K. Esiri M.M. Perry V.H. Brain. 1997; 120: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 7Trapp B.D. Peterson J. Ransohoff R.M. Rudick R. Mork S. Bo L. N. Engl. J.

Pathol. 2000; 157: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Histopathological studies have shown that axonal damage in MS is associated with axonal accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is transported in a kinesin-dependent fashion, indicating impairment of axonal transport (6Ferguson B. Matyszak M.K. Esiri M.M. Perry V.H. Brain. 1997; 120: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Because neurons are highly elongated cells, their function depends on efficient transport of proteins and organelles toward synapses. A disturbance in axonal transport would therefore cause energy depletion at synapses, eventually leading to complete transsection and degeneration of axons in MS. The underlying molecular mechanisms of transport impairment and axonal degeneration in MS are so far elusive. Axonal degeneration is also found in neurodegenerative diseases (i.e. Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal dementia linked to parkinsonism), which are characterized by pathological hyperphosphorylation and assembly of microtubule-associated protein tau into paired helical filaments (11Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar, 12Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The physiological function of tau is to bind to and stabilize microtubules in a phosphorylation-dependent way (11Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar). In addition, tau is involved in regulation of anterograde axonal transport by influencing the attachment/detachment rate of molecular motors along microtubules (13Ebneth A. Godemann R. Stamer K. Illenberger S. Trinczek B. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 777-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Pathological hyperphosphorylation of tau as seen in Alzheimer's disease causes detachment of tau from microtubules that might lead to microtubule breakdown and disruption of axonal transport (loss of function). An imbalance of kinases and phosphatases has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases with paired helical filaments (14Buée L. Bussière T. Buée-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). A common hypothesis holds that tau hyperphosphorylation and subsequent detachment increases the pool of unbound tau beyond a critical concentration, thereby initiating its aggregation into paired helical filaments (gain of toxic function) (11Lee V.M.

In light of the conspicuous axonal abnormalities in MS, we wondered whether tau abnormalities contribute to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelities (EAE), an animal model of MS. Myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE in rats resembles many characteristic features of MS including multifocal inflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss. Therefore, we characterized tau phosphorylation, solubility, and distribution in rats with acute brainstem EAE. Induction of EAE—EAE was induced in female LEW.1N rats by intradermal injection of 50 μg rat MOG in saline emulsified (1:1) with complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) containing 200 μg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain H 37 RA; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). Control rats were injected with complete Freund's adjuvant alone. Rats were scored for clinical signs of EAE and weighed daily. Rats were sacrificed 12-13 days after sensitization. The experiments were approved by the regional ethics board. Treatment of Animals—Rats were treated intraperitoneally with prednisolone (20 mg/kg) starting on day 8 after sensitization as described (17Diem R. Hobom M. Maier K. Weissert R. Storch M.K. Meyer R. Bähr M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6993-7000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 8-Week-old C57/Bl6 mice (n = 5) were fed with 0.2% (w/w) cuprizone (bis-cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone) (Sigma) in ground breeder chow for 5 weeks. Subsequently, brains were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for further biochemical analysis (see below). Brains from age-matched animals (n = 5) maintained on a normal diet served as controls. Western Blotting—Brainstems of LEW.1N rats were dissected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and weighted. Tissue was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). The homogenates were centrifuged and the protein content in the supernatant was determined. The supernatants were subjected to immunoblotting analysis. As a phosphorylation-independent monoclonal antibody Tau-5 (BD Pharmingen) was used. Monoclonal antibodies directed against phosphorylated tau epitopes were AT-8, AT-100, AT-180 (Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium), 12E8 (P. Seubert, Elan Pharmaceuticals, South San Francisco, CA), TG-3 and PHF-1 (kindly provided by P. Davies, New York). The rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-MAPK, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-independent-MAPK, monoclonal anti-phospho-GSK-3β, and polyclonal phosphorylation-independent GSK-3β were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Rabbit anti-p35 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblots were measured using Scion Image software. Statistical differences were determined with Student's t test. Isolation of Insoluble Tau—Brainstems were homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) and protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged twice at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was re-extracted with 70% formic acid to recover the insoluble material. For isolation of crude paired helical filaments (18Lee V.M. Wang J. Trojanowski J.Q. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) brainstem were homogenized in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.8 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% sucrose and protease inhibitors, and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was washed once. Both supernatants were combined, adjusted to 1% Sarkosyl, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 35 min. The resulting pellet containing crude insoluble tau was resuspended in 8 m urea. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed on adjacent serial sections of paraffin-embedded brainstem sections using standard streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase methods or immunofluorescent dyes. Primary antibodies were used against the following targets: APP, monoclonal antibody 22C11 (Chemicon); phosphorylated tau (AT-8, AT-100, PHF-1, TG-3); and p35/p25 regulatory subunit of cdk5. Bielschowsky silver, Gallyas silver, hematoxylin-eosin, and luxol fast blue stainings were done using standard methods. Protein Phosphatase Activity Measurements—Phosphatase activity was determined by phosphatase assay V2460 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Hyperphosphorylation of Tau in Rats with EAE—To study the mechanisms of axonal pathology in MS, we used LEW.1N rats with MOG-induced hyperacute EAE as an experimental model (19Weissert R. Wallstroem E. Storch M.K. Stefferl A. Lorentzen J. Lassmann H. Linington C. Olsson T. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As in acute MS, active demyelination is accompanied with extensive axonal damage in these animals (9Kornek B. Storch M.K. Weissert R. Wallstroem E. Stefferl A. Olsson T. Linington C. Schmidbauer M. Lassmann H. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). In addition, the focal course of the disease with reproducible severe brainstem pathology facilitates the selection and biochemical analysis of lesions. To study expression levels and phosphorylation status of tau in inflammatory demyelinating lesions, LEW.1N rats were immunized with 50 μg of recombinant MOG in complete Freund's adjuvant and brainstems were dissected at day 12-13 post-immunization. Immunoblotting analysis with the pan-tau antibody tau-5 did not reveal any significant changes in the expression levels of brainstem tau between rats with EAE, adjuvant only immunized controls, and naïve rats (Fig. 1). To determine whether tau phosphorylation was altered, we used a panel of different phosphorylation-dependent antibodies that are commonly used to detect Alzheimer tau. One can broadly distinguish two classes of paired helical filament tau phosphorylation sites (Table I): 1) Ser-Pro and Thr-Pro (SP/TP) sites in the flanking region of tau phosphorylated by proline-directed kinases such as glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), or mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. 2) KXGS motifs in the repeat region phosphorylated by nonproline-directed kinases like microtubule-affinity regulating kinase (MARK/Par-1) and protein kinase A. Tau phosphorylation at KXGS sites has been implicated in the loss of microtubule binding, whereas phosphorylation of the flanking region has only a minor effect on tau microtubule interaction. Replicate blots were stained with PHF-1 (pS396/pS404), AT-8 (pS202/pT205), AT100 (pT212/pS214), and AT-180 (pT231/pS235) to detect distinct proline-directed kinase phosphorylation sites in the flanking region of tau. We observed a dramatic increase of immunoreactivity toward the PHF-1, AT-8, AT-100, and AT-180 epitopes in brainstem lysates prepared of rats with EAE compared with those from control animals (Fig. 1). The average increase was ∼3.5-fold for PHF-1, ∼4-fold for AT-8, ∼4-fold for AT-100, and ∼4.5-fold for AT-180. Next we assessed the phosphorylation status of tau at KXGS motifs in the repeat region phosphorylated by nonproline-directed kinases. Among these phosphorylation sites, Ser-262 is of particular interest, because its phosphorylation is increased in Alzheimer's disease, virtually abolishes tau binding to microtubules and disrupts microtubule stability (20Seubert P. Mawal-Dewan M. Barbour R. Jakes R. Goedert M. Johnson G.V. Litersky J.M. Schenk D. Lieberburg I. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol.

Immunoblotting revealed that phosphorylation at the 12EA (pS262) epitope was strongly increased in rats with EAE (Fig. 1).Table IBar diagram of the longest tau isoform tau40 and its phosphorylation sitesView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Activation of MAPK and p25/cdk5 in EAE—To determine the molecular mechanisms for increased tau phosphorylation, the activity of several known tau-directed protein kinases, including MAPK, GSK-3β, cdk5, and MARK were studied (Fig. 2, A and B). Immunoblot analysis using an anti-phospho MAPK (Erk1/2) antibody, which recognizes only the activated form of MAPK, showed a ∼2.5-fold increase in MAPK activity in EAE brain lysates compared with that in adjuvant alone immunized or naïve rats. The overall expression levels of MAPK were not changed. To assess the activity of cdk5, we determined the levels of cdk5 activators, p35 and its proteolytic fragment p25. The proteolytic conversion of p35 to p25 has been implicated in aberrant cdk5 activation leading to tau hyperphosphorylation, cytoskeleton disruption, and neuronal death (22Patrick G.N. Zuckerberg L.

There was a striking increase in the p25/p35 ratio in EAE brainstems, suggesting conversion of p35 to p25 in EAE. The activity of the tau-directed kinase GSK-3β is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Ser-9. We found increased phosphorylation at Ser-9, whereas levels of total GSK-3α/β remained unchanged, indicating that GSK-3β is not involved in the cascade leading to tau hyperphosphorylation in EAE. Furthermore, we observed that the activity of the non-proline-directed kinase, MARK, which phosphorylates Ser-262, was not altered in EAE. In addition to kinase activation, inactivation of phosphatases can result in hyperphosphorylation of tau (26Gong C.X. Shaikh S. Wang J.Z. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 27Goedert M. Jakes R. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Cohen P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2804-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the activity of the major tau-directed phosphatase, PP2A, in duplicate samples by a colorimetric assay using a phosphopeptide substrate in the PP2A-specific reaction buffer (27Goedert M. Jakes R. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Cohen P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2804-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Kins S. Crameri A. Evans D.R. Hemmings B.A. Nitsch R.M. Götz J. J. Biol.

The peptide was dephosphorylated to the same extent by homogenates obtained from rats with EAE compared with controls, indicating that the activity of the tau-directed phosphatase, PP2A, is not changed (Fig. 2C). Hyperphosphorylated Tau and p25/p35 in Degenerating Neurons of Rats with EAE—Previous neuropathological studies have demonstrated axonal dilatations and spheroids in rats with MOG-induced EAE as well as in human MS brains (6Ferguson B. Matyszak M.K. Esiri M.M. Perry V.H. Brain. 1997; 120: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 7Trapp B.D. Peterson J. Ransohoff R.M. Rudick R. Mork S. Bo L. N. Engl. J.

Pathol. 2000; 157: 267-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that damaged axons and spheroids stain strongly positive with an antibody against APP (6Ferguson B. Matyszak M.K. Esiri M.M. Perry V.H. Brain. 1997; 120: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Whereas physiological levels of axonal APP are not detected by this method, APP accumulation is found in damaged axons possibly because of failure of axonal transport (6Ferguson B. Matyszak M.K. Esiri M.M. Perry V.H. Brain. 1997; 120: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). We detected prominent APP staining in dilated axons and spheroids on paraffin-embedded brainstems of LEW.1N rats with EAE (Fig. 3A). To analyze whether pathologically hyperphosphorylated tau was localized in neurons with axonal injury, we performed immunohistochemical stainings with PHF-1, AT-8, and 12E8 antibodies. All three antibodies prominently stained axons in EAE brains, particularly dilated and irregularly shaped axons and axonal spheroids (Fig. 3; and data not shown). In contrast, only weak immunoreactivity of AT-8, PHF-1, and 12E8 was observed in adjuvant-immunized control rats. We next evaluated the immunoreactivity with TG-3, an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated tau (pT231) with abnormal conformation and detects early stages of paired helical filaments (29Jicha G.A. Lane E. Vincent I. Otvos Jr., L. Hoffmann R. Davies P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 30Augustinack J.C. Schneider A. Mandelkow E-M. Hyman B.T. Acta Neuropathol. 2002; 103: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). TG-3 displayed extensive staining of abnormal axons and spheroids in rats with EAE, indicating a pathological conformation shift of tau (Fig. 3). Similar results were observed when the conformation-dependent antibody MC-1 was used (data not shown). In addition, an altered compartmentalization of tau with accumulation of amorphous and granular tau deposits in the soma of neurons within demyelinating plaques was detected by PHF-1 and Bielschowsky stainings (Fig. 3B). Previous studies have shown that the TG-3, AT-8, and PHF-1 epitopes can be generated in vivo by cdk5 (31Hamdane M. Sambo A-V. Delobel P. Begard S. Violleau A. Delacourte A. Bertrand P. Benavides J. Buee L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 36: 34026-34034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Illenberger S. Drewes G. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Meyer H.E. Olmsted J.B. Mandelkow E-M. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1495-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Because we found a conversion of p35 to p25, indicating an activation of cdk5 toward tau phosphorylation in EAE brains, we analyzed the localization of the regulatory subunits of cdk5 in rats with EAE. Immunostaining with a C-terminal p35 antibody recognizing both p35 and p25 revealed intense staining of axons with abnormal profiles and hyperphosphorylated tau (Fig. 3C). In contrast, we did not detect any significant co-localization of pMAPK and PHF-1 (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results indicate that cdk5, but not MAPK is involved in hyperphosphorylation of tau in EAE. Tau Insolubility and Aggregation, but No Formation of Paired Helical Filaments in Rats with EAE—The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in dilated axons and spheroids as well as its pathological conformation, which is known to precede formation of paired helical filaments, is suggestive of axonal tau aggregations. Because paired helical filaments are highly insoluble, we analyzed the insolubility of tau in 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Triton X-100. EAE brainstems were extracted in lysis buffer, and the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Whereas tau was barely detectable in the detergent-insoluble fraction of control brains we found significant amounts of insoluble tau in EAE brainstems (Fig. 4). The overall levels of tau did not differ between EAE and controls. These data show that in addition to hyperphosphorylation, tau also partially forms detergent-insoluble aggregates in EAE. An established biochemical method for isolation of paired helical filaments is to take advantage of their insolubility in 1% Sarkosyl (18Lee V.M. Wang J. Trojanowski J.Q. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Greenberg S.G. Davies P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5827-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In contrast to its insolubility in 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Triton X-100, tau from diseased animals was soluble in 1% Sarkosyl. Taken together, these findings demonstrate aggregation of tau without the formation of paired helical filaments. Prednisolone Treatment Reduces Kinase Activation and Tau Phosphorylation in Rats with EAE—High-dosage prednisolone treatment is the standard therapy regime in acute relapses of MS (1Compston A. Coles A. Lancet. 2002; 359: 1221-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 2Steinman L. Martin R. Bernard C. Conlon P. Oksenberg J.R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 491-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the treatment with prednisolone could inhibit the pathological cascade leading to hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau in EAE rats. Rats were treated with 20 mg/kg prednisolone intraperitoneally from day 8 post-immunization to day 12. At day 12 animals from treated and untreated groups were sacrificed. As expected, the severity of the disease, measured by the clinical score of each animal, and the number of inflammatory infiltrates were significantly reduced in rats that had been treated with prednisolone. Previous work in a rat model of autoimmune optic neuritis has provided evidence that prednisolone treatment may induce apoptosis in retinal ganglia cells (17Diem R. Hobom M. Maier K. Weissert R. Storch M.K. Meyer R. Bähr M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6993-7000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the extent of axonal damage by Bielschowsky silver staining on brainstem cross-sections of rats with EAE. However, signs of axonal injury such as dilated axons and spheroids were virtually absent in the brainstem of rats that had been treated with prednisolone. Next, we analyzed the effect of prednisolone treatment on tau phosphorylation. By immunoblotting brainstem lysates with PHF-1 we found a significant reduction (∼50%) of tau phosphorylation in treated animals compared with untreated controls (Fig. 5). In addition, treatment with prednisolone reduced levels of phosphorylated MAPK and p25 significantly. Tau Is Not Hyperphosphorylated in Other Conditions with Primary Oligodendroglial Dysfunction—The causal relationship of inflammation, demyelination, and axonal degeneration has been difficult to determine in EAE. We therefore analyzed the extent of tau phosphorylation in a model of axonal damage that is caused by oligodendroglial dysfunction and not by inflammation. Mice that are deficient for the oligodendroglial protein, 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP), develop a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in the absence of demyelination or inflammation, starting 4 months after birth and are characterized by signs of axonal damage as observed in MS (Fig. 6C and Ref. 34Lappe-Siefke C. Goebbels S. Gravel M. Nicksch E. Lee J. Braun P.E. Griffiths I.R. Nave K.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). The development of axonal pathology in CNP-deficient mice was not accompanied by an increase in tau phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). To analyze whether acute demyelination per se can induce tau pathology in axons, we fed mice with the demyelinating toxin cuprizone for 5 weeks. Although cuprizone treatment leads to extensive demyelination (Fig. 6D and Ref. 35Matsushima G.K. Morell P. Brain Pathol. 2001; 11: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), we did not detect any changes"
https://openalex.org/W2041039104,"We examined the effects of chronic hypoxia on recombinant human L-type Ca2+ channel alpha1C subunits stably expressed in HEK 293 cells, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Current density was dramatically increased following 24 h exposure to chronic hypoxia (CH), and membrane channel protein levels were enhanced. CH also increased the levels of Alzheimer's amyloid beta peptides (AbetaPs), determined immunocytochemically. Pharmacological prevention of AbetaP production (via exposure to inhibitors of secretase enzymes that are required to cleave AbetaP from its precursor protein) prevented hypoxic augmentation of currents, as did inhibition of vesicular trafficking with bafilomycin A1. The enhancing effect of AbetaPs or CH were abolished following incubation with the monoclonal 3D6 antibody, raised against the extracellular N' terminus of AbetaP. Immunolocalization and immunoprecipitation studies provided compelling evidence that AbetaPs physically associated with the alpha1C subunit, and this association was promoted by hypoxia. These data suggest an important role for AbetaPs in mediating the increase in Ca2+ channel activity following CH and show that AbetaPs act post-transcriptionally to promote alpha1C subunit insertion into (and/or retention within) the plasma membrane. Such an action will likely contribute to the Ca2+ dyshomeostasis of Alzheimer's disease and may contribute to the mechanisms underlying the known increased incidence of this neurodegenerative disease following hypoxic episodes."
https://openalex.org/W2016645839,"The Crt1 (RFX1) protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an effector of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. It recognizes a 13-bp cis-regulatory element in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the ribonucleotide reductase genes RNR2, RNR3, and RNR4; the HUG1 gene; and itself. We calculated the weight matrix representing the Crt1p binding site motif according to analysis of the 5′-UTR sequences of the genes that are under its regulation. We subsequently searched the 5′-UTR sequences of all the genes in the yeast genome for the occurrence of this motif. The motif was found in regulatory regions of 30 genes. A statistical analysis showed that it is unlikely that a random gene cluster contains the motif conserved as well as the Crt1p binding site. Analysis of microarray data provided supporting evidence for five putative Crt1p targets: FSH3, YLR345W, UBC5, NDE2, and NTH2. We used reverse transcription-PCR to compare the expression levels of these genes in wild-type and crt1Δ strains. Our results indicated that FSH3, YLR345W, and NTH2 are indeed under the regulation of Crt1p. Sequence analysis of the FSH3p indicated that this protein may be involved in folate metabolism either by carrying serine hydrolase activity required for the novel metabolic pathway involving dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or by directly interacting with the DHFR enzyme. We postulate that Crt1p may influence deoxyribonucleotide synthesis not only by regulating expression of the RNR genes but also by modulating DHFR activity.

High fidelity of transmission of genetic information is crucial for the survival of living organisms. To assure faithful DNA replication, cells have evolved complex mechanisms that activate a multifaceted response to occasional DNA damage resulting from both environmental factors and cellular processes. In eukaryotes DNA damage activates evolutionarily conserved checkpoint pathways that induce apoptosis, arrest the cell cycle, and activate transcription of genes whose products are involved in repair processes. Signal transduction in these pathways proceeds through a kinase cascade involving products of the ATR, ATM, Chk1, and Chk2 genes in mammals and their yeast homologs MEC1, TEL1, CHK1, and RAD53 (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar, 2Wahl G.M. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E277-E286Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The DNA damage response pathways and their evolutionary conservation in eukaryotic cells have been reviewed elsewhere (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J.

The product of the CRT1 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the effector proteins that take part in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway (3Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). CRT1 encodes a DNA-binding protein that acts by recruiting Ssn6p and Tup1p, general repressors to the promoters of damage-inducible genes. In response to DNA damage Crt1p becomes phosphorylated via the Dun1p pathway downstream of the Rad53p checkpoint kinase. The hyperphosphorylated form of Crt1p does not bind DNA, preventing formation of a repressor complex, and leads to activation of damage-inducible genes. So far there are five experimentally verified targets of Crt1p action: three ribonucleotide reductase genes, RNR2, RNR3, and RNR4 (3Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J.

In the case of the RNR and CRT1 genes, Crt1p has been experimentally shown to recognize a 13-nucleotide-long cis-regulatory element (3Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The element resembles the mammalian X-box motif recognized by RFX transcription factors that take part in regulation of the major histocompatibility complex genes (5Reith W. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Silacci P. Berte C. Barras E. Fey S. Mach B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1528-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6Durand B. Kobr M. Reith W. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6839-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This homology is not surprising considering that the DNA-binding domain of Crt1p shares significant sequence similarity with the DNA-binding domain of RFX proteins. In the case of the HUG1 gene, transcription factor binding has not been studied experimentally, but the upstream region of the gene contains 13-nucleotide-long motifs strongly resembling the Crt1p binding sites (4Basrai M.A Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7041-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Crt1p binding sites, experimentally studied in the RNR and CRT1 genes, have been classified as strong or weak based on the relative binding affinity of Crt1p and the degree of sequence conservation (3Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In RNR2, RNR4, and CRT1, one strong and one weak site have been found. RNR3 contains one strong and two weak sites. Huang et al. (3Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) postulated that multiple binding sites allow graded response to the DNA damage signal. When the pool of Crt1p molecules decreases, Crt1p dissociates first from weak sites allowing gradual transcription induction. Knowledge about experimentally verified Crt1p binding sites has never been used to define the binding site motif of the Crt1 transcription factor and study its distribution in regulatory regions of yeast genes. In this study we used a sequence motif discovery approach to derive optimal weight matrix representing the Crt1p binding site motif. The search of yeast gene regulatory regions with the resulting motif representation yielded a cluster of 30 putative Crt1p targets. Further analysis of expression profile data allowed us to select the set of most probable additional Crt1p targets. We experimentally verified that three of them, YLR345W, NTH2, and FSH3, are indeed regulated by Crt1p. Analysis of literature data and the protein sequence of FSH3 suggests that the Mec1p-Rad53p-Dun1p-Crt1p signal transduction pathway may control deoxyribonucleotide synthesis not only at the level of ribonucleotide reductase activity but also by altering one-carbon group metabolism and consequently purine ring synthesis. The fact that YLR345W and NTH2 are regulated by Crt1p indicates the regulatory link between DNA damage response and central metabolism.

Elkan C. Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1994: 28-36Google Scholar) was used to find conserved motifs in the 1-kb-long 5′-UTR sequences of genes experimentally shown to be regulated by Crt1p (RNR2, RNR3, RNR4, CRT1, and HUG1). MEME is a motif discovery algorithm, i.e. it searches for motifs that occur in a training set of unaligned sequences more frequently than expected by chance. Motifs are represented as weight matrices. A default background model uses single base composition of the sequences analyzed. As an option, frequencies of words may be used. We found that similarly to other DNA sequence analysis problems, application of the fifth order Markov model of random sequence improves the quality of the results. To apply this approach we computed frequencies of all 1-, 2-,..., 6-nucleotide-long words in the data base of yeast 5′-UTR sequences. The oligonucleotide composition of yeast 5′-UTR sequences was computed with the WORDCOUNT program from the EMBOSS package (16Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6252) Google Scholar). MEME algorithm searches for motifs of predefined length. It also uses constraints on the number of occurrences of the motif per sequence. We searched for motifs ranging in length from 6 to 50 nucleotides and tested all three kinds of constraints on the number of motif occurrences, namely one occurrence per sequence (OOPS mode), zero or one occurrence per sequence (ZOOPS mode), and any number of occurrences per sequence (TCM mode). We used the MEME program from stand alone distribution of the MEME 3.0 package. The MAST program from the same package was applied to search the data base of 5′-UTR sequences of yeast genes for sites matching weight matrices obtained in MEME analysis (E-value cut-off of 10 was used). Computation of the Sequence Logo—To compute information content of every position in the Crt1p binding site motif, we used the relative entropy formula (17Durbin R. Eddy S. Krogh A. Mitchinson G. Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1998: 308Google Scholar): Rj = Σpij log2(pij/bi), where Rj is the information content of the jth position in the motif, pij is the probability of finding residue i in the jth position of the motif, and bi is the data set frequency of residue i. We used the relative entropy method instead of the more frequently used formula of Schneider and Stephens (18Schneider T.D. Stephens R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6097-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar) to take into account background nucleotide frequencies that are highly biased in our data set. The sequence logo was drawn as follows. The height of every column in the logo was set to Rj. Relative heights of individual letters in the same column were computed according to their pij log2(pij/bi) contribution to Rj. Residues for which the absolute value of pij log2(pij/bi) was less than 0.1 were not drawn. If the residue column frequency was less than background frequency, the information given by the individual residue was negative. In this case the letter was drawn below the x axis to indicate negative information content. Yeast Strains and Media—Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was conducted to compare expression of selected genes in two strains of S. cerevisiae obtained from EUROSCARF: a wild-type reference strain, Y20000 (BY4743; MATa/MATα; his3Δ1/his3Δ1; leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0/LYS2; MET15/met15Δ0; ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0) and a deletion strain, crt1Δ, Y34125 (BY4743; MATa/MATα; his3Δ1/his3Δ1; leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0/LYS2; MET15/met15Δ0; ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0; YLR176c::kanMX4/YLR176c::kanMX4). Cells were grown in the synthetic minimal medium (containing 6.7g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, and supplemented with amino acids) to the midlogarithmic phase. For DNA damage experiments the cells were exposed to 0.1% methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (Aldrich) for 90 min at 30 °C. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from yeast by a single step guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol-chloroform extraction using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT)18 as primer (BD Biosciences) and the BD Biosciences Advantage RT kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. Five microliters of this reaction was amplified by PCR in a Pelthier Thermal Cycler apparatus (MJ Research, Watertown, MA) using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The primers used for RT-PCR listed in Table I were produced using an Applied Biosystems 3900 HT automated DNA synthesizer. To ensure that PCR signals were not the result of contaminating genomic DNA, control samples containing either water or RNA, in which the reverse transcriptase was omitted during cDNA synthesis, were run. For RT-PCR, the number of cycles was chosen so that amplification remained well within the linear range. An initial denaturation step at 96 °C for 2 min was followed by 24–28 amplification cycles (30 s at 96 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C) and a final extension period of 7 min at 72 °C. As an internal control, primers for the detection of yeast pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDA1) were used. Aliquots of each amplification reaction were separated on 1.2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, and images of the gels were recorded using the UVP Gel Documentation System (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). The bands on the images were quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences, Version 5.2), and the densities were normalized with respect to the values obtained for PDA1.Table IGene-specific primers used for RT-PCRGeneForward primerReverse primerSizebpCRT15′-CTCGAACGACAATAGCAAC-3′5′-GAAAGAAAGTGGGTAAGCAG-3′382RNR25′-AAGACGCTGAAAATCACAAG-3′5′-CGAAAAAGGCAAGAACTCTG-3′276RNR35′-CAGAACGTCCTCAGCATTTG-3′5′-GTACCAGCGATATAAGAACC-3′304RNR45′-CATCGAGAGATGGATTTCC-3′5′-TTGGGGTTTGGCTTGGTTC-3′234FSH35′-TCTTGGGGGCTACTTAGTC-3′5′-CTTGGGATACGAATGGTTTC-3′299YLR345W5′-GCCAAATGTGCTTTCTGATG-3′5′-AACGATTTCGTCCTAACTCC-3′348NDE25′-AATCGAACCCACCCAAACAG-3′5′-GCGCCTACACTAACAACAAG-3′394NTH25′-GGATCTCGCTTTAGATGAG-3′5′-CTGGGCAGTTATATGGAAC-3′392UBC55′-AAGACCTGTAGGGGATGACCTGTAT-3′5′-AAGGATCGTCGGGATTAGCATCTGTTAAAAGAGAG-3′287PDA15′-CATTCAAACGCCAACCATC-3′5′-CCATTACCACCATAGAAGC-3′541 Open table in a new tab MEME Analysis of 5′-UTR Regions of Genes Regulated by Crt1p—We applied the MEME motif discovery algorithm (15Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1994: 28-36Google Scholar) to build weight matrices modeling over-represented sequence motifs in 1-kb-long 5′-UTRs of the genes experimentally shown to be under Crt1p regulation. Various parameter configurations of the algorithm were tested. Different parameter sets used for motif calculation were evaluated by the ability of the resulting weight matrices to retrieve experimentally known Crt1p binding sites (Fig. 1) in the MAST search of the data base of yeast 5′-UTRs. The rationale of using MEME rather than direct computation of weight matrices from the alignment of known binding sites is the following. First, experimental procedures used to study regulatory regions of Crt1p target genes do not guarantee that all the binding sites will be found. The MEME algorithm could, in principle, find additional Crt1p binding sites if they are present. Moreover the site of Crt1p action within the HUG1 gene has not been experimentally confirmed. Therefore, one cannot a priori exclude the possibility that the regulatory region of the HUG1 gene contains the site that would better conform to a Crt1p binding site motif than the putative site proposed by Basrai et al. (4Basrai M.A Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7041-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Second, MEME analysis would show whether the sequences analyzed contain a motif that is more conserved than the Crt1p cis-regulatory element and would give an estimate of the expected number of its occurrence in random sequences. This helps to judge the specificity of the motif. We used MEME to find motifs ranging from 5 to 60 nucleotides in the 1-kb-long 5′-UTR sequences of RNR2, RNR3, RNR4, CRT1, and HUG1 genes. The influence of the random sequence model on the results was tested. When data set letter frequencies were used as a random sequence model, two low complexity A/T-rich regions of 27 and 26 bases were found as the most conserved regions. The Crt1p binding site motif was found as the third region with respect to E-value computed by MEME. The fact that a low complexity sequence was found as the best motif should be considered an artifact taking into account the very high frequency of consecutive A/T base occurrences in yeast 5′-UTRs. To solve this problem we applied the fifth order Marcov model of random sequence computed according to the frequencies of 1-, 2-,..., 6-nucleotide-long words in all 5′-UTRs of yeast genes. MEME analysis with this background model was no longer biased toward A/T-rich sequence stretches, and the Crt1p binding site was the most conserved motif. MEME uses one of the three modes of constraints on the number of motif occurrences per sequence (see “Experimental Procedures”). As there are multiple Crt1p binding sites in the regulatory regions under investigation the most reasonable choice seems to be the TCM mode allowing any number of occurrences of the motif per sequence. Surprisingly the analysis run with the assumption of exactly one occurrence of the motif per sequence (OOPS mode) produced better results than analysis run in TCM mode. When the data base of the yeast 5′-UTRs was searched with the MAST program using weight matrix calculated in MEME analysis with the TCM mode, the CRT1 gene was not retrieved. When the motif defined by MEME analysis using the OOPS mode was used in MAST search, all five known targets of Crt1p action were found. Moreover all experimentally verified sites of Crt1p action, except a weak site of the CRT1 gene, were correctly positioned by the MAST program. The CRT1 gene weak site has the lowest DNA binding affinity of all experimentally verified sites. In the regulatory region of the HUG1 gene only the putative strong site proposed in Ref. 4Basrai M.A Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7041-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar was found in the MAST search. Fig. 2 shows our statistical model of the Crt1p binding site motif. Matching sites in RNR2, RNR3, RNR4, CRT1, and HUG1 genes are shown in Table II. We conclude that the best strategy to define this motif is to perform MEME analysis in the OOPS mode using the fifth order Markov model of yeast regulatory regions as the reference state. The analysis run in the OOPS mode is forced to search for strong sites only. The resulting weight matrix is able to correctly position not only strong but also most of the weak sites when used in the MAST search of yeast regulatory regions.Table IIOccurrence of Crt1p binding site motif in 1-kb-long 5′-UTR sequences of yeast genesORFGeneCellular role (YPD)aYeast Protein DatabaseSitebIn several cases the sites are composed of two Crt1p binding site motifs located on opposite strands and shifted by one base.

In addition to the five genes known to contain the Crt1p binding site, 25 novel potential Crt1p targets were identified. The genes are listed in Table II together with their functional annotation according to the Yeast Protein Database (13Costanzo M.C. Crawford M.E. Hirschman J.E. Kranz J.E. Olsen P. Robertson L.S. Skrzypek M.S. Braun B.R. Hopkins K.L. Kondu P. Lengieza C. Lew-Smith J.E. Tillberg M. Garrels J.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 75-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the putative Crt1p binding sites. As shown by the ORF identifiers in the first column of Table II in many cases the regulatory site is shared by two neighboring genes positioned on opposite strands (W and C in the ORF names are strand identifiers; in neighboring genes the numbers in ORF names differ by 1). The ORF of the HUG1 gene is so short that a putative Crt1p binding site in the regulatory region of this gene is also within 1000 bp from the SML1 gene positioned downstream of HUG1 (expression of SML1 gene does not depend on the Ssn6p-Tup1p-Crt1p repressor complex (4Basrai M.A Velculescu V.E. Kinzler K.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7041-7049Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). There are two putative Crt1p targets that contain sites identical to those of the genes experimentally shown to be under Crt1p regulation. The site within the regulatory region of NTH2 is identical to the putative strong site of the HUG1 gene. NDE2 contains a site identical to the experimentally verified strong binding site within the 5′-UTR of the RNR4 and RNR3 genes. Crt1p recognizes sequences resembling palindromes. For this reason in several cases listed in Table II the sites identified are composed of two overlapping 13-nucleotide-long DNA stretches located on opposite strands and shifted by one base. For example, one of the weak binding sites of the RNR3 gene is TTGCTGTGACAAC at position -369 on the minus strand. The second overlapping site of the sequence matching the Crt1p binding site motif was found by MAST at position -370 on the plus strand. Therefore, oligonucleotide GTTGCTGTGACAAC contains two overlapping sequences matching the Crt1p binding site motif located on opposite strands and shifted by one base. In most of the genes listed in Table II only a single putative Crt1p binding site was detected. However, we did not reject genes that do not have multiple sites from the list of putative Crt1p targets for the following reasons. According to the mechanism of Crt1p action proposed in Ref. 3Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, multiple sites allow the modulation of timing and strength of the response rather than reflecting structural requirements for oligomeric protein-DNA complexes to be formed. The variable number of weak sites and wide distribution of distances between them support this assumption. The RNR3 gene contains three experimentally confirmed Crt1p binding sites, whereas RNR2, RNR4, and CRT1 have only two. The distance between the sites in RNR4 is 369 bp, while in RNR2 it is only 73 bp. Moreover the example of the CRT1 gene shows that Crt1p may bind with low affinity to the sites that are significantly different from the consensus sequence. The weak site of the CRT1 gene is well conserved only in the last five positions of the motif (Fig. 1). The nucleotides in positions 1, 3, and 8 are not present in any other experimentally confirmed Crt1p binding site. For this reason the weak site of the CRT1 gene was not found in the MAST search of yeast 5′-UTR sequences. Multiple sites were likewise not found in the regulatory region of the HUG1 gene, an experimentally verified Crt1p target. The example of the CRT1 gene weak sites shows that possible sequence diversity of weak sites is too large to include all these s"

Transduction of intra- and extracellular signals is a tightly regulated process requiring the coordination of multiple signaling pathways to direct the appropriate physiological response to these signals. Correct spatial assembly or targeting of signaling components confers specificity to activated signaling cascades. In most cases, such targeting seems to be regulated by adaptor, scaffolding, and anchoring proteins that facilitate the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes at various regions of the cell (1Scott J.D.

Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The composition and expression of these complexes are thus important determinants of a cell's response to stimuli. AKAP12 is the official gene symbol of a group of orthologous proteins that includes human gravin/AKAP250 and the rodent Src-Suppressed C Kinase Substrate (SSeCKS). As its name implies, AKAP12 binds the regulatory subunit of PRKA via a C-terminal amphipathic helix similar to that of other AKAPs (5Nauert J.B. Klauck T.M. Langeber L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The ability to bind protein kinase C (6Chapline C. Mousseau B. Ramsay K. Duddy S. Li Y. Kiley S.C. Jaken S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) in addition to PRKA suggests that AKAP12 functions to assemble a multiprotein signaling complex at sites of its localization. Recent work has demonstrated that AKAP12 can assemble such a complex at the plasma membrane in association with the β-adrenergic receptor (8Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, previous studies have demonstrated cytosolic distribution of AKAP12 in addition to membrane association (9Lin X. Tombler E. Nelson P.J. Gelman I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28430-28438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that AKAP12 has multiple functions in different cellular locales. Although several interacting partners for AKAP12 have been identified, the downstream targets of AKAP12-moderated signaling remain undefined. While the mechanisms of AKAP12 function are still being investigated, several studies have implicated AKAP12 in the control of cytoskeletal architecture and cell-cycle progression (10Gelman I.H. Lee K. Tombler E. Gordon R. Lin X. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1998; 41: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Lin X. Nelson P.J. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7259-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whereas experimental overexpression of AKAP12 results in cell cycle arrest (11Lin X. Nelson P.J. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7259-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), endogenous expression is severely attenuated in transformed cells (12Lin X. Nelson P.J. Frankfort B. Tombler E. Johnson R. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in growth control, many mitogenic stimuli transiently increase AKAP12 expression (13Coats S.R. Covington J.W. Su M. Pabón-Peña L.M. Eren M. Hao Q. Vaughan D.E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 2207-2219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Nelson P.J. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 175: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). More recently, oxygen tension has been shown to be an important regulator of AKAP12 expression in astrocytes during formation of the blood-brain barrier (15Lee S.W. Kin W.J. Choi Y.L. Song H.S. Son M.J. Gelman I.H. Kim Y.J. Kim K.W. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Together, these studies highlight the importance of control of AKAP12 expression in determining cell function. In the present study, we have characterized the AKAP12 gene to establish a foundation for further study of AKAP12 regulation. It is interesting that the AKAP12 locus encodes for three separate mRNAs (AKAP12α, -β, and -γ) that are regulated by unique promoters and differentially expressed in various organs. Although the proteins encoded by each isoform are highly similar, a myristoylation motif present in AKAP12α targets the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum. Deletion or mutation of the myristoylation motif results in cytosolic distribution similar to that of the other isoforms. Our data illustrate the complexity of the AKAP12 locus and demonstrate a novel mechanism of genetic control of spatial and temporal signal compartmentalization through transcriptional regulation of alternately targeted AKAP isoforms. Cell Culture—A7r5 rat aortic smooth muscle cells, Rat-2 rat fibroblasts, NRK rat kidney epithelial cells, Clone-9 rat liver epithelial cells, GC-2spd(ts) mouse spermatocytes, and COS-7 rat kidney fibroblasts were all purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. Wang Min (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). A7r5 and 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B. Rat-2, NRK, GC-2spd(ts), and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Clone-9 cells were maintained in Ham's F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. GC-2spd(ts) cells were maintained at 32 °C; all other cells were maintained at 37 °C. 5′-RACE/Transcription Start Site Mapping—Two independent assays were used to define the 5′ boundaries of the three AKAP12 isoforms. 5′-RACE was performed using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion) per the manufacturer's directions and with primers specific to each isoform. Rat testis cDNA served as the template for the α and γ isoforms, and rat kidney cDNA was used for the β isoform. In all cases, a single band was amplified (data not shown) and subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ for sequencing. At least two independent clones were sequenced for each isoform. Transcription initiation start site mapping using RNase protection was performed as described previously (16Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using isoform-specific riboprobes. Comparative Genomics—Identification of conserved regions around the promoter regions of the three AKAP12 isoforms was performed using VISTA (www-gsd.lbl.gov/vista/index.shtml) (17Mayor C. Brudno M. Schwartz J.R. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Pachter L.S. Dubchak I. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1046-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In brief, either the entire locus or 10-kb regions surrounding exons 1, 3, or 4 of human and rat AKAP12 were downloaded with the aid of the UCSC Genome Browser (genome.ucsc.edu) (18Karolchik D. Baertsch R. Diekhans M. Furey T.S. Hinrichs A. Lu Y.T. Roskin K.M. Schwartz M. Sugnet C.W. Thomas D.J. Weber R.J. Haussler D. Kent W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). Each exon was then annotated before submitting the sequences to VISTA for comparison. For comparison of the entire locus, a window length of 75 base pairs was used to determine percentage identity. A window length of 50 base pairs was used in comparison of the promoter regions. We acknowledge the Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (19Consortium International Human Genome Sequencing Nature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (18124) Google Scholar), the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium (20Consortium Mouse Genome Sequencing Nature. 2002; 420: 520-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (5474) Google Scholar), and the Rat Genome Sequencing Project Consortium (21Consortium Rat Genome Sequencing Project Nature. 2004; 428: 493-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar) for making available early draft sequences that were used in this report. PAC Library Screening—The RPCI-31 rat bacteriophage P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) library (22Woon P.Y. Osoegawa K. Kaisaki P.J. Zhao B. Catanese J.J. Gauguier D. Cox R. Levy E.R. Lathrop G.M. Monaco A.P. de Jong P.J. Genomics. 1998; 50: 306-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was screened with a probe to exon 5 of AKAP12 to obtain a template for cloning the AKAP12 promoters. The exon 5 probe was amplified from rat cDNA using primers as follows: Exon5Forward, 5′-ATACGGATCCCCAGGATGGGGAAGCTGA; Exon5Reverse, 5′-ATACAAGCTTTTCCTTGCTCTCTTCTTGG. In brief, radiolabeled probe was hybridized for 2 h to five membranes of the PAC library using standard hybridization techniques followed by copious washing to remove unbound probe. Positive clones were visualized after autoradiographic exposure (Kodak X-Omat AR; Eastman Kodak). Four PAC clones were identified and were screened by PCR using primers to exons 1 and 3 to confirm the PACs contained the full locus. Two clones, RPCI-31 311H10 and RPCI-31 489O7, were found to contain the full AKAP12 locus. Initial sequencing in the promoter regions of both clones revealed no differences; subsequent cloning was performed using only the 489O7 clone. Reporter Constructs—Promoter constructs for the AKAP12α promoter were designed to encompass conserved regions identified with VISTA. All constructs were amplified from the 489O7 PAC clone using Pfu ultra high-fidelity polymerase (Stratagene) with restriction enzyme-clamped primers and then cloned into MluI-XhoI digested pGL3-Basic (Promega). Promoter constructs for the AKAP12β promoter were similarly designed to encompass conserved regions identified with VISTA. To clone the -396, -646, -2300, and -5000 constructs, an XbaI fragment encompassing exon 3 was excised from the 489O7 PAC clone and inserted into pBluescript II SK+(Stratagene). Restriction enzymes were then used to subclone these inserts into SmaI cut pGL3-Basic as follows: -396, 5′-NcoI-SanDI-3′, blunted; -646, 5′-PvuII-SanDI-3′, blunted; -2239, 5′AflII-SanDI-3′, blunted; -5399, 5′-XbaI-SanDI-3′, blunted. Insert orientation was determined by PCR. The short constructs +1, -120, and -250 were amplified as above using the -2239 reporter as template with restriction enzyme clamped primers and sequenced to confirm identity. The promoter constructs for AKAP12γ were amplified as for AKAP12α using restriction clamped primers and cloned into MluI-XhoI digested pGL3-Basic. The putative AKAP12γ enhancer was amplified by PCR and cloned into SalI-BamHI digested pGL3-Promoter (Promega). All PCR-generated inserts were sequenced to confirm integrity, with the exception of the long AKAP12α reporter constructs, -2032, -4304, and -4764. These inserts were end-sequenced only; however, multiple independent constructs were tested to ensure no aberrant changes had occurred in the non-sequenced regions. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were seeded in 24-well dishes, allowed to adhere overnight, and then transfected with luciferase reporter constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The amount of each reporter used was adjusted to account for size variations between the constructs, with the largest construct set as the upper limit at 450 ng/well. pBluescript II SK+ was added to equalize the amount of DNA transfected per condition. The Renilla reniformis luciferase reporter pRL-TK (Promega) was co-transfected at 50 ng/well to normalize for transfection efficiency between conditions. All constructs were transfected in triplicate and assayed 48 h after transfection as described previously (16Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Data presented is a representative experiment of at least three independent experiments. Error bars represent S.E. Nuclear Extracts and Gel Shifts—Nuclear Extracts from Rat-2 fibroblasts were prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extract Kit (Pierce) per manufacturer's instructions. For examination of USF-1 binding to the E boxes within the AKAP12α and -β minimal promoter, gel shifts were performed as follows. Nuclear extracts were incubated on ice for 10 min in gel shift buffer (40 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 50 ng/μl poly dI:dC) with or without the indicated competitors. End-labeled probes for the AKAP12α and -β promoters were then added, and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For supershifts, either rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-USF-1 (Santa Cruz) was added as indicated, and all reactions were further incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Nucleoprotein complexes were resolved on nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels and then visualized after autoradiographic exposure. Tissue Isolation, RT-PCR, and Northern Blotting—Indicated tissues were isolated from either C57BL/6 mice or Sprague-Dawley rats, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized with a tissue homogenizer (Polytron) in TRIzol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was then purified according to manufacturer's directions. For RT-PCR, cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the FirstStrand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) per the manufacturer's directions. The 5′ ends of the α, β, and γ transcripts were then amplified using a reverse primer to exon 5 and forward primers to exons 1, 3, or 4, respectively. For analysis of human AKAP12γ expression, human multiple tissue blots were purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech and hybridized with a probe from exon 4 of human AKAP12. Recombinant AKAP12 Constructs—Construction of FLAG-tagged AKAP12 constructs was performed in several steps. First, the full-length AKAP12 cDNA from pUHD10-3-SSeCKS (23Lin X. Gelman I.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2304-2312PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into EcoRI-XhoI-cut pBluescript II SK+ to create pBS-AKAP12α. Next, the stop codon was replaced with an in-frame XbaI site and the 3′ untranslated region was removed, allowing in-frame fusion to the C terminus. The AKAP12β and AKAP12γ constructs were created by exchanging the 5′-XhoI-SwaI fragment of AKAP12α with the 5′ regions of either β or γ created by PCR amplification using either the primers AKAP12β 5′For (5′-GATAGGTCGACTGCTCTGAGGATAGTTAGG) or AKAP12γ 5′For (5′-GATAGTCGACAAATGGCGGCCAACTCCAC) and AKAP12 5′Rev (5′-GATAGGTCGACTGCTCTGAGGATAGTTAGG). Rat lung and testis cDNA were used as templates. The full-length cDNAs were then subcloned into pCMV-3xFLAG-14 (Sigma) to create pAKAP12α-FLAG, pAKAP12β-FLAG, and pAKAP12γ-FLAG. Full-length AKAP12-EGFP fusions were created by excising AKAP12 cDNAs from pBS-AKAP12α, -β, or -γ with XhoI and SacII and subcloning into pEGFP-N3 (BD Bisociences Clontech). AKAP12α-EGFP 5′ deletion constructs were constructed by cloning different regions of the first two AKAP12 exons using restriction enzyme-clamped primers. Mutation of the myristoylation site in full-length and deletion AKAP12α constructs was performed by amplifying a new 5′ end with the primer AKAP12MyrMut (5′-GATACTCGAGCCACCATGGcCGCAGGCAGTTCCACC) where the lowercase letter indicates the changed nucleotide (AKAP12 G2A mutation). Preservation of reading frame in all fusion constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared in “crack” lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 24 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7) containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (Sigma). Lysates were passed 10 times through a 22-gauge needle to shear genomic DNA, and protein concentration was determined with a detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). For expression of FLAG-tagged AKAP12, constructs were transfected into COS-7 with FuGENE6 (Roche), and lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection. Lysates were resolved on denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), blocked, and incubated with either rabbit anti-SSeCKS (9Lin X. Tombler E. Nelson P.J. Gelman I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28430-28438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or mouse anti-FLAG-M2 (Sigma) antibodies overnight as indicated. Blots were then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence. Fluorescence Microscopy—AKAP12-EGFP constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells with FuGENE6. Cells were visualized 48 h after transfection using a BX51 Fluorescence Microscope and a 60× water-immersion lens (Olympus). In some experiments, either the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes were labeled using ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX, BODIPY TR C5-ceramide complexed to bovine serum albumin, or LysoTracker Red DND-99, respectively (Molecular Probes), per the manufacturer's directions. Images were processed with Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). AKAP12 Encodes Three Different mRNAs—The availability of high quality drafts of the human, mouse, and more recently, rat genomes is accelerating the study of gene regulation. Although finalized drafts of these genomes were not available for the majority of this study, early release of unassembled sequence allowed us to examine the AKAP12 gene in these three species. To begin our characterization, we searched the non-redundant data base and trace archives at NCBI for genomic sequences encompassing and flanking the AKAP12 locus. In this fashion, we were able to obtain sequence that spanned from the upstream flanking gene MTHFD1 through the entire AKAP12 locus to the downstream flanking gene ZBTB2. We then assembled the AKAP12 gene structure by tiling previously described AKAP12 mRNAs available in the non-redundant data base against the genomic sequence (Fig. 1A). Three isoforms of AKAP12 mRNAs were revealed during tiling that differ in the positioning of their 5′ exons within the genomic landscape. We propose that these three isoforms be named AKAP12α, AKAP12β, and AKAP12γ to reflect both their timeline of discovery and position in the AKAP12 gene. The majority of described mRNAs belong to one class, AKAP12α. This class includes SSeCKS and Gravin and is represented in all three species. AKAP12β and AKAP12γ each has a single representative in human and mouse; the latter corresponds to the testis-restricted transcript described by Camus et al. (24Camus A. Mesbah K. Rallu M. Babinet C. Barra J. Mech. Dev. 2001; 105: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We searched the expressed sequence tag data base at NCBI and the AKAP12 genomic sequence to identify orthologous transcripts in mouse and rat and human and rat, respectively. Although a potential human ortholog for AKAP12γ was identified within the human AKAP12 locus, support for expression cannot be gleaned from the expressed sequence tag data base. It is interesting that the 5′ end of the human ortholog of AKAP12γ does not align with its rodent counterparts but is spatially conserved in the context of the AKAP12 gene (discussed below). Organization of the AKAP12 Gene—The AKAP12 gene is contained in a moderate-sized locus that spans ∼100 kb and is composed of six exons (Fig. 1A). The unusually large 3′ exons, exons 5 and 6, contain almost the entire protein coding region and 3′ untranslated region. Splicing of the isoform specific 5′ exons, exons 1 through 4, to these large exons generates the full-length mRNA of each isoform (Fig. 1A). CpG islands characteristically found in the promoter regions of genes encompass exons 1, 3 and 4 (data not shown), which suggested to us that the three isoforms represented distinctly regulated transcripts. To rule out alternative splicing as the mechanism that generates the three isoforms, we performed RACE to define the 5′ boundary of each isoform. Despite minor extension of the 5′ untranslated region of each AKAP12 isoform (data not shown), the terminal end of each isoform remained in the same position within the AKAP12 locus, indicating the three isoforms are not generated by alternative splicing (data not shown). RNase protection mapping of the transcriptional start sites of each isoform supported our RACE data (data not shown). AKAP12α and AKAP12β have strictly defined transcriptional start sites (TSS). In contrast, AKAP12γ has multiple TSS dispersed throughout the 5′ flanking region of exon 4 (data not shown). Cross-species comparison is rapidly emerging as a tool to identify important regulatory regions in large spans of genomic DNA, operating under the assumption that conservation reflects functional significance (25Pennacchio L.A. Rubin E.M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). As a first step toward identifying the promoters of the three AKAP12 isoforms, we compared the entire rat AKAP12 locus with the corresponding human locus (Fig. 1B). This comparison gave us a detailed view of the entire array of putative conserved regions within the AKAP12 locus. As expected, peaks representing regions of high similarity were observed at the positions of the AKAP12 exons. Clusters of conserved non-coding elements flank exons 1, 3, and 4 in the putative promoter regions of the α, β, and γ isoforms respectively, supporting our hypothesis that each isoform is independently regulated. Numerous conserved regions are also scattered throughout the introns but concentrate in the regions flanking the second exon. Whether these regions correspond to novel genes within the AKAP12 locus, unidentified AKAP12 exons, or intronic enhancers that regulate AKAP12 expression is unclear at this time. The AKAP12α Promoter—Using the conserved regions identified by cross-species comparison as a guide, we constructed several luciferase reporters encompassing various amounts of the 5′ region flanking exon one to characterize the AKAP12α promoter (Fig. 2A). These constructs were tested in multiple cell lines to determine important regions regulating basal promoter activity. Although normalized promoter activity varies with cell line, the activity profile of the AKAP12α promoter constructs is fairly consistent (Fig. 2B). The shortest construct, corresponding to the first conserved region upstream of the TSS, contains sufficient sequence to support maximal activity in all lines. Inclusion of additional conserved regions 5′ of this sequence does not significantly enhance basal activity. It is interesting that inclusion of distal flanking sequence >600 and >2300 base pairs upstream of the TSS suppresses promoter activity in the Clone9 and A7r5 cells, but does not affect the activity of the promoter in the two kidney cell lines, Rat-2 and NRK. Based on these results, it seems that the AKAP12α promoter may be subdivided into three regions: a basal promoter immediately adjacent to the TSS (-173 to +1), a putative modulator region (-588 to -174), and a negative control region (-4764 to -589). The region corresponding to the basal AKAP12α promoter is highly conserved between rat, mouse, and human (Fig. 2C). Using the TRANSFAC data base of known transcription factor binding sites (www.gene-regulation.com), we identified multiple potential cis-regulatory elements in the rat AKAP12α promoter. To minimize the chance that these identified sites represent false positives, we used conservation in human and mouse as our threshold for inclusion. The AKAP12α promoter lacks a TATA-like element, but contains multiple GC boxes, recognition sites for the stimulating protein family of transcription factors, which could partially explain the strong activity of this promoter. A unique poly-thymidine tract occurs just upstream of a consensus site for p300 and the TSS. The opposite end of this region contains the GC boxes centered around an E Box, a cis-element that is known to be a binding site for a wide array of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. The remainder of conserved regions of the basal promoter did not align well with sites in the data base. To determine whether the cis-elements identified in our scan contribute to the basal activity of the AKAP12α promoter, we constructed further deletion reporter constructs within the basal promoter. Deletion beyond -173 nearly abolished basal promoter activity in all cases, indicating that the entire region is required for maximal activity (data not shown). Because our deletions would not allow us to assess the contribution to maximal activity of the cis-elements contained in the basal promoter, we circumvented this limitation by replacing each element with a sequence that differs from the consensus or by deleting them (Fig. 2D). Our analysis focused on the p300 site, poly T tract, and E box. The activity of these altered constructs was then compared with that of the wild-type promoter in Rat-2 cells. Replacement or deletion of these cis-elements reduced promoter activity to varying degrees, indicating that all contribute to the maximal activity of the basal promoter (Fig. 2E). This is in keeping with our deletion data. These sites are good candidates for future studies focused on determining the transcription factors that regulate AKAP12α expression (see below). The AKAP12β Promoter—We approached characterization of the AKAP12β promoter in the same fashion as the AKAP12α promoter. We again used conserved regions to direct our cloning of reporter constructs to test for promoter activity of the 5′ region flanking exon 3, the initiating exon of AKAP12β (Fig. 3A). Although not as robust as the AKAP12α promoter, the reporter constructs encompassing the AKAP12β promoter display a pattern of activity remarkably similar to AKAP12α (Fig. 3B). Again, the shortest construct, corresponding to the first conserved region upstream of the TSS, is sufficient to support maximal promoter activity. Similar to the AKAP12α promoter, further addition of upstr"

A novel SRF cofactor, herein called p49/STRAP, for SRF-dependent transcription regulation-associated protein, was recently identified in our laboratory. This protein interacted mainly with the transcriptional activation domain of the SRF protein and was found to bind to SRF or to the complex of SRF and another cofactor, such as myocardin or Nkx2.5. The expression of p49/STRAP affected the promoter activity of SRF target genes in a non-uniform manner. For example, p49 activated MLC2v and cardiac actin promoters when it was co-transfected with SRF, but it repressed atrial natriuretic factor promoter activity, which was strongly induced by myocardin. The p49/STRAP mRNA was observed to be highly expressed in fetal, adult, and senescent human hearts, and also in hearts of young adult and old mice, suggesting that p49/STRAP may be an important SRF cofactor in the transcriptional regulation of mammalian cardiac muscle genes throughout the life span.

SRF is a member of the MADS (MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens, SRF) family of transcription factors that regulate a number of immediate early and muscle-specific genes, and also serves to regulate cell proliferation, cell size, and cell survival (4Tsou H.

SRF is highly expressed in the heart during embryonic and early postnatal development, and it is mildly increased by ∼20% from post-maturational adulthood to senescence (4Tsou H. Azhar G. Lu X.G.

In a transgenic mouse model in which the human SRF gene was mildly overexpressed in the heart, cardiac changes resembling those that have been observed during adult aging in terms of myocardial function, morphology, and gene expression are observed in young adulthood (7Zhang X. Azhar G. Furr M.C. Zhong Y. Wei J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: R552-R560Google Scholar). The mildly increased cardiac-specific SRF expression apparently up-regulates some SRF target genes, whereas it down-regulates others in the heart (7Zhang X. Azhar G. Furr M.C. Zhong Y. Wei J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: R552-R560Google Scholar). This bidirectional pattern of altered gene expression following mild SRF up-regulation suggests that possibly other transcription regulators, including perhaps certain SRF cofactors, may pose either positive and/or negative modulatory effects on the activation of SRF target genes (7Zhang X.

To date, a number of SRF cofactors, including the TCF family of proteins, the SAP protein myocardin, Nkx 2.5, and Hop, have been identified, and their various functions in cardiac development have been investigated (20Chen F.

Fewer studies have reported on the role of SRF cofactors in the regulation of cardiac genes during adult aging and senescence. In an effort to identify potential SRF cofactors that may contribute to cardiac gene regulation during aging, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using both SRF NH2- and COOH-terminal portions as bait. Here we report the identification of a novel transcription regulator, p49/STRAP (SRF-dependent transcription regulation associated protein), isolated with the SRF COOH-terminal bait, and propose a model of gene regulation by SRF, p49/STRAP, and other cofactors. The protein p49/STRAP displayed functional cooperation with SRF and myocardin, and repressed the atrial natriuretic factor promoter activity, which was strongly induced by myocardin. The p49/STRAP mRNA was highly expressed in fetal and postnatal hearts, and was increased by ∼45% in old compared with young adult hearts. The age- and cardiac-specific changes of p49/STRAP and other SRF cofactors in senescence may reflect a dynamic pattern of well regulated gene expression during the process of adult aging. Yeast Two-hybrid System—The bait construct containing the NH2 terminus of the SRF protein (1-244 residues), and another containing the COOH terminus of the SRF protein (247-499 residues) were each constructed by fusing the SRF fragments to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the pGBT9 vector (Clontech). The constructs were then used to screen an EML cDNA library (24Zhang P. Behre G. Pan J. Iwama A. Wara-Aswapati N. Radomska H.S. Auron P.E. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8705-8710Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and a human heart cDNA library (Clontech) with a method described by Zhang et al. (24Zhang P. Behre G. Pan J. Iwama A. Wara-Aswapati N. Radomska H.S. Auron P.E. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8705-8710Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The cDNA clones representing potential SRF-interacting proteins were sequenced and were compared with the GenBank™ database by using Blast Search. Cloning of Full-length Coding Region Sequence of p49/STRAP—Two independent cDNA clones (G65, G78), which were isolated with SRF COOH-terminal bait construct, matched a single gene in the GenBank™ database, which has not been previously characterized (we named it p49/STRAP). The full-length coding region of the mouse and human p49/STRAP gene were amplified by PCR using heart cDNA samples (Clontech). The rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR was performed to confirm the full coverage of the p49 coding region sequence as provided in this report. The sequences have been submitted to GenBank™ with the accession numbers AY611629 and AY611630. Antibodies and Plasmid Constructs—A polyclonal antibody against a peptide (KSKKGTEDALLKNQRRAQ) of the p49/STRAP protein was commercially generated by standard procedures (Genemed Synthesis Inc.). The p49/STRAP antibody was shown to be specific for p49/STRAP in whole-cell lysates by Western blotting with competing peptide (see Fig. 2B). Other antibodies that were employed include HA.11 (Co-vance), FLAG (Sigma), and SRF (Santa Cruz). Expression plasmid constructs pcDNA-HA-p49/STRAP (wild-type), pcDNA3-HA-p49/STRAP (1-91), and pcDNA3-HA-p49/STRAP (1-232) were constructed by fusing the wild-type and mutant p49/STRAP to HA tag in pcDNA3-HA vector. pCMV-Flag-SRF was assembled by fusing the wild-type SRF to FLAG tag in pCMV-Tag2 vector (Stratagene). The pGEX4T1-SRF and pGEX4T1-dmSRF were formed by fusing the SRF and dmSRF (a double mutant form of SRF) (25Zhang X. Chai J. Azhar G. Sheridan P. Borras A.M. Furr M.C. Khrapko K. Lawitts J. Misra R.P. Wei J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40033-40040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to GST in pGEX4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). All the DNA constructs were verified with sequencing analysis. In Vitro Protein Interaction Assays—GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma). The p49/STRAP protein was translated in vitro using a TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) and pcDNA3-p49/STRAP plasmid in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. In the in vitro binding assay, 2 μg of agarose-bound GST fusion proteins were incubated with [35S]methionine-labeled p49/STRAP protein for 1 h at 4 °C in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1%Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor mix). Beads were washed four times with NETN buffer and then analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the binding activity was detected by autoradiography. Northern Blotting and Western Blotting—Healthy young adult (3-month-old) and old (20-month-old) mice were obtained from colonies maintained by the NIA, the National Institutes of Health, under contractual agreement with Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc. (Harlan, IN). The human heart mRNA samples were obtained from Biochain Institute (Hayward, CA). The human tissue blot, human cardiovascular system blot, and mouse tissue blot were purchased from Clontech. The Northern blotting and Western blotting were performed as described (6Zhang X. Azhar G. Chai J. Sheridan P. Nagano K. Brown T. Yang J. Khrapko K. Borras A.M. Lawitts J. Misra R.P. Wei J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1782-H1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zhang X. Chai J. Azhar G.

The studies were conducted with Institutional Review Board approval and in accordance with the NIH Guiding Principles for Research Involving Animals and Human Beings. Co-immunoprecipitation—The expression plasmid constructs containing p49/STRAP, SRF, and either myocardin or Nkx2.5 were cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). At 48 h after the transfection, cells were harvested, and the whole-cell lysate was isolated. The lysate proteins were incubated with primary antibody diluted to 1:1000 and bound to protein A/G-Agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C in IP buffer (2% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Beads were then washed four times with a cold buffer containing 0.5% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnSO4, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and bound proteins were separated via SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Transfection Assays—Transient transfections were carried out with the Lipofectamine and Plus reagents as previously described (25Zhang X. Chai J. Azhar G. Sheridan P. Borras A.M. Furr M.C. Khrapko K. Lawitts J. Misra R.P. Wei J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40033-40040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At ∼4 h after the transfection was initiated, the NIH3T3 cells were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated overnight. The cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% fetal calf serum for another 24 h and then placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal calf serum for an additional 3.5 h. Firefly luciferase activity was measured as relative light units. To control for variability, the number of relative light units from individual transfection experiments was normalized by measuring Renilla luciferase activity expressed from a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven vector in the same samples. Individual transfection experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the results were reported as mean firefly luciferase/Renilla luciferase activity (mean ± S.D.) from representative experiments. Subcellular Localization—The expression plasmid (pLP-EGFP-p49/STRAP) containing the EGFP-p49/STRAP fusion protein was generated using the Creator DNA cloning system (Clontech). At ∼30 h after the transfection, the expression of EGFP-p49/STRAP fusion protein was examined by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Deconvolution microscope with AxioVison version 3.1 software. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described by using the SRE consensus oligonucleotide, which is derived from the c-fos promoter (5′-GGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT-3′) (6Zhang X. Azhar G. Chai J. Sheridan P. Nagano K. Brown T. Yang J. Khrapko K. Borras A.M. Lawitts J. Misra R.P. Wei J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1782-H1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro translated SRF and p49/STRAP, as well as the protein from NIH3T3 cells transfected with pAd-Track-CMV-SRF and pcDNA3-HA-p49/STRAP plasmids, were employed for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. P49/STRAP Is a Novel SRF-binding Protein—Sequencing analysis and Blast Search against the GenBank™ database revealed that two independent yeast cDNA clones, which were isolated with the SRF COOH-terminal bait, matched a single gene in the GenBank™ database, the function of which remains uncharacterized. The full-length coding region sequence of this gene was amplified from mouse cardiac cDNA by PCR. This gene encoded a 441-amino acid protein with a predicted mass of 49-kDa; therefore we named it p49/STRAP. The overlapping sequence of the two cDNA clones covered 132 amino acids of the p49/STRAP protein (Fig. 1), indicating that this domain was important for its binding to the SRF protein. The human p49/STRAP gene was also amplified from human cardiac cDNA. Sequence alignment revealed 67% homology between human and mouse p49/STRAP (Fig. 1). To determine whether p49/STRAP processes conserved protein domain or motif, the p49/STRAP sequence was compared with the NCBI Conserved Domain database, Pfam Protein Family database, and SWISS-PRO Protein database. However, no existing domain or motif matched the p49/STRAP gene, indicating that p49/STRAP may belong to a new class of as yet uncharacterized proteins. p49/STRAP Is Expressed in the Heart and Other Tissues—Northern blotting revealed that three p49 isoforms were detected in mouse tissues. Among the tissues tested, mouse heart, liver, kidney, and testes had a high level of p49 expression (Fig. 2A). Western blotting using mouse tissue lysates demonstrated that the p49/STRAP antibody recognized a 49-kDa protein (Fig. 2, A and B). This antibody-protein binding could be blocked by the p49/STRAP peptide (Fig. 2B), indicating that the 49-kDa protein is the main protein product of this gene. Among human tissues, human heart and skeletal muscle had the highest levels of p49/STRAP mRNA, whereas the brain and lungs had the lowest levels of p49/STRAP mRNA (Fig. 2D). Unlike the mouse tissue, human tissue had only one major p49/STRAP transcript, at ∼2.2 kb. In the human cardiovascular system, the p49 mRNA level is higher in the adult than in the fetal heart (Fig. 2E). p49/STRAP Is Increased in Expression in the Aging Heart and in the Heart of Cardiomyopathy—To determine whether there might be an age-related change of p49/STRAP expression in the heart, the expression of p49/STRAP was determined in the myocardium of young adult and old mice. Western blotting analysis revealed that the cardiac p49/STRAP protein level in 20-month-old mice was ∼45% higher than in 3-month-old mice (Fig. 3B). The p49/STRAP mRNA was also increased in the heart of the 20-month-old compared with 3-month-old mice (Fig. 3A). In humans, the age-related change was also observed, as shown in Fig. 3C, p49/STRAP mRNA was increased in 77-year-old individual compared with 30-year-old individual. To test whether the expression of p49/STRAP might be associated with a pathological condition, the level of p49/STRAP expression was examined in the myocardium of SRF transgenic mice that suffered from cardiomyopathy (6Zhang X. Azhar G. Chai J. Sheridan P. Nagano K. Brown T. Yang J. Khrapko K. Borras A.M. Lawitts J. Misra R.P. Wei J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1782-H1792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blotting revealed a 4-fold increase of p49/STRAP in the heart of adult transgenic compared with that of wild-type mice (Fig. 3D). p49/STRAP Interacts with SRF in Vitro and in Vivo—To confirm the physical interaction between p49/STRAP and SRF proteins, we first transformed both the SRF bait plasmid containing SRF COOH terminus and the yeast plasmids containing p49/STRAP protein back into yeast cells. The transformants grew on the -Trp/-Leu/-His triple dropout plates, indicating that the two proteins interact in the yeast cells. Then we tested whether p49/STRAP binds to SRF in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4A, 35S-labeled in vitro translated p49/STRAP protein bound to both immobilized GST-SRF (wild-type) and GST-dmSRF protein (a double mutant form of SRF) (25Zhang X. Chai J. Azhar G. Sheridan P. Borras A.M. Furr M.C. Khrapko K. Lawitts J. Misra R.P. Wei J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40033-40040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) but not to GST protein alone, indicating that p49/STRAP interacts with both the wild-type form and the mutant form of SRF proteins and that point mutations within the DNA binding domain of SRF did not affect the interaction between SRF and p49/STRAP. To test whether the interaction between p49/STRAP and SRF could occur in vivo within mammalian cells, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with plasmid constructs containing wild-type and two mutants of p49/STRAP tagged with HA epitope, and a plasmid construct containing Flag-SRF. As shown in Fig. 4B, the wild-type and both p49/STRAP mutants bound to SRF, indicating that p49/STRAP indeed interacted with SRF in vivo. Analysis of the previously isolated two yeast cDNA clones that interacted with the SRF bait plasmid suggested that a domain from residue 53 to 185 in the p49/STRAP protein is important for its interaction with the SRF protein. However, the in vivo p49/STRAP-SRF interaction data indicated that the protein fragment from residue 1 to 91 in the p49/STRAP protein may possibly also be sufficient for such an interaction. SRF Simultaneously Binds to p49/STRAP and Other Cofactors—Because p49/STRAP binds mainly to the COOH terminus of SRF, we hypothesized that other SRF cofactor(s) that interact with the NH2 terminus of the SRF protein could potentially also bind to SRF at the same time. To test this hypothesis, we performed a parallel transfection assay. One set of cells was transfected with p49/STRAP, SRF, and myocardin expression plasmids; the other set of cells was transfected with p49/STRAP, SRF, and Nkx2.5 expression plasmids. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, a three-protein complex was precipitated in each case, indicating that SRF could simultaneously interact with both p49/STRAP and another cofactor, either myocardin or Nkx2.5. p49/STRAP Is a Nuclear Protein That Does Not Bind to SRE—SRF is a nuclear protein with three nuclear localization signal sequences in its coding region (27Gauthier-Rouviere C.

To identify whether p49/STRAP also localizes to the nucleus, an expression plasmid containing the EGFP-p49/STRAP fusion protein was transfected into NIH3T3 cells. The fusion protein was localized within the nucleus in the vast majority of cells that were examined (Fig. 5). Because p49 was isolated based on its ability to interact with SRF COOH terminus, which contains the SRF transcription activation domain, it was not expected that p49/STRAP would form a ternary complex with SRF at the site of SRE. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using proteins from both cell lysate and in vitro translated p49/STRAP and SRF revealed that no additional band was shifted by anti-SRF or anti-HA antibodies (data not shown) in the presence of a DNA fragment corresponding to c-fos promoter that contains SRE, thus confirming that p49/STRAP did not form the ternary complex with SRF at the site of SRE. p49/STRAP Modulates the Transcriptional Activation of Cardiac Genes—To explore the biological effect of p49/STRAP and the consequences of an elevation of p49/STRAP expression on cardiac gene expression, the promoter activities of c-fos SRE, MLC2v, cardiac actin, and atrial natriuretic factor were utilized as indicators in cell transfection assays. As shown in Fig. 6A-C, p49/STRAP activated SRE-luciferase, MLC2v, and cardiac actin promoter activity, respectively, mainly in cooperation with SRF. However, p49 apparently effectively repressed atrial natriuretic factor promoter activity, which was strongly induced by myocardin (Fig. 6D). In the present study, we report the identification and characterization of a new gene, p49/STRAP, as a novel SRF-dependent transcription regulator. This gene was initially isolated from yeast two-hybrid screening based on its ability to bind to the SRF COOH terminus. The subsequent protein-protein binding assays further confirmed that p49/STRAP is a SRF-binding protein. In addition, we observed that p49/STRAP could form a protein complex with SRF and also with other SRF cofactor(s), such as myocardin or Nkx2.5. The interaction of p49/STRAP with SRF alone or with both SRF and other cofactors can clearly affect the activation of cardiac gene promoters in diverse ways. Both the p49/STRAP mRNA and protein are highly expressed in the mouse and human heart, and their expression levels increase with advancing age, suggesting that p49/STRAP may play a significant role in the regulation of cardiac genes during adult aging. The sequence of the p49/STRAP protein is conserved between human and mouse. However, to date the p49/STRAP protein sequence does not match any known conserved protein domain or known motif that has been deposited in several public databases, including the NCBI conserved domain database and Pfam Protein Family database. This suggests that p49/STRAP may belong to a new class of proteins that are yet to be determined. Inasmuch as the p49/STRAP protein does not bind to DNA and does not form a protein complex with SRF at the SRE site, it is likely that p49/STRAP modulates SRF function primarily through its interactions with SRF in the SRF transcriptional activation domain. SRF target genes are regulated in a complex manner that is partly because of the participation of multiple SRF-binding proteins in the co-regulation of SRF target genes. SRF-binding proteins include the TCF family proteins (26Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vandromme M.

With the increasing number of SRF cofactors being identified, one emerging question is how SRF cofactors might be recruited by SRF for the SRF-dependent transcriptional regulation. Molecular dissection of the functional domain of SRF has revealed that SRF has two major parts. The NH2 terminus has the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain, while the COOH terminus has the transcriptional activation domain (31Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Each part constitutes approximately half of the protein. Most of the SRF cofactors (except ATF6) that have been identified apparently predominantly bind to the SRF NH2 terminus (18Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 33Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

However, we and others have observed that a mutant form of SRF, which substitutes amino acids in the DNA binding domain and thus prevents the proteins from binding to DNA, can still significantly affect the expression of SRF target genes, suggesting that the SRF transcriptional activation domain plays a critical role in the regulation of SRF target genes (25Zhang X. Chai J. Azhar G. Sheridan P. Borras A.M. Furr M.C. Khrapko K. Lawitts J. Misra R.P. Wei J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40033-40040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our finding of the co-immunoprecipitation of two protein complexes containing three proteins, “p49/STRAP-SRF-myocardin” and “p49/STRAP-SRF-Nkx2.5,” indicates that p49/STRAP is able to interact with SRF in the presence of another cofactor while they are both bound to SRF. It is likely that multiple cofactors may interact with SRF at any given time within a cell, as shown in Fig. 7. This intriguing model of the dynamic pattern of the interactions among SRF and its cofactors warrants further study. On the NH2 terminus of SRF, many cofactors may competitively bind to SRF, including the TCF family proteins Elk1, SAP-1, and SAP-2 (22Wang Z. Wang D.Z. Hockemeyer D. McAnally J. Nordheim A.

On the COOH terminus of the SRF protein, it is plausible that p49/STRAP and ATF6 may also modulate the binding of one another to SRF (37Thuerauf D.J. Arnold N.D. Zechner D. Hanford D.S. DeMartin K.M.

The concept of multiprotein functional complexes and regulation of intracellular and intercellular processes has been evolving (38Pardee A.B. Reddy G.P.

Cell. 2002; 10: 857-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The participation by multiple cofactors and the exchange of the cofactors for each other at any given time may potentially account for the complex patterns of SRF target gene expression in different tissues, at different development stages, and under different stress conditions (40Li X. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 2004; 427: 687-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The dynamic interactions among SRF, p49/STRAP, and other cofactors may help to determine whether and how much SRF activates or represses its target gene(s). It has been documented that the RNAs of certain SRF cofactors, such as TCF family proteins (Elk-1, SAP-1, and SAP-2), are present at similar relative levels in many different tissues, suggesting that TCF proteins may serve as universal instead of tissue-specific cofactors (21Shin C.H.

However, some other cofactors, including myocardin and Nkx2.5, are highly expressed in the heart, and therefore may serve as tissue-specific cofactors. It is plausible that the recently identified Hop protein, which also modulates SRF activity, may also have a similar role (21Shin C.H. Liu Z.P. Passier R. Zhang C.L. Wang D.Z. Harris T.M.

In addition, SRF and myocardin have been reported to be well expressed in the heart during embryogenesis and postnatal development (18Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 19Du K.L. Ip H.S. Li J. Chen M. Dandre F. Yu W. Lu M.M. Owens G.K. Parmacek M.S.

These data indicate that p49/STRAP, SRF, and myocardin are well expressed in the heart during different developmental stages and suggest that p49/STRAP may also contribute significantly to cardiac gene expression. We have observed that the cardiac expression of p49/STRAP and myocardin are both increased during adult aging. We previously reported that SRF expression was increased by ∼20% in the heart of the senescent compared with young adult rodents (5Lu X.G. Azhar G. Liu L. Tsou H. Wei J.Y. J Gerontol. 1998; 53: B3-B10Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Zhang X. Azhar G. Furr M.C. Zhong Y. Wei J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: R552-R560Google Scholar). In contrast, some other transcription factors, which are SRF cofactors, including Nkx2.5 and GATA4, have been reported to be decreased during adult aging (41Bodyak N. Kang P.M. Hiromura M. Sulijoadikusumo I. Horikoshi N. Khrapko K. Usheva A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3788-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The age and cardiac-specific increase of some SRF cofactors and decrease of other cofactors are unlikely to be a coincidence and rather may reflect the dynamic pattern of precisely regulated gene expression during the process of adult aging. Recent studies using sophisticated molecular methods have revealed dynamic patterns of gene expression during aging in animals across the species and support the concept that the change in gene expression during adult aging is likely because of “selective gene regulation” rather than random passive decline (42Helfand S.L. Inouye S.K. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We thank D. Tenen for the EML cDNA library, pcDNA3-HA tag, and pcDNA3-flag tag vectors, E.

However, more recent studies have shown it to be cytoplasmic. In addition, analysis of its subcellular localization has been complicated by the existence of the paralog Usp15. In this study, we resolved this controversy by investigating the localization of exogenously expressed Usp4 (using red fluorescent protein-Usp4) and of endogenous Usp4 (using highly specific antibodies that can distinguish Usp4 from Usp15). We found that by inhibiting nuclear export with leptomycin B, both exogenous and endogenous Usp4 accumulate in the nucleus. Further, using a Rev-green fluorescent protein-based export assay, we confirmed the existence of a nuclear export signal (133VEVYLLELKL142) in Usp4. In addition, a functional nuclear import signal (766QPQKKKK772) was also identified, which was specifically recognized by importin α/β. Finally, we show that the equilibrium of Usp4 subcellular localization varies between different cell types. Usp4 is thus the first DUB reported to have nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties.

The implications of this shuttling for its function as a DUB are discussed. Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid protein that serves as a multi-functional covalent “tag” for a wide variety of cellular proteins. Its best understood function is in marking proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome, but ubiquitin conjugation is also important in diverse pathways including DNA repair, receptor internalization, and signal transduction (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3275) Google Scholar, 2Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Mutations affecting enzymes involved in the ubiquitin system have been implicated in several human diseases (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol.

Ubiquitin conjugation requires the action of several enzymes to activate and covalently attach ubiquitin to target proteins, with specificity being provided by the ubiquitin ligase/E3 enzymes, which are involved in substrate binding and have received much attention in recent years (5Jackson P.K.

DUBs constitute large gene families in all eukaryotes and can be divided into the ubiquitin-specific protease (UBP) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase families based on amino acid sequence (6Wilkinson K.D.

This multiplicity is not required merely for the cleavage of ubiquitin precursors but is indicative of other regulatory roles in the ubiquitin pathway. Clues to the function of some mammalian UBPs have come from their identification as growth regulators. These include the human tre-2/tre-17(USP6) proto-oncogene (9Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and the mouse cytokine-inducible UBPs DUB-1 and DUB-2 (10Zhu Y. Lambert K. Corless C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A.

We have studied the mouse Unp gene (Usp4 in the systematic nomenclature) (11Baker R.T. Wang X.W. Woollatt E. White J.A. Sutherland G.R. Genomics. 1999; 59: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which was originally identified as a proto-oncogene related to tre-2/tre-17/USP6 (12Gupta K. Chevrette M. Gray D.A.

Unp/Usp4 was subsequently observed to contain the UBP Cys and His boxes (9Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 14Gray D.A. Inazawa J.

Ueda R. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2179-2183PubMed Google Scholar) observed that the human homolog of Usp4, USP4 (UNP; also termed Unph), had consistently elevated gene expression levels in small cell tumors and adenocarcinomas of the lung, suggesting a possible causative role for this UBP in neoplasia. In a separate study using cell lines rather than primary tissue, USP4 protein levels were shown to be slightly but consistently reduced in cell lines derived from small cell tumors, leading to the suggestion that USP4 may be a candidate tumor suppressor gene (17Frederick A. Rolfe M. Chiu M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, both mouse and human Usp4 have been shown to interact with the Rb family of tumor suppressor proteins, a possible mechanism for Usp4-mediated cell transformation (18Blanchette P. Gilchrist C.A. Baker R.T. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5533-5537Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19DeSalle L.M. Latres E. Lin D. Graner E. Montagnoli A. Baker R.T. Pagano M. Loda M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5538-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). There is considerable controversy regarding the cellular location of Usp4/USP4. Initial reports described it as a nuclear protein as determined by cell fractionation (13Gupta K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2307-2310PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, cell fractionation studies by Frederick et al. (17Frederick A. Rolfe M. Chiu M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using a different anti-peptide antibody showed it to be cytoplasmic. Both of these studies are clouded by the subsequent identification of a novel DUB termed USP15 (11Baker R.T. Wang X.W. Woollatt E. White J.A. Sutherland G.R. Genomics. 1999; 59: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Angelats C. Wang X.W. Jermiin L.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baker R.T. Mamm. Genome. 2003; 14: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which is 61% identical to USP4. Since the antibody produced by Frederick et al. (17Frederick A. Rolfe M. Chiu M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was raised against a peptide that is almost identical in the subsequently identified USP15, it seems likely that both USP4 and USP15 were being detected. Both USP4 and USP15 contain putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs), with that of USP4 being very similar to that of p53 (11Baker R.T. Wang X.W. Woollatt E. White J.A. Sutherland G.R. Genomics. 1999; 59: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Gupta K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2307-2310PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of transfected myc epitope-tagged USP4 in IMR90 cells revealed either whole-cell or cytoplasmic staining (17Frederick A. Rolfe M. Chiu M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the overexpression of USP4 in these experiments could affect its location. Although the location of USP15 has not been studied, the recently described rat ortholog of USP15, UBP109 (21Park K.C. Choi E.J. Min S.W. Chung S.S. Kim H. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 443-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), shows both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. Mutation of one of three putative NLSs in UBP109 resulted in exclusion from the nucleus of myc-tagged UBP109 (21Park K.C. Choi E.J. Min S.W. Chung S.S. Kim H. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 443-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although no quantification was presented. Proteins larger than ∼40 kDa are generally transported into the nucleus through an active mechanism (22Jans D.A. Chan C.K. Huebner S. Med. Res. Rev. 1998; 18: 189-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Nuclear import is mediated by members of the importin (IMP) superfamily that recognize NLSs. Conversely, nuclear export is mediated by exportins that recognize nuclear export signals (NESs), which are generally leucine-rich elements (23Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The best studied exportin is CRM1 (24Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Proteins that possess NLS and NES motifs can shuttle between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in signal-dependent fashion. It seems reasonable to suggest that the conflicting reports of the cellular localization of USP4 reflect bona fide differences due to different cell types or stages of the cell cycle, rather than artifactual differences due to different technical approaches. In an effort to resolve this issue and to gain a deeper understanding of their function, we generated polyclonal antibodies that discriminate between Usp4 and Usp15 and used these to study their subcellular localization in a variety of cell types. We also constructed a fusion of the red fluorescent protein (RFP) to Usp4 and used this to identify functional NLS and NES signals. Usp4 is thus shown to be a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, with different proportions of nuclear and cytoplasmic localization depending on the cell type. This is the first demonstration of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling for a DUB. DNA Manipulation and Cloning—DNA was amplified by PCR using Promega Pfu enzyme according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR templates were a mouse Usp4 cDNA clone (pCG53) (15Gilchrist C.A. Baker R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and a mouse Usp15 cDNA clone (pXW122) (20Angelats C. Wang X.W. Jermiin L.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baker R.T. Mamm. Genome. 2003; 14: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were constructed by cloning the Usp4 or Usp15 gene region, corresponding to amino acids 539-789 or 526-797, respectively, into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biotech) using EcoRI and SalI sites. Poly-His-tagged full-length Usp4 and Usp15 proteins were constructed using the Gateway cloning system and the pDEST17 vector (Invitrogen). The RFP-Usp4 fusion was also constructed using the Gateway system in the plasmid pDEST-RFP, which was generated by inserting the attR1-ccdB-attR2 cassette B (Invitrogen) into the unique SmaI site of plasmid pDsRed-C1 (Clontech) to render it Gateway-compatible. The Rev-GFP reporter construct, Rev(1.4)-GFP, was kindly provided by Beric Henderson (25Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 26Henderson B.R. Percipalle P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides encoding putative Usp4 NESs were ligated between the BamHI and AgeI sites of this vector. The Usp4-NLS2-β-galactosidase construct was created by introducing short double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding Usp4 NLS2 into XmaI sites of pPR2all vector (27Rihs H.P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were purified for transfection using the PureFection maxi/midi kit (Promega). The integrity of all amplified DNAs and plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing (ABI Big Dye; Biomolecular Resource Facility, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University). Primer sequences are available on request. Protein Purification and Antibody Production—Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was used for expression of Usp4- and Usp15-GST and His6-tagged proteins, whereas MC1060 was used to express β-galactosidase fusion proteins. β-Galactosidase fusion proteins were purified by APTG-agarose affinity chromatography (Roche Molecular Biosciences) as described (27Rihs H.P. Jans D.A. Fan H. Peters R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Mouse IMP α2 (Rch1) and β1 proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins in strain TG-1 and purified as previously (28Efthymiadis A. Shao H. Hubner S. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22134-22139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the case of the Usp4 and Usp15 proteins, GST fusions were expressed in a 10-liter batch culture at 25 °C and induced with 0.01 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h and then purified by GSH affinity chromatography as described (29Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). His6-tagged fusions were expressed at 30 °C with 4 h of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and were purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-iminodiacetate-Sepharose prepared as described (30Porath J. Olin B. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1621-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The GST-variable region fusions were used to separately inoculate New Zealand White rabbits (three injections of 150 μg) and produce antibodies by standard methods (31Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The serum obtained was then affinity-purified using His6-tagged full-length Usp4 or Usp15 proteins immobilized on PVDF membrane by standard methods (31Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mml-glutamine. Saos-2 and SR-40 cells were grown in Mac-Coy's 5a, 15% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and PSN (50 units of penicillin, 50 ng of streptomycin, 0.1 mg of neomycin per ml). Mouse primary embryonic fibroblasts (MPEFs) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 15% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine. HepG2 cells were grown in minimal essential medium, 20% FBS, 1× amino acids, 1× nonessential amino acids, 1× vitamins. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine. MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in RPMI, 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, PSN. All cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and passaged routinely. For immunofluorescence or transient transfection with RFP or GFP fusion constructs, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 12-well plates and transfected at 60-85% confluence with 2 μg of DNA and 4 μl of Cytofectene (Invitrogen) per 1 ml of medium as described by the manufacturer. Cells, expressing either RFP or GFP fusion proteins, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15-30 min, washed in PBS, and mounted on slides for protein expression analysis 48 or 24 h post-transfection, respectively. For immunofluorescence, fixed and washed cells were permeabilized in PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, blocked in PBS plus 1% BSA for 45 min, incubated with primary antibodies (1:50 to 1:200 dilution in PBS plus 1% BSA) overnight at 4 °C, washed five times with PBS, incubated with anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated or anti-mouse Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100 dilution; Jackson laboratory) for 1 h, washed with PBS five times, and mounted on microscope slides using nail polish. Image Analysis—Cells were imaged by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM; Bio-Rad Radiance 2000), using a × 60 oil immersion lens. The ratio of fluorescence in the nucleus relative to the cytoplasm (Fn/c) was derived by image analysis of confocal files as previously (28Efthymiadis A. Shao H. Hubner S. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22134-22139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using the NIH Image 1.62 public domain software, whereby the mean pixel density was assessed for manually cropped areas of uniform intensity in the nucleus (Fn) or cytoplasm (Fc), with identical measurements performed on untransfected cells used as the background fluorescence (Fb). The Fn/c ratio was calculated using the formula, Fn/c = (Fn - Fb)/(Fc - Fb), where an Fn/c of 0.9-1.1 was designated as N = C, Fn/c > 1.1 was designated as N > C, and Fn/c < 0.9 was designated as C > N. Statistical differences were determined using Student's t test. Subcellular location was also monitored using fluorescence microscopy and simple UV illumination, with results scored as predominantly nuclear (N > C), nuclear and cytoplasmic (N = C), or predominantly cytoplasmic (C > N). Western Blotting—Proteins were mixed with protein loading buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and resolved by 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, which was then blocked in 5% skim milk, phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h, incubated with primary antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times, incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DAKO; 1:4,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and visualized using the ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). ELISA Protein Binding Assay—The binding of bacterially expressed GST-tagged mouse importins to Usp4 NLS-β-galactosidase fusion proteins or to His6-tagged Usp4 was assessed using an ELISA-based binding assay as previously, using the IMP α/β-recognized NLS-containing T-ag-NLS-β-galactosidase protein as a control (28Efthymiadis A. Shao H. Hubner S. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22134-22139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Data were fitted to the formula, B(x) = Bmax (1 - e-kx), where x is the concentration of IMPs, as previously (28Efthymiadis A. Shao H. Hubner S. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22134-22139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constant, Kd, represents the concentration of IMPs yielding half-maximal binding. Generation of Usp4- and Usp15-specific Antibodies—Several laboratories have previously generated anti-Usp4 antibodies, albeit with questionable specificity. For example, Gupta et al. (12Gupta K. Chevrette M. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1729-1731PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gupta K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Gray D.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2307-2310PubMed Google Scholar) generated anti-peptide antibodies, which reacted with a 180-kDa protein in NIH3T3 cell lysates instead of the predicted 110 kDa for Usp4. Frederick et al. (17Frederick A. Rolfe M. Chiu M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) raised a peptide antibody against a region of USP4 almost identical to the subsequently identified USP15 (4Sakamoto K.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (USP4, CHFSKADTIATIEK; USP15, RRFSKADTIDTIEK; identical residues are underlined). Finally, we found that the commercial anti-USP4 (UNP) antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), raised by DeSalle et al. (19DeSalle L.M. Latres E. Lin D. Graner E. Montagnoli A. Baker R.T. Pagano M. Loda M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5538-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) against a C-terminal peptide of human USP4, cross-reacted with recombinant Usp15 (Fig. 1B). In this light, we set out to generate specific antibodies to Usp4 and Usp15. The variable regions (var) of mouse Usp4 (amino acids 539-786) and mouse Usp15 (amino acids 526-797) (Fig. 1A) were chosen as antigens, since these regions were only 33% identical, compared with >60% for the remainder of the proteins. DNA encoding Usp4(var) or Usp15(var) was amplified by PCR and cloned into plasmid pGEX-4T-1. The resulting plasmids were used for bacterial expression of GST-Usp4(var) and GST-Usp15(var) fusion proteins, which were purified and then injected into rabbits for generation of antibodies. Sera from immunized rabbits were affinity-purified using His6-tagged full-length Usp4 or Usp15 and tested for their specificity by Western blotting. The antibodies recognized their cognate recombinant proteins and did not cross-react (Fig. 1C). These antibodies also detected recombinant human USP4 or USP15 specifically (data not shown). They also identified proteins of the expected molecular mass in extracts from various mouse tissues (Figs. 1, D and E). Splice variants of Usp4 have slightly lower molecular masses (108.3 or 103.7 kDa) than those of Usp15 (112.3 or 109.2 kDa) (20Angelats C. Wang X.W. Jermiin L.S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Baker R.T. Mamm. Genome. 2003; 14: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A Western blot performed with spleen extract showed that the Usp4 antibody clearly detects a protein(s) of lower mass than the Usp15 antibody (Fig. 1F, lanes 4 compared with lanes 15). Upon closer examination, two closely migrating bands can be detected in each lane of D-F, representing the alternately spliced variants. In addition, a blot probed with a mixture of Usp4 and Usp15 antibodies detects thicker bands that encompass all bands seen with the separate antibodies (Fig. 1F, lanes 4 + 15). It was thus possible to conclude that our antibodies are specific for Usp4 and Usp15. Differential Subcellular Localization of Endogenous Usp4 and Usp15—Usp4 and Usp15 are paralogs showing ∼61% sequence identity. This similarity is also reflected in the fact that both are ubiquitin-specific proteases and can bind the pRb family of tumor suppressor proteins (11Baker R.T. Wang X.W. Woollatt E. White J.A. Sutherland G.R. Genomics. 1999; 59: 264-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Blanchette P. Gilchrist C.A. Baker R.T. Gray D.A.

Genome. 2003; 14: 31-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 2C. Angelats and R. T. Baker, unpublished data. Immunostaining experiments showed that the subcellular localization of endogenous USP4 and USP15 proteins in HeLa human cervical cancer cells is largely mutually exclusive. Whereas Usp4 was observed exclusively in the nucleus, excluding the nucleolus, Usp15 was detected primarily in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus, but not the nucleus (Fig. 1, G and H). As a control, blocking either antibody with its cognate recombinant protein resulted in the elimination of staining (not shown), demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies and lack of cross-reactivity with other proteins in the fixed cell preparations. These results were confirmed in the NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line, although a greater heterogeneity of staining was observed. Usp4 was found mainly in the nuclei of 23% of cells, exclusively in the cytoplasm of 27% of cells and throughout the cell in 50% of cells. Usp15, in contrast, did not show such heterogeneity, being never seen in the nucleus but rather localized near the plasma membrane and enriched near some membranes but not others (Fig. 1, I and J). Endogenous Usp4 Has Different Subcellular Localization in Different Cell Lines—Since Usp4 localization in HeLa and NIH3T3 cell lines was different, we explored the localization of endogenous Usp4 in a range of other cell lines. Immunostaining of HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), Saos-2, (human osteosarcoma), and MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer) cells (Fig. 2) revealed a range of different endogenous USP4 staining patterns. Thus, USP4 was detected only in the cytoplasm in HepG2 cells, while being exclusively nuclear in Saos-2 cells. Staining of MDA-MB-231 cells showed that USP4 was predominantly nuclear in 51.5% of cells, cytoplasmic in 27.5% of cells, and throughout the cell in 21% of cells (Fig. 2).Fig. 1Generation of Usp4- and Usp15-specific antibodies.A, Usp4 and Usp15 sequence features. Variable regions of Usp4 and Usp15 are shown as shaded and dotted boxes, respectively, with the sequence identities shown in percentages. Putative NESs and NLSs in Usp4 are shown with arrows and shown in single-letter code. B, Western blot analysis with a commercial anti-USP4 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Total cell lysates from bacteria expressing Usp15 (U15), Usp4 (U4), or an empty plasmid (con) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with a commercially available anti-USP4 (UNP) antibody from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (1:1000 dilution), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (diluted 1:4,000) and ECL detection. The position of the 97-kDa marker is shown. C, Western blot analysis with Usp4 and Usp15 affinity-purified antibodies. Purified His6-Usp4 (lanes U4) and His6-Usp15 (lanes U15) recombinant proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and probed with affinity-purified anti-Usp15 antibody or with affinity-purified anti-Usp4 antibody, as indicated below the panels, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and ECL detection. The position of the 97-kDa marker is shown. Usp4 expressed in bacteria gives proteins of different sizes due to internal initiation codons and/or degradation (15Gilchrist C.A. Baker R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). D and E, Western blot against total mouse tissue extracts. Total protein extracts from mouse brain (Br), kidney (Ki), liver (Li), or spleen (Sp) were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with affinity-purified anti-Usp4 antibody (D) or anti-Usp15 antibody (E). F, Usp4 and Usp15 antibodies detect proteins of different sizes. Mouse spleen extract was resolved in a wide slot gel by 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the membrane was sliced into four strips. Alternate strips were probed with affinity-purified anti-Usp4 antibody (lanes 4) or anti-Usp15 antibody (lanes 15), and the membrane was reassembled prior to chemiluminescent detection. The central two strips were stripped and reprobed with a mixture of Usp4 and Usp15 antibodies (lanes 4 + 15). At higher magnification, two closely mi"

Their second transmembrane helix (TM2) contains a leucine heptad repeat proposed to be involved in oligomerization. In artificial transmembrane segments, interhelical interactions are stabilized by polar residues. We searched for these hydrogen bond donors in TM2 by mutating the five polar residues in TM2 of the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter-1 (GAT1). We tested the ability of the resulting mutants to oligomerize by fluorescence microscopy, Foerster resonance energy transfer, and β-lactamase fragment complementation. Of all generated mutants, only Y86A- (but not Y86F-), E101A-, E101Q-, and E101D-GAT1 were judged by these criteria to be deficient in oligomerization and were retained intracellularly. The observations are consistent with a model where the leucine heptad repeat in TM2 drives a homophilic association that is stabilized by Tyr86 and Glu101; Tyr86 participates in hydrophobic stacking. Glu101 is in the a-position of the leucine heptad repeat (where positions 1-7 are denoted a-g, and each leucine is in the central d-position). Thus, Glu101 is in the position predicted for the hydrogen bond donor (i.e. sandwiched between Leu97 and Leu104, which are one helical turn above and below Glu101). These key residues, namely Tyr86 and Glu101, are conserved in related transporters from archaeae to humans; they are therefore likely to support oligomeric assembly in transporter orthologs and possibly other proteins with multiple transmembrane segments.

The four known GABA transporters (GAT1, BGT1 (betaine/GABA transporter), GAT2, and GAT3) belong to the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) (1Busch W. Saier Jr., M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 37: 287-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) family, which also includes carriers for dopamine, serotonin, glycine, etc. (2Torres G.E. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). All members of the family share sequence similarity, membrane topology, and common functional features (e.g. ion channel-like properties, sodium, and chloride) as transported cosubstrates and bidirectional transport of substrates. The interest in transporters of this family is motivated in part by their clinical relevance; they are targets for drugs of abuse (e.g. cocaine, ecstasy, and metamphetamine) and for therapeutic agents including antidepressants (amitryptiline, desipramine, citalopram, and paroxetine) and anticonvulsants (tiagabine), etc. (reviewed in Ref. 3Zahniser N.R. Doolen S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 21-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). With the notable exception of the glycine transporter-1 (4Horiuchi M. Nicke A. Gomeza J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), all members of the neurotransmitter transporter family that have so far been examined form oligomers (reviewed in Ref. 5Sitte H.H. Freissmuth M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 479: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This is also true for GAT1, for which oligomers have been visualized in membranes of living cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy (6Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The TM2 of GAT1 contains a leucine heptad repeat that seems to supports oligomer formation (7Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The leucine heptad repeat in TM2 is a highly conserved feature throughout the NSS family. Consistent with this finding, TM2-mediated dimer formation was also suggested for dopamine transporter (8Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.D. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). By analogy with leucine zippers in soluble proteins, the stretch of leucine residues in the TM2 of GAT1 lines one side of a hypothetical α-helix. If this leucine heptad repeat is to serve as an interface between two transporter molecules, there must be additional forces that stabilize this arrangement. In aqueous solution, the hydrophobic leucine (or isoleucine) side chains are tightly packed to minimize the solvent exposed surface. It is, however, difficult to conceive how the hydrophobic environment in the membrane provides the force to drive the association of leucine residues. In fact, synthetic polyleucine segments show little propensity for self-association in the membrane (9Zhou F.X. Merianos H.J. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 10Gurezka R. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45580-45587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in phospholamban and in the erythropoietin receptor (11Simmerman H.K. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 12Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F. Moucadel V. Krishnakumar S. Smith S.O. Constantinescu S.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1239-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), leucine and isoleucine-based packing interactions do occur between transmembrane domains. Similarly, artificial leucine-rich transmembrane segments can be forced to self-associate, provided that the interaction is stabilized by a polar hydrogen bond-donating residue (i.e. Ser, Thr, Gln, Glu, and Asp in the a-position sandwiched between two leucine residues in the d-positions of the heptad repeats) (9Zhou F.X. Merianos H.J. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 13Dawson J.P. Weinger J.S. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we surmised that a polar residue must be essential to stabilize the homophilic interaction of TM2 segments in the GAT1 oligomer if the interaction is supported by packing of the leucine heptad repeat. We therefore focused on the polar or ionizable residues in TM2 of GAT1: Tyr86, Thr89, Glu101, Cys102, and Ser103. Our experiments identified the two residues Tyr86 and Glu101, both invariably present in the corresponding positions in all neurotransmitter:sodium symporters, as key players in TM2-mediated intramembrane interaction. However, in Tyr86 the hydrogen bond-donating hydroxyl group is dispensable, and it is the aromatic ring (and hence a hydrophobic interaction) that is (appears) essential for stabilizing the oligomer. In contrast, both, the size of the side chain and the hydroxyl group of Glu101 seem to be essential for supporting oligomer formation. Glu101 is in the a-position of the heptad repeat, sandwiched between Leu97 and Leu104, which, in a helical arrangement, are one turn above and below Glu101. Thus, Glu101 fulfills the criteria of the hydrogen bond donor capable of stabilizing the interhelical contact. cDNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—Plasmid DNA constructs YFPGAT1, CFP-GAT1, YFP-GAT1, YFP-GATΔ37, CFP-GATΔ37, and CFPGAT1-L97A were described elsewhere (7Scholze P.

At this step, the L97A mutation in the former was eliminated, and the desired ones were introduced. The derived transporters or truncated versions (amino acids 1-110) were cloned in frame with F[1] and F[2] β-lactamase fragment via AscI/NotI sites introduced by PCR. Sequences of all constructs were verified. Cell Culture, Heterologous Expression, and Uptake Assays—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing l-alanyl-l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 50 mg/liter gentamicin on 10-cm diameter cell culture dishes at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. One day before transfection, cells were replated to obtain subconfluent cultures either on glass coverslips (22 mm in diameter and placed into 6-well plates, 3 × 105 cells/well plate) or on 10-cm plates (1 × 106 cells/well plate) for uptake experiments. Transient transfections were done using the CaPO4 precipitation method (15Okayama H. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1136-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and whole-cell uptake assays as described previously (6Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In brief, 48 h after transfection with either CFP-GAT1 or its mutated versions, HEK-293 cells were incubated for 3 min at room temperature in 0.1 ml of Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, final pH 7.3) containing 15-20 nm [3H]GABA in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled GABA, with total GABA concentration ranging from 1 to 60 μm (resulting in a specific activity ranging from 1000 to 10 cpm/pmol). Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 10 μm tiagabine, with 3 min of preincubation. The uptake buffer was aspirated, and the cells were washed with 1 ml of ice-cold Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer and lysed with 0.5 ml of 1% SDS. The amount of accumulated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For vesicular uptake assays, membranes were prepared from cells that expressed intracellularly retained GAT1 mutants in isotonic sucrose; NaCl-driven uptake of [3H]GABA into these membrane vesicles (50-100 μg/assay) was measured by employing a filtration assay as described earlier (7Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP fx cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ). The fluorescence filter sets were purchased from Chroma (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT; CFP filter set: excitation 436 nm, dichroic 455 nm, emission 480 nm; YFP filter set: excitation 500 nm, dichroic 515 nm, emission 535 nm; FRET filter set: excitation 436 nm, dichroic 455 nm, emission 535 nm). Coverslips with attached cells were mounted in the microscope chamber and put on the microscope stage. Images of cells with CFP- or YFP-tagged transporters were acquired through corresponding filter channels. For donor photobleaching, FRET cells expressing either CFP-tagged or CFP- and YFP-tagged transporters were continuously illuminated with a 100-watt mercury lamp and the CFP filter set for 1 min, a time interval sufficient to bleach the donor to an extent of less than 20% (with acquisition of one image every 3 s). Regions of interest were selected, and fluorescence emission intensities were quantified. The resulting fluorescence decay curves were fitted to the equation for a single exponential decay approaching a constant value: fluorescence intensity = A0e-Kt + offset, where A0 denotes the starting value, offset is the final fluorescence signal, and K is the decay constant. The photobleaching lifetime constant τ is defined as 1/K. To measure donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching (DRAP), we acquired a donor (CFP) image before (Ib) and after (Ia) photobleaching using the YFP setting for 90 s (excitation 500 nm, dichroic mirror 525 nm, and emission 535 nm). DRAP was quantified by FRET efficiency (E) according to the following equation: E = (Ia - Ib)/Ia (16Miyawaki A. Tsien R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 472-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and corrected for cross-bleaching of CFP through the YFP filter set (∼9-10%). Fluorescence images were acquired and analyzed using the MetaMorph and MetaFluor of MetaSeries software package (release 4.6; Universal Imaging Corp., Downing-town, PA). For statistical comparisons of time constants of fluorescence efficiencies, ANOVA followed by Dunnett's or Tukey's test was used. β-Lactamase Protein Fragment Complementation Assay—For the β-lactamase protein fragment complementation assay, we used plasmids pcDNA3.1-Zeo/F[1]m182T and pcDNA3.1-Zeo/F[2] to express of proteins fused to β-lactamase fragments F[1] and F[2] (17Galarneau A. Primeau M. Trudeau L.E. Michnick S.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Constructs of wild type and mutant GAT1 were fused by PCR cloning. Cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of plasmids using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After 24 h, cells were detached mechanically, lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle, and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline. Membranes were sedimented by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 20 min, and pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The membrane suspension (20-μl aliquot containing 50-100 μg of membrane protein) was incubated in the presence of 100 μm nitrocefin in phosphate-buffered saline in a total volume of 200 μl; the incubation times were as indicated for the indicated periods at 37 °C. Absorption at 492 nm was measured using an automated plate reader. The comparisons were performed between the activities measured within linear range, before onset of substrate (nitrocefin) depletion. The results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. Molecular Graphics—The Swiss-PDBViewer was used to generate the molecular model of TM2 dimer. The sequence of GAT1 TM2 (AFLIPYFLTLIFAGVPLFLLECSL) was fitted onto the α-carbon backbone of the two GCN-4 (2ZTA) leucine zipper helices. The improbable side chain conformations were excluded by selection of allowed conformers following energy minimization of the whole structure by Swiss-PDBViewer implementation of GROMOS96. The derived model was rendered by POV-Ray 3.0. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The hydrophobic environment of the membrane does not provide any driving force for the assembly or stabilization of a leucine zipper (9Zhou F.X. Merianos H.J. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 10Gurezka R. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45580-45587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the amino acid residues of TM2 were examined for their ability to form hydrogen bonds and selected by sequence comparison between the members of the NSS family. For lack of structural information, we considered the TM2 region as the sequence between Ala81 and Leu104 (Fig. 1A); the leucine heptad repeat comprises residues Leu83-Leu104. We identified residues tyrosine 86 (Tyr86), threonine 89 (Thr89), glutamate 101 (Glu101), cysteine 102 (Cys102), and serine 103 (Ser103) as the candidates for site-directed mutagenesis (marked by the arrows in Fig. 1A). Side chains of each of these residues may participate in inter- or intrahelical interactions between transmembrane domains of polytopic proteins. Tyr86 and Glu101 are conserved in all members of the family including bacterial and archaeal transporters (three examples shown in Fig. 1A). This suggests similar or related functional roles in different transporters. Ser103 is present in close relatives of GAT1, namely glycine and proline transporters. The equivalent positions in TM2 of more distantly related transporters are predominantly occupied by alanine. Thr89 and Cys102 are present exclusively in GAT1. Thus, we searched for the hydrogen donor that may support oligomer formation by generating the following point-mutated versions of GAT1 (see also Fig. 1A); the Tyr86 residue was mutated to alanine (the smallest side chain, incapable of forming hydrogen bonds) and phenylalanine (lacking only the hydroxyl group when compared with tyrosine). Thr89 was substituted by alanine and phenylalanine (present in analogous positions of dopamine transporter, norepinephrin transporter, GAT2, GAT3, etc.). Glu101 was changed to alanine and aspartate (a charged residue one -CH2- group shorter than glutamate) and glutamine (devoid of charge but same size as glutamate). Cys102 and Ser103 were substituted by alanine residues. Transport of GABA by GAT1 Mutants—Cellular uptake assays showed that the mutated transporters were capable of transporting GABA with a high rate and that transport was blocked by the competitive inhibitor tiagabine. By definition, cellular uptake demonstrates that the transporters are expressed on the cell surface. When assayed at a low fixed concentration of [3H]GABA, the transport velocities of the mutants Y86F, C102A, and S103A were comparable with that of the fluorescently tagged wild type transporter (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, in saturation experiments, these mutants had Km values that were indistinguishable from those of wild type GAT1 (Table II). In contrast, substitutions of Thr89 by alanine and by phenylalanine progressively reduced the affinity for substrate (see Fig. 2A and Table II). The Km reflects the overall process of substrate transport (i.e. binding of substrate and the cosubstrates Na+ and Cl-, their translocation, and intracellular release). Because there is no suitable radioligand for GAT1 binding assays, it is not possible to determine substrate binding affinity directly. We probed the binding pocket of GAT1 indirectly by determining the IC50 of tiagabine for GAT1 at a very low substrate concentration. Under these conditions, differences in substrate affinity are irrelevant, and the IC50 approaches the Ki value of the inhibitor. As can be seen from Fig. 2B, mutation of Thr89 did not impair binding of the inhibitor regardless of whether threonine was substituted by alanine or by the bulky phenylalanine (see also Table II). These findings argue against a role of Thr89 in initial inhibitor recognition and binding but imply a role in translocation of the substrate.Table IIKm values for uptake of [3H]GABA uptake by wild type (WT) and mutated versions of GAT1 and IC50 values for tiagabine-induced inhibition thereofTM2 mutationKm (whole cell)aKm values were calculated from whole cell uptake experiments (performed as shown in Fig. 1A); the differences between wild type GAT1, T89A-GAT1, and T89F are statistically significant judged by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (n = 4-6).Km (vesicular uptake)bKm values were calculated from uptake assays in vesicular membrane preparations (n = 4).IC50 for tiagabineμMμMnMWT GAT14.2 ± 1.04.1 ± 0.6cKm was determined for intracellularly retained GAT1-Δ37.408 ± 26Y86A9.2 ± 3.0Y86F2.0 ± 0.4T89A17.6 ± 2.3233 ± 63T89F57.8 ± 15.0244 ± 91E101ANMdNM, not measurable.E101D1.6 ± 0.5E101QNMC102A3.0 ± 0.5S103A4.7 ± 0.9a Km values were calculated from whole cell uptake experiments (performed as shown in Fig. 1A); the differences between wild type GAT1, T89A-GAT1, and T89F are statistically significant judged by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test (n = 4-6).b Km values were calculated from uptake assays in vesicular membrane preparations (n = 4).c Km was determined for intracellularly retained GAT1-Δ37.d NM, not measurable. Open table in a new tab Y86A-GAT1 transported substrate with a significantly lower rate when compared with wild type GAT1 (second bar from left in Fig. 1B). In experiments performed with E101A, E101D, and E101Q-GAT1, the transport of [3H]GABA could barely be detected irrespective of the transfection method employed (calcium phosphate precipitation in Fig. 1B). This observation indicated that the mutated transporters were either not properly folded or failed to get inserted into the plasma membrane. We verified that all mutants were expressed by visualizing the transporters in living cells by means of fluorescence microscopy. Consistent with [3H]GABA uptake measurements, CFP-tagged GAT containing Y86F, T89A, T89F, C102A, and S103A substitutions were expressed at the surface of heterologously transfected HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1C). By contrast with wild type CFP-GAT1 (and the other mutants), there was little, if any, fluorescence recorded over the plasma membrane with Y86AGAT1, E101A-GAT1, E101D-GAT1, and E101Q-GAT1; these mutants were trapped within the cell. Transport of GABA by Intracellularly Retained GAT1 Mutants—The mutations Y86A, E101A, and E101D caused inefficient targeting of GAT1 to the plasma membrane of HEK-293 cells. This may have resulted from misfolding of these mutated transporters. To assess the conformational integrity of the mutants, we prepared membrane vesicles from appropriately transfected cells and measured vesicular [3H]GABA uptake. As an internal control, we used GAT1-Δ37, which lacks the last 37 amino acids. This truncated version is retained within the cell, because it lacks the docking sites for the coatomer protein II components, but it has a wild type transmembrane core and hence transports at normal rates (14Farhan H. Korkhov V.M. Paulitschke V. Dorostkar M.M. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28553-28563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The transporters were tagged with a fluorescent protein; this allowed us to correct for the variability in expression inherent in transient transfections by normalizing the transport velocity for recorded fluorescence. It is evident from Fig. 3A that Y86A-GAT1 transported [3H]GABA with a Km and a Vmax value that were reasonably similar to that of the wild type transporter. Likewise, E101DGAT1 translocated [3H]GABA with an apparent affinity that was within the range seen with GAT1-Δ37 (see Table II). In contrast, we failed to detect any measurable [3H]GABA influx with vesicles containing the other two Glu101 mutants (i.e. E101A-GAT1 and E101Q-GAT1). Thus, while we cannot rule out the possibility that the latter two mutants are misfolded, it is clear that Y86A-GAT1 and E101D-GAT1 adopt a conformation that binds and translocates substrate with an affinity that is only modestly different from that of the wild type transporter. In other words, retention of Y86A-GAT1 and of E101DGAT1 is unlikely to be due to misfolding.

This model also explains the dominant negative phenotype (i.e. familial postural hypotension) that results from a point mutation in one allele of the norepinephrine transporter (20Hahn M.K. Robertson D. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4470-4478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of Fig. 4, A and B, illustrates this phenomenon; cells were transfected with CFP-tagged GAT1-Δ37 (visualized in Fig. 4A) and YFP-tagged wild type GAT1 (visualized in Fig. 4B). In the cell that expressed GAT1-Δ37 (visualized in the left corner of Fig. 4A), the wild type transporter was trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in the cell that only expressed YFP-tagged GAT1, the transporter was found at the plasma membrane (top right corner of Fig. 4B). As mentioned earlier, GAT1-Δ37 is trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum, because it lacks the docking site for the coatomer protein II component Sec24 (14Farhan H. Korkhov V.M. Paulitschke V.

Thus, this approach can serve as a means to detect the capacity of mutant transporters to associate with wild type GAT1. It is evident that all Glu101-substituted GAT1 variants (Fig. 4, E, G, and I) did not impair cell surface targeting of the wild type transporter to any appreciable extent (Fig. 4, F, H, and J). In cells that expressed high levels of Y86A-GAT1 (cell on the left in Fig. 4C), there was some intracellular retention of wild type GAT1 (Fig. 4D); wild type GAT1 was, however, visualized predominantly at the cell surface in cells that expressed Y86A-GAT1 at moderate levels (exemplified by the cell on the right in Fig. 4, C and D). We interpret these observations as indicative of a reduced association of the Y86A mutant and the Glu101-substituted versions with the wild type transporter. Impaired Oligomerization of Intracellular GAT1 Mutants—The fact that the Y86A and Glu101 mutants were retained within the cell and failed to retain the wild type transporter in the endoplasmic reticulum provided circumstantial evidence for a defect in their ability to form oligomers. To directly visualize the oligomeric status of individual transporters in living cells, we performed FRET microscopy. FRET microscopy relies on the en"

Although the intracellular events that transmit NGF receptor signals to the nucleus have been widely characterized, relatively little is known regarding the mechanisms for recruitment of transcriptional coactivators/acetyltransferases (PCAF andhGCN5) to chromatin-remodeling complexes assembled on promoters of target genes in response to growth factor stimulation (24Kwok R.P.

Here we demonstrate that NGF receptor signaling induces phosphorylation and HAT domain-dependent nuclear translocation of PCAF and hGCN5 acetyltransferases. Our results suggest that signal-dependent HAT trafficking may increase the complexity of neuronal gene regulation and allude to a novel mechanism for ligand/receptor modulation of nuclear PCAF and hGCN5 interactions. Cell Culture and Transfections—Rodent pheochromocytoma cells, PC12 (CRL-1721, ATCC), were cultured at 37 °C under 10% CO2 in Ham's F-12K medium (ATCC), supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen) in culture flasks pre-coated with mouse type IV collagen (20 μg/ml, Roche Applied Science). For neuronal differentiation studies, PC12 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well on eight-chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International). Mouse nerve growth factor (10 ng/ml NGF, 2.5 S, grade II, Roche Applied Science) was added, and neurite outgrowth was monitored microscopically over 12 h. Transfections were carried out by seeding 6-well tissue culture plates with 2 × 105 cells per well (or 100-mm2 tissue culture dishes with 1 × 106 cells) and using a calcium-phosphate transfection system (Invitrogen) or SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). Following transfection, PC12 cells were treated with NGF (10 ng/ml) and incubated for an additional 12 h at 37 °C; cells were then harvested by shaking and lysed by freeze-thawing. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bradford microassay and spectrophotometric analyses at 595 nm. To measure p21WAF/CIP1 promoter activity in response to NGF stimulation, luciferase assays were performed on 50-μg total cellular proteins using a Berthold Lumat LB 9501 luminometer. Results shown are representative of duplicate or triplicate experiments. The CMV-FLAG-PCAF expression constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Nakatani (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School), and CMV-FLAG-MSK1 was generously provided by Dr. D. R. Alessi (MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit, University of Dundee). The p21WAF/CIP1 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. W. El-Deiry (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). Immunofluorescence Laser Confocal Microscopy—Subcellular colocalization and nuclear translocation studies were carried out by using a Leica TCS spectrophotometric confocal microscope equipped with argon/krypton lasers or by using a Nikon TE-2000U inverted microscope/C1 confocal system. Relative fluorescence intensities were quantified using Leica TCS software. PC12 cells were cultured on collagen-coated tissue culture slides in the presence of NGF (10 ng/ml). Slides were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min and washed three times with PBS, and nonspecific antigens were blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. A monoclonal antibody against p300 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and either a goat polyclonal antibody against PCAF or hGCN5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added, and slides were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The p53 protein was visualized using a monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). FLAG epitope-tagged PCAF (FLAG-PCAF) and FLAG-PCAFΔHAT were detected using a monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Following incubation, slides were washed twice with BLOTTO (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 0.2% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.02% w/v sodium azide, 5% w/v non-fat dry milk), and appropriate fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies were added (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunoprecipitations—For cellular fractionation studies, 3 × 106 PC12 cells were stimulated by NGF treatment (10 ng/ml), and nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by resuspending cells in 500 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and by addition of 500 μl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) IGEPAL-CA630 followed by passage through a 27.5-gauge tuberculin syringe. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in nuclear freezing buffer, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA. Alternatively, whole-cell extracts were prepared by lysing PC12 cells in 300 μl of RIPA buffer containing the following protease inhibitors: bestatin, pepstatin, antipain-dihydrochloride, chymostatin, leupeptin (50 ng/ml each, Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitations were carried out using antibodies against PCAF, hGCN5, or p53. Ten microliters of recombinant protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) were added to each sample, and reactions were incubated with agitation at 4 °C overnight. Matrices were pelleted by centrifugation at 6500 rpm for 5 min and washed twice with RIPA buffer. Samples were resuspended in 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and bound proteins were resolved by electrophoresis through 4-15% gradient or 12.5% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotting was performed to identify bound factors or detect post-translational modifications (phosphorylation and acetylation). In Vitro Phosphorylation of GST-PCAF-(351-832)—Five units of recombinant GST-PCAF-(351-832) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), containing the minimal acetyltransferase and bromo domains of PCAF or GST protein, were mixed with 20 μl of cytoplasmic extract prepared from unstimulated or NGF-stimulated (1, 3, 6, and 12 h) PC12 cells in 2.5 mm ATP, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in a 40-μl reaction volume and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Following incubation, 180 μl of PBS containing protease inhibitors and 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and GST pull-downs were performed. Matrices were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with 500 μl of PBS containing protease inhibitors. Recombinant GST-PCAF-(351-832) and GST were eluted in 50 μl of 10 mm reduced glutathione, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of GST-PCAF-(351-832) on Ser/Thr residues was determined by immunoblotting GST pull-down reaction products by using phospho-Ser- and phospho-Thr-specific monoclonal antibodies (Sigma). NGF Receptor Signaling Induces Nuclear Translocation of PCAF and Stabilizes PCAF-p300 Nuclear Complexes—PC12 cells were stimulated with NGF (10 ng/ml), and neuronal differentiation was followed microscopically over a 12-h time course. Neurite outgrowth and expansion of neuronal surface areas were evident within 3 h of neurotrophin stimulation (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy was performed to determine the subcellular distributions of transcriptional coactivators, PCAF and p300, in response to NGF receptor signaling. Most surprisingly, we found that NGF stimulation induces nuclear translocation of PCAF and promotes colocalization between PCAF-p300 in nuclei of differentiated cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether NGF signaling influences PCAF-p300 complexes, nuclear extracts were prepared from unstimulated or NGF-stimulated (1, 3, 6, and 12 h) PC12 cells. p300 proteins were immunoprecipitated, and bound PCAF was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-PCAF polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1C). Nuclear levels of PCAF were significantly increased following NGF stimulation, consistent with neurotrophin-responsive nuclear translocation (Fig. 1C). Nuclear concentrations of p300 were also increased following NGF stimulation. Lamin B is shown as a loading control for comparison between nuclear fractions. Neurotrophin stimulation stabilizes formation of PCAF-p300 nuclear complexes detectable by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 1C, lanes 6 and 12 h). Most importantly, these results suggest that NGF receptor signaling influences PCAF subcellular localization and nuclear interactions in neurons. NGF Stimulation Induces Nuclear Translocation of PCAF and hGCN5 Acetyltransferases—PCAF shares 80% amino acid sequence homology with the related acetyltransferase, hGCN5, within their conserved bromo-acetyltransferase domains and GCN5 (PCAF-b) functionally substitutes for PCAF in PCAF-/- knockout mice (45Yamauchi T. Yamauchi J. Kuwata T. Tamura T. Yamashita T. Bae N. Westphal H. Ozato K. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11303-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether NGF signaling induces nuclear translocation of hGCN5. Time course immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that PCAF is absent from the nucleoplasm of unstimulated cells, but enters the nuclei within 3 h of NGF stimulation coincident with the appearance of neurite extensions (Fig. 2A). Results in Fig. 2B demonstrate that hGCN5 is absent from the nucleoplasm of unstimulated cells, but enters the nuclei following 3 h of NGF stimulation and strongly colocalizes with nuclear p300 after 6-12 h (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate that neurotrophin receptor signaling modulates the subcellular distributions of PCAF and hGCN5 acetyltransferases. Neurotrophin Stimulation Induces Phosphorylation of PCAF and hGCN5 and Dissociates Transcriptional Coactivator/Protein-Phosphatase Complexes—Nerve growth factor stimulation activates intracellular signaling cascades, involving PI3K, MAPK/ERK 1/2, and Ca2+-dependent nuclear kinases (e.g. Rsk2pp90 and MSK-1/2) (1Kuruvilla R. Ye H. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 499-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12York R.D. Molliver D.C. Grewal S.S. Stenberg P.E. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell.

Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether chemical kinase inhibitors (wortmannin, SB 203580, and staurosporine) might influence NGF-responsive nuclear translocation of PCAF and colocalization between PCAF and p300. Results in Fig. 3A demonstrate that PCAF enters nuclei following 12 h of NGF stimulation. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, for 1 h prior to addition of NGF significantly prevents nuclear translocation of PCAF induced by NGF signaling (Fig. 3A). The chemical inhibitor, SB 203580, which inhibits p38 MAPK activation, had no effect upon PCAF nuclear translocation (Fig. 3, A and B). However, a broad specificity inhibitor of nuclear Ca2+-dependent kinases, staurosporine, prevents nuclear translocation of PCAF in response to neurotrophin stimulation (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that NGF stimulation transmits a signal that activates Ca2+-dependent kinases to promote nuclear translocation of PCAF. To determine whether NGF stimulation induces phosphorylation of PCAF, we immunoprecipitated PCAF from whole-cell extracts prepared from unstimulated or NGF-stimulated (1, 3, 6, and 2 h) cells. Phosphorylation of PCAF on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues was detected by immunoblotting precipitated PCAF proteins using monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize phospho-Ser, phospho-Thr, and phospho-Tyr (Sigma). As shown in Fig. 3C, PCAF became phosphorylated on Ser residues in response to NGF stimulation. Constitutive phosphorylation of PCAF on Thr and weak Tyr phosphorylation induced by NGF stimulation was also detected (Fig. 3C). In unstimulated cells, the PCAF transcriptional coactivator is present in immune complexes containing protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2a (Fig. 3C). Nerve growth factor receptor signaling promotes dissociation of PCAF-PP1/PP2a complexes coincident with NGF-induced Ser phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). We next investigated whether neurotrophin stimulation induces phosphorylation of hGCN5. The hGCN5 acetyltransferase was immunoprecipitated from whole-cell extracts prepared from unstimulated or NGF-treated PC12 cells and immunoblotted using phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies as described. Most interestingly, no Ser phosphorylation was observed, although constitutive Thr phosphorylation and weak NGF-responsive Tyr phosphorylation was detected following 6 h of NGF stimulation (Fig. 3C). In unstimulated cells, hGCN5 is present in immune complexes containing the SHP2 phosphatase, a tyrosine phosphatase important for neurogenesis (46Yamada M. Ohnishi H. Sano S. Araki T. Nakatani A. Ikeuchi T. Hatanaka H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nerve growth factor receptor signaling promotes dissociation of hGCN5-SHP2 complexes coincident with increased Tyr phosphorylation of hGCN5 (Fig. 3C). Our results indicate that NGF stimulation induces differential phosphorylation of PCAF and hGCN5 coincident with signal-dependent nuclear translocation. NGF Signaling Induces HAT Domain-dependent Nuclear Translocation of PCAF—To determine the roles of PI3K and Ca2+-dependent kinases during NGF-responsive nuclear translocation of PCAF, we transfected PC12 cells with plasmids expressing constitutively active Rsk2pp90 (HA epitope-tagged), MSK-1 (FLAG epitope-tagged) (20Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), or PI3K (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The subcellular localization of PCAF was determined by immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy, compared with cells transfected with an empty CβS vector. Results in Fig. 4A demonstrate that Ca2+-dependent kinases, Rsk2pp90 (HA) and MSK-1 (FLAG), were predominantly expressed in the nuclei of transfected cells. The localization of PCAF was almost exclusively nuclear in PC12 cells expressing constitutively active Rsk2pp90 (HA) or MSK-1 (FLAG). Similarly, ectopic PI3K induced nuclear translocation of PCAF consistent with its role during NGF receptor signaling (Fig. 4B) (1Kuruvilla R. Ye H. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2000; 27: 499-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12York R.D. Molliver D.C. Grewal S.S. Stenberg P.E. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8069-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Barlev et al. (47Barlev N.A. Poltoratsky V. Owen-Hughes T. Ying C. Liu L. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have shown previously that the hGCN5 bromo-HAT domain is phosphorylated by DNA-dependent protein kinase. We therefore tested whether the minimal bromo-HAT domain (residues 351-832) of PCAF is phosphorylated in response to NGF stimulation. Purified recombinant HAT-active GST-PCAF-(351-832) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or GST protein control was incubated with cytoplasmic extracts prepared from unstimulated or NGF-stimulated PC12 cells in in vitro kinase assays. Glutathione S-transferase pull-downs were performed to precipitate GST and GST-PCAF-(351-832) proteins. Input and recovered GST fusion protein levels from pull-down experiments are shown in Fig. 4D. Phosphorylation of GST-PCAF-(351-832) on Ser and Thr residues, as a result of incubation with NGF-stimulated cytoplasmic extracts, was determined by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies against phospho-Ser and phospho-Thr as described. Nerve growth factor signaling induces Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the PCAF-(351-832) minimal HAT domain (Fig. 4D). No modification of the GST control was detected (Fig. 4D). These results somewhat contrast our earlier findings in which constitutive Thr phosphorylation of full-length endogenous PCAF was observed (see Fig. 3C). The present data reveal NGF-responsive Thr phosphorylation of GST-PCAF-(351-832) and suggest that multiple Thr phosphorylation of full-length PCAF may have precluded detection of NGF-inducible effects or removal of the PCAF NH2 terminus (residues 1-350). Addition of the GST moiety could have altered the conformation of the protein to favor NGF-responsive Thr phosphorylation, although NGF-induced Ser phosphorylation was not significantly changed (compare Figs. 3C and 4D). Our results demonstrate that NGF stimulation induces Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the PCAF HAT domain, suggesting that residues within this region may be important for nuclear translocation in response to growth factor receptor signaling. As PCAF and hGCN5 share amino acid sequence homology within their bromo-HAT domains, we investigated whether NGF-responsive nuclear translocation of PCAF requires this conserved sequence (34Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 43Candau R. Zhou J.X. Allis C.D. Berger S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were transfected with CMV-FLAG-PCAF or CMV-FLAG-PCAFΔHAT, expressing FLAG epitope-tagged wild-type PCAF or a HAT domain deletion mutant (34Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 48Jiang H. Lu H. Schiltz R.L. Pise-Masison C.A. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Brady J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8136-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Subcellular localizations of FLAG-PCAF and FLAG-PCAFΔHAT were determined by immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy using a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG M2 epitope tag. Results in Fig. 4C demonstrate that FLAG-PCAF expression is absent from the nuclei of unstimulated transfected cells. Treatment with NGF for 12 h induces nuclear translocation of FLAG-PCAF, similar to endogenous PCAF (Fig. 4, left panel), but the FLAG-PCAFΔHAT mutant protein remained cytoplasmic following NGF stimulation (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that residues within the conserved HAT domain of PCAF are essential for nuclear translocation in response to NGF receptor signaling. NGF Signaling Induces p53K320Acetylation by PCAF and p53-dependent Transcription Associated with G1/S Arrest and Neuronal Differentiation—To determine the biological relevance of PCAF and hGCN5 nuclear translocation in neuronal cells, we investigated the effects of NGF stimulation upon p53-dependent transcription and p53K320 acetylation, which has been demonstrated to occur in vivo, depending upon the PCAF acetyltransferase (28Sakaguchi K.

Such expectations are sustained on the relatively simple mechanism of action of antimicrobial peptides that, in contrast to classical antibiotics, involves simple disruption of microbial plasma membranes rather than complex intracellular targets and pathways. For pathogens to develop resistance to membrane-acting peptides, substantial membrane redesign would be required, a non-affordable solution for most species. Following earlier studies on linear antimicrobial peptides (15Merrifield R.B. Juvvadi P. Andreu D. Ubach J. Boman A. Boman H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the first family of antimicrobial peptides for which in vitro activity against plant pathogens (18Fernandez de Caleya R.

Garcia-Olmedo F. Plant J. 1993; 3: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) were reported. Despite their early discovery, the potential of thionins and other plant antibiotic peptides (20García-Olmedo F. López-Fando J.J. Castagnaro A. Molina A. Hernández-Lucas C. Carbonero P. Boller T. Meins F. Genes Involved in Plant Defense.

Hancock R.E. Kay W.W. Misra S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) on peptide families isolated from mammals, amphibians or insects (bbcm.univ.trieste.it/~tossi/pag1.htm contains a complete collection of gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides). Thionins are basic, 45–47-residue long, highly folded, disulfide-rich peptides classified into five structural types on the basis of amino acid sequence and cysteine pairing (22García-Olmedo F. Molina A. Alamillo J.M. Rodríguez-Palenzuéla P. Pept. Sci. 1998; 47: 479-491Crossref Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Despite some inter-species diversity, all thionins share an almost identical folding pattern consisting of a short β-sheet and a pair of antiparallel α-helices connected through a β-turn (Fig. 1). Disulfide bonds play a crucial role in stabilizing thionin folding, providing a characteristic amphipathic distribution of residues that is thought to be responsible for their ability to strongly interact and disrupt microbial and model membranes (23Caaveiro J.M. Molina A. González-Mañas J.M. Rodríguez-Palenzuéla P. García-Olmedo F. Goñi F.M.

We describe here our search for a minimal active structure for the thionin from Pyrularia pubera (PpTH), 1The abbreviations used are: PpTH, Pyrularia pubera thionin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; Rink amide linker, 2,4-dimethoxy-4′-(carboxymethyloxy)-benzhydrylamine; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; Acm, acetamidomethyl; DMPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DMPG, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. a highly knotted peptide representative of this cysteine-stabilized family of membrane-active peptides. Our dissection of the native PpTH structure has led to several shortened versions, and eventually shown that the central antiparallel double helix of PpTH is fully active against representative plant pathogens. We have used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to show that the affinity of this mini-thionin for artificial membranes is comparable with that of the native peptide, and demonstrated that the ability to bind model membranes correlates with antimicrobial activity. Experiments with the SYTOX Green dye have shown that all active peptides permeabilize in a similar way the plasma membrane of the fungal plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. We also show that a well defined secondary structure, prior to membrane binding, is required for the peptide to display any relevant antimicrobial activity. Our results are discussed in the light of recent advances in the understanding of the mechanism of action of antimicrobial peptides. Fmoc-protected amino acids were purchased from Senn Chemicals (Dielsdorf, Switzerland). Polyethylene glycol-polystyrene resin was from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). p-Methylbenzhydrylamine resin and the 2,4-dimethoxy-4′-(carboxymethyloxy)-benzhydrylamine (Rink amide) linker were from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). 2-(1H-Benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate and N-hydroxybenzotriazole were from Albatross Chemicals (Montreal, Canada). HPLC-grade acetonitrile, peptide synthesis-grade N,N-dimethylformamide and trifluoroacetic acid were from SDS (Peypin, France). Other reagents were from Sigma. Bacterial pathogens Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus, strain C5, Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, and Rizhobium meliloti were from the ETSIA collection (Madrid, Spain), and the fungal plant pathogen F. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans, was a gift of Dr. M. L. G. Roncero (Cordoba University, Spain). Nutrient broth was from Oxoid (Basingstoke, UK) and potato dextrose from Difco (Detroit, MI). Analytical reversed-phase HPLC was done on a Shimadzu LC-2010A system using a Phenomenex Luna C8 column (3 μm, 0.46 × 5 cm). Separations were performed using a linear gradient (10–40%) of buffer B into buffer A over 15 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Buffer A was 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid in water. Buffer B was 0.036% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Preparative HPLC runs were performed on a Shimadzu LC-8A instrument using a Phenomenex Luna C8 column (10 μm, 2.1 × 25 cm) eluted with the above gradient over 60 min at a flow rate of 25 ml/min. Mass spectrometric analysis of peptides was performed on a Voyager DE-STR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using α-cyano-4′-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Four-disulfide Peptides—PpTH-(3–41) and PpTHR-(3–41) (Table I), with native-like folding pattern, were prepared as C-terminal carboxamides from a linear octathiol precursor assembled by Fmoc solid phase synthesis protocols (27Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar) on Rink amide-polyethylene glycol-polystyrene at 0.1-mmol scale in an Applied Biosystems 433A instrument. Side chain protections were tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Lys, Trp), tert-butyl (Ser, Asp, Glu), trityl (Asn, Cys), and 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Arg). Couplings were performed with 10 eq (1 mmol) each of Fmoc-amino acid 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate and N-hydroxybenzotriazole, in the presence of 20 eq of N,N-diisopropylethylamine in N,N-dimethylformamide. Total deprotection and cleavage from the solid support were done with trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/water/phenol/ethanedithiol (82.5:5: 5:5:2.5) for 3.5 h at room temperature. Peptides were isolated by precipitation with cold tert-butyl methyl ether and centrifugation, then taken up in 10% acetic acid and lyophilized. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC. Fractions containing >95% (by analytical HPLC) of the expected octathiol (by MALDI-TOF MS) were pooled, dissolved (argon atmosphere) to 5 μm in 0.1 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.8, and oxidatively folded as described (17Vila-Perello M. Sanchez-Vallet A. Garcia-Olmedo F. Molina A. Andreu D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in the presence of 1 m guanidinium chloride and reduced and oxidized glutathione (1:100:10 molar ratio of peptide:GSH:GSSG). After 8 h at 25 °C the major HPLC product gave a negative Ellman test upon which the reaction was quenched with trifluoroacetic acid (to pH 2) and the mixture purified by preparative HPLC and characterized as above. Two-disulfide Peptides—PpTH-(7–32) and PpTHR-(7–32) (Table I), two 26-residue analogues, were prepared by stepwise disulfide formation (28Andreu D. Nicolás E. Kates S.A. Albericio F. Solid-phase Synthesis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2000: 365-375Google Scholar) from linear precursors assembled by Fmoc solid phase methods on Rink amide-p-methylbenzhydrylamine resin as above, except that Cys residues (6Ganz T.

Sci. 1999; 24: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) corresponding to positions 12 and 31 of the native sequence were protected with the acetamidomethyl (Acm) group. Deprotection and cleavage from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/water/phenol/EDT (82.5:5:5:5:2.5, 2 h at room temperature) gave partially protected (Cys6,25(Acm)) derivatives that, after preparative HPLC purification, were dissolved at 15 μm concentration in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and stirred under air until oxidation was shown to be complete by both the Ellman test and MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the major HPLC peak. The solution was then made up to 15% acetic acid and the Acm groups were removed simultaneously with Cys oxidation by dropwise addition of 4 eq of iodine (freshly prepared 5 mm solution in methanol). HPLC analysis showed the oxidation to be complete after 10 min. The reaction mixture was treated with sodium thiosulfate to stop the oxidation and directly loaded onto a preparative HPLC column. Fractions containing >95% (by analytical HPLC) of the expected double disulfide products were pooled and further characterized by amino acid analysis and MALDI-TOF MS. Single Disulfide and Linear Peptides—PpTH-(24–32), PpTHR-(24–32), PpTH-(15–28), and PpTH-(7–19) (Table I) were assembled in a Syro multiple synthesizer (MultiSyntech, Witten, Germany) by Fmoc solid phase methods on Rink amide-p-methylbenzhydrylamine resin as above. PpTH-(15–28) peptide containing a Cys pair was deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid/water/triisopropylsilane/EDT (92.5:2.5:2.5:2.5, 2 h at room temperature), whereas for linear peptides trifluoroacetic acid/water/triisopropylsilane (95:2.5:2.5, 2 h at room temperature) was used. The dithiol precursor of PpTH-(15–28) was air-oxidized at 10 μm concentration in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.1, for 24 h. Oxidation was quenched by trifluoroacetic acid addition to pH 1.5–2. All peptides were purified by preparative HPLC to give products with amino acid analyses and MS consistent with theory. CD spectra in the 190–260-nm range were acquired on a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter purged with nitrogen (25 ml/min) and using a quartz 0.1-cm path length cell stabilized to ±0.1 °C of the desired temperature by a Peltier controller. Spectra of all peptides were recordered at 15 μm concentration in 25 mm phosphate, pH 6.0, in the absence and presence of small unilamellar vesicles of dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) at a peptide/lipid ratio of 1:100. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by dissolving dry DMPG in chloroform/methanol (2:1), removing the solvents in a rotary evaporator, and hydrating the residue (to 3 mm DMPG concentration) in 25 mm phosphate, pH 6.0, for 1 h at room temperature. The suspension was first mixed in a vortex shaker, then sonicated until clear. The antimicrobial tests were done in sterile 96-well microplates by mixing different amounts of the peptides dissolved in 66.7 μl of sterile water with 33.3 μl of bacterial suspension (final concentration 104 colony forming units/ml) in nutrient broth or TY medium (R. meliloti (29Beringer J.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1973; 84: 188-198Crossref Scopus (1646) Google Scholar)), or 33.3 μl of F. oxsyporum spore suspension (final concentration, 104 spores/ml) in potato dextrose. Microorganisms were incubated at 28 °C with periodic agitation and growth was recorded 24–48 h later by measuring absorbance at 490 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. For SYTOX green uptake different amounts of the peptides dissolved in 25 μl of sterile water were mixed with 12.5 μl of F. oxsyporum spore suspension (final concentration 2 × 104 spores/ml) in potato dextrose, the microplate was incubated at 28 °C for 6 h, and 0.75 μl of SYTOX Green (0.2 μm final concentration) was added to the wells. After 18 h of additional incubation fungal hyphae fluorescence was viewed with a microscope (Zeiss AxioPhot, Germany) equipped with a B-2A filter set for fluorescence detection (excitation wave-length, 450–490 nm; emission wavelength, 520 nm). Light and fluorescence microscopic images were taken with a video camera (SPOT33, Diagnostic Instrument Inc.) and analyzed using the SPOT33 2.2 software. Measurements were carried out on a BIAcore 3000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) using a L1 sensor chip with a carboxymethylated dextran matrix modified with lipophilic units to capture lipid bilayer vesicles. Phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.8, was used as running buffer and regeneration and washing solutions were 10 mm NaOH and 40 mmN-octyl-β-glucopyranoside, respectively. All solutions were freshly made, degassed, and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. Large unilamellar vesicles (100 nm) with a 3:1 DMPC/DMPG ratio were prepared by dissolving the dry lipids in chloroform/methanol (2:1). After solvent removal by rotary evaporation, the lipids were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.8, by sonication, and liposomes of the desired size were obtained by sequentially extruding the resultant emulsion through 0.8-, 0.4-, 0.2-, and 0.1-μm filters (5 passages through each filter). Prior to immobilization of the DMPC/DMPG large unilamellar vesicles on the L1 chip, an injection of 25 μl of 40 mmN-octyl-β-glucopyranoside at 5 μl/min flow rate was performed to clean the surface. Liposomes were applied to the sensor surface at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Between each liposome injection, a 10 mm NaOH pulse was applied to remove multilamellar structures. Once the desired immobilization level (above 5000 response units) was reached, the active surface was stabilized by repeated injections of 10 mm NaOH and buffer until a stable baseline was obtained. Further details are provided as Supplementary Materials. Peptides were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at concentrations in the 5–100 μm range and injected (40 μl) at 10 μl/min flow rate on the liposome-loaded sensor chip. Peptide solution was next replaced by running buffer and the peptide-bilayer complex was allowed to dissociate for 5 min. Because peptides bind very tightly to the liposomes, no complete regeneration of the active surface was possible in this way and full removal of the immobilized bilayer had to be achieved by pulsing with 10 mm NaOH and 10 mm HCl (50 μl each) followed by a 30-μl wash with 40 mmN-octyl-β-glucopyranoside at 5 μl/min flow rate. Sensorgrams for each peptide-lipid interaction were analyzed by curve fitting using numerical integration algorithms in the BIAevaluation 3.0 software package. Recorded sensorgrams at seven different concentrations were globally fitted using a two-state binding model, as poorer fitting was obtained using simpler models (e.g. 1:1 Langmuir binding). Equations used in the fitting process are detailed under Supplementary Materials. Peptide Design and Synthesis—To elucidate which structural motifs are responsible for the antimicrobial activity of PpTH (Fig. 1), several peptides reproducing different regions were designed (Table I). PpTH-(3–41) is a shortened version of PpTH, with both N- and C-terminal deletions but preserving the four disulfide arrangement. PpTHR-(3–41) is a PpTH-(3–41) analogue where the Asp32 residue is mutated to Arg, a modification shown to significantly enhance the antimicrobial activity of full-length PpTH against Gram-negative bacteria (17Vila-Perello M. Sanchez-Vallet A. Garcia-Olmedo F. Molina A. Andreu D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Other peptides were meant to reproduce secondary structure elements such as each one of the helical segments (PpTH-(7–19) and PpTH-(24–32)), the intervening loop (PpTH (15–28)), or the double antiparallel α-helix motif (PpTH-(7–32)), which given its amphipathic character, might be a key feature for antimicrobial activity. For all analogues containing the Asp residue at position 32 of the native sequence, the corresponding Arg replacement analogue was also synthesized to explore whether the positive effect of this mutation was maintained throughout the series. Disulfide pairings corresponding to native PpTH were preserved in all peptides except PpTH-(7–32)b, where the alternative connectivity was explored to evaluate the importance of disulfide bridges for the secondary structure and activity of this particular structure. For the four-disulfide peptides, PpTH-(3–41) and PpTHR-(3–41), synthesis and folding protocols previously developed for full-length thionins (17Vila-Perello M. Sanchez-Vallet A. Garcia-Olmedo F. Molina A. Andreu D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were successfully adapted. The oxidation reaction was remarkably clean, allowing for combined folding-purification yields in the 30% range. The folded peptides had the expected amino acid compositions and molecular masses 8.0 Da less than their octathiol precursors (Table I). Attempts to synthesize the double-disulfide PpTH-(7–32) by a similar oxidative folding procedure led to a mixture where a misfolded analogue, PpTH-(7–32)b (see Table I), predominated over the expected product. PpTH-(7–32) was more efficiently accessible by a two-step strategy of directed disulfide formation (28Andreu D. Nicolás E. Kates S.A. Albericio F. Solid-phase Synthesis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2000: 365-375Google Scholar, 30Hackeng T.M. Dawson P.E. Kent S.B. Griffin J.H. Biopolymers. 1998; 46: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) where Cys6 and Cys25 and Cys10 and Cys21 were, respectively, protected with the Acm and trityl groups (Fig. 2). The Cys10-Cys21 disulfide bridge was generated practically quantitatively by air oxidation at pH 8.0 and followed by iodolytic removal of the two Acm groups and concomitant formation of the second disulfide bond under mild conditions at room temperature. An entirely analogous approach was used to prepare the Arg replacement analogue PpTHR-(7–32). Following preparative HPLC purification, both peptides and the mis-folded PpTH-(7–32)b analogue were satisfactorily characterized by amino acid analysis and MS (Table I), and their disulfide connectivity corroborated by tryptic digestion of the folded peptides and MS analysis of the fragments (see Supplementary Materials). The remaining peptides (single disulfide PpTH-(15–28), and linear PpTH-(7–19) and PpTH-(24–32)) were prepared by standard Fmoc solid phase synthesis methods (27Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—CD spectra of PpTH-(3–41), PpTH-(7–32) and their Arg32 analogues PpTHR-(3–41) and PpTHR-(7–32) in aqueous solution were almost identical to those of native PpTH and consistent with a mainly α-helical structure coexisting with some levels of β-type structure. Upon binding to anionic DMPG liposomes, the global pattern of CD signatures was maintained, with slight decreases in helical content for the larger PpTH-(3–41) and PpTHR-(3–41) peptides, whereas the smaller PpTH-(7–32) and PpTHR-(7–32) reinforced their helical character (Fig. 3, Table II). Temperature studies for these four peptides in the 5–85 °C range showed the helical pattern mostly preserved throughout the interval, as for native thionin (17Vila-Perello M. Sanchez-Vallet A. Garcia-Olmedo F. Molina A. Andreu D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (see Supplementary Materials). At elevated temperatures slight decreases in helical content were detected; globally, the temperature dependence pattern of molar ellipticity at 207 nm fitted with a non-cooperative thermal unfolding pathway.Table IIα-Helical percentage, in buffer and in the presence of SUV, of all studied PpTH peptidesα-Helixa% α-Helix estimated by the Yang equations (31, 32)In bufferb15 μm peptide, 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0Bound to SUVc15 μm peptide in the presence of DMPG liposomes (1:100 peptide/lipid ratio), 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0PpTH53.353.3PpTH-(3–41)43.937PpTHR-(3–41)49.640.5PpTH-(7–32)65.468.3PpTH-(7–32)bRCdRC, ramdom coil conformation19.9PpTHR-(7–32)68.278.8PpTH-(7–19)RCRCPpTH-(24–32)RCRCPpTHR-(24–32)RCRCPpTH-(15–28)RC17.6a % α-Helix estimated by the Yang equations (31Chen Y-H.

Interestingly, PpTH-(15–28) and PpTH-(7–32)b peptides exhibited an intermediate behavior, with no preferred conformation in aqueous solution but adopting a certain level (about 20%) of helicity on binding to negatively charged liposomes. Antimicrobial and Permeabilizing Activity—In vitro activities of the synthetic peptides against one Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria, and a fungal plant pathogen are shown in Table III. As previously described (17Vila-Perello M. Sanchez-Vallet A. Garcia-Olmedo F. Molina A. Andreu D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) PpTHR was significantly more active than PpTH against the Gram-negative bacteria, whereas activity against the Gram-positive organism and the fungus were comparable. The shortened PpTH-(3–41) and PpTHR-(3–41) analogues were undistinguishable from their full-size counterparts in activity against Clavibacter and Rhizobium but slightly less active against Fusarium and Xanthomonas. Again, the Arg32 substitution increased activity against all Gram-negative bacteria. Substantially shorter PpTH-(7–32) and PpTHR-(7–32) peptides were only slightly less active than the full-length parent structures against the pathogens tested, whereas the misfolded PpTH-(7–32)b was completely inactive against Gram-negative and fungal pathogens and marginally active against Gram-positive bacteria. The remaining peptides did not inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria nor F. oxysporum and only PpTHR-(24–32) and PpTH-(7–19) were slightly active against C. michiganensis.Table IIIInhibition of bacterial and fungal plant pathogen growth by PpTH peptidesPeptidebNamed according to Table 1EC50 (μm)aEffective concentration for 50% inhibition (mean of three experiments ± S.D.)Gram"

Taken together, these results provide unanticipated insights into the functions of the pseudoknots and protein SmpB during tmRNA folding, maturation, and protein synthesis. An interruption of the elongation step of protein synthesis results in the production of truncated proteins and leaves ribosomes stalled at the 3′ end of mRNA templates lacking a stop codon(s). To remove the defective polypeptides and recycle the ribosomes, bacteria have developed trans-translation, a quality control mechanism that tags the C termini of defective proteins with a short peptide recognized by housekeeping proteases. This peptide tag is encoded by a short open reading frame present in a small stable RNA molecule called 10Sa or transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA). 1The abbreviations used are: tmRNA, transfer-messenger RNA; TLD, tRNA-like domain; MLD, mRNA-like domain; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Ni-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. It has been shown that in addition to protein tagging, tmRNA facilitates the recycling of ribosomes by providing missing stop codons (1Tu G.F. Reid G.E. Zhang J.G. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9322-9326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 2Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Structure probing of the Escherichia coli tmRNA and sequence comparisons demonstrated the presence of three domains (Fig. 1A) (3Williams K.P. Bartel D.P. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 1306-1310PubMed Google Scholar, 4Felden B. Himeno H. Muto A. McCutcheon J.P. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 89-103PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zwieb C. Wower I.K. Wower J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2063-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The 3′ and 5′ termini of the tmRNA form the tRNA-like domain (TLD) with a significantly reduced D arm. The resume codon and stop codon(s) demarcate the open reading frame in the mRNA-like domain (MLD). The TLD and the MLD are connected by a pseudoknot-rich domain consisting of four pseudoknots (pk1 to pk4) in most tmRNAs. The three-dimensional model of E. coli tmRNA suggests a structure in which the TLD is connected to the circularly arranged MLD and pseudoknots through coaxially stacked helices (6Zwieb C. Muller F. Wower J. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1999; 41: 200-204Google Scholar). Recently, the entry of tmRNA into a stalled E. coli ribosome has been visualized by cryo-electron microscopy (7Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishman V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). At this particular step of trans-translation, the TLD, pk1, and the MLD contact the ribosome, whereas the pk2 to pk4 segment forms an arc that remains outside the ribosome. Three proteins facilitate binding of tmRNA to the ribosome. Elongation factor Tu forms a ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tmRNA, as in regular protein synthesis (8Rudinger-Thirion J. Giege R. Felden B. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Barends S. Wower J. Kraal B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2652-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Protein SmpB binds to the ternary complex in vitro as well as to stalled ribosomes in vivo (10Barends S. Karzai A.W. Sauer R.T. Wower J. Kraal B. J. Mol.

Pavlov M. Ehrenberg M. Felden B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Ribosomal protein S1 contacts the MLD and the pseudoknot-rich domain both on and off the ribosome (13Wower I.K. Zwieb C.W. Guven S.A. Wower J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6612-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although pseudoknots are predominant tmRNA features, little is known about their contributions to tmRNA structure and function. Previous in vitro experiments suggested that pk1 is essential for tmRNA folding and protein tagging, whereas the three remaining pseudoknots, pk2 through pk4, are interchangeable and replaceable with stretches of single-stranded RNA (14Nameki N. Chattopadhyay P. Himeno H. Muto A. Kawai G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15Nameki N. Felden B. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Himeno H. Muto A. J.

However, these data were derived exclusively using an insensitive assay in which poly(U)-programmed ribosomes produce hydrophobic polypeptides (polyphenylalanine) that are inefficiently tagged and because of their heterogeneity are difficult to analyze qualitatively. To understand how tmRNA facilitates the tagging of truncated proteins, we investigated the contributions of the pseudoknots pk2 to pk4 and protein SmpB. The key to achieving our goals was development of two exceptionally sensitive assays for testing the functionality of tmRNA in vivo and in vitro. A truncated ribosomal protein, L27, produced by ribosomes programmed with mRNA lacking stop codons, was tagged with a protease-resistant histidine-rich peptide in the presence or absence of protein SmpB. A stable fusion protein was easily detected in fractionated E. coli lysates either by staining with Coomassie Blue or by using anti-His-tag antibodies. We found that disrupting pseudoknots pk2 to pk4 had differential effects not only on tmRNA tagging activity and on binding of ribosomal protein S1 to tmRNA but also on tmRNA maturation. Taken together, these results indicated that pk2, pk3, and pk4 are important for the proper overall folding of the tmRNA. The ability of SmpB to reverse certain defects in tmRNA processing suggests that this protein plays a hitherto undiscovered regulatory role in trans-translation. Bacterial Strains—E. coli strain XL1-B was the host for purification and maintenance of new plasmids. Expression strains IW410 and IW363 were constructed by P1 transduction of gene ssrA deletion from W3110ΔssrA::kanr into BL21(DE3) and BL21(DE3)/pLysS, respectively (17Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Primers—Oligodeoxyribonucleotides used for constructions of plasmids and mutagenesis of the rpmA and ssrA genes were as follows: PR1, 5′-GACAGCTTATCATCGATAAGCTTTAATGCG-GTCCGACACAAATGTTGCC-3′; PR2, 5′-GATGCCGGCCACGATGCGTCCGGCGTAGAG-GATCCCGTTGGGCCTATCAATG-3′; PR3, 5′-GGTCGCGGATCCGCACATAAAAAGGCTG-GC-3′; PR4, 5′-TTATTGCTCAGCAAAAAAAGCCCGCTCATTAGGCGGGCTGCTTCGATGCTGATAAATTT-3′; PR5, 5′-GAGTGGACTCCAGAATCC-3′; PR6, 5′-TAGTTCTCTTCG-GACTTCG-3′; PR7, 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGTTATTCAGCTTCGATGCTG-3′; PR8, 5′-GCAGGTTATTAATGATGATGATGGTGGTGTTCGTCGTTTGCGACTATTTTTTGC-3′; PR9, 5′-GTTGGCCTCGTAAAAAGC-3; PR10, 5′-GCAGGTTATTAATGATGATGATGGTGGTGATGGTGGTTTGCGACTATTTTTTGC-3′; PR11, 5′-GCAGGTTATTAATGATGATGATGGTGGTGATGGTGGTTTGCGACTATTTTTTGC-3′; PR11, 5′-GTTGGCCTCGTAAAAAGC-3; PR12, 5′-GAGGCTAGGGAGAGAGGCATCATACATCGTTATTAATGATGATGATGGTG-3′; PR13, 5′-GACGGACACGCCACTAACAAACTACATCATACATCGTTATTAATGATGATG-3′; PR14, 5′-CTACATCCTCGGTACTACATGCTTAGATCTCTTTTGGGTTTGACCTCTC-3′; PR15, 5′-CTACATCCTCGGTACTACATGCTTAGGCATCATACATCGTTATTAATGATG-3′; PR16, 5′-CAGGGCTTCCACGCGATCTCTTAGGCTAGGGAGAGAGGCATCATAC-3′; PR17, 5′-CACGCCACTAACAAACTAGCCTGAGGCTTCCACGCGATCTCTTTTGG-3′; PR18, 5′-TCGGTACTACATGCTTAGTCAGTCCGCCACTAACAAACTAGCCTGATT-3′; PR19, 5′-GAGGCTTCCACGCGATCTCTTAGGCTAGGGAGAGAGGCATC3′; PR20, 5′-GGTACTACATGCTTAGTCAGTCCGCCACTAACAAACTAGCCTG-3′; PR21, 5′-CAGGGCTTCCACGCGATCTCTTAGGCTAGGGAGAGAGGCATCATAC-3′. Construction of Plasmids—The two-step PCR cloning method described by Chen et al. (18Chen G.J. Qiu N. Karrer C. Caspers P. Page M.G. Biotechniques. 2000; 28: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was used. Plasmid pACssrA(camr) was constructed by cloning of the E. coli ssrA gene with its flanking regions (133 bp upstream and 157 bp downstream) from E. coli K12 genomic DNA into plasmid pACYC184. The DNA segment was amplified using PR1 and PR2, digested with HindIII and BamHI and inserted into the pACYC184 vector. Plasmid pETrpmA-At-1 contained the E. coli rpmA gene in which the stop codon was replaced with the trpA terminator sequence (19MacDonald L.E. Zhou Y. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1030-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To construct this plasmid, the rpmA gene obtained from plasmid pETrpmA was amplified using PR3 and PR4 and cloned into pET-23a (see Fig. 2A) (20Maguire B.A. Manuilov A.V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6565-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Plasmid pETrpmA-At-2 was a derivative of pETrpmA-At-1 into which the ssrA gene with its flanking regions (133 bp upstream and 157 bp downstream) was inserted. A PCR fragment containing the ssrA gene was cloned into the PvuII site in pETrpmA-At-1. Plasmid pETrpmA-At-3 was prepared by inserting the smpB gene upstream of the ssrA gene in plasmid pETrpmA-At-2 to obtain their chromosomal configuration. Primers PR5 and PR6 were used to amplify the insert. Mutagenesis—To replace the rpmA-trpAt gene with wild-type rpmA sequence in plasmid pETrpmA-At-3, mutagenic primer PR7 was used. The resulting plasmid pETrpmA-3 was suitable for expression of protein T7-L27 in vivo. For replacing the sequence encoding the proteolytic peptide ANDENYALAA with a sequence encoding ANDEHHHHHH (H6 tag) in E. coli ssrA gene in all pETrpmA-type plasmids, PCR-directed mutagenesis was carried out with PR8 and PR9. Similarly, for the replacement with ANHHHHHHHH (H8 tag), PCR-directed mutagenesis was carried out with PR10 and PR11. The base pairing in helix 5 of tmRNA(H6) and tmRNA(H8) was restored using PCR-directed mutagenesis with PR12. The resulting mutant ssrA genes encoded tmRNA(H6hp) and tmRNA(H8hp). TmRNAs lacking pseudoknots or containing disrupted pseudoknots were introduced into plasmids pETrpmA-At-2 and pETrpmA-At-3 carrying mutant ssrA gene encoding tmRNA(H8hp). Primers used were as follows: PR13, Δpk2/pk3 (residues 138–245 deleted); PR14, Δpk3/pk4 (residues 200–299 deleted); PR15, Δpk2-pk4 (residues 140–299 deleted); PR16, pK2L (residues 154–191 deleted); PR17, pK3L (residues 211–239 deleted); PR18, pk4L (residues 262–292 deleted); PR19 (and template with pk3L mutation), pk2/3L (residues 154–191/211–239 deleted); PR20 (and template with pk3L mutation), pk3/4L (residues 211–239/262–292 deleted); PR21 (and template with pk3/4L mutation), pk2–4L (residues 154–191/211–239/262–292 deleted). For the in vitro tagging experiments, the ssrA gene in plasmid ptmR was replaced with its derivative encoding tmRNA(H8hp) (13Wower I.K. Zwieb C.W. Guven S.A. Wower J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6612-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All deletion mutations listed above were re-cloned into plasmid ptmRH8hp using restriction enzymes SphI and PvuII. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. In Vitro RNA Synthesis and Analysis—tmRNAs were transcribed in vitro, purified, 32P-labeled, aminoacylated, and tested for binding to protein S1 as described earlier (13Wower I.K. Zwieb C.W. Guven S.A. Wower J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6612-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Wower J. Zwieb C.W. Hoffman D.W. Wower I.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8826-8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). [35S]-Labeling of Proteins in Vivo—Proteins were labeled with [35S]Met as described (22Wower I. Kowaleski M.P. Sears L.E. Zimmermann R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1213-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Tagging in Vivo—In initial in vivo tagging experiments the rpmA and ssrA genes were expressed simultaneously from the plasmids pETrpmA-At-1 and pACssrA in E. coli strains BL21(DE3) and IW410. Most of the in vivo tagging experiments were performed in E. coli IW363 cells transformed with either pETrpmA-At-2 or pETrpmA-At-3. Freshly transformed cells were grown at 37 °C for 2 h in 2×YT broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin, 50 μl/ml; chloramphenicol, 30 μl/ml; ampicillin, 200 μl/ml) to 0.3–0.4 A600. Cultures were diluted to an A600 of 0.05 and incubated in the absence or presence of 1 mm IPTG for 3 h. 1-ml aliquots of each cell culture were collected for RNA and protein analysis. Cells were lysed and fractionated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (23Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. When tagging was inefficient, tagged proteins were purified using Ni-NTA-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's procedure (Qiagen), fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and visualized by Western blotting with anti-His-tag antibodies, as suggested by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Protein Tagging in Vitro—Tagging in vitro was performed with the E. coli T7 transcription/translation system for circular DNA following the instructions provided by Promega. A typical 20-μl sample contained 2 μg of plasmid pETrpmA-At-1, 20 pmol/μl of purified tmRNA transcript, and 20 pmol/μl of purified protein SmpB-H6 (25Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Tagged proteins were purified on Ni-NTA-Sepharose using the denaturing conditions recommended by Qiagen, resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Tagged proteins were identified with anti-His-tag monoclonal antibodies from Qiagen and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. followed by detection with an ECL-Plus Western blotting system from Amersham Biosciences. Northern Blotting—Total RNA was purified using the RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen). RNA samples (1.0 μg) were fractionated on a 5% Tris-buffered EDTA-urea polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad). Blots were probed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 5′-CGAGGCCAACCGCCC-3′ complementary to E. coli tmRNA residues 54–67 in OligoUltrahyb solution (Ambion). Hybridization signals were quantified using a Typhoon PhosphorImager and ImageQuant Version 5.2 software (Amersham Biosciences). Monitoring tmRNA-dependent Tagging of Truncated Proteins in Vitro—Ribosomal protein L27, encoded by the rpmA gene, can be overexpressed in E. coli without detrimental effects (24Wower I.K. Wower J. Zimmermann R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19847-19852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, a truncated L27 encoded by mRNA lacking a stop codon(s) was expected to be suitable for studying tmRNA-dependent tagging in cell lysates by detection of polypeptides using SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Stable expression of tagged L27 was assured by replacing the ANDENYALAA proteolysis tag with a protease-resistant peptide. We chose a string of six or eight histidines (His tag) to allow the isolation and optional detection of even minute quantities of the tagged fusion protein by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA-Sepharose and anti-His-tag antibodies, respectively. The main components of the in vivo assay are the three plasmids, pETrpmA-At-1, -2, and -3 (Fig. 2A), which direct the expression of truncated L27 either in the presence or absence of tmRNA and protein SmpB. Plasmid pETrpmA-At-1 was constructed by deleting the His-tag-encoding segment from pET-23a (Novagen) followed by inserting a modified rpmA gene under control of the T7 promoter. The 5′ end of the rpmA gene was fused to the T7-tag, a DNA segment that encodes the N-terminal segment of the T7 major capsid protein. The stop codon of the rpmA gene was replaced with trpAt, an efficient trpA terminator (19MacDonald L.E. Zhou Y. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1030-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These manipulations yielded T7-rpmA-At, a modified rpmA gene encoding T7-L27-At, a 11,226-Da polypeptide consisting of 105 amino acids. T7-L27-At, when tagged by the tmRNA mutants with the protease-resistant ANDEHHHHHH (H6 tag) or AANHHHHHHHH (H8 tag) (see Fig. 1B), produced the 116-amino acid long proteins T7-L27-H6 (Mr 12,444) or T7-L27-H8 (Mr 12,474 Da). Because T7-L27-At and its tagged derivative can be separated by SDS-PAGE, tagging is easily monitored (Fig. 2C). Expression of protein T7-L27-At in IW410, an E. coli strain lacking the ssrA gene, was prominent (Fig. 3). In contrast, in the ssrA gene-containing BL21(DE3) strain, T7-L27-At was degraded, demonstrating that this protein is suitable for monitoring tmRNA-directed tagging. To prevent the degradation of tagged T7-L27-At, we constructed tmRNA(H6) and tmRNA(H8), encoding protease-resistant H6 and H8 tags (Fig. 1B). The alterations were introduced into plasmid pACssrA where the ssrA gene is under control of its own promoter. As shown in Fig. 4, tmRNA(H8) was expressed less efficiently than the wild-type tmRNA. A similarly reduced level of expression was observed for tmRNA(H6) (not shown). We attribute this effect to the disruption of base pairing in helix 5 because higher expression levels were observed with wild-type tmRNA and tmRNA(H8hp) in which helix 5 is restored (see Fig. 1B). The mechanism for how the disruption of helix 5 reduces the expression of the tmRNA(H6/H8)-encoded peptides remains to be resolved. To tag T7-L27-At in vivo, E. coli IW410 cells were transformed simultaneously with pETrpmA-At-1 and derivatives of pACssrA encoding either wild-type tmRNA or tmRNA(H6/H8). The synthesis of truncated L27 was induced in logarithmically growing cells by the addition of IPTG. Cells continued to grow for 3 h, and their protein content was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 5, similar sets of proteins were apparent in uninduced and induced cells, indicating that the truncated L27 was tagged by plasmid-borne wild-type tmRNA and then proteolytically degraded. In contrast, a prominent band corresponding to T7-L27-At was visible in lysates of the IPTG-induced cells expressing either tmRNA(H6) or tmRNA(H8). Using Coomassie Blue staining, tagged proteins could not be detected. To demonstrate that tmRNA(H6) and tmRNA(H8) were able to tag in vivo, it was necessary to use 35S-labeled T7-L27-At, affinity chromatography, and anti-His-tag antibodies. IW410 cells were transformed simultaneously with plasmids pETrpmA-At-1 and pACssrA and treated with IPTG in a medium containing [35S]Met as described (26Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Tadaki M. Inokuchi H. Himeno H. Muto A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1620-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled, His-tagged T7-L27-At proteins were captured on Ni-NTA-Sepharose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein T7-L27-At was tagged very poorly by tmRNA(H6) and tmRNA(H8) (see Fig. 6). Northern blot analysis revealed that a substantial portion of the mutant tmRNAs was not processed (Fig. 7) and was likely to account for some of the observed poor tagging of protein T7-L27-At.Fig. 7Maturation of wild-type tmRNA, tmRNA(H6), and tmRNA(H8) expressed from plasmid pETrpmA-At-2. Northern blot analysis of 1 μg of total RNA extracted from un-induced and IPTG-induced E. coli IW363 cells separated on a 1.5% formamide-agarose gel and blotted to a Zeta-probe membrane. 32P-Labeled oligonucleotide TM4 was hybridized to both precursor tmRNA (p-tmRNA) and mature tmRNA. Δ, no tmRNA; H6, H8, and wt denote tmRNA(H6), tmRNA(H8), and wild-type tmRNA, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) E. coli strains BL21(DE3) and IW410, when transformed simultaneously with plasmids pETrpmA-At-1 and pACssrA, displayed an undesirable variability in their protein expression profiles (not shown). To increase the reproducibility of these experiments, we inserted the ssrA gene into plasmid pETrpmA-At-1 to form pETrpmA-At-2 (Fig. 2A). Because the rmpA and ssrA genes were part of the same molecule, their products were expected to be expressed at a constant ratio. To increase the expression levels of tmRNA(H6) and tmRNA(H8), base pairing in helix 5 was restored by introducing compensatory mutations (see Fig. 1B). These modifications resulted in tmRNA(H6hp) and tmRNA(H8hp), which expressed as efficiently as wild-type tmRNA (not shown). Precursors of tmRNA(H6hp) and tmRNA(H8hp) were trimmed to their mature form as efficiently as the precursors of wild-type tmRNA (compare Figs. 7 and 15). Tagging of protein T7-L27-At by tmRNA(H6hp) and tmRNA(H8hp) was tested in IW363, a derivative of E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS lacking the ssrA gene. As shown in Fig. 8A, inserting the ssrA and T7-rpmA-At genes into a single plasmid and restoring helix 5 in tmRNA(H6hp) and tmRNA(H8hp) improved the tagging efficiency of protein T7-L27-At to a level that allowed the detection of the fusion protein by Coomassie Blue staining. Effective His-tagging of protein T7-L27-At was confirmed by its capture on Ni-NTA-Sepharose and the use of anti-His-tag antibodies (Fig. 8B). Both tmRNA(H6hp) and tmRNA(H8hp) tagged protein T7-L27-At efficiently. Together, these findings demonstrated that, at least in E. coli, the disruption of helix 5 inhibits maturation of precursor tmRNAs and tmRNA-dependent tagging. Therefore, helix 5 constitutes a functionally important element of tmRNA structure and function. Monitoring tmRNA-dependent Tagging of Truncated Proteins in Vitro—As shown above, certain alterations in tmRNA affected tmRNA-dependent protein tagging by preventing the processing of tmRNA precursors. To differentiate between defects in protein tagging and tmRNA maturation, we developed an in vitro assay that employed plasmids pT7tmRNAH8hp and pETrpmA-At-1. pT7tmRNAH8hp linearized with restriction enzyme BstNI provided a template suitable for in vitro synthesis of tmRNA(H8hp) by T7 RNA polymerase. pETrpmA-At-1, when added to an in vitro transcription/translation system, was used for the synthesis of stop-free mRNA encoding truncated protein L27. Although the in vitro tagging of truncated protein L27 by tmRNA(H8hp) was less efficient than the in vivo reaction, formation of the fusion protein could be easily monitored by fractionation of the reaction products on SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by Western blotting with anti-His-tag antibodies. During the optimization of the in vitro protein tagging assay, we found that in addition to plasmids pETrpmA-At-1 and tmRNA(H8hp), the transcription/translation reactions had to be supplemented with protein SmpB (Fig. 9). The most efficient tagging was observed when tmRNA(H8hp) and protein SmpB were provided in equimolar quantities. This finding was consistent with the earlier demonstration that protein SmpB is an essential component of the trans-translational apparatus in vitro (25Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 26Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Tadaki M. Inokuchi H. Himeno H. Muto A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1620-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Functions of Pseudoknots in tmRNA-dependent Protein Tagging—TLD and MLD are mimics of tRNA and mRNA, respectively, and function in trans-translation as expected (1Tu G.F. Reid G.E. Zhang J.G. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9322-9326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 2Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Pseudoknots, on the other hand, form in many of the larger RNAs where they are involved in a wide variety of biological processes (29Mans R.M. Guerrier-Takada C. Altman S. Pleij C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3479-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Gilley D. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine the roles of the pseudoknots, we first tested the tagging potential of tmRNAs that lacked two or more pseudoknots. Three derivatives of tmRNA(H8hp) missing pk2 and pk3 (tmRNAΔpk2/pk3), pk3 and pk4 (tmRNAΔpk3/pk4), or pk2-pk4 (tmRNAΔpk2-pk4) were unable to tag protein T7-L27-At in vivo (not shown). The tmRNAΔpk3/pk4 construct was able to mediate tagging of protein T7-L27-At in vitro (Fig. 10) but with greatly reduced efficiency. This result suggested that the loss of pk2 is more detrimental for tmRNA-dependent tagging than the depletion of pk3 or pk4. Previously, ribosomal protein S1 was shown to be associated with the MLR and pseudoknots pk2 to pk4 (17Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the ability of purified E. coli S1 to bind to mutant tmRNAs that lacked various pseudoknots. TmRNAs were 32P-labeled at their 3′ ends with yeast ATP/CTP tRNA nucleotidyl-transferase in the presence of [α-32P]ATP and aminoacylated with alanine as described (13Wower I.K. Zwieb C.W. Guven S.A. Wower J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6612-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Typically 80–95% of tmRNAΔpk2/pk3, tmRNAΔpk3/pk4, and tmRNAΔpk2-pk4 could be charged (not shown), indicating that the TLDs of the mutant tmRNAs were properly folded (32Francklyn C. Schimmel P. Nature. 1989; 337: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that the pseudoknot deletion mutants retained their ability to bind protein S1 (Fig. 11). However, the affinity of S1 to tmRNA was particularly low when pk2 was deleted (compare panels b and d with panel c in Fig. 11). Protein S1 bound to tmRNA derivatives lacking pk2 with an apparent binding constant, K′a, of 5 × 108–1 × 107m–1 (Fig. 11, panels b and d). The affinity between S1 and wild-type tmRNA is much higher (K′a ∼ 1 × 108m–1) (13Wower I.K. Zwieb C.W. Guven S.A. Wower J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6612-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), suggesting that pk2 constitutes an important part of the S1 binding site. To avoid widespread structural changes in the tmRNA molecule that may result from the pseudoknot excisions, we replaced pk2, pk3, and pk4 with single-stranded RNAs to form tmRNApk2L, tmRNApk3L, and tmRNApk4L, respectively. When expressed from plasmid pETrpmA-At-2 in vivo, all three mutant tmRNAs displayed levels of tagging that were undetectable by Coomassie Blue staining (not shown). Affinity purification followed by the use of anti-His-tag antibodies demonstrated that tmRNApk2L, tmRNApk3L, and tmRNApk4L tagged T7-L27-At at an ∼20-fold reduced level compared with the tagging by tmRNA(H8hp) (Fig. 12). The decrease was only 5-fold lower than the tagging by tmRNA(H8hp) when the transcription/translation reactions were furnished with purified SmpB (Fig. 13).Fig. 13In vitro tagging of truncated protein L27 by tmRNA(H8hp) and its derivatives with single, double, and triple pseudoknot substitutions.

For more details, see the legends for Figs. 9 and 10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The boost in tagging activity afforded by the addition of protein SmpB allowed us to test the tagging properties of tmRNAs in which pseudoknot pairs pk2 and pk3 (tmRNApk2/3L) and pk3 and pk4 (tmRNApk3/4L) as well as the pseudoknot triplet pk2-pk4 (tmRNApk2–4L) were replaced with single-stranded RNAs. As suspected, multiple mutations were more detrimental for protein tagging than disruptions of a single pseudoknot in tmRNApk2L, tmRNApk3L, and tmRNApk4L. Only tmRNApk3/4L displayed detectable tagging activity ∼20-fold lower than the tagging by tmRNA(H8hp) (Fig. 13). Inactivity of both tmRNApk2/3L and tmRNApk2–4L highlighted the importance of pk2 for tagging. Because protein SmpB enhanced protein tagging in vitro (see Fig. 13), we speculated that co-expression of tmRNA mutants and SmpB may also improve protein tagging in vivo. In pETrpmA-At-3 the smpB gene was inserted upstream of the ssrA gene in pETrpmA-At-2 to mimic the chromosomal organization of these two genes (Fig. 2A). TmRNApk2L, tmRNApk3L, and tmRNApk4L, when co-expressed with protein SmpB, tagged so efficiently that protein T7-L27-H8 could be easily detected by staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 14A). As much as 50% of protein T7-L27-At was tagged by tmRNA(H8hp). The levels of tagging by tmRNApk2L and tmRNApk3L were similar. However, the expression of protein T7-L27-At in cells producing tmRNApk3L was consistently lower than in cells expressing tmRNA(H8hp), tmRNApk2L, and tmRNApk4L. The tagging by tmRNApk4L, tmRNApk2/3L, and tmRNAp3/4L was significantly impaired and was detected only with anti-His-tag antibodies (Fig. 14B). The tmRNApk2–4L could not tag at all. Together, the observations indicated that pk4 is very important for protein tagging. The tagging patterns seen in Figs. 13 and 14 suggested that certain defects displayed by tmRNAs with disrupted pseudoknots might be related to tmRNA maturation. To test this possibility we isolated total RNA from IW363 cells before and after induction of protein T7-L27-At synthesis with IPTG. The RNAs were examined by Northern blot analysis with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to nucleotides 54–67 of E. coli tmRNA. As seen in Fig. 15, E. coli coped very well with processing of tmRNA precursors before IPTG induction. More than 90% of precursor tmRNA(H8hp), tmRNApk2L, tmRNApk3L, and tmRNApk2/3L were trimmed to their mature forms. Maturation of precursor tmRNApk4L, tmRNApk3/4L, and tmRNApk2–4L was less effective, but still, more than 70% of the molecules were processed. Upon IPTG induction, the processing of precursor tmRNApk4L, tmRNApk3/4L, and tmRNApk2–4L was affected the most. More than 50% of these tmRNA derivatives remained unprocessed. Because pk4 was disrupted in these tmRNA mutants, the maturation pattern shown in Fig. 15 indicated that pk4 is more important for tmRNA processing than pk2 and pk3. Because protein SmpB improved tmRNA-dependent tagging in vivo, we compared the maturation of mutant tmRNAs with a single pseudoknot disrupted in the presence and absence of SmpB. Total RNA was isolated from the IPTG-induced IW363 cells harboring plasmids pETrpmA-At-2 or pETrpmA-At-3 and examined by Northern blot analysis. This analysis demonstrated that the majority of the precursor tmRNApk2L and tmRNApk3L and 90% of tmRNApk4L remained unprocessed when SmpB was absent (Fig. 16). In contrast, in the presence of protein SmpB, more than 85% of precursor tmRNA(H8hp), tmRNApk2L, and tmRNApk3L was processed to their mature forms. Most of the tmRNApk4L mutant remained unprocessed, confirming that pk4 plays a prominent role in tmRNA maturation. For protein tagging, the 457-nucleotide precursor of E. coli tmRNA must be trimmed to its mature form, aminoacylated, delivered to the ribosome, and then perform its dual tRNA- and mRNA-like functions (2Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 17Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have studied these processes in vivo and in vitro by using suitably modified tmRNA derivatives with focus on the relative contribution of pseudoknots pk2 to pk4, helix 5, and proteins SmpB. Using novel sensitive assays for monitoring tmRNA-dependent tagging of truncated protein L27, we demonstrated that deletions and disruptions of pseudoknots pk2-pk4 and helix 5 impair protein tagging in vitro and in vivo. The level of tagging was different for each modification. For example, tmRNAΔpk2/pk3 and tmRNAΔpk2-pk4, mutants lacking pk2, did not tag in vitro. TmRNApk3L tagged well but inhibited the expression of the truncated protein L27 in vivo. TmRNApk4L, tmRNApk3/4L, and tmRNApk2–4L, all of which contained a disrupted pk4, showed no tagging activity in vivo. However, tmRNApk4L was as active as tmRNApk2L and tmRNApk3L in tagging in vitro. Differences between the in vitro and in vivo tagging profiles suggested that different functions of tmRNA may be impaired (compare Figs. 13 and 14). Indeed, further testing using gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that the deletion of pk2 in particular weakened the interactions between tmRNA and ribosomal protein S1, suggesting that pk2 may be an important S1 binding site in tmRNA. This result is consistent with footprinting studies, which demonstrated a decreased reactivity of pk2 toward single-strand-specific probes when tmRNA is bound to protein S1 in vitro (34Bordeau V. Felden B. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cryo-electron microscopy revealed that pk2 remains available for interactions with protein S1 when tmRNA enters the ribosome (7Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishman V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Our work demonstrated that mutant tmRNAs with alterations in helix 5 and the pk2-pk4 region adversely affect maturation of tmRNA precursors. Because formation of the double-stranded acceptor stem is a prerequisite for trimming the termini of the precursor tmRNA (17Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 33Li Z. Pandit S. Deutcher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), this finding implied that disruption of pseudoknots impairs the folding of the 3′ and 5′ termini of tmRNA into a tRNA-like structure. However, pk2 to pk4 were not essential for tmRNA maturation. As shown in Fig. 15 (upper panel, last lane), even upon disruption of base pairing in the pk2-pk4 segment E. coli was able to process ∼50% of the tmRNApk2–4L precursors to mature, tagging-incompetent RNA molecules. Because we observed similar cellular levels of vigorously tagging mature tmRNA(H8hp) and tagging-impaired mature tmRNA mutants, at least one pseudoknot, preferably pk4, is required for tmRNA-directed protein tagging. In contrast, it was suggested previously that pk2, pk3, and pk4 are interchangeable and can be replaced with single-stranded RNAs without detriment to tmRNA tagging (16Nameki N. Tadaki T. Himeno H. Muto A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, these data were derived exclusively from inefficient in vitro tagging experiments. The differences in protein tagging patterns shown in Figs. 12 and 14 underscore the need to investigate the structure and function of tmRNA in vitro as well as in vivo. Co-expression of protein SmpB with tmRNA significantly improved the maturation of tmRNA precursors, suggesting an unanticipated role for this protein in trans-translation. Because SmpB forms a tight complex with the TLD (21Wower J. Zwieb C.W. Hoffman D.W. Wower I.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8826-8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Gutmann S. Haebel P.W. Metzinger L. Sutter M. Felden B. Ban N. Nature. 2003; 424: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it may facilitate the formation of the acceptor arm in precursor tmRNA and, thus, assist in the formation of a structure that is suitable for trimming by RNases P, T, and PH (16Nameki N. Tadaki T. Himeno H. Muto A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Li Z. Pandit S. Deutcher M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Moreover, because pre-binding of SmpB to stalled ribosomes triggers trans-translation (12Hallier M. Ivanova N. Rametti A. Pavlov M. Ehrenberg M. Felden B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), overexpression of truncated proteins is likely to recruit SmpB to ribosomes and might limit its availability for tmRNA maturation as observed (see Fig. 15). In summary, our data provide the first evidence that pseudoknots pk2-pk4 play an important role in folding and maturation of tmRNA. Moreover, the presence of at least one pseudoknot, optimally pk4, is required for tmRNA tagging. This work also highlights the important role of helix 5, for which phylogenetic support is weak (5Zwieb C. Wower I.K. Wower J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2063-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally, evidence is presented that protein SmpB helps to process tmRNA precursors. Further studies will investigate how protein SmpB facilitates maturation of tmRNA, why pk4 is especially important for tmRNA maturation, why disruption of pk3 inhibits synthesis of truncated protein, and why pk2 is more important for protein S1 than the other pseudoknots. Powerful assay systems to address these critical questions are now available."

The 3′-end of secM encodes an “arrest sequence,” which can interact with the ribosomal exit tunnel, preventing complete secM translation under secretion-defective conditions. In a cis-acting manner, ribosome stalling enhances secA translation. Pro166 is the last residue incorporated when SecM elongation is arrested. We report that secretion deficiencies lead to SsrA tagging of SecM after Pro166, Gly165, and likely Arg163. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of a truncated secM transcript, likely issued from a secM-secA cleavage. The level of secM transcripts was decreased either when secM translation was totally prevented or when Pro166 was mutated. However, the accumulation of a truncated secM transcript required secM translation and was prevented when the SecM arrest sequence was inactivated by a point mutation changing Pro166 to Ala. We suggest that ribosome pausing at the site encoding the arrest sequence is required for formation of the truncated secM mRNA. SsrA tagging affected neither the presence of the secM mRNA nor secA expression, even under translocation-defective conditions. It is therefore likely that SsrA tagging of SecM occurs only after cleavage of secM-secA mRNA within the secM open reading frame encoding the SecM arrest sequence. Accumulation of transcripts expressing arrested SecM generated growth inhibition that was alleviated by the SsrA tagging system. Therefore, SsrA tagging of SecM would rescue ribosomes to avoid excessive jamming of the translation apparatus on stop-less secM mRNA.

Nascent proteins emerge from the 50 S ribosomal subunit through an exit tunnel with a length of ∼100 Å and containing 35–40 amino acids of the elongating polypeptide. Its narrowness prevents peptide folding, and certain sequences from nascent peptides can interact with ribosomal elements of the tunnel to affect protein biosynthesis. The ribosome is therefore sensitive to the composition of the amino acid chain it is synthesizing, and the exit tunnel contributes to the dynamics of protein elongation (1Tenson T. Ehrenberg M. Cell. 2002; 108: 591-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, this is exemplified by a sequence of the periplasmic protein SecM (secretion monitor) at a position close to its C terminus called the arrest sequence, which interacts with the ribosomal exit tunnel and causes elongation arrest within the ribosome (Refs. 2Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar and 3Murakami A. Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ribosomal arrest is a key element in the regulation of SecA, an ATPase that targets protein precursors to the SecYEG core translocon for secretion. SecA is expressed from the secM-secA-mutT operon; its translation is up-regulated by a block in SecM secretion in a cis-specific manner (2Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Cell. 2002; 108: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 6Oliver D. Norman J. Sarker S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5240-5242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A secondary structure encompassing the secA Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the secM-secA-mutT RNA can conditionally inhibit secA translation. Due to its arrest sequence, secM translation stalls when its N-terminal signal sequence is not “pulled” by the protein export machinery (7Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 185-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Butkus M.E. Prundeanu L.B. Oliver D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6719-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Paused ribosomes are thought to mediate unfolding of the RNA secondary structure, thereby exposing the initiation signal for SecA biosynthesis (9Oliver D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 686-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By this mechanism, the amount of SecA is adjusted to the intracellular demand for protein export (6Oliver D. Norman J. Sarker S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5240-5242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pausing of translating ribosomes can lead to protein tagging by the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA 1The abbreviations used are: tmRNA, transfer-messenger RNA; CTABr, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide; CRP, cAMP receptor protein. ; also called SsrA in E. coli) (for review, see Ref. 10Withey J.H. Friedman D.I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When charged with an alanine, tmRNA is recruited to A-sites of stalled ribosomes, and growing polypeptide chains are transferred to alanyl-tmRNA by a transpeptidation reaction. tmRNA then becomes a template for translation of an oligopeptide tag, which in E. coli corresponds to ANDENYALAA (11Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). The change of matrix from mRNA to tmRNA is referred to as trans-translation. This mechanism allows release of stalled ribosomes (11Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) and elimination of tagged products by specific proteases (12Keiler K.C. Sauer R.T. J. Biol.

Ribosome stalling and trans-translation occur during translation of truncated mRNAs lacking a stop codon because release factors are not recruited (11Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T.

Here, we show that ribosomes stalled on the secM transcript are rescued by the SsrA tagging system. We show the presence of a truncated secM mRNA transcript likely issued from endonucleolytic cleavage of a secM-secA mRNA. It requires translation of secM mRNA and the integrity of the SecM arrest sequence. SsrA tagging does not influence secA expression but prevents the toxicity of accumulated non-exported SecM.

The PCR product was digested with KpnI-BamHI and cloned into KpnI-BamHI-digested pZA31-MCS1 (31Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pSecM, expresses SecM precursor protein. A truncated secM gene lacking its 5′-end was amplified using primers 5′-GGGGTACCAT GCTCAGCAAC GCCGCCGAA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCAA TAAAATCTCA AACGCC-3′. The PCR product was digested with KpnI-BamHI and cloned into KpnI-BamHI-digested pZA31-MCS1 (31Lutz R. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pΔssSecM, expresses the mature SecM protein lacking its signal sequence, ΔssSecM (Ser2–Ala37) (32Sarker S. Rudd K.E. Oliver D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5592-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The pΔssM2SecM plasmid expresses a fusion protein between tandem FLAG epitopes and ΔssSecM. The 5′-truncated secM gene was amplified from the chromosome using primers 5′-ATACGCGTCG ACCTCAGCAA CGCCGCCGAA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCAA TAAAATCTCA AACGCC-3′. The PCR product digested by SalI and BamHI was cloned into the SalI-BamHI sites of pZA31-M2N (25Collier J. Binet E. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), giving rise to pΔssM2SecM. The pssM2SecM plasmid expresses a fusion protein with internal tandem FLAG epitopes between Val57 and Asn58 of the SecM protein (with its signal sequence). It was obtained by cloning the linker resulting from the nucleotide annealing of 5′-GCTAGCTTTA TCATCATCAT CTTTATAATC TTTATCATCA TCATCTTTAT AATCCAT-3′ and 5′-ATGGATTATA AAGATGATGA TGATAAAGAT TATAAAGATG ATGATGATAA AGCTAGC-3′ into the HpaI site of pSecM. pETSecM, pETSecM*, and pETΔssSecM are pET-3b (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) derivatives with secM and secM mutations (and the first 1077 nucleotides of the secA coding sequence) under the transcriptional control of the T7 polymerase. The secM gene and part of the secA gene were amplified from the chromosome using primers 5′-GGAATTCCAT ATGAGTGGAA TACTGACGC-3′ (P1) and 5′-CGGGATCCCG CTTCCACAGC CTGGTG-3′ (P4); the PCR product was digested with NdeI-BamHI and cloned into NdeI-BamHI-digested pET-3b. The resulting plasmid, pETSecM, expresses SecM precursor protein. The secM* gene and part of secA were amplified from the chromosome using the mutagenic primer 5′-GGAATTCCAT ATGTAATGAA TACTGACGCG CTGGC-3′ (P2) and primer P4; the PCR product was digested with NdeI-BamHI and cloned into NdeI-BamHI-digested pET-3b. The resulting plasmid, pETSecM*, cannot express SecM since its initiation codon is replaced with a stop codon. The ΔsssecM gene and part of the secA gene were amplified from the chromosome using primers 5′-GGAATTCCAT ATGCTCAGCA ACGCCGCCGAA-3′ (P3) and P4; the PCR product was digested with NdeI-BamHI and cloned into NdeI-BamHI-digested pET-3b. The resulting plasmid, pETΔssSecM, expresses SecM with no signal sequence. The CCT codon encoding Pro166 was change to Ala (GCT) using the Megaprimer method (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with the mutagenic primer 5′-GGCGTTGAGC GCCAGC-3′ and primers P1/P4 (on pETSecM), P2/P4 (on pETSecM*) and P3/P4 (on pETΔssSecM), giving rise to pETSecM-P166A, pETSecM*-P166A, and pETΔssSecM-P166A, respectively. The ssrAH7 gene from pSsrA-H7 (25Collier J. Binet E. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CGGGATCCTG GACTCCAGAA TCCGAC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCT CACCTGTTCT TTCTGA-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and inserted at the BamHI site of pKO3, giving rise to pKO3SsrA-H7. All plasmid constructions were confirmed for their inserts by DNA sequencing. ssrA/ssrAH7 Gene Replacement—The ssrA gene encoding the SsrA tag ANDENYALAA was previously modified to encode the peptide tag ANDENYHHHHHHH (ssrAH7, expressed in pSsrA-H7) (25Collier J. Binet E. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The chromosomal ssrA gene was replaced with the modified ssrAH7 gene at its own locus using pKO3SsrA-H7 introduced into strain PhB1805 (MG1655 ssrA::Km) as described (33Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The resulting ssrAH7 strain supported hybrid λimmP22 growth with the same efficiency as the wild-type strain, whereas the ssrA::Km strain showed a 104-fold reduction in plaque formation (34Retallack D.M. Johnson L.L. Friedman D.I. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2082-2089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Withey J. Friedman D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2148-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analyses—Overnight bacterial cultures grown in LB medium at 37 °C were diluted 1000-fold into fresh LB medium. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture medium at A600 = 0.15. At A600 = 0.3, the culture (10 ml) was mixed with an equal volume of cold (–80 °C) absolute ethanol and immediately spun down. The pellet was suspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (0.02 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 1 mm EDTA), and 600 μl of hot acidic phenol was added. Phenol extraction was repeated three times, and RNA was precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 2 volumes of absolute ethanol. RNA samples were separated by electrophoresis on agarose gel containing formaldehyde and capillary-transferred onto nylon membrane (Hybond-XL, Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England) according to published protocols (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and the manufacturer's instructions. The secM (5′-GCTGAATTTT GCTTGTGGGG TAAAATGCGC A-3′), intergenic (5′-GCGTTGCGAG TTAATAAAAT GAAGTAAAGG TTTATTGTTG-3′), and secA (5′-TACCGAAAAC TTTAGTTAAC AATTTGATTA GCATA-3′) probes were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and purified using the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (QIAGEN Inc., Courtabœuf, France). Prehybridization (3 h at 52 °C) and hybridization (20 h at 52 °C) of the membrane with labeled oligonucleotides were performed in SSC/Denhardt's buffer as described (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Radioactivity was detected on storage phosphor screens using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of SsrA-H7-tagged Proteins—Cultures of 0.75 liters were grown overnight in Terrific broth at 37 °C. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer A (6 m guanidine, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 100 mm NaCl (pH 8)) at 5 ml/g of cells and lysed by stirring for 1 h at room temperature. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry (QIAGEN Inc.) equilibrated in lysis buffer A and allowed to bind by rocking for 1 h at room temperature. The resin was collected by centrifugation and washed (incubation for 10 min followed by 7 min of centrifugation at 700 × g twice with 15 ml of lysis buffer A) and three times with lysis buffer B (8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 8)). An additional wash with 1 ml of lysis buffer B was performed. Proteins were eluted with 4 × 1 ml of elution buffer (lysis buffer B + 100 mm imidazole (pH 8)). SsrA-H7-tagged proteins were usually recovered in the first 1-ml fraction. SDS-15% PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining were performed according to manual (36Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar) and manufacturers' protocols. Identification of SsrA-H7-tagged ΔssSecM by Mass Spectrometry— Tryptic peptides from SsrA-H7-tagged ΔssSecM were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry according to a described protocol (25Collier J. Binet E. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Strain PhB2431 (with a slyD mutation to avoid sample contamination by the histidine-rich peptidyl cis, trans-isomerase SlyD) containing pΔssSecM was used for identification of SsrA-H7-tagged ΔssSecM. The percentage of protein length covered by peptide matches was ∼40% for SsrA-H7-tagged ΔssSecM. Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTABr) Fractionation for Identification of Peptidyl-tRNA Proteins—Cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C and normalized to the same absorbance. Samples were treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and denatured proteins were collected, washed, and dissolved in SDS buffer (37Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). RNase A treatment was performed where indicated using 100 μg/ml RNase A for 10 min at 37 °C. CTABr precipitation was then performed as described (7Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 185-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Precipitates were washed twice with 80% acetone and dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer (7Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 185-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) before SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Supernatants were treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid to recover protein contents and analyzed similarly. Western Blotting—Following SDS-15% PAGE, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) as described (36Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar). Immunodetection was performed with anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody M2 and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma). Pulse-Chase Analysis—Cells were grown at 37 °C in minimal M63 medium supplemented with 16 amino acids (20 μg/ml each, except Met, Cys, Ala, and Gly), 0.4% glucose, chloramphenicol, and anhydrotetracycline to induce ssM2SecM expression. Exponential phase cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 min. The chase was initiated by addition of unlabeled l-methionine (200 μg/ml). At each time point indicated, samples were treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed twice with 80% acetone, and dissolved in SDS buffer (37Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Samples were processed for immunoprecipitation as described (38Ito K. Beckwith J.R. Cell. 1981; 25: 143-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) except that protein A-agarose beads (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) were used with anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody M2. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and labeled proteins were visualized on storage phosphor screens. Elongation-arrested SecM Is SsrA-tagged—Elongation of secM translation is arrested when SecM is not translocated to the periplasm (7Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 185-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39Sarker S. Oliver D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2360-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since SsrA tagging of proteins can be induced by ribosome stalling, we hypothesized that elongation-arrested SecM protein is subject to SsrA tagging. We constructed SecM derivatives containing a tandem FLAG epitope to allow immunodetection or immun"
https://openalex.org/W1965198876,"Nine neurodegenerative diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), are caused by the expansion of polyglutamine stretches in the respective disease-causing proteins. A hallmark of these diseases is the aggregation of expanded polyglutamine-containing proteins in nuclear inclusions that also accumulate molecular chaperones and components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Manipulation of HSP70 and HSP40 chaperone levels has been shown to suppress aggregates in cellular models, prevent neuronal death in Drosophila, and improve to some extent neurological symptoms in mouse models. An important issue in mammals is the relative expression levels of toxic and putative rescuing proteins. Furthermore, overexpression of both HSP70 and its co-factor HSP40/HDJ2 has never been investigated in mice. We decided to address this question in a SCA7 transgenic mouse model that progressively develops retinopathy, similar to SCA7 patients. To co-express HSP70 and HDJ2 with the polyglutamine protein, in the same cell type, at comparable levels and with the same time course, we generated transgenic mice that express the heat shock proteins specifically in rod photoreceptors. While co-expression of HSP70 with its co-factor HDJ2 efficiently suppressed mutant ataxin-7 aggregation in transfected cells, they did not prevent either neuronal toxicity or aggregate formation in SCA7 mice. Furthermore, nuclear inclusions in SCA7 mice were composed of a cleaved mutant ataxin-7 fragment, whereas they contained the full-length protein in transfected cells. We propose that differences in the aggregation process might account for the different effects of chaperone overexpression in cellular and animal models of polyglutamine diseases.

Martin J.J. Van Broeckhoven C. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 12: 2-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). SCA7 is caused by an abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine (poly(Q)) tract (38-460 repeats) in the SCA7 gene product ataxin-7 (2David G. Abbas N. Stevanin G. Durr A. Yvert G. Cancel G. Weber C.

Eight other neurodegenerative diseases are caused by a CAG/poly(Q) repeat expansion, including Huntington disease (HD), dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy, spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17. Genetic and molecular studies indicate that poly(Q) tracts confer a novel toxic function to the otherwise unrelated proteins, but the mechanisms by which poly(Q) expansions lead to neurodegeneration remain unclear (4Zoghbi H.Y.

Furthermore, the levels of several chaperones, including the HSP70 and the HSP40 chaperones HDJ1 and HDJ2, were shown to be reduced in SCA7 and/or HD mouse models (16Helmlinger D. Yvert G. Picaud S.

Altogether, these findings suggested that protein misfolding and impaired clearance might be a common pathogenic event in poly(Q) diseases. Accordingly, several studies showed that overexpression of chaperones in cells reduces aggregate formation and, in some cases, suppresses poly(Q) toxicity (reviewed in Refs. 8Opal P. Zoghbi H.Y.

Genetic screens, in Drosophila models overexpressing mutant ataxin-1 or a pure 127Q stretch, identified molecular chaperones and components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as strong modulators of poly(Q)-induced toxicity (19Kazemi-Esfarjani P.

In particular, deletion of HSP70 genes exacerbated SCA1 or SBMA fly phenotypes, whereas overexpression of HSP70 or HDJ1 suppressed neurodegeneration in various Drosophila models (19Kazemi-Esfarjani P.

Furthermore, Chan et al. (25Chan H.Y. Warrick J.M. Gray-Board G.L. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) showed that HSP70 and HDJ1 synergistically suppressed poly(Q) toxicity in a SCA3 fly model. These chaperones work together in an ATP-dependent manner, notably to help refold denaturated and aggregated proteins. HSP40 co-chaperones recognize abnormally folded polypeptide substrates, present them to HSP70, and stimulate HSP70 ATPase activity (26Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HSP70 had a more mitigated outcome in modulating poly(Q) toxicity in mouse models (17Hay D.G. Sathasivam K. Tobaben S. Stahl B. Marber M. Mestril R. Mahal A. Smith D.L. Woodman B. Bates G.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1389-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27Cummings C.J.

Leist M. Jaattela M. Brundin P. Brain Res. 2003; 970: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The authors hypothesized that this might be explained by the lack of HSP40 induction that would be required for HSP70 to modulate neurodegeneration. Overexpression of both HSP70 and HSP40 has not been investigated in mouse models of poly(Q) diseases. We decided to address this question in a SCA7 transgenic mouse model that presents with a progressive and severe retinopathy (9Yvert G. Lindenberg K.S. Picaud S. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Sahel J.A. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2491-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Helmlinger D. Abou-Sleymane G. Yvert G. Rousseau S. Weber C. Trot-tier Y. Mandel J.L. Devys D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1881-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this model, neuronal dysfunction of a single cell type (rod photoreceptors) can be quantified on living animals by recording electroretinograms (ERGs). To co-express mutant ataxin-7 and the molecular chaperones in the same cell type, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing HSP70 and HDJ2 specifically in rod photoreceptors. These heat shock proteins efficiently suppressed mutant ataxin-7 aggregation in transfected cells but were not able to prevent either neuronal toxicity or aggregate formation in photoreceptors from SCA7 mice. We show here for the first time that expressing both HSP70 and its co-factor HDJ2 has no beneficial effect on phenotype progression in a poly(Q) mouse model. Generation of Transgenic Animals—A 2.2-kb XbaI-SmaI fragment of the human rhodopsin promoter, encompassing the distal enhancer region, was subcloned from the R7N construct (9Yvert G. Lindenberg K.S. Picaud S. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Sahel J.A. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2491-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) into the pGSp2 vector, kindly provided by Dr. D. Metzger, upstream of the rabbit β-globin intron II, to generate the pGS-Rho vector. The 1.9-kb human HSP70 cDNA was amplified by PCR from clone pH2.3, kindly provided by Dr. R. Morimoto, using a 5′ primer encoding a FLAG epitope. The 1.2-kb human HDJ2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from clone J3, kindly provided by Dr. T. Mohanakumar, using a 3′ primer encoding a HA epitope. These PCR fragments were XhoI-NheI-digested and cloned into the pGS-Rho vector to generate pGS-Rho-RH70 and pGS-Rho-RH40 transgene constructs, respectively. All final plasmids were verified by sequencing and subsequently SalI-ApaLI-digested to remove bacterial sequences, purified on sucrose gradients, and microinjected into FVB/N-fertilized eggs, as described (9Yvert G. Lindenberg K.S. Picaud S. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Sahel J.A. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2491-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Mouse tail DNA was screened by PCR for the presence of the transgenes. Founder mice were backcrossed on the inbred C57BL/6 background to get F3 RH40 or RH70 transgenic mice with a mixed (87.5% C57BL/6; 12.5% FVB/N) genetic background. The loss of the rd allele from the FVB/N background was checked by PCR followed by DpnI digestion. For genotyping of R7E, RH70, and RH40 transgenic mice, mouse tail DNA was screened by PCR using specific primers (5′-AGGCGATGACAAAGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-AGGGGATGAGGATGAAGAG-3′ for the SCA7 transgene, 470-bp product; 5′-CAACAAGATCACCATCACCAAC-3′ and 5′-GCTATTGCTTTATTTGTAACC-3′ for the HSP70 transgene, 500-bp product; 5′-GGGGTCAAACCCAATGCTACTC-3′ and 5′-CATCCTTCCTCCTCCTCCAAAA-3′ for the HDJ2 transgene, 260-bp product). For genotyping of double and triple transgenic mice, two independent PCR reactions were performed on the same mouse tail DNA sample; one including both HSP70 and HDJ2 primer pairs and another using primers specific for the SCA7 transgene. Plasmid Construction and Cell Transfection—For cell transfection experiments, a full-length SCA7 cDNA with 128 CAGs was obtained by PCR amplification of the B7E2B construct (10Yvert G. Lindenberg K.S. Devys D. Helmlinger D. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1679-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), using a 5′ primer encoding a FLAG epitope. This fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to generate pc7E2FL. A truncated SCA7 construct (pc7E2-456) was generated by PCR amplification of pc7E2FL and introduced into pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). Tagged full-length HDJ2 and HSP70 cDNAs were subcloned from pGS-Rho-RH70 and pGS-Rho-RH40 constructs into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to generate pcHDJ2 and pcHSP70 constructs, respectively. 2 × 105 HEK293T cells were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation, washed 16 h later, and harvested or fixed 24 or 48 h after washing. Immunoblot Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts from dissected retina or from transfected HEK293T cells were obtained by homogenization in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Homogenates were then incubated for 20 min on ice and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C. Supernatants were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-HA 12CA5, anti-HSP70 SPA-810 (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), and anti-HDJ2/Hsp40 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA). Antibody Production—The anti-ataxin-7 polyclonal 1599 antibody was generated by immunization of rabbits with a peptide corresponding to amino acids 226-245 (KEKLQLRGNTRPMHPIQQSR) of human ataxin-7 and purified as described previously (9Yvert G. Lindenberg K.S. Picaud S. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Sahel J.A. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2491-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Immunohistology and Light Microscopy—For histology, retina were dissected from enucleated eyes and then fixed by immersion in 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Fixed eyes were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated with a graded alcohol series, and embedded in Epon. Semi-thin (1 μm) sections were stained with toluidin blue. For immunocytofluorescence, transfected HEK293T cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-ataxin-7 2A10 monoclonal and affinity-purified 1261 and 1598 polyclonal antibodies, as described (9Yvert G.

Briefly, dissected retina were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected, and frozen in Cryomatrix (Thermo Shandon). 10-μm cryostat sections were permeabilized, blocked, and then immunostained using the following primary antibodies: anti-ataxin-7 2A10 monoclonal and affinity-purified 1261, 1599, and 1598 polyclonal antibodies, as described (9Yvert G.

Secondary antibodies used were CY3- and Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Nuclei were counter-stained with 0.5 μg/ml 4,6-diaminido-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Real-time RT-PCR Analysis of Retinal RNA—Real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously (29Helmlinger D. Abou-Sleymane G. Yvert G. Rousseau S. Weber C. Trot-tier Y. Mandel J.L. Devys D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1881-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, reverse-transcribed total retinal RNA was amplified with SYBR Green I (Sigma) on a Light-Cycler instrument (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) using Rho- and Ppia-specific primers. Electroretinogram Recordings—Electroretinographic analysis was performed as described previously (29Helmlinger D. Abou-Sleymane G. Yvert G. Rousseau S. Weber C. Trot-tier Y. Mandel J.L. Devys D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1881-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, dark-adapted mice were anesthetized, pupils were dilated, and the cornea was locally anesthetized. Scotopic rod ERGs were recorded by using a gold loop electrode placed on the corneal surface and calibrated to a reference electrode inserted subcutaneously on the head. Light stimulation was increased from -4 to 1.4 log candela s m-2, as measured with a luxmeter at eye level. The duration of the light stimulus was constant. Responses were digitized using a data acquisition labmaster board (Multiliner Vision). Molecular Chaperones Suppress Formation of Aggregates in Cells Expressing Mutant Ataxin-7—We first evaluated whether overexpression of HSP70 and/or HSP40/HDJ2 could modulate mutant ataxin-7 aggregation in mammalian cells. We transfected HEK293T cells with truncated or full-length mutant SCA7 cDNA constructs (128 CAG) either alone or together with human HSP70- and HDJ2-tagged cDNA constructs. Fourty hours after transfection, Western blots revealed high and comparable expression of FLAG-tagged mutant ataxin-7, FLAG-tagged HSP70, and HA-tagged HDJ2 (Fig. 1A). We then performed immunofluorescence staining of transfected cells using an N-terminal anti-ataxin-7 antibody (1261 (9Yvert G. Lindenberg K.S. Picaud S. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Sahel J.A. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2491-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)). While truncated (residues 1-456) and full-length normal ataxin-7 displayed a diffuse nuclear staining (3Helmlinger D. Hardy S. Sasorith S. Klein F. Robert F. Weber C. Miguet L. Potier N. Van-Dorsselaer A. Wurtz J.M. Mandel J.L. Tora L. Devys D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), mutant ataxin-7 either showed a similar localization or accumulated into large NIs (Fig. 1B, upper panels). Co-transfection of both HDJ2 and HSP70 cDNAs with truncated (residues 1-456) or full-length mutant SCA7 completely suppressed formation of NIs (Fig. 1B, lower panels and data not shown). All transfected cells displayed a diffuse nuclear staining suggesting that overexpression of these chaperones inhibited mutant ataxin-7 aggregation. We then quantified this effect by counting cells displaying either NIs or homogenous nuclear staining after transfecting either truncated mutant SCA7 cDNA alone or together with HDJ2, with HSP70, or with both HDJ2 and HSP70 cDNAs. Overexpression of HDJ2 had a mild effect on the number of aggregates (20.3% ± 2.6% versus 31.3% ± 2.7%) that was not statistically significant (one-way analysis of variance, F(2,14) = 1.6, p > 0.05). Drastic suppression of aggregate formation was achieved by overexpressing HSP70 alone (1.0% ± 0.5% versus 31.3% ± 2.7%; one-way analysis of variance, F(3,14) = 4.8, p < 0.05), or together with its co-factor HDJ2 (Fig. 1C). These results show that mutant ataxin-7 aggregation can be suppressed in transfected cells by manipulating HSP70 and HDJ2 chaperone expression levels. Generation of Transgenic Lines Overexpressing HDJ2 or HSP70 in the Retina—We then wanted to address whether HSP70 and/or HDJ2 overexpression could modulate mutant ataxin-7 aggregation and neuronal toxicity in a SCA7 mouse model. We previously generated SCA7 transgenic mice (R7E) that highly and specifically overexpress mutant ataxin-7 (90Q) in a single cell type, rod photoreceptors. These mice (from the R7E.A line) have an early and severe retinal dysfunction, as revealed by a progressive decrease of rod photoreceptor electrophysiological activity (9Yvert G. Lindenberg K.S. Picaud S. Landwehrmeyer G.B. Sahel J.A. Mandel J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2491-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Helmlinger D. Abou-Sleymane G. Yvert G. Rousseau S. Weber C. Trot-tier Y. Mandel J.L. Devys D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1881-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We thus made new transgenic mice that co-express molecular chaperones and mutant ataxin-7 in the same cells, at comparable levels and with the same time course. We constructed expression vectors with human HSP70 or HDJ2 cDNAs downstream from the same 2.2 kb of the human rhodopsin promoter used to drive mutant ataxin-7 expression. To assess recombinant chaperone expression, we FLAG-tagged HSP70 and HA-tagged HDJ2 cDNAs (Fig. 2A). The FLAG tag was inserted at the N-terminal end of HSP70 to preserve the integrity of its C-terminal co-chaperone binding domain, while the HA tag was inserted at the C-terminal end of HDJ2 to avoid interference with the structure of its N-terminal J domain (30Demand J. Luders J. Hohfeld J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 31Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). We generated several transgenic lines containing HSP70 or HDJ2 transgenes and called RH70 and RH40, respectively. They express the recombinant chaperones at different levels relative to the endogenous proteins (Fig. 2B and Table I), as determined by Western blot analysis of retinal homogenates using anti-HSP70 or anti-HDJ2 antibodies. RH40 line B and RH70 line G showed the highest expression, reaching 5-10-fold the endogenous levels. Expression levels of endogenous Hsp70 and Hdj2 were not modified in transgenic mice compared with wild type (Fig. 2B). Immunostaining with either anti-tag or anti-chaperone antibodies indicated that expression was high and clearly restricted to rod photoreceptors (Fig. 2C). In RH40 line E and RH70 line H, we observed strong expression of recombinant chaperones confined to a small subset of rods, accounting for moderate levels detected by Western blots. Finally, chaperone overexpression did not affect retinal structure and function, as revealed by histological examination and electroretinogram recordings (Fig. 2C and data not shown).Table ISummary of the different HSP70/HDJ2 transgenic mouse lines generatedConstructNo. foundersLinesaOnly lines that stably transmitted the transgene over three generations and expressed detectable levels of protein are presented.Protein expressionbEstimated by Western blot analysis using anti-HDJ2 and anti-HA antibodies or anti-HSP70 and anti-FLAG antibodies.RH4012A++cRecombinant/endogenous chaperones expression ratio: +++, >5-fold; ++, around 1-fold; +, <1-fold.B+++C+++D+E+F++RH7016G+++H+I++J++a Only lines that stably transmitted the transgene over three generations and expressed detectable levels of protein are presented.b Estimated by Western blot analysis using anti-HDJ2 and anti-HA antibodies or anti-HSP70 and anti-FLAG antibodies.c Recombinant/endogenous chaperones expression ratio: +++, >5-fold; ++, around 1-fold; +, <1-fold. Open table in a new tab HSP70/HDJ2 Overexpression, Alone or in Combination, Does Not Modulate SCA7 Retinopathy—F2 hemizygous animals from RH70 line G and RH40 line B were cross-bred with hemizygous R7E mice to generate double transgenic mice R7E/RH70 and R7E/RH40, respectively. This breeding scheme results in all genotypes (wild-type, R7E, RH70, RH40, and double transgenic mice) from the same litter. Rod photoreceptor function was quantified on living animals at 9 weeks of age by measuring the amplitude of the a-wave from electroretinogram recordings performed on dark-adapted mice (scotopic ERGs). At this age, RH70 and RH40 mice displayed similar ERG recordings to that of wild-type littermates (data not shown). We previously showed that rod activity was reduced by around 65% in 9-week-old R7E mice compared with wild-type littermates. These results were obtained with mice maintained on a pure C57BL/6 genetic background (29Helmlinger D. Abou-Sleymane G. Yvert G. Rousseau S. Weber C. Trot-tier Y. Mandel J.L. Devys D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1881-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As our breeding scheme generated mice with a mixed background (87.5% C57BL/6, 12.5% FVB/N, see “Experimental Procedures”), we first performed ERG recordings on R7E and control mice from these litters. Rod response was only reduced by 40% in 9-week-old R7E mice as compared with control (CT) littermates, indicating a slightly less severe disease progression on this mixed background (Fig. 3). A comparable reduction of rod response was observed between age-matched R7E (106 ± 11 μV), R7E/RH40 (120 ± 16 μV), and R7E/RH70 (94 ± 14 μV) mice as compared with control littermates (182 ± 13 μV) (Fig. 3B). As it has been previously shown that HSP70 and HDJ2 act synergistically in preventing polyQ-induced toxicity (25Chan H.Y. Warrick J.M. Gray-Board G.L. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), we then generated triple transgenic mice to overexpress both HSP70 and its co-factor HDJ2 in rod photoreceptors of R7E mice. At 9 weeks of age, ERG recordings showed that rod photoreceptor responses were comparable in R7E/RH40/RH70 (107 ± 11 μV) and R7E (106 ± 11 μV) mice (Fig. 3). We previously reported that progressive reduction of rod photoreceptor activity was accompanied by dramatic thinning of the segment layer in R7E mice. We assessed progression of retinopathy by histological examination of retina from the 10-week-old R7E, R7E/RH40/RH70 triple transgenic, and WT mice that had been used for the ERG recordings. Toluidin blue-stained retinal sections from triple transgenic R7E/RH40/RH70 or R7E mice were indistinguishable (Fig. 4A). At this age, mice of both genotypes displayed heterogeneous pattern of segment"

It was previously shown to dimerize upon activation in a concentration- and temperature-dependent manner. This dimer was thought to bind to aggregation-prone target proteins, preventing their aggregation. In the present study, we report small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), steady state and time-resolved fluorescence, gel filtration, and glutaraldehyde cross-linking analysis of full-length Hsp33. Our circular dichroism and fluorescence results show that there are significant structural changes in oxidized Hsp33 at different temperatures. SAXS, gel filtration, and glutaraldehyde cross-linking results indicate, in addition to the dimers, the presence of oligomeric species. Oxidation in the presence of physiological salt concentration leads to significant increases in the oligomer population. Our results further show that under conditions that mimic the crowded milieu of the cytosol, oxidized Hsp33 exists predominantly as an oligomeric species. Interestingly, chaperone activity studies show that the oligomeric species is much more efficient compared with the dimers in preventing aggregation of target proteins. Taken together, these results indicate that in the cell, Hsp33 undergoes conformational and quaternary structural changes leading to the formation of oligomeric species in response to oxidative stress. Oligomeric Hsp33 thus might be physiologically relevant under oxidative stress.

In addition, the extracellular environment can also cause oxidative stress to the cells (1Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin.

Heat shock is shown to increase oxidative stress (3Davidson J.F. Whyte B. Bissinger P.H. Schiestl R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress, inter alia, results in misfolding and aggregation of several cellular proteins. In order to combat oxidative stress, cells produce proteins that detoxify reactive oxygen species and repair harmful changes. The Escherichia coli cytoplasm, like that of most other organisms, is largely reducing in nature although under oxidative stress, the redox status of the cell changes significantly. Several cellular proteins are regulated by redox-dependent post-translational modifications (4Paget M.S. Buttner M.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Until recently, no molecular chaperone was known that could be turned on or off by a post-translational event acting as a switch. Jakob et al. (5Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) showed that a member of the highly conserved cytoplasmic prokaryotic molecular chaperones, Hsp33, is regulated by the redox state of the medium. Under reducing conditions, Hsp33 is inactive. Hsp33 has four absolutely conserved cysteine residues: Cys-232, -234, -265, and -268. In the reduced state, they are coordinated to a zinc atom (6Jakob U. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38302-38310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Oxidizing conditions lead to the release of zinc and formation of two intramolecular disulfide bonds, Cys-232 with Cys-234 and Cys-265 with Cys-268 (7Barbirz S. Jakob U. Glocker M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18759-18766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Upon such oxidative activation, Hsp33 binds to aggregation-prone states of proteins, preventing their aggregation and acting as a holdase chaperone (5Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 7Barbirz S. Jakob U. Glocker M.O. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have earlier shown that there are significant secondary and tertiary structural differences between the reduced and oxidized forms of Hsp33. Our studies showed that conformational changes accompanied by increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, are involved in the oxidative activation of Hsp33 (9Raman B. Kumar L.V.S. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Initial studies by Jakob et al. (5Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), based on gel filtration and cross-linking data, suggested that Hsp33 might act as a monomer (5Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the crystal structure of Hsp33 was reported by two groups (10Kim S.J. Jeong D.G. Chi S.W. Lee J.S. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Vijayalakshmi J. Mukhergee M.K. Graumann J. Jakob U. Saper M.A. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both studies showed that Hsp33 existed in a domain-swapped dimeric form. One of the studies suggested that the increase in concentration of Hsp33, brought about under conditions of heat stress, favors dimerization (12Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the reported crystal structure lacks about 60 residues in the C terminus. In the present study, we have used small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), 1The abbreviations used are: SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; PEG, polyethylene glycol; DTT, dithiothreitol; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; BSA, bovine serum albumin; bis-ANS, 1,1′-bis(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid; CS, citrate synthase; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. fluorescence, gel filtration, and glutaraldehyde cross-linking analysis of full-length Hsp33 to investigate structural and conformational changes in Hsp33 upon oxidation at different temperatures. Our results show that upon oxidative stress there are significant structural and conformational changes in oxidized Hsp33 at different temperatures, leading to the formation of higher oligomeric species, ranging from dimer to octamer. Chaperone activity studies show that the oligomeric species is much more efficient compared with the dimer. Taken together, our results suggest that in the cell, Hsp33 exists predominantly as an oligomeric species upon oxidative stress. 1,1′-Bis(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid (Bis-ANS), citrate synthase (from porcine heart), dithiothreitol (DTT), glutaraldehyde, PEG 3350, and PEG 8000 were purchased from Sigma. Sephadex G-75, Superdex G-75, Superose 6, Superose 12 HR 10/30 FPLC columns, and phenyl-Sepharose CL 6B fast flow were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was obtained from Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India and acrylamide (3×) was from Sisco Research Laboratory, Mumbai, India. H2O2 and other chemicals used in this study were of analytical reagent grade. Overexpression and Purification of Hsp33—E. coli Hsp33 was cloned as described earlier (9Raman B. Kumar L.V.S. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the expression plasmid pET21a-Hsp33. Primary culture was grown overnight from transformed cells at 37 °C, and 1% inoculum of this primary culture was added to 1 liter of medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin for the secondary culture at 37 °C and 250 rpm. The secondary culture was grown until OD600 nm of the culture reached 0.6-0.8. The culture was then induced with 1 mm IPTG and grown for 5 more hours. Along with IPTG, ZnSO4 was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 10 min. The harvested cells were stored at -20 °C. The cells were resuspended (3 ml of buffer per gram of pellet) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (TEN buffer), and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. Hsp33 precipitated between 15 and 50% saturation by ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in TEN buffer and the protein solution applied to a Sephadex G-75 column (150 cm × 1.8 cm diameter) equilibrated with TEN buffer and was eluted at a flow rate of 20 ml/h using the same buffer with a fraction size of 2 ml. Fractions containing Hsp33 were pooled, and 200 mm ammonium sulfate was added to the protein. This protein solution was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 200 mm ammonium sulfate. The column was developed using 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Fractions containing pure Hsp33 were pooled, concentrated, and buffer exchanged with buffer A (40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 20 mm KCl and 200 μm of ZnSO4) using Amicon ultrafiltration unit and stored at -70 °C. Preparation of Reduced and Oxidized Hsp33—For chaperone assays, small angle x-ray scattering studies, and other experiments, purified Hsp33 was oxidized with 10 mm H2O2 for 4 h at different temperatures. Reduced Hsp33 was prepared by incubating the purified Hsp33 with 10 mm DTT for 2 h. For gel filtration studies, Hsp33 was reduced with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at 25 °C and subsequently oxidized by 10 mm H2O2 for varying durations at different temperatures. Gel Filtration Studies—Oligomer formation was studied by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex G-75 or Superose-12 HR 10/30 FPLC column. 80 μl of Hsp33 (1 mg/ml) oxidized in the presence or the absence of 500 mm NaCl was loaded on the Superdex G-75 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with or without 500 mm NaCl, respectively. To study the effect of NaCl concentration, Hsp33 oxidized at 43 °C in the presence of various concentrations of NaCl was loaded on a Superose-12 column previously equilibrated with the Tris-HCl buffer containing the appropriate concentration of NaCl. Molecular mass standards comprising blue dextran (2,000 kDa), BSA (67 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and RNase A (13.7 kDa) were used for calibration. Oligomer sizes, in the presence of PEG, were determined using Superose-6 HR 10/30 FPLC column. Hsp33 oxidized at 43 °C in the presence of 100 mg/ml PEG and 100 mm NaCl was applied to the column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. High molecular mass standards comprising BSA (67 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) were used for calibration. SDS-PAGE—Glutaraldehyde cross-linking studies on reduced Hsp33 or Hsp33 oxidized at 43 °C in the presence of 150 or 500 mm NaCl for 4 h were performed with 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h at 25 °C. The cross-linked products were loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by silver staining. To investigate the involvement of intermolecular disulfide bonds in the formation of higher oligomers, samples of reduced Hsp33 or Hsp33 oxidized at 43 °C in the presence of 500 mm NaCl or 100 mg/ml PEG 8000 for 4 h were loaded on a 12% non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. Small Angle X-ray Scattering Studies—The SAXS experiments were performed at beamline 15A of the Photon Factory at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan (13Amemiya Y. Wakabayashi K. Hamanaka T. Wakabayashi T. Matsushima T. Hashizume H. Nuclear Instrum. Methods. 1983; 208: 471-477Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The experimental details and the analysis of the scattering data were essentially the same as described earlier (14Arai M. Ito K. Inobe T. Nakao M. Maki K. Kamagata K. Kihara H. Amemiya Y. Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The sample solution in 1-mm path length mica-windowed cell was exposed to a monochromatic x-ray beam (1.5 Å). The temperature of the sample solution was maintained at 25 °C using a circulating water bath. Scattering patterns were recorded by a CCD-based x-ray detector, which consisted of a beryllium-windowed x-ray image intensifier (Be-XRII) (Hamamatsu, V5445P-MOD), an optical lens, a CCD image sensor, and a data acquisition system (Hamamatsu C7300) (14Arai M.

The camera length was set to be 1485 or 2375 mm depending on the scattering-angle region to be observed. The Rg and I (0) values were obtained using the Guinier approximation. ln I(Q)=ln I(0)−(Q2Rg2)/3, at small angle regions where ln I(Q) is linearly dependent on Q2. Q and I (Q) are the momentum transfer and intensity at zero scattering angle, respectively. Q is defined as Q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, 1.5 Å (16Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering.

The theoretical Rg values of Hsp33 monomer and dimer were calculated from the crystal structure (11Vijayalakshmi J. Mukhergee M.K. Graumann J. Jakob U. Saper M.A. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using the program Crysol (18Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2778) Google Scholar). To obtain shape information, the scattering data were converted to P(r) function by GNOM software using a Dmax value of 71 Å (19Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2969) Google Scholar). The P(r) function was taken to DAMMIN to generate ab initio shape data (20Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). This process was repeated 11 times and then averaged using DAMAVER. The high resolution, crystal structure data of Hsp33 (PDB 1HW7), and the ab initio shape data obtained from DAMMIN program were matched using SUPCOMB (21Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Applied Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Chaperone Assays—Citrate synthase is known to undergo aggregation upon heating at temperatures above 40 °C (22Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Citrate synthase (0.02 or 0.025 mg/ml) in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, was incubated at 43 °C. Light scattering was monitored in a Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cell holder and stirrer. The measurements were performed by setting the excitation and emission wavelengths at 360 nm and the excitation and emission band passes at 3 nm. To study the effect of NaCl, Hsp33 oxidized in the presence of 150 or 500 mm NaCl was used in the assay. Similarly, to study the effect of PEG, Hsp33 oxidized in buffer containing 100 mg/ml PEG 8000 and 100 mm NaCl was used in the assay. Aggregation of citrate synthase in the presence of required concentrations of NaCl or PEG alone were used as controls. Percent protection of aggregation was calculated relative to these controls. Percent protection of aggregation was calculated as (Ics-Ics+Hsp33)/It × 100, where It is the intensity of scattered light for citrate synthase alone at the end of the assay, and Ics+Hsp33 is the intensity of light scattered by the citrate synthase in the presence of Hsp33. Fluorescence Measurements—All fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-4010 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Intrinsic protein fluorescence of reduced and oxidized Hsp33 (0.2 mg/ml) was recorded by exciting the sample at 285 nm. The emission spectra were recorded from 295 to 380 nm by setting the excitation and emission slit widths at 5 nm and 3 nm, respectively. Time-resolved fluorescence quenching measurements were performed with the neutral quencher, acrylamide, using a picosecond time-correlated photon counting setup described earlier (23Lakshmikanth G.S. Krishnamoorthy G. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1100-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A Ti-sapphire femto/picosecond laser (Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) pumped by an Nd:YLF Laser (Millenia X, Spectra Physics) was used. 1-ps pulses of 888 nm radiation from the Ti-sapphire laser were frequency tripled to 295 nm using a frequency doubler/tripler (GWU, Spectra Physics). Fluorescence decay curves were obtained using a time-correlated single photon counting setup, coupled to a microchannel plate photomultiplier (model 2809u; Hamamatsu Corporation). The instrument response function (IRF) was obtained at 295 nm using a dilute colloidal suspension of bright nondairy coffee whitener. The half-width of IRF was ∼40 ps. The samples were excited at 295 nm, and the fluorescence emission was collected through a 310-nm cutoff filter followed by a monochromator at 340-350 nm. The cutoff filter was used to prevent the scattering of the excitation beam from the samples. In fluorescence lifetime measurements, the emission was measured at the magic angle (54.7°) to eliminate the contribution from the decay of anisotropy. The fluorescence decay curves at the magic angle were analyzed by deconvoluting the observed decay with IRF to obtain the intensity decay function represented as a sum of three exponentials: I(t) = ∑αi exp(-t/τi) i = 1-3, where I(t) is the fluorescence intensity at time t and αi is the amplitude of the ith lifetime τi, such that ∑iαi = 1. Tryptophan time-resolved fluorescence intensity measurements for reduced Hsp33 and Hsp33 oxidized at 25, 37, and 43 °C were made in the absence and the presence of various concentrations of acrylamide in buffer A. The concentration of Hsp33 used was 0.33 mg/ml. To probe the hydrophobic surfaces of the protein, polarity-sensitive fluorescent probe bis-ANS was used (24Musci G. Metz G.D. Tsunematsu H. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2034-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Stock solution of bis-ANS was prepared in methanol. To 0.2 mg/ml reduced or oxidized Hsp33 in buffer A, bis-ANS was added to a final concentration of 5 μm. Fluorescence spectra of the samples were recorded from 400 to 600 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 390 nm. Excitation and emission band passes were set at 5 nm. All spectra were recorded in the corrected spectrum mode. Temperature-dependent Structural Changes in Hsp33—Hsp33 is inactive as a chaperone in its reduced form, and oxidation is known to activate it to prevent the aggregation of target proteins. It provides an interesting example of a post-translational event acting as a switch to regulate the chaperone-like activity of Hsps. We have shown earlier that oxidative activation is associated with conformational change and increase in hydrophobicity (9Raman B. Kumar L.V.S. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Many small heat shock proteins are known to undergo temperature-dependent changes in their structure, which modulates their chaperone activity. We have previously shown that α-crystallin undergoes structural alteration above 30 °C, resulting in the re-organization of its hydrophobic surfaces and a concomitant increase in its chaperone activity (25Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23559-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Rao C.M. Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rajaraman K. Ghosh D. Datta S. Trivedi V.D. Sukhaswami M.B. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Rao C.M. Ramakrishna T. Raman B. Proc. Ind. Natl. Sci. Acad. 2002; 68: 349-365Google Scholar). The small heat shock protein, Hsp22 also exhibits temperature-dependent changes in the tertiary structure and increase in chaperone activity (28Chowdary T.K. Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown increase in chaperone activity of Hsp33 as a function of temperature; at elevated temperatures, the rate of Hsp33 dimerization is higher suggesting the involvement of structural rearrangements (12Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have investigated, using fluorescence and CD spectroscopy, the structural changes of Hsp33 as a function of temperature. Fig. 1 shows the intrinsic fluorescence spectra of reduced Hsp33 and Hsp33 oxidized at 25, 37, and 43 °C. Reduced Hsp33, upon exciting at 285 nm, exhibits an emission maximum at 351 nm whereas Hsp33 oxidized at 25 °C shows emission maximum at 346 nm. When Hsp33 is oxidized at elevated temperatures (37 and 43 °C), it shows larger blue shifts in the tryptophan emission maximum, the maxima being 335 and 330 nm at 37 °C and 43 °C, respectively. It is evident from Fig. 1 that the lone tryptophan residue of reduced Hsp33 is exposed to the solvent; oxidation leads to its burial in the hydrophobic environment. This process is much more pronounced at elevated temperatures, indicating conformational and/or quaternary structural changes. Reduced Hsp33 shows a less intense emission maximum, in addition to 351-nm emission, at around 305 nm (Fig. 1). This fluorescence (305 nm) is quenched upon oxidation. This result is in conformity with that of Graumann et al. (12Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) who observed quenched tyrosine fluorescence accompanied by substantially broadened fluorescence spectra suggesting an increased energy transfer between tyrosine and tryptophan residues. In order to investigate the accessibility of the lone tryptophan, we have carried out tryptophan lifetime measurements of reduced Hsp33 and Hsp33 oxidized at 25, 37, and 43 °C in the absence and presence of acrylamide. Fig. 2 shows the effect of increasing acrylamide concentration on the ratio of τ0/τ (where τ0 represents the lifetime in the absence of quencher, and τ is the lifetime in the presence of various concentrations of quencher) in reduced Hsp33 and Hsp33 oxidized at 25, 37, and 43 °C. Our time-resolved fluorescence data show that oxidation leads to increased burial of the lone tryptophan residue of Hsp33. The slopes of these plots yield the Stern-Volmer constants (Ksv), and the ratio of Ksv and τ yields the bimolecular quenching constant, Kq. Table I shows the average lifetimes, Ksv values, and the bimolecular quenching constants of Hsp33 under reduced and oxidized conditions. Upon oxidation, we have observed a slight increase in the average lifetime of the lone tryptophan residue and a 3-fold decrease in the bimolecular quenching constants (Table I). These results show that Hsp33 undergoes structural changes upon oxidation; the lone tryptophan residue, which is exposed in reduced Hsp33, gets buried in a relatively more hydrophobic environment upon oxidation at elevated temperatures.Table ILifetimes and quenching parameters obtained from time-resolved fluorescence studiesLifetimeaτ0 and τ600 are the average lifetimes obtained in the absence and in the presence of 600 mm acrylamide, respectively.KsvBimolecular quenching constant Kqτ0τ600nsM−1M−1 s−1Red Hsp332.50.625.132.05 × 109Ox Hsp3325 °C2.813.131.12 × 10937 °C31.192.770.92 × 10943 °C2.91.322.020.69 × 109a τ0 and τ600 are the average lifetimes obtained in the absence and in the presence of 600 mm acrylamide, respectively.

Oligomerization of Hsp33—Initial studies by Jakob et al. (5Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) suggested that Hsp33 is monomeric even upon activation, but subsequent biochemical and crystal structure studies on Hsp33 suggested that it forms dimers (10Kim S.J. Jeong D.G. Chi S.W. Lee J.S. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Vijayalakshmi J. Mukhergee M.K. Graumann J. Jakob U. Saper M.A. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The dimerization of oxidized Hsp33 as well as chaperone-like activity is temperature-dependent (12Graumann J. Lilie H. Tang X. Tucker K.A. Hoffmann J.H. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M. Bardwell J.C. Jakob U. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, glutaraldehyde cross-linking of the truncated Hsp33 (residues 1-235) in the presence of the target protein, luciferase, suggested the possibility of the formation of higher oligomers (10Kim S.J. Jeong D.G. Chi S.W. Lee J.S. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have investigated in detail the process of oligomerization upon oxidation of Hsp33. We have used gel filtration (Superdex G-75) to investigate the temperature-dependent dimerization of Hsp33. Fig. 3 shows the effect of temperature on the dimerization of Hsp33. Panel I in Fig. 3A shows the chromatogram of reduced Hsp33, whereas panel II shows that of Hsp33 oxidized at 25 °C. As can be seen from these panels, oxidation at 25 °C does not lead to dimerization, even after 4 h of oxidation (panel III). At 37 °C, reduced Hsp33 is monomeric (Fig. 3B, panel I), upon oxidation for 30 min, 1, 2, and 4 h, the dimer population gradually increases (panels II-V). The population of the dimer increases significantly at the heat shock temperature, 43 °C, with much reduced content of monomer (Fig. 3C, panel II-V). Interestingly, at later time points, a small population of oligomeric species could also be seen. This result indicates that Hsp33 could form oligomeric species upon oxidation at physiological (37 °C) and heat shock temperatures (43 °C), which might have functional significance. At all the temperatures studied, reduced Hsp33 remained monomeric (panel I of Fig. 3, A-C). Since hydrophobic interactions are enhanced in the presence of salt, we studied the effect of NaCl on the quaternary structure of Hsp33 upon oxidation as a function of temperature. Fig. 4A (panel II) shows that Hsp33 oxidized at 25 °C remains largely monomeric with a small extent of dimerization even in the presence of salt. Hsp33 oxidized at 37 °C, was a mixture of monomer, dimer, and higher order species that eluted in the void volume of the Superdex G-75 column (Fig. 4B). However, Hsp33 oxidized at 43 °C, eluted almost completely in the void volume on a Superdex G-75 column, with a small amount of monomer and dimer (Fig. 4C)."
https://openalex.org/W2084526009,"Carnitine acyltransferases have crucial functions in fatty acid metabolism. Members of this enzyme family show distinctive substrate preferences for short-, medium- or long-chain fatty acids. The molecular mechanism for this substrate selectivity is not clear as so far only the structure of carnitine acetyltransferase has been determined. To further our understanding of these important enzymes, we report here the crystal structures at up to 2.0-Å resolution of mouse carnitine octanoyltransferase alone and in complex with the substrate octanoylcarnitine. The structures reveal significant differences in the acyl group binding pocket between carnitine octanoyltransferase and carnitine acetyltransferase. Amino acid substitutions and structural changes produce a larger hydrophobic pocket that binds the octanoyl group in an extended conformation. Mutation of a single residue (Gly-553) in this pocket can change the substrate preference between short- and medium-chain acyl groups. The side chains of Cys-323 and Met-335 at the bottom of this pocket assume dual conformations in the substrate complex, and mutagenesis studies suggest that the Met-335 residue is important for catalysis. Carnitine acyltransferases have crucial functions in fatty acid metabolism. Members of this enzyme family show distinctive substrate preferences for short-, medium- or long-chain fatty acids.

Carnitine acyltransferases catalyze the reversible transfer of acyl groups between carnitine and coenzyme A (see Fig. 1A) (1Bieber L.L. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J.

Members of this family of enzymes include carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPTs) 1The abbreviations used are: CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferase; CrOT, carnitine octanoyltransferase; CrAT, carnitine acetyltransferase; r.m.s., root mean square. I and II (CPT-I, CPT-II), carnitine octanoyltransferase (CrOT), and carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) with substrate preferences for long-chain, medium-chain, and short-chain acyl groups, respectively. The catalytic domains of these enzymes contain about 600 amino acid residues (see Fig. 1B), and share ∼30% amino acid sequence identity (see supplemental Fig. 1). Carnitine acyltransferases are of crucial importance for the transport of fatty acids among different cellular compartments (2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar, 3Ramsay R.R. van der Gandour R.D. Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 4Kerner J. Hoppel C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The CPTs are associated with the mitochondrial compartment and are essential for the import of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for β-oxidation. The CoA esters of long-chain fatty acids are impermeable to the mitochondrial membrane. They must first be converted to carnitine esters by CPT-I, which is integrally associated with the outer membrane of the mitochondria through a unique N-terminal segment (see Fig. 1B) (5Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Zammit V.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14629-14634Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Upon transport into the mitochondria, the carnitine esters are converted back to CoA esters by CPT-II, which is located in the mitochondrial matrix. The CoA esters can then undergo β-oxidation for energy production. The CPTs are therefore key enzymes for the transport of long-chain fatty acids. Inherited mutational defects of these enzymes are the cause of many human diseases (2McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar, 3Ramsay R.R. van der Gandour R.D. Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). CPT-I deficiency is linked to serious episodes of hypoketonic hypoglycemia, whereas autosomal recessive deficiency of CPT-II is one of the most common inherited muscle lipid metabolism disorders (6Sigauke E. Rakheja D. Kitson K. Bennett M.J. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 1543-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Both missense and deletion mutations have been described for these enzymes, and the defect of the mutated enzymes is most often caused by their reduced catalytic activity. The CPTs are promising targets for drug development against several important human diseases (3Ramsay R.R. van der Gandour R.D. Leij F.R. Biochim. Biophys.

An irreversible inhibitor of CPT-I can reduce blood glucose levels in diabetic animals and humans, validating this enzyme as a target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. More recently, an agonist of CPT-I has been shown to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and reduce body weight in test animals, suggesting that such compounds may be efficacious against obesity (10Thupari J.N.

J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E97-E104Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the currently known modulators of CPT-I have rather poor pharmacokinetic properties, and new classes of compounds need to be identified. However, this process is hampered by the relative lack of structural information on these enzymes. CrOT (EC 2.3.1.137) contains 612 amino acid residues (Fig. 1B) and is localized in the peroxisomes (12Farrell S.O. Bieber L.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Ferdinandusse S. Mulders J. Ijlst L. Denis S. Dacremont G. Waterham H.R. Wanders R.J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is most active for substrates with a chain length between 6 and 10 carbon atoms and is less active with substrates containing 12 to 16 carbon atoms (14Farrell S.O. Fiol C.J. Reddy J.K. Bieber L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13089-13095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-oxidation of very long-chain and branched-chain fatty acids occurs in the peroxisomes. The medium- and short-chain CoA esters produced by peroxisomal β-oxidation are converted to carnitine esters by CrOT and peroxisomal CrAT, allowing their export to the cytosol and ultimately the mitochondria where they can undergo the final steps of β-oxidation (13Ferdinandusse S. Mulders J. Ijlst L. Denis S. Dacremont G. Waterham H.R. Wanders R.J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Ramsay R.R. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 28-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the peroxisomes, CrAT is also found in the mitochondria, where it may have a role in maintaining the acetyl-CoA:CoA balance. We have recently reported the crystal structures of mouse CrAT, alone and in complex with its substrate carnitine or CoA (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Ramsay R.R. Naismith J.H. Trends Biochem.

Ohno K. Hersh L.B. Rodgers D.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2047-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), have also been reported. These studies reveal that carnitine acyltransferases contain two structural domains, N and C domains, that unexpectedly share the same backbone fold with each other and with that of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (21Leslie A.G.W. Moody P.C. Shaw W.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The active site of the enzyme is located at the interface of the two domains, accessible from the surface of the enzyme through two tunnels. The structural analyses suggest that the Met564 residue of CrAT may block the entrance to the acyl group binding site, limiting the substrate preference of this enzyme to short-chain acyl groups. Mutagenesis and structural studies confirm the importance of this residue in determining substrate selectivity of CrAT such that the M564G single-site mutant has significantly enhanced activity toward medium-chain acyl groups (22Hsiao Y-S. Jogl G. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31584-31589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Cordente A.G. Lopez-Vinas E. Vazquez M.I. Swiegers J.H. Pretorius I.S.

We report here the crystal structures of mouse CrOT, alone and in complex with the substrate octanoylcarnitine, at up to 2.0-Å resolution. This is the first time that the binding mode of an acyl group to the carnitine acyltransferases has been observed experimentally. The overall structure of CrOT is remarkably similar to that of CrAT, and the two enzymes share 36% amino acid sequence identity. Significant differences are observed however in the acyl group binding site of the two enzymes. Amino acid substitutions together with structural differences between the two enzymes help define the binding site for medium-chain acyl groups in CrOT. Our structures show that a methionine residue at the bottom of the octanoyl binding site assumes dual conformations in the complex with octanoylcarnitine, and mutagenesis studies show that this residue is important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Protein Expression and Purification—Full-length mouse CrOT was sub-cloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen) and over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The expression construct introduced a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus of the protein. The soluble protein was purified by nickel-agarose affinity chromatography, anion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. The protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.5) and 20 mm NaCl and stored at -80 °C. The C-terminal His tag was not removed for crystallization. For the production of selenomethionyl protein, the expression construct was transformed into B834(DE3) cells. The bacterial growth was carried out in defined LeMaster media (24Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar), and the protein was purified using the same protocol as for the wild-type protein. Protein Crystallization—Small crystals of the free enzyme of mouse CrOT were obtained at 4 °C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 62% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Larger crystals were grown from the same condition by microseeding followed by macroseeding. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was cross-seeded with microcrystals from native protein to obtain adequate crystals. For data collection, crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen directly in the mother liquor. To determine the binding mode of the octanoylcarnitine substrate by soaking experiments, the free enzyme crystals were first soaked in a Tris-buffered solution to remove the Hepes molecule that was observed in the active site. Crystals in the Tris buffer were soaked with octanoylcarnitine for various lengths of time. It was discovered that the acylcarnitine was rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme, and we invariably observed only the binding of carnitine to the active site if the soaking time was longer than 20 min. From a 5-min soaking experiment, we were able to observe the binding of octanoylcarnitine to one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, whereas the other molecule contained carnitine. Data Collection and Processing—X-ray diffraction data were collected on an ADSC charge-coupled device at the X4A beamline of Brookhaven National Laboratory. A selenomethionyl single-wave-length anomalous diffraction data set to 2.0-Å resolution was collected at 100 K on a crystal of the free enzyme, and a native reflection data set to 2.2-Å resolution was collected for the octanoylcarnitine soak. The diffraction images were processed and scaled with the HKL package (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the space group R3, with cell dimensions of a = b = 162.6 Å and c = 158.6 Å for the free enzyme. There are two molecules of CrOT in the crystallographic asymmetric unit.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The locations of 34 selenium atoms were determined with the program SnB (26Weeks C.M. Miller R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 120-124Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and further confirmed with SHELXS (27Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 467-473Crossref Scopus (19251) Google Scholar). Reflection phases to 1.8-Å resolution were calculated based on the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data and improved with the program SOLVE (28Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), which also automatically located a significant portion of the residues in both molecules. The atomic model was fit into the electron density with the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The structure refinement was carried out with the program CNS (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The statistics of the structure refinement are summarized in Table I. Mutagenesis and Kinetic Studies—The mutants were designed based on the structural information, created with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), and verified by sequencing. The substrate preference of wild-type and mutant CrOT enzymes were determined by kinetic studies following a protocol reported earlier (31Ramsay R.R. Derrick J.P. Friend A.S. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reaction buffer contained 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 125 μm 4,4′-dithiobispyridine (dissolved in ethanol), 0.5 mm acyl-CoA, 2 mm carnitine, and 0.5 μg of enzyme in a volume of 0.2 ml. The reaction was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 324 nm. The assays were repeated 2-5 times for each enzyme preparation with each substrate to verify the observed reaction velocity. Structure Determination of the M335V and C323M Mutants—The M335V and C323M mutants of CrOT were crystallized with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method using essentially the same condition as the wild-type enzyme. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the X4A beamline of the National Synchroton Light Source, and the crystals are isomorphous to those of the wild type. The data processing and structure refinement followed the same protocol as that for the wild-type enzyme of structures reported here. Atomic Coordinates—The atomic coordinates of structures reported here were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1XL7, 1XL8, 1XMC, 1XMD). Structure Determination—The crystal structure of the free enzyme of mouse CrOT was solved at 2.0-Å resolution using the selenomethionyl single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method (32Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). There are two molecules of CrOT in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, and 34 of the expected 36 selenium positions were located from the anomalous difference data. The current atomic model has an R value of 19.0%, and the majority of the residues (92.6%) are in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot (data not shown). The crystallographic information is summarized in Table I. The structure of CrOT in complex with octanoylcarnitine has been determined at 2.2-Å resolution (Table I) from a crystal that was soaked with this substrate for approximately 5 min. We found that octanoylcarnitine was rapidly hydrolyzed by the crystals, and those soaked for longer times contained only carnitine in the active site (data not shown). With a soaking time of 5 min, our crystallographic analysis showed that one of the two CrOT molecules in the asymmetric unit contained octanoylcarnitine in the active site, whereas the other contained only carnitine. This suggests that the two enzyme molecules might have different catalytic activity in the crystalline state. In both the free enzyme and the octanoylcarnitine complex, residues 1-10 and the C-terminal hexahistidine tag are disordered. In addition, residues 403-413 have weak electron density, and these residues are not included in the atomic model for one of the two CrOT molecules. The two CrOT molecules in the asymmetric unit have essentially the same conformation, with an r.m.s. distance between equivalent Cα atoms of 0.36 Å for the free enzyme and 0.39 Å for the octanoylcarnitine complex (calculated with LSQMAN for all Cα pairs). The intermolecular contacts between the two molecules are generally weak and hydrophilic in nature. The structural information is consistent with our observations that CrOT migrates as a monomer on the gel filtration column (data not shown). Other biochemical data also suggest a monomeric native structure for CrOT (31Ramsay R.R. Derrick J.P. Friend A.S. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our attempts at determining the structure of CrOT in complex with the CoA substrate have so far not been successful. Examination of the packing of the current crystal form shows that the CoA binding site is likely to be occluded by neighboring molecules in the crystal, explaining the lack of success with the soaking protocol. At the same time, we have not been able to crystallize CrOT in the presence of CoA. Overall Structure of CrOT—The structure of CrOT consists of 20 α-helices (named α1 through α20) and 16 β-strands (β1 through β16) and can be divided into two domains, N and C domains (Fig. 2A). The N domain covers residues 102 to 393, whereas the C domain covers residues 394-612 together with residues 11-101 at the N terminus. The two domains have the same backbone fold with a central mixed β-sheet and several flanking helices as their common features (Fig. 2A). A total of 68 Cα positions can be superimposed structurally between the two domains, and the r.m.s. distance for these Cα atoms is 2.1 Å. However, the amino acid sequence identity for these structurally equivalent residues is only 9%. The backbone fold of the two domains of CrOT is related to other acetyltransferases, especially chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (21Leslie A.G.W. Moody P.C. Shaw W.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the catalytic domain of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (33Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Schulze E. Kalk K.H. Westphal A.H. de Kok A. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1992; 255: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) as was first observed with the structure of CrAT (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Wu D. Govindasamy L. Lian W. Gu Y. Kukar T. Agbandje-McKenna M. McKenna R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13159-13165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The carnitine acyltransferases may have evolved by gene duplication of a primordial, prokaryotic acetyltransferase. The overall structure of CrOT is remarkably similar to that of CrAT (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and the positions of the secondary structure elements are conserved in both enzymes (Fig. 2B). The r.m.s. distance between equivalent Cα atoms of the two structures is 1.4 Å (calculated with LSQMAN), consistent with the fact that the two enzymes share 36% amino acid sequence identity (supplemental Fig. 1) (34Chothia C. Lesk A.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). However, significant differences were observed in the acyl group binding region of the active site (see below), which defines the differing substrate selectivity of these two enzymes. In addition, several loops on the surface of the N domain have large differences between the two enzymes (Fig. 2B). The Carnitine Binding Site—The active site of CrOT is located at the interface of the two domains (Fig. 2A). The catalytic residue, His-327, is positioned near the center of the enzyme. It is accessible from opposite surfaces of the enzyme through two tunnels that meet at the active site (Fig. 3A) (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). One of these tunnels is for binding the carnitine substrate, whereas the other is for CoA. In the structure of CrOT, a third tunnel extends from the active site toward the core of the N domain (Fig. 3A). This is the tunnel for binding the medium-chain acyl group of the substrate. In the crystal that was soaked with octanoylcarnitine, one of the CrOT molecules in the asymmetric unit has octanoylcarnitine in the active site (Fig. 3A), whereas the other has only carnitine. Superimposing the two protein molecules shows that the positions of carnitine are the same in the two complexes. This confirms that the presence of the acyl group does not disturb the binding of carnitine. Next we compared the binding mode of carnitine in complex with CrOT to that in complex with CrAT (Fig. 3B). Although the overall binding modes of the carnitine molecules are similar, there are recognizable differences in their positions. The carboxylate group of carnitine shifts by about 0.7 Å in the CrOT complex relative to the CrAT complex (Fig. 3B), although the carboxylate is recognized by an equivalent set of intricate hydrogen bonding and ion pair interactions (Fig. 3C). Only two residues are different between CrOT and CrAT in this binding site, Asp-331 (Glu-347 in CrAT) and Thr-441 (Ser-454 in CrAT), but these differences do not affect the binding of carnitine (Fig. 3B). The largest difference in the binding mode of carnitine is observed for the trimethylammonium group, which shifts by about 1.1 Å in the complex with CrOT (Fig. 3B). Moreover, residues that line the trimethylammonium binding pocket show large variations between CrOT and CrAT (Fig. 3B), including Val-555 (Phe-566 in CrAT) and Phe-566 (Cys-577 in CrAT). Interestingly, these two variations are compensatory of each other, which help to maintain the overall shape and the hydrophobic nature of the trimethylammonium binding site. The larger changes in both the position of the trimethylammonium group and in its binding pocket are consistent with the notion that this group is not bound through specific interactions with the carnitine acyltransferases and that the positive charge of this group may instead be important for stabilizing the transition state of the catalysis (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The free enzyme crystals were grown from a solution containing Hepes and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Our crystallographic analysis showed that both molecules are bound in the active site of the enzyme. The sulfonic acid of Hepes is situated in the binding site for the carboxylate group of carnitine, suggesting that this binding site is an “anion hole” that can recognize many different types of negatively charged groups. The Binding Site for Medium-chain Acyl Groups—Our crystallographic analysis revealed well defined electron density for the octanoylcarnitine substrate in the active site of CrOT (Fig. 4A). This is the first time that the binding mode of an acyl group to the carnitine acyltransferases has been observed experimentally. The acyl group has relatively weaker electron density, especially at the C7′ and C8′ positions. This may be caused by partial disorder of the end of the acyl group. Another possibility is that octanoylcarnitine is present only in partial occupancy. However, this is less likely as the average temperature factor value for the substrate (including its acyl group) is essentially the same as that for the enzyme. The octanoyl group is bound in an extended but slightly bent conformation (Fig. 4B). The binding pocket is lined in its entire length with hydrophobic residues, coming from strand β1 (Phe-103, Gly-105), β8 (Cys-323, Cys-325), β13 (Ser-544), β13-β14 loop (Val-546), β14 (Val-551, Gly-553, Val-555), β15 (Phe-566), and α12 (Ala-332, Met-333, Met-335, Val-336). These residues define a narrow, cylindrical-shaped binding site (Fig. 5A), which represents a good fit to the contour of acyl groups. With the exception of Met-335 and Cys-323, residues in this binding site show little conformational change between the free enzyme and the octanoylcarnitine complex, suggesting that the acyl group binding site is essentially preformed in the structure of CrOT. The side chains of Met-335 and Cys-323 assume dual conformations in the complex with octanoylcarnitine (supplemental Fig. 2A), whereas in the free enzyme and the carnitine complex only a single conformation is observed (supplemental Fig. 2B). These two side chains interact with each other and with the C8′ atom of the octanoyl group (Fig. 4B), and their disorder may create additional space for the octanoyl group (see below). The carbonyl oxygen of the acyl group is pointed toward the side chain of Ser-544, although the hydroxyl group of the side chain is not positioned correctly for hydrogen bonding to the substrate (Fig. 4B). Ser-544 is the second serine residue in the Ser-Thr-Ser motif that is strictly conserved among the carnitine acyltransferases (supplemental Fig. 1). Structural and mutagenesis studies suggest that this side chain may help stabilize the oxyanion in the tetrahedral intermediate of the reaction (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Cronin C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By assuming a different rotamer, Ser-544 should be able to hydrogen bond to the oxyanion of the intermediate. At the same time, our structural analysis of CrAT suggests that the trimethylammonium group of carnitine may play a more important role in stabilizing the transition state, and carnitine acyltransferases are an example of substrate assisted catalysis (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the structure of CrOT in complex with octanoylcarnitine, a water molecule is located 3.2 Å from the carbonyl carbon (C1′) of the octanoyl group (Figs. 4A and 3B). This water molecule is hydrogen bonded to the main chain amide of Ala-332 (in helix α12) (Fig. 3C) and is also observed in the structures of the free enzyme and the carnitine complex of CrOT. It occupies roughly the same position as the thiol group of the CoA substrate that is observed in the structure of CrAT (16Jogl G. Tong L. Cell. 2003; 112: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that this water molecule can function as a nucleophile and initiate the hydrolysis of bound acylcarnitine substrates. This explains our observation of rapid hydrolysis of acylcarnitines during soaking experiments. Molecular Determinants of Substrate Selectivity of CrOT and CrAT—Sequence and structural variations between CrOT and CrAT in the acyl group binding site determine their substrate preferences. Remarkably, only three of the residues (Val-336, Ser-544, Val-546) in this binding site are conserved between the two enzymes (supplemental Fig. 1). Moreover, residue Val-546 assumes a different conformation in the structure of CrOT (Fig. 4B) despite being conserved between the two enzymes. This conformation places its side chain further from the octanoyl group (Fig. 4B), thereby creating additional space in the binding site. Sequence variations in the other residues in the binding site probably play a larger role in determining the substrate preferences of the two enzymes. Our structural analysis shows that the most important difference between CrOT and CrAT is the replacement of Gly-553 (β14) in CrOT with Met-564 in CrAT (supplemental Fig. 1). This residue is Met only in CrAT and is Gly in CrOT and also in all the CPTs (supplemental Fig. 1). The Met side chain fills the acyl group binding site and would actually clash with the octanoyl group (Fig. 4B). Recent studies show that the single-site M564G mutation of CrAT is sufficient to alter the substrate selectivity of that enzyme, so that hexanoyl-CoA is the preferred substrate (22Hsiao Y-S. Jogl G. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31584-31589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Cordente A.G. Lopez-Vinas E. Vazquez M.I. Swiegers J.H. Pretorius I.S. Gomez-Puertas P. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Serra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33899-33908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that Met-564 in CrAT may be the “gatekeeper” to the binding site for medium- and long-chain acyl groups. The structural, sequence, and biochemical studies therefore suggest that the G553M mutation of CrOT should be able to limit the substrate preference of CrOT to short-chain acyl groups. Our kinetic characterization of the G553M mutant of CrOT confirms the important role of Gly-553 in defining the substrate selectivity of CrOT (Fig. 6) as has also been reported in a different study (23Cordente A.G. Lopez-Vinas E. Vazquez M.I. Swiegers J.H. Pretorius I.S. Gomez-Puertas P. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Serra D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33899-33908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The G553M mutant can no longer utilize octanoyl-CoA as a substrate, although the activity with the short-chain acetyl-CoA substrate is maintained. Additional sequence variations between CrOT and CrAT may also have an impact on the substrate selectivity of these enzymes. The side chain of Tyr-341 in CrAT is within 3.3 Å of the C4′ atom of octanoylcarnitine. This residue is replaced with Cys-325 in CrOT (supplemental Fig. 1), alleviating the contact with the octanoyl group (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, Phe-103 of CrOT replaces Pro-120 of CrAT, and the phenyl ring occupies part of the space vacated by the Tyr-341 side chain (Fig. 4B). In addition, replacement of Gly-105 in CrOT by Val-122 in CrAT may create unfavorable contacts with the C8′ atom of the octanoyl group. Finally, residues 546-552 of CrOT (β13-β14 loop) have a different conformation compared with their equivalents in CrAT (Fig. 4B), which also affects the binding site near the C8′ atom. Functional Relevance of the Disordering of the Met-335 and Cys-323 Side Chains—Our structural analysis shows that the side chains of Met-335 and Cys-323 assume dual conformations in the complex with octanoylcarnitine. The two conformations of Met-335 are distinguished by the placement of the SD and CE atoms in its side chain. In one conformation, these atoms are located closer to the C8′ atom of octanoylcarnitine (Fig. 4B), whereas they are swung away in the other conformation. It is likely that the dual conformation in the side chain of Cys-323 is induced by that of Met-335, as the two side chains are in direct contact with each other (Fig. 4B). What is the functional role, if any, for the disordering of these two residues? Molecular surface analysis suggests that when the Met-335 side chain is further from the octanoyl group, a larger acyl group binding pocket could be formed, which might allow the enzyme to utilize longer fatty acids as substrates (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, this Met residue is replaced by a smaller Val residue in the CPTs (supplemental Fig. 1), which also suggests that this residue might control access by the long-chain substrates. To assess the functional relevance of these residues, we have created single-site mutants of CrOT, replacing Met-335 with Val (M335V mutant) or Ala (M335A), as well as replacing Cys-323 with Met (C323M mutant). The C323M mutant was chosen because the equivalent residue of Cys-323 in CrAT is Met (supplemental Fig. 1). The kinetic data show that the C323M mutant has slightly higher catalytic activity with the octanoyl-CoA substrate but maintains the same substrate preference as the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 6). Somewhat unexpectedly, our kinetic experiments show that the M335V mutant has significantly reduced catalytic activity (Fig. 6) even with the octanoyl-CoA substrate. Similarly, the M335A mutant also has a loss in catalytic activity (Fig. 6). The kinetic data suggest that Met-335 may be important for the catalysis by CrOT, although neither mutant displays enhanced activity with the long-chain substrates (Fig. 6). To examine whether the mutations can disturb the conformation of the enzyme, we have determined the crystal structures of the M335V and C323M mutants at up to 2.0-Å resolution (Table I). The structural analyses demonstrate that neither mutation causes any significant changes in the structure of the enzyme (supplemental Fig. 3). As expected, the M335V mutant appears to have an enlarged acyl group binding site (Fig. 5C). The molecular mechanism for the reduced catalytic activity of the M335V mutant is currently not clear. In summary, we have determined the crystal structure of mouse CrOT alone and in complex with the substrate octanoylcarnitine at up to 2.0-Å resolution. Comparison of CrOT with CrAT demonstrates how the variation of critical residues can give rise to distinctive substrate preferences within a common overall protein fold. Structure-based mutagenesis studies of CrOT and CrAT indicate that a single amino acid residue (Gly-553 in CrOT, equivalent to Met-564 in CrAT) can control the substrate preference between medium- and short-chain substrates. In contrast, our mutagenesis studies suggest that the selectivity for long-chain substrates may be determined by more complicated factors, possibly the interactions among several different residues, a detailed understanding of which will have to await the structural information on the CPTs.

Acting as mobile buffers, calbindins are thought to ferry calcium in bulk and simultaneously protect against its potentially cytotoxic effects. Here, we contradict this dogma by showing that teeth and bones were produced normally in null mutant mice lacking calbindin28kDa. Structural analysis of dental enamel, the development of which depends critically on active calcium transport, showed that mineralization was unaffected in calbindin28kDa-null mutants. An unchanged rate of calcium transport was verified by measurements of 45Ca incorporation into developing teeth in vivo. In enamel-forming cells, the absence of calbindin28kDa was not compensated by other cytosolic calcium-binding proteins as detectable by 45Ca overlay, two-dimensional gel, and equilibrium binding analyses. Despite a 33% decrease in cytosolic buffer capacity, cytotoxicity was not evident in either the null mutant enamel or its formative cells. This is the first definitive evidence that calbindins are not required for active calcium transport, either as ferries or as facilitative buffers. Moreover, in challenging the broader notion of a cytosolic route for calcium, the findings support an alternative paradigm involving passage via calcium-tolerant organelles.

Moreover, in challenging the broader notion of a cytosolic route for calcium, the findings support an alternative paradigm involving passage via calcium-tolerant organelles. The active transport of calcium across cells holds widespread importance in medicine and biology, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Operating in many places (e.g. gut, kidney, placenta, teeth, bones, oviduct, lung, inner ear), active transport is used to control the amount of calcium in body fluids and so impacts on nutrition, biomineralization, fertility, respiration, and hearing (1Hubbard M.J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 437-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 2Wood J.D. Muchinsky S.J. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Tempel B.L. J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). Superior control is achieved by passaging calcium actively through cells rather than passively between them, but this comes at the risk of cytotoxicity should the ability to regulate intracellular calcium be overburdened. Mechanistically, active transport is considered in three steps: the entry of calcium to the cell, transit across it, and extrusion at the other side. The transit step has received the most attention over several decades, being considered rate-limiting and having key molecular players defined. However, recent molecular characterization of calcium entry channels has transformed the field by providing a new mechanistic focus for vitamin D-restricted transport (3Peng J.B. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 158-163PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 529-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). With these advances reigniting interest in therapeutic applications, it is important to revisit what happens following calcium entry. The 30-year-old paradigm that calcium is ferried through cytosol by mobile calcium-binding proteins (calbindins) remains widely accepted (3Peng J.B. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 158-163PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 529-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 5Wasserman R.H. Fullmer C.S. J.

Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 33: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Calbindins are thought to facilitate the naturally poor diffusion of calcium in cytosol and simultaneously buffer calcium at safe concentrations. Comprehensively supporting this view, tight correlations between calbindin expression and vitamin D-dependent transport were found in intestine and kidney, and mathematical modeling verified that calbindin could boost the self-diffusion rate of calcium to the required extent (70-fold). This mechanism appears robust and flexible since all major calcium-transporting tissues express either the 28- or 9-kDa type of calbindin (1Hubbard M.J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 437-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 10Feher J.J. Fullmer C.S. Wasserman R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C517-C526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Active calcium transport is crucial for normal production of tooth enamel, and it appeared that the calbindin ferry model would apply here too. Enamel, the most highly calcified of all tissues, is formed in two stages (secretion, maturation) involving low and high rates of calcium transport, respectively. Calbindin28kDa is expressed abundantly in enamel-forming cells in a vitamin D-dependent fashion, and calbindin9kDa is also expressed at trace levels (11Berdal A. Hotton D. Pike J.W. Mathieu H. Dupret J.M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, however, proteome analysis revealed that calbindin28kDa was down-regulated during maturation, whereas calcium-handling proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER/Ca2+ stores) 1The abbreviation used is: ER, endoplasmic reticulum. were elevated in parallel with calcium transport. These and other findings led us to postulate a “calcium transcytosis” mechanism whereby the ER serves as a transcellular pipeline for calcium (1Hubbard M.J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 437-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Hubbard M.J. Connect.

Null mutant mice completely lacking calbindin28kDa (15Airaksinen M.S. Eilers J. Garaschuk O. Thoenen H. Konnerth A. Meyer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) constitute a powerful tool to pursue this stimulating possibility further. These animals maintain serum calcium normally but have a distinctive neurological phenotype attributable to diminished calcium buffering in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (15Airaksinen M.S. Eilers J. Garaschuk O. Thoenen H. Konnerth A. Meyer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 16Barski J.J. Hartmann J. Rose C.R. Hoebeek F. Morl K. Noll-Hussong M. De Zeeuw C.I. Konnerth A. Meyer M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3469-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study addressed the hypothesis that, should calbindin28kDa be crucial for active calcium transport, its absence in null mutants will either disrupt enamel mineralization or be compensated by overexpression of equivalent cytosolic buffers. Our approach involved comparative analysis of null mutants and wild type controls using biochemical, physiological, and morphological measures, paying particular attention to the issues of molecular compensation and cytotoxicity. Although the primary focus was on enamel, bone and dentine were also characterized because calbindin28kDa is expressed in their formative cells, osteoblasts and odontoblasts (17Berdal A. Hotton D. Saffar J.L. Thomasset M. Nanci A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 768-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Bellido T. Huening M. Raval-Pandya M. Manolagas S.C. Christakos S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26328-26332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The results provide a consistent picture that seems incompatible with calbindins playing a key role in active calcium transport, either as a ferry or as a facilitatory buffer. Animals and Isolation of Tissues—All animal experimentation complied with national ethical and gene regulatory requirements. Transgenic mice were from a colony we established at Dunedin by crossing calbindin28kDa-null mutants (15Airaksinen M.S. Eilers J. Garaschuk O. Thoenen H. Konnerth A. Meyer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) with local C57BL/6 wild types. Heterozygote crosses gave null mutant offspring at Mendelian frequency and with equivalent weights as wild type littermates (quantified at 5, 9, and 44 days old). Genotyping was done using a PCR procedure (19Sooy K. Schermerhorn T. Noda M. Surana M. Rhoten W.B. Meyer M. Fleischer N. Sharp G.W. Christakos S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34343-34349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and corroborated for all reported experiments by immunoblot analysis of brain samples using a mixture of antibodies against calbindin28kDa and calretinin (the latter providing a positive control for null mutants). Developing mandibular first molars (5 and 9 days postnatal for secretion and maturation, respectively) and soft tissues were isolated essentially as reported for rat (12Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For morphology, isolated hemimandibles were stripped of soft tissue using household bleach and then water-washed and air-dried thoroughly. An additional washing step with SDS was used to ensure delipidation of the whole skeletons used for chemical analysis. Morphological and Chemical Characterization of Teeth and Bone— Hard tissues were examined just before the first molars erupted, when eruption was complete, and 1 week after weaning (days 12, 19, and 28, respectively). Macroscopic examinations were made under a dissecting microscope and by x-radiography (molybdenum source at 32 kV, Kodak Industrex SR5 film), and abrasion resistance was assessed with a dental probe and during preparation for scanning electron microscopy as follows. Null mutant and wild type hemimandibles were mounted pairwise in epoxy glue, and the erupted portion of both incisors was excised accurately at the bony margin using a diamond disc. The retained tooth faces were then polished (Aloxite-1200 slurry), etched (0.1% nitric acid, 3 × 10 s), coated, and examined essentially as before (21Hubbard M.J. J. Dent. Res. 1982; 61: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Morphometric analysis was done on digital images (×150) using NIH Image software. For histology, 7-day-old hemimandibles were fixed by immersion in formalin, demineralized, and processed through wax (22Shnyder S.D. Hubbard M.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Skeletal chemistry was analyzed on samples (two 44-day-old males and females of each genotype) prepared as above, powdered, weighed individually (“dry residue”), and then pooled for triplicated analyses of mineral ash, calcium, and phosphorus by a commercial laboratory (ChemSearch, Dunedin, New Zealand). Calcium Transport into Developing Teeth—The 45Ca transport assay was based on a novel procedure we have characterized extensively in rat, as will be reported elsewhere. In brief, mandibular first molars were isolated at various periods after intraperitoneal injection of 45Ca (20 μl of saline containing 3 μl of 45Ca; CES3 from Amersham Biosciences), and then the hard (enamel, dentine) and soft (enamel cells, pulp) tissue components were dissected apart and extracted twice under sonication with 0.2 m HCl prior to liquid scintillation counting. Serum harvested at decapitation was extracted and quantified likewise. Since serum 45Ca decreased markedly over the first 60 min, 45Ca mineral values were normalized to a constant substrate activity (i.e. 1000 cpm 45Ca/μl serum), yielding linear progress curves for hard tissue as noted under “Results.” Moreover the 3-fold increased rate seen at maturation (see Fig. 3; data pooled from similar numbers of 8, 9, and 10 day olds) was close to that predicted (4-fold over secretion (1Hubbard M.J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 437-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)), suggesting the 45Ca mineral was located mainly in enamel. In contrast, soft tissue uptake plateaued within 20 min, at which time it comprised ≤3% of the corresponding value for hard tissue. Protein Biochemistry—Procedures for immunoblotting, 45Ca overlay, two-dimensional PAGE, densitometric quantitation, and normalization of sample loadings by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE were reported previously (23Hubbard M.J. McHugh N.J. Carne D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1945-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Epithelial extracts from mandibular first molars were prepared in buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 as described (23Hubbard M.J. McHugh N.J. Carne D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1945-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) except that tissue was disrupted by repeated freeze-thawing and bath sonication. The non-denaturing 45Ca binding microassay was done on nuclease-treated EGTA-soluble extracts as before (12Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using enriched cytosol released from semi-intact cells by five freeze-thaw cycles (23Hubbard M.J. McHugh N.J. Carne D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1945-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Assays were done within the linear range (≤10 μl of extract, r > 0.98), and null mutant extracts were reconstituted with pure calbindin28kDa to wild type levels essentially as before (20Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed with Student's t test (two-tailed, homoscedastic). Teeth and Bone Are Structurally Normal in Calbindin28kDa-Null Mutants—Mineralization of enamel takes place before the tooth erupts from its developmental site inside the jawbone. During this process, calcium passes from the systemic circulation, across the enamel-forming cells (ameloblasts) and then out into the developing enamel matrix, where it becomes incorporated into mineral (Fig. 1F). Quantitative variation of this active transport process will be reflected in enamel mineral through differences in rate and total amount of production. If transport is disrupted qualitatively, so that calcium passes between instead of through the cells, mineralization will stall and lose its highly refined microstructure. The enamel cells are also likely to reflect major alterations in calcium transport, at the molecular and perhaps morphological levels (1Hubbard M.J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 437-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To address these possibilities, we initially compared enamel formation in calbindin28kDa-null mutants and wild type controls using a variety of conventional structural approaches (Fig. 1). Null mutant teeth (n = 12) were found to be morphologically normal by visual inspection and x-radiography (Fig. 1, A-D). Enamel in null mutants exhibited the same physical properties as controls, including high radiographic density (Fig. 1, C and D), color, translucence and reflectiveness (Fig. 1E), and abrasion resistance. Standard enamel microstructure, comprising highly ordered assemblies of mineral crystals and prisms, was also evident by scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 1G). Morphometric analysis indicated that normal total amounts of enamel mineral were produced in null mutants (≥99 ± 1% versus wild types; ± S.E., n = 4), whether being nursed on milk or consuming a solid diet (Fig. 2A). The developmental rate of mineralization was also unaltered, as evident from the incompletely formed enamel at the necks of unerupted molars (not shown). Finally, histological examination of 7-day-old hemimandibles (n = 5) showed that null mutant enamel cells retained the classical features of a columnar epithelium during secretion (Fig. 1F) and maturation. No signs of cellular distress were visible either histologically (e.g. gross cellular debris, fragmented Tomes' processes) or in the enamel (e.g. discoloration, pitting). Collectively, by showing that mineralization was unaltered both qualitatively and quantitatively, these results implied that calcium was transported normally into null mutant enamel. Like enamel, dentine and bone were indistinguishable when compared in null mutants and wild types using macroscopy, x-ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and histology (Fig. 1). Moreover, chemical analysis of the skeletons showed equal contents of total mineral, calcium, and phosphate (≥98 ± 1%; n = 4), indicating that null mutants produced and retained bone mass normally (Fig. 2B). Calcium Is Transported Normally into Developing Teeth of Calbindin28kDa-Null Mutants—To test calcium transport more directly, we developed a radiotracer assay to measure the rate at which calcium is added to developing tooth mineral in vivo. Initially, a linear incorporation rate consistent with the expected steady progression of calcium transport and mineralization was verified by introducing 45Ca to the systemic circulation and measuring its uptake into molar teeth after various intervals. Subject to normalization of serum 45Ca (i.e. substrate) levels as described under “Experimental Procedures,” 45Ca mineral accumulated linearly for over 60 min (r > 0.97; not shown). Using this novel assay, null mutants were found to have the same calcium transport rate as heterozygotes and wild type controls (≥94 ± 6% versus wild types; n = 15-32), during both maturation and secretion, where calcium transport and calbindin28kDa expression levels are highest, respectively (Fig. 3). These results endorsed the structural evidence that calcium transport was unaffected in null mutants, raising the potential for functional compensation. Absence of Calbindin28kDa Is Not Compensated by Overexpression of like Calcium-binding Proteins—Since calcium transport appeared normal in the null mutants, we next searched for compensatory up-regulation of other cytosolic calcium-binding proteins. Calmodulin was examined because it and calbindin28kDa comprise the major cytosolic buffers in murine enamel cells (Fig. 4A) (12Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and might overlap functionally (24Reisner P.D. Christakos S. Vanaman T.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Timmermans J.A. Bindels R.J. Van Os C.H. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1981S-1986SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using 45Ca overlay analysis, calmodulin expression was found to be unaltered in null mutants (95 ± 3% versus wild types; p > 0.5). Next, hypothesizing that in heterozygotes the remaining allele might undergo compensatory overexpression, calbindin28kDa levels were quantified carefully. However, heterozygote expression levels were half those in wild types (52 ± 5%, for combined data from immunoblotting and 45Ca overlay analyses), commensurate with the genetic ratio. Turning to other members of the calmodulin superfamily previously identified in murine enamel cells, neither these (calbindin9kDa, calcineurin B, parvalbumin/CaBP12kDa (11Berdal A. Hotton D. Pike J.W. Mathieu H. Dupret J.M. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 12Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) nor any other similar proteins were found to be overexpressed significantly (Fig. 4A). Recognizing that not all calcium binding activities might survive the 45Ca overlay procedure, two-dimensional PAGE was then used to compare expression levels of acidic proteins globally. Calbindin28kDa was conspicuously absent from null mutants as expected, but no consistent differences in over 200 other major proteins were revealed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4B). Finally, to test the arising implication that null mutants would be significantly deficient in calcium buffer capacity, enriched cytosol samples were subjected to equilibrium binding analysis under non-denaturing conditions. Null mutant extracts were indeed found to have substantially lower capacity than wild types (33 ± 5% reduction, p < 0.002) as shown in Fig. 4C, and this deficiency was correctable by the addition of exogenous calbindin28kDa as expected. Together these molecular and activity-based findings showed comprehensively that the absence of calbindin28kDa in null mutants was not compensated by like proteins, leading to a major reduction of cytosolic calcium-buffering capacity. According to widely accepted models, the removal of calbindins from calcium-transporting tissues should either curtail active transport or be compensated by functionally similar “calcium ferries.” Contradicting this dogma, we found that active calcium transport proceeded normally during enamel formation in null mutant mice lacking calbindin28kDa, despite a major loss of cytosolic calcium binding capacity. These findings constitute the first definitive evidence that calbindins are not a crucial component of the machinery used to transport calcium across enamel cells and also undermine the associated doctrine that bulk calcium is conveyed through cytosol by a facilitated diffusion mechanism. Our results showed that calbindin28kDa is a predominant calcium buffer in enamel cells but, strikingly, its absence in null mutants was not corrected by detectable overexpression of other cytosolic calcium-binding proteins. Comprising about 1% of soluble protein, calbindin28kDa is a major constituent of the proteome (Fig. 4A) (20Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and so a significant demand for compensation might be expected in null mutants. However, no such compensation was found either at the molecular expression or at the buffer activity levels. Molecular evidence included the targeted assessment of self-rectification in heterozygotes and replacement in null mutants by other calmodulin superfamily members and also a more global analysis covering acidic proteins that could potentially buffer calcium. The additional two possibilities of restoration by undetectably small contributions from several other buffers or by calcium-binding proteins that did not survive the 45Ca overlay procedure were precluded by the equilibrium binding results (Fig. 4C). Here, the finding that calbindin28kDa contributed 33% of the total capacity 2Underestimated somewhat due to the inclusion of accessory cells lacking calbindin28kDa (cf. Ref. 26Sayer R.J. Turnbull C.I. Hubbard M.J. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 302: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). endorsed its assignment as the main cytosolic buffer besides calmodulin (12Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This overt lack of compensation mirrors the situation in null mutant brain (15Airaksinen M.S. Eilers J. Garaschuk O. Thoenen H. Konnerth A. Meyer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 27Schmidt H. Stiefel K.M. Racay P. Schwaller B. Eilers J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 13-32Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar), although in that case the molecular findings were not verified by binding analysis, and the overall reduction in buffer capacity was not quantified. A strong likelihood that null mutant enamel cells have altered calcium dynamics like null mutant Purkinje neurons (16Barski J.J. Hartmann J. Rose C.R. Hoebeek F. Morl K. Noll-Hussong M. De Zeeuw C.I. Konnerth A. Meyer M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3469-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) follows because calbindin28kDa is expressed at similar levels in cerebellum and enamel epithelium (20Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Having established that null mutant enamel cells were practically free of calbindins and did not appear to overexpress analogous proteins in their place, this experimental system could be used confidently to address the specific contributions of calbindin28kDa to calcium transport. Despite the predominance of calbindin28kDa as a cytosolic buffer, our results did not support the tenet that calcium transport would be disrupted in null mutants due to shortage of calcium ferries. Instead, the calcium-dependent mineralization process was found to be unaffected both qualitatively and quantitatively. Evidence of normal mineral production came from 45Ca incorporation and morphometric data, which comprised dynamic and static measures over short and long periods, respectively. The normal optical properties and microstructure of null mutant enamel also implied production by healthy cells maintaining strict control over calcium transport as usual. Together these results established that calcium could be conveyed actively in the practical absence of 28- and 9-kDa calbindins, nullifying their postulated transport roles as a ferry or otherwise facilitatory buffer. It is remarkable that calbindin-independent transport was maintained at the same high rate as normal (Fig. 3), approximating the active fluxes achieved maximally in gut and kidney (1Hubbard M.J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 437-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). That this was accomplished with a 33% reduction in cytosolic buffering, and with no cytotoxic overload apparent, casts serious doubt on facilitated diffusion as the underpinning mechanism. The possibilities remain that baseline buffer capacity vastly exceeds that needed for routine transport demands and that calcium is conveyed by non-calbindin ferries or some other cytosolic mechanism. However, another possibility with more substance is that calcium traverses enamel cells via a non-cytosolic route. An alternative paradigm whereby calcium is routed through organelles instead of the cytosol does fit our observations that bulk calcium can be transported safely in the absence of calbindins. Calcium transcytosis via an ER/Ca2+ pipeline is conceptually attractive since it embraces free calcium levels that are normally 3 orders higher than in cytosol, averting the cytotoxic threat and need for assisted diffusion. Indeed, it was calculated that to maintain calcium flux during enamel mineralization, ER/Ca2+ stores would need to be exchanged once every 4 s, in striking contrast to the 150 exchanges/s required for cytosolic calcium (1Hubbard M.J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 437-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As a calbindin-independent pathway, calcium transcytosis is consistent not only with the null mutant results obtained here but also with the unexpected 4-fold down-regulation of calbindin28kDa during maturation (20Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), evidence that a substantial proportion of calbindin28kDa is not freely mobile (20Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Sayer R.J. Turnbull C.I. Hubbard M.J. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 302: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and with the surprising resilience of enamel formation to vitamin D-dependent rickets (28Limeback H. Schlumbohm C. Sen A. Nikiforuk G. J. Dent. Res. 1992; 71: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the 3-fold increased transport rate at maturation, quantified here for the first time (Fig. 3), closely matches the up-regulation of ER/Ca2+ store machinery (12Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Franklin I.K. Winz R.A. Hubbard M.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and associated capacity for sequestering 45Ca. 3I. K Franklin and M. J. Hubbard, unpublished work. Collectively, the results of this study warrant further investigation of the calcium transcytosis paradigm in enamel cells. Do these findings hold broader significance beyond teeth? In general terms, calcium handling processes appear to be largely conserved across different animal tissues, albeit each system is adapted to its particular physiological circumstances. Enamel cells conform in this regard, having been found to express conventional calcium machinery in similarly high abundance as brain, a particularly calcium-centric tissue (12Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 20Hubbard M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Calcium transcytosis componentry is generally available and, as such, ER/Ca2+ stores are known to be capable of translocating calcium at least partly across cells during calcium signaling (1Hubbard M.J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 437-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Mogami H. Nakano K. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 49-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Although the calbindin ferry concept was founded on highly credible correlations between calbindins and vitamin D-dependent transport, various departures from this relationship have emerged in the gut, kidney, and elsewhere (1Hubbard M.J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 437-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30Hemmingsen C. Staun M. Meibom K. Bang K. Olgaard K. Kidney Blood Press.

More research is needed to determine whether such exceptions reflect occasional variation from a normal dependence on calbindins or instead represent informative glimpses of what actually is a calbindin-independent transit process. Null mutant models should be invaluable in this regard and, provocatively, current evidence hints that calbindin28kDa has substantially less impact on calcium transport in the kidney than does the calcium entry channel, TRPV5. Although TRPV5-null mutants exhibited a major, constitutive loss of renal calcium compensated by bone resorption and intestinal uptake (35Hoenderop J.G. van Leeuwen J.P. van der Eerden B.C. Kersten F.F. van der Kemp A.W. Merillat A.M. Waarsing J.H. Rossier B.C. Vallon V. Hummler E. Bindels R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), calbindin28kDa-null mutants excreted renal calcium normally unless challenged by dietary overload and showed no obvious compensation from intestine (36Sooy K. Kohut J. Christakos S. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Lee C.T. Huynh V.M. Lai L.W. Lien Y.H. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 2055-2061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or bone (Fig. 2). The possibilities of compensation by other calcium-binding proteins or by passive transport processes remain to be addressed in the kidney and gut of calbindin28kDa-null mutants however. Notably, being regulated by vitamin D (3Peng J.B. Brown E.M. Hediger M.A. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 158-163PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hoenderop J.G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 529-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), TRPV5 also provides an alternative explanation for the vitamin D dependence of calcium transport previously attributed to calbindins. In conclusion, this study brings to the fore a fundamentally important question with broad biomedical significance: is bulk calcium transported across cells via the cytosol or organelles? Answers are needed if active calcium transport is to be targeted accurately with a view to developing new therapeutics in key areas such as nutrition, biomineralization, and fertility. Until now, calbindins have stood as prime targets in the transit step of active calcium transport. This no longer seems appropriate, however, at least in the tooth, where this study has rendered the calbindin ferry concept untenable.

https://openalex.org/W2167829028,"The assembly of MHC class I molecules with β2-microglobulin and peptides is assisted by the housekeeping chaperones calnexin, calreticulin, and Erp57 and the dedicated accessory protein, tapasin. Tapasin and calreticulin are essential for efficient MHC class I assembly, but their precise action during class I assembly remains to be elucidated. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that the lectin calreticulin interacts with monoglucosylated MHC class I heavy chains, whatever their state of assembly with light chains and peptide, and inhibits their aggregation above physiological temperature. We used a soluble single chain HLA-A2/β2-microglobulin molecule, A2SC, to study the effect of calreticulin on the peptide binding capacity of HLA class I molecules. Calreticulin inhibited the formation of A2SC aggregates both when co-expressed in insect cells and during incubations at elevated temperature. Calreticulin dramatically enhanced acquisition of peptide binding capacity when added to denatured A2SC molecules during refolding at 4 °C. However, it had no effect on the rapid loss of A2SC peptide binding capacity at physiological temperature. We conclude that calreticulin promotes the folding of HLA class I molecules to a state in which, at low temperature, they spontaneously acquire peptide binding capacity. However, it does not induce or maintain a peptide-receptive state of the class I-binding site, which is likely to be promoted by one or several other components of the class I loading complexes. By being amenable to complementation with additional proteins, the described system should be useful for identification of these components."

Accordingly, we systematically analyzed an interaction between VEGF and TGF-β in the endothelial cell lines, and discovered a novel action of VEGF, the attenuation of TGF-β action.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Human recombinant full-length VEGF, VEGF121 and TGF-β were obtained from Sigma, and wortmannin from Nakalai Tesque (Tokyo). Anti-Smad2/3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (aSmad2/3), anti-phospho-Ser465/467-specific Smad2/3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (apSmad2/3), anti-Smad7 rabbit polyclonal antibody (aSmad7), and TGF-β receptor type I (ALK5) mouse monoclonal antibody (aTGFRI) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and BD Biosciences, respectively.Plasmid Constructs—A DNA of the genomic sequence from nucleotides –799 to +71 of the 5′ end of the human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene was inserted into the thymidine kinase-luciferase, which contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minimal promoter driving expression of the luciferase reporter gene (PAI-1/luciferase) (14Abdollah S.

This plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Mayumi Abe (Tohoku University, Tohoku, Japan).Cell Culture and Transfection—A human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC) (Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank, Osaka, Japan), a cultured human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line (CADMEC) (Kurabo Industries, Osaka), and a bovine coronary artery endothelial cell line (BCAEC) (Kurabo Industries, Osaka) were maintained in human endothelial serum-free medium (Invitrogen) containing 20 ng/ml basal fibroblast growth factor and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor on a collagen I-coated dish. PAI-1/luciferase was transfected into HUVEC using an electroporation method. Briefly, HUVEC were electroporated with a total of 10 μg of plasmid DNA at 250 V and 960 microfarad. After the electroporation, the cells were plated to a 24-well dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Twelve hours later, the incubation medium was changed to serum-free F-12 medium containing test substances. After the 12-h test incubation, the media and the cells were collected for determination of PAI-1 and luciferase activity, respectively. TGF-β and/or VEGF treatment did not significantly change the cell number and protein/cell under the experimental conditions. All experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate.PAI-1 Assay—PAI-1 concentration in the medium was determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Biopool International, Ventura, CA).Luciferase Assay—The cells were lysed using Promega lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), mixed with the Promega luciferase assay reagent, and the luciferase activity of the cells was detected by luminometer. To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies between plates within an experiment, the luciferase activity in an extract was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity unless otherwise indicated.Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared by detergent solubilization of the cells in the lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.5 μm pepstatin) for 1 h at 4 °C. For Western blotting, 200 μg of protein lysate was applied for each lane. Two mg of protein lysate was diluted five times by lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and used for immunoprecipitation experiments in which the diluted cell lysate was incubated with 2 μgof aSmad7 antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. The primary polyclonal antibody was incubated with protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The resultant cell extracts or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 including 3% bovine serum albumin for blocking solution and 1000× diluted primary antibody of apSmad, aSmad2/3, aTGFIR, or aSmad7 and visualized with the enhanced chemical luminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The densitometry data were evaluated by NIH Image, version 1.63 (Bethesda, MD).Statistical Analysis—Analysis of variance with Fisher's protected least significant difference test (StatView, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was employed for statistical analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSStimulation of PAI-1 production by TGF-β in HUVEC and Its Suppression by VEGF—Accumulation of PAI-1 in the culture medium during a 12-h incubation period was used as an index of PAI-1 production. One nm TGF-β increased PAI-1 production 3.5-fold, and 30 nm VEGF significantly (60%) inhibited such TGF-β action (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, VEGF did not significantly change basal PAI-1 production in the absence of TGF-β.Stimulation of PAI-1 Gene Transcription by TGF-β in HUVEC and Its Attenuation by VEGF—In HUVEC cells transfected with PAI-1/luciferase, the effects of TGF-β and VEGF on PAI-1 promoter-induced luciferase activity were examined. As expected, TGF-β stimulated luciferase activity; the EC50 was 30 pm, and the maximum effect was at 100 pm (Fig. 2), indicating the validity of this cell line. VEGF, when added alone, did not cause a significant change in PAI-1 promoter activity; however, the peptide strongly inhibited the TGF-β stimulation of PAI-1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). The IC50 of VEGF effect was 3 nm, and the maximum inhibition occurred at 30 nm. Importantly, VEGF attenuated TGF-β stimulation of PAI-1 promoter activity also in CADMEC and BCAEC (Fig. 4). VEGF121 showed a similar effect at 30 nm (Fig. 5A).Fig. 2Effects of TGF-β on PAI-1 gene expression in HUVEC. HUVEC were incubated with the indicated concentrations of TGF-β for 12 h.

The same concentration of wortmannin clearly attenuated (by 80%) the VEGF-induced activation of PI3-kinase.Effect of VEGF on TGF-β Stimulation of Smad2/3 Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation of Smad2/3 is required for Smad2/3·Smad4 complex formation, which is an obligatory step for TGF-β signaling (13Nakao A.

Stimulation of Smad2/3 phosphorylation by 1 nm TGF-β was strongly suppressed by 30 nm VEGF. However, VEGF itself did not significantly alter the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Effect of TGF-β and/or VEGF on phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in HUVEC. HUVEC cells were incubated with 30 nm VEGF and/or 1 nm TGF-β for 60 min, and the cell lysates were electrophoresed and immunoblotted (IB) with antibodies against phosphorylated Smad2/3 (apsmad2/3) or Smad2/3 (asmad2/3).

As the treatment did not alter the amount of Smad7 and TGF-β receptor, the finding indicated that VEGF enhances the binding of Smad7 to the TGF-β receptor.Fig. 7Effect of VEGF on binding of Smad7 to TGF-β receptor type I in HUVEC.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and induces angiogenesis (17Bikfalvi A. Sauzeau C. Moukadiri H. Maclouf J. Busso N. Bryckaert M. Plouet J. Tobelem G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We found that VEGF itself did not significantly change PAI-1 production and PAI-1 promoter activity, namely mRNA expression. Quite interestingly, however, the addition of VEGF strongly inhibited TGF-β stimulation of PAI-1 production and mRNA expression. The data imply that VEGF inhibits TGF-β-induced activation of the PAI-1 gene at the level of transcription, leading to a reduced PAI-1 production. PI3-kinase is one of the major intracellular signaling molecules for VEGF (18Zachary I. Gliki G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 49: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), and wortmannin, a potent PI3-kinase inhibitor, prevented the inhibitory effect of VEGF on TGF-β-induced PAI-1 expression. Thus, inhibition of TGF-β action by VEGF is likely mediated by PI3-kinase.There are three signaling tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3) for three VEGFs (a full-length VEGF, VEGF121, and VEGF-B). VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are abundantly expressed in the bovine pulmonary artery cells (19Cohen A.W. Carbajal J.M. Schaeffer Jr., R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2038-H2049PubMed Google Scholar). We found that not only a full-length VEGF (a ligand for the three VEGFRs) but also VEGF121 (a ligand for VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) suppressed TGF-β action. On the other hand, Olofsson et al. (20Olofsson B. Korpelainen E. Pepper M.S. Mandriota S.J. Aase K. Kumar V. Gunji Y. Jeltsch M.M. Shibuya M. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11709-11714Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) showed that VEGF-B (a selective ligand for VEGFR-1) increases PAI-1 gene expression without PI3-kinase activation and that a full-length VEGF fails to increase PAI-1 activity in HUVEC. Taken together, VEGF may suppress PAI-1 activity via VEGFR-2-mediated activation of PI3-kinase.Smad cascade is the major signaling pathway of TGF-β activation of PAI-1 expression (21Wang W. Zhou G.

Sidera P. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Because we did not examine the effect of VEGF on the other branch of TGF-β signaling (ALK1/Smad1), it is not known whether VEGF inhibits both branches of TGF-β signaling. TGF type I receptor mediates phosphorylation of Smad2/3 at the C-terminal serine residues, which is a required step for Smad signaling (13Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, Smad2 and Smad3 homo- or heterooligomerize with Smad4, and translocate into the nucleus (24Baker J.C. Harland R.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M.

There they bind to DNA and regulate gene transcription. The interaction of Smad2/3 with coactivators such as CBP and p300 is essential for TGF-β inhibition of cellular proliferation, and such interaction is enhanced by the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 by TGF-β (27Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The cross-talk between epidermal growth factor and TGF-β signaling has also been reported (28Peron P. Rahmani M. Zagar Y. Durand-Schneider A.M. Lardeux B. Bernuau D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10524-10531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).As shown, TGF-β stimulation of phosphorylation of Smad2/3 was strongly suppressed by VEGF without an effect on the amount of TGF-β receptor. Therefore, VEGF must have inhibited TGF-β action through interference of the intracellular signaling. VEGF stimulation of Smad7 (an antagonist of TGF-β signaling) association with TGF-β type 1 receptor may well be responsible for such VEGF action.In summary, we have discovered a novel action of VEGF in endothelial cells, the inhibition of TGF-β stimulation of PAI-1 gene activation and PAI-1 production. We suggest the following scenario: VEGF binding to VEGFR-2 activates PI3-kinase, leading to enhanced binding of Smad7 to TGF-β type 1 receptor and interference of TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3, which is responsible for attenuation of TGF-β action.

VEGF plays a major part in mediating active intraocular neovascularization in patients with ischemic retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (5Aiello L.P. Wong J.S. Kidney Int. Suppl. 2000; 77: S113-S119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A role of VEGF in the development of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy was also reported (6Chiarelli F. Santilli F. Mohn A. Horm. Res. (Basel). 2000; 53: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). On the other hand, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), a strong modulator of cell growth and differentiation, exhibits either deleterious or protective effects on the blood vessels depending on the experimental conditions (7Iruela-Arispe M.L. Sage E.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 52: 414-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Nicosia R.F. Nicosia S.V. Smith M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1023-1029PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that many growth factors are simultaneously acting on the same tissue in vivo, delineation of synergistic and/or antagonizing effects of growth factors is important for understanding of pathophysiology of diabetic complications (9Gambaro G.

Accordingly, we systematically analyzed an interaction between VEGF and TGF-β in the endothelial cell lines, and discovered a novel action of VEGF, the attenuation of TGF-β action.

This plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Mayumi Abe (Tohoku University, Tohoku, Japan).Cell Culture and Transfection—A human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC) (Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank, Osaka, Japan), a cultured human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line (CADMEC) (Kurabo Industries, Osaka), and a bovine coronary artery endothelial cell line (BCAEC) (Kurabo Industries, Osaka) were maintained in human endothelial serum-free medium (Invitrogen) containing 20 ng/ml basal fibroblast growth factor and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor on a collagen I-coated dish. PAI-1/luciferase was transfected into HUVEC using an electroporation method. Briefly, HUVEC were electroporated with a total of 10 μg of plasmid DNA at 250 V and 960 microfarad. After the electroporation, the cells were plated to a 24-well dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Twelve hours later, the incubation medium was changed to serum-free F-12 medium containing test substances. After the 12-h test incubation, the media and the cells were collected for determination of PAI-1 and luciferase activity, respectively. TGF-β and/or VEGF treatment did not significantly change the cell number and protein/cell under the experimental conditions. All experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate.PAI-1 Assay—PAI-1 concentration in the medium was determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Biopool International, Ventura, CA).Luciferase Assay—The cells were lysed using Promega lysis buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), mixed with the Promega luciferase assay reagent, and the luciferase activity of the cells was detected by luminometer.

Recently, we described a novel BRCA1-dependent C-terminal transcriptional repression domain (CTRD) within ZBRK1, the mode of repression of which is functionally distinguishable from that of the N-terminal KRAB repression domain within ZBRK1. The identification of BRCA1 binding-competent but repression-defective CTRD mutants further revealed that BRCA1 binding is necessary, but not sufficient, for ZBRK1 CTRD function.

In addition to its identification as the product of a gene up-regulated in senescent fibroblasts, ZBRK1 was independently identified as a BRCA1-dependent transcriptional repressor of the gene encoding GADD45a, a functionally important DNA damage-response effector that functions in G2/M cell cycle checkpoint control and the maintenance of genomic stability (2Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10Sheikh M.S. Hollander M.C.

Cell Res. 2001; 263: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Previous functional analyses revealed that ZBRK1 represses GADD45a gene transcription through an intron 3 DNA-binding site in a manner dependent upon direct interaction with BRCA1 and further suggested a model in which ZBRK1 and BRCA1 function coordinately to repress GADD45a gene transcription in the absence of genotoxic stress (2Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Evidence to support this model derives from the recent observation that DNA damage-induced ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of ZBRK1 leads to de-repression of GADD45a (12Yun J. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7305-7314Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the DNA damage-induced degradation of ZBRK1 is a BRCA1-independent phenomenon, familial breast cancer-derived mutants of BRCA1 that disrupt its interaction with ZBRK1 nonetheless abrogate its co-repressor activity, suggesting that its ZBRK1 co-repressor function may be important for the tumor suppressor properties of BRCA1 (2Zheng L.

Biol. 2003; 23: 7305-7314Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition to GADD45a, potential ZBRK1 binding sites have been identified in other DNA damage-response genes that are also regulated by BRCA1, including p21, Bax, and GADD153 (2Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). This observation suggests a potentially broader role for BRCA1 and ZBRK1 in the coordinate transcriptional control of functionally diverse DNA damage response genes. As part of our initial effort to explore the mechanism by which BRCA1 mediates sequence-specific transcriptional repression through ZBRK1, we recently identified and functionally characterized a novel C-terminal transcriptional repression domain (CTRD) within ZBRK1 (13Tan W. Zheng L. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6576-6587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Structurally, the CTRD comprises the last four zinc fingers and an atypical C-terminal extension within the eight-fingered ZBRK1 protein (13Tan W. Zheng L. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6576-6587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Functionally, the CTRD represses transcription in a BRCA1-dependent, histone deacetylase-dependent, and promoter-specific manner and is thus distinguishable from the N-terminal KRAB repression domain in ZBRK1, which exhibits no BRCA1 dependence and broad promoter specificity (13Tan W. Zheng L. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6576-6587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). During the course of our functional dissection of ZBRK1, we identified CTRD mutants that are competent for BRCA1 binding but nonetheless defective for transcriptional repression (13Tan W. Zheng L. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6576-6587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that BRCA1 binding is necessary but not sufficient for the ZBRK1 CTRD repression function and implies a role for additional co-regulators of the CTRD. During an unbiased search for CTRD-interacting proteins and, therefore, potential CTRD co-regulators, we unexpectedly identified ZBRK1 itself, suggesting that ZBRK1 can homo-oligomerize through its CTRD. Herein, we explore the physical and functional requirements for ZBRK1 oligomerization in ZBRK1-directed repression. Our results reveal the ZBRK1 CTRD to be a novel interaction surface responsible for directing both homotypic and the heterotypic interactions essential for ZBRK1 repression and further suggest an unanticipated dual role for ZBRK1 in both DNA binding-dependent and -independent modes of transcriptional repression. We discuss the implications of these findings for BRCA1-dependent ZBRK1 repression. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—Plasmid pMAL-C2-TEV ZBRK1 ΔK for expressing maltose-binding protein (MBP)-ZBRK1 ΔKin Escherichia coli has been described previously (13Tan W. Zheng L. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6576-6587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 for in vitro transcription/translation and mammalian expression of FLAG epitope-tagged ZBRK1 was constructed by subcloning a BamHI-HindIII fragment carrying sequences encoding an amino-terminally FLAG-tagged ZBRK1 from pFastbac-FLAG-ZBRK1 into pCS2+ (14Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 broken finger (BF) and KRAB domain (D12A,V13A) mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each broken finger mutant bears a histidine (CAT codon) to asparagine (AAT codon) substitution mutation at the first of the two conserved histidine residues within the targeted C2H2 zinc finger. The D12A,V13A KRAB domain double mutation bears an aspartic acid (GAT codon) to alanine (GGT) substitution and a valine (GTG codon) to alanine (GGG codon) substitution at amino acid position numbers 12 and 13, respectively, of the 532-amino acid ZBRK1 protein. pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants (ΔC1, ΔC2, ΔC3) were generated by PCR-based subcloning. In brief, a PstI-XbaI fragment encompassing the carboxyl terminus of ZBRK1 in pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 was replaced with PCR-amplified fragments carrying corresponding carboxyl-terminal truncations. Individual pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 carboxyl-terminal deletion derivatives encode the following ZBRK1 amino acids: ΔC1, amino acids 1–523; ΔC2, amino acids1–503; and ΔC3, amino acids 1–483. Plasmid pCS2+-T7-ZBRK1 for in vitro transcription/translation and mammalian expression of T7 epitope-tagged ZBRK1 was generated by replacing a BamHI-Eco47-III fragment from pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 with a PCR-amplified BamHI-Eco47-III fragment carrying sequences encoding a T7 epitope tag in-frame with the ZBRK1 amino terminus. Reporter plasmid pZRE4-TK-Luc was constructed by replacing a HindIII-BglII fragment including 5XGAL4 DNA-binding sites and the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter from pG5TK-Luc (13Tan W. Zheng L. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6576-6587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with a HindIII-BglII fragment from pBL-CAT E (2Zheng L. Pan H. Li S. Flesken-Nikitin A. Chen P.L. Boyer T.G. Lee W.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), encompassing 4× ZBRK1 consensus DNA-binding sites and the TK promoter. Plasmid pm-ZBRK1 CTRD (previously named pm-ZBRK1 5ZFC) for mammalian expression of GAL4-CTRD and reporter plasmid pG5TK-Luc have both been described previously (13Tan W. Zheng L. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6576-6587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfections, and Reporter Assays—U2OS human osteosarcoma cells were cultured as described (13Tan W. Zheng L. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6576-6587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For transient reporter assays, 2 × 105 cells were seeded per well of a 6-well plate 24 h before transfection. When 70% confluent, the cells were transfected with Fu-GENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instructions. The amounts of expression and reporter plasmids utilized in each experiment are indicated in the legends to Figs. 4, 5, 6. A total of 1or 2 μg, respectively, of DNA per well was transfected when pG5TK-Luc or pZRE4-Luc were used as reporter templates. Each transfection also included an internal control plasmid, pCH110 (15Zheng L. Annab L.A. Afshari C.A. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9587-9592Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), expressing β-galactosidase under control of the SV40 promoter. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 250 μl/well reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfected cell lysates (20 μl) were analyzed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and for β-galactosidase activity using the Galacto-Light Plus chemiluminescent reporter assay (BD Biosciences). Each transfection was performed a minimum of three times in duplicate.Fig. 5Structural requirements for ZBRK1 co-repressor activity.

To confirm that wild-type (WT) GAL4-ZBRK1 CTRD and GAL4-ZBRK1-CTRD ΔC1 were expressed at equivalent levels in functional assays, equivalent proportional aliquots of transfected U20S cell lysates used in the functional assays were also resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and subjected to immunoblot analysis using FLAG epitope-specific antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Protein Expression and Purification—MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK, MBP-ZBRK1 CTRD, and MBP proteins were each expressed in and purified from E. coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen). The procedures for protein induction, extraction, and purification of MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK have been described previously (13Tan W. Zheng L. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6576-6587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For MBP-ZBRK1 CTRD and MBP, cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration 0.3 mm, and the cells were transferred to 25 °C for another 3.5 h. Cells were pelleted, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in MBP binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.4 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm benzamidine-HCl). Resuspended cells were frozen and thawed once followed by sonication (three times for 1 min each on ice) and clarification by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. MBP-ZBRK1 CTRD and MBP proteins were purified from clarified lysates by affinity chromatography on amylose resin (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Briefly, clarified lysates were incubated with amylose resin in batch at for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with MBP binding buffer, and eluted with MBP binding buffer containing 0.5% maltose in column format. MBP Binding Assays—MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK was purified from clarified bacterial cell extract (150 μl) by incubation with amylose resin (15 μl) in batch for 30 min at 25 °C, followed by washing two times for 5 min each at 25 °C in MBP binding buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and three times for 5 min each at 25 °C in lysis 300 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. FLAG-ZBRK1 or its mutant derivatives were labeled with [35S]methionine (TnT SP6 quick coupled transcription/translation system; Promega) and incubated with amylose-immobilized MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK in lysis 300 buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Binding reactions were washed with Lysis 300 buffer four times for 10 min each at 4 °C and subsequently boiled in 30 μl of 1.5× Laemmli sample buffer. Eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation Analyses—U2OS cells at 70% confluency in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 12 μg of DNA using the following expression plasmids (with amounts in parentheses): pCS2+-T7-ZBRK1 (6 μg) and pCS2+FLAG-ZBRK1 (6 μg); pCS2+-T7-ZBRK1 (6 μg) and pCS2+FLAG-ZBRK1 BF mutants (6 μg); pCS2+-T7-ZBRK1 (6 μg) and pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 ΔC1 (3 μg), pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 ΔC2 (4.5 μg), or pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 ΔC3 (2.25 μg) (the total amount of DNA was fixed by supplementing these transfections with pCS2+). Thirty-six hours post-transfection, 2.5 × 106 transfected U2OS cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 300 μl of lysis 150T buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) by sonication at four intervals of 7 s each using a Branson 450 sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics) at the lowest setting. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with either 1 μg of anti-T7 antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI) or 5 μg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (for anti-T7 antibody immunoprecipitation) or protein G-Sepharose (Roche Diagnostics) (for anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitation) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were pelleted and washed with lysis 150T buffer at least four times for 10 min each at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for 3 min, and eluates were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and processed for immunoblot analysis. Chemical Cross-linking Assays—U2OS cells at 70% confluency on 10-cm plates were transfected with either 12 μg of pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 or 6 μg of pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 ΔC1 in combination with 6 μg of pCS2+. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 300 μl of lysis 150H buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) by sonication at four intervals of 7 s each using a Branson 450 sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics) at the lowest setting. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysates (36 μl) were subjected to chemical cross-linking by the addition of disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (25 mm) to a final concentration of 2.25 mm. Cross-linking reactions were performed at 25 °C and terminated by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer followed by boiling for 3 min (16McCarty A.S. Kleiger G. Eisenberg D. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cross-linked products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and processed for immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Purified MBP-ZBRK1 CTRD and MBP proteins were each subjected to cross-linking by the addition of DSS (25 mm) to a final concentration of 0.75 mm. Cross-linking reactions were performed at 25 °C and terminated by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer followed by boiling for 3 min. Cross-linked products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) followed by silver staining. Gel Filtration Chromatography—U2OS cells at 70% confluency on 10-cm plates were transfected with either 12 μg of pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 or 6 μg of pCS2+-FLAG-ZBRK1 ΔC1 in combination with 6 μg of pCS2+. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 150 μl of lysis 150T buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 25 mm pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich)) by sonication at four intervals of 7 s each using a Branson 450 sonifier (Branson Ultrasonics) at the lowest setting. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysates were concentrated 5-fold by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm using a Nanosep 30K omega filtration unit (Pall Corporation, East Hills, NY). Gel filtration chromatography was performed on an Amersham Biosciences SMART System using a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) and a flow rate of 40 μl/min. Column fractions (45 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and visualized by immunoblot analysis using an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). ZBRK1 Homo-oligomerizes in Vitro—To identify novel interaction partners and potential co-regulators of the ZBRK1 CTRD, we employed two independent experimental approaches. First, we used the CTRD (amino acids 319–532 of ZBRK1) as a bait protein to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library by a yeast-two hybrid assay. From among ∼1 × 106 independent clones screened, we identified ZBRK1 itself as a CTRD interaction partner (data not shown). Second, we expressed a ZBRK1 KRAB domain deletion derivative (ZBRK1 ΔK; amino acids 144–532 of ZBRK1) as an MBP chimera in E. coli, immobilized the fusion protein on amylose resin, and probed HeLa cell nuclear extract for interacting proteins using an MBP pull-down assay. Identification of ZBRK1 ΔK-interacting proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-based peptide mass fingerprinting revealed ZBRK1 itself to be among the interaction partners thus captured (data not shown). Coupled with the identification of ZBRK1 as a CTRD-interacting protein by a yeast two-hybrid assay, this observation suggested the possibility that ZBRK1 might homo-oligomerize through a direct interaction involving its CTRD. To confirm that ZBRK1 can bind directly to itself and to map the relevant interaction surface required for this interaction, we tested the ability of in vitro translated wild-type ZBRK1 and ZBRK1 CTRD mutant derivatives for their respective abilities to bind to MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK in an MBP pull-down assay (Fig. 1). As reported previously, deletion of the KRAB domain permits the expression and purification of an otherwise insoluble full-length recombinant ZBRK1 protein (13Tan W. Zheng L. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6576-6587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK bound full-length ZBRK1 efficiently, thus confirming that ZBRK1 can directly self-associate in vitro (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we examined the structural determinants within the CTRD required for ZBRK1 self-association. Analysis of C-terminal ZBRK1 truncation derivatives revealed that the deletion of only nine amino acids from the CTRD C terminus was sufficient to eliminate ZBRK1 oligomerization (Fig. 1A). By contrast, individual disruption of CTRD zinc fingers 5–8 by substitution mutagenesis revealed that each “broken finger” mutant (13Tan W. Zheng L. Lee W.H. Boyer T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6576-6587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) bound MBP-ZBRK1 ΔK comparably to wild-type ZBRK1, thus revealing that the CTRD zinc fingers are individually dispensable for ZBRK1 oligomerization (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that ZBRK1 can homooligomerize in vitro through a direct interaction involving its CTRD C terminus. ZBRK1 Homo-oligomerizes in Vivo—To determine whether ZBRK1 can homo-oligomerize in vivo, we first examined the ability of ZBRK1 derivatives independently tagged with either T7 or FLAG epitopes to reciprocally co-immunoprecipitate one another following their transient over-expression in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells. T7-tagged ZBRK1 could be efficiently precipitated by FLAG-specific antibodies only in the presence of FLAG-tagged ZBRK1 (Fig. 2A). Reciprocally, FLAG-tagged ZBRK1 could be efficiently precipitated by T7-specific antibodies only when T7-tagged ZBRK1 was co-expressed (Fig. 2B). These results confirm that ZBRK1 can homo-oligomerize in vivo. Next, to map the relevant interaction surface(s) required for ZBRK1 oligomerization in vivo, we examined a set of FLAG-tagged ZBRK1 CTRD mutant derivatives for their respective abilities to be co-immunoprecipitated along with T7-tagged wild-type ZBRK1 following their transient co-expression in U2OS cells. Consistent with the results of in vitro binding analyses, these in vivo binding studies revealed the CTRD C terminus to be critical and the CTRD zinc fingers to be dispensable for ZBRK1 self-association. Thus, deletion of only nine amino acids from the ZBRK1 C terminus largely abolished ZBRK1 self-association (Fig. 2C), whereas individual ZBRK1 derivatives bearing targeted disruptions of CTRD zinc fingers 5–8 bound to T7-tagged ZBRK1 as efficiently as wild-type ZBRK1 (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that ZBRK1 can homo-oligomerize both in vitro and in vivo and furthermore delimit the oligomerization interface to the CTRD C terminus. The ZBRK1 CTRD Mediates Tetrameric Oligomerization—To characterize the oligomeric state of ZBRK1 in vivo, we first employed the chemical cross-linker DSS to covalently capture ZBRK1 protein complexes present in extracts of U2OS cells transfected with FLAG-tagged ZBRK1 (16McCarty A.S.
