https://openalex.org/W4307441048,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has highlighted the need for vaccines that not only prevent disease but also prevent transmission. Parenteral vaccines induce robust systemic immunity but poor immunity at the respiratory mucosa. We developed a vaccine strategy that we call ""prime and spike,"" which leverages existing immunity generated by primary vaccination (prime) to elicit mucosal immune memory within the respiratory tract by using unadjuvanted intranasal spike boosters (spike). We show that prime and spike induces robust resident memory B and T cell responses, induces immunoglobulin A at the respiratory mucosa, boosts systemic immunity, and completely protects mice with partial immunity from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using divergent spike proteins, prime and spike enables the induction of cross-reactive immunity against sarbecoviruses."

How receptor systems are situated within macro-scale neuroanatomy and how they shape emergent function remain poorly understood, and there exists no comprehensive atlas of receptors. Here we collate positron emission tomography data from more than 1,200 healthy individuals to construct a whole-brain three-dimensional normative atlas of 19 receptors and transporters across nine different neurotransmitter systems. We found that receptor profiles align with structural connectivity and mediate function, including neurophysiological oscillatory dynamics and resting-state hemodynamic functional connectivity. Using the Neurosynth cognitive atlas, we uncovered a topographic gradient of overlapping receptor distributions that separates extrinsic and intrinsic psychological processes. Finally, we found both expected and novel associations between receptor distributions and cortical abnormality patterns across 13 disorders. We replicated all findings in an independently collected autoradiography dataset. This work demonstrates how chemoarchitecture shapes brain structure and function, providing a new direction for studying multi-scale brain organization."

https://openalex.org/W4307495488,"Abstract Functional characterization of pseudouridine (Ψ) in mammalian mRNA has been hampered by the lack of a quantitative method that maps Ψ in the whole transcriptome. We report bisulfite-induced deletion sequencing (BID-seq), which uses a bisulfite-mediated reaction to convert pseudouridine stoichiometrically into deletion upon reverse transcription without cytosine deamination. BID-seq enables detection of abundant Ψ sites with stoichiometry information in several human cell lines and 12 different mouse tissues using 10–20 ng input RNA. We uncover consensus sequences for Ψ in mammalian mRNA and assign different ‘writer’ proteins to individual Ψ deposition. Our results reveal a transcript stabilization role of Ψ sites installed by TRUB1 in human cancer cells. We also detect the presence of Ψ within stop codons of mammalian mRNA and confirm the role of Ψ in promoting stop codon readthrough in vivo. BID-seq will enable future investigations of the roles of Ψ in diverse biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W4307725211,"The target DNA specificity of the CRISPR-associated genome editor nuclease Cas9 is determined by complementarity to a 20-nucleotide segment in its guide RNA. However, Cas9 can bind and cleave partially complementary off-target sequences, which raises safety concerns for its use in clinical applications. Here, we report crystallographic structures of Cas9 bound to bona fide off-target substrates, revealing that off-target binding is enabled by a range of noncanonical base-pairing interactions within the guide:off-target heteroduplex. Off-target substrates containing single-nucleotide deletions relative to the guide RNA are accommodated by base skipping or multiple noncanonical base pairs rather than RNA bulge formation. Finally, PAM-distal mismatches result in duplex unpairing and induce a conformational change in the Cas9 REC lobe that perturbs its conformational activation. Together, these insights provide a structural rationale for the off-target activity of Cas9 and contribute to the improved rational design of guide RNAs and off-target prediction algorithms."

https://openalex.org/W4307502381,"Therapeutic cancer vaccines are designed to increase tumor-specific T cell immunity. However, suppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) may limit T cell function. Here, we assessed how the route of vaccination alters intratumoral myeloid cells. Using a self-assembling nanoparticle vaccine that links tumor antigen peptides to a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist (SNP-7/8a), we treated tumor-bearing mice subcutaneously (SNP-SC) or intravenously (SNP-IV). Both routes generated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that infiltrated tumors. However, only SNP-IV mediated tumor regression, dependent on systemic type I interferon at the time of boost. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that intratumoral monocytes expressing an immunoregulatory gene signature (Chil3, Anxa2, Wfdc17) were reduced after SNP-IV boost. In humans, the Chil3+ monocyte gene signature is enriched in CD16- monocytes and associated with worse outcomes. Our results show that the generation of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells combined with remodeling of the TME is a promising approach for tumor immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4307408150,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. The protection provided by vaccines and booster doses offered a method of mitigating severe clinical outcomes and mortality. However, by the end of 2021, the global distribution of vaccines was highly heterogeneous, with some countries gaining over 90% coverage in adults, whereas others reached less than 2%. In this study, we used an age-structured model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, matched to national data from 152 countries in 2021, to investigate the global impact of different potential vaccine sharing protocols that attempted to address this inequity. We quantified the effects of implemented vaccine rollout strategies on the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the subsequent global burden of disease and the emergence of novel variants. We found that greater vaccine sharing would have lowered the total global burden of disease, and any associated increases in infections in previously vaccine-rich countries could have been mitigated by reduced relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our results reinforce the health message, pertinent to future pandemics, that vaccine distribution proportional to wealth, rather than to need, may be detrimental to all."
https://openalex.org/W4307493594,"Astrocytes become reactive in response to insults to the central nervous system by adopting context-specific cellular signatures and outputs, but a systematic understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is lacking. In this study, we developed CRISPR interference screening in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes coupled to single-cell transcriptomics to systematically interrogate cytokine-induced inflammatory astrocyte reactivity. We found that autocrine-paracrine IL-6 and interferon signaling downstream of canonical NF-κB activation drove two distinct inflammatory reactive signatures, one promoted by STAT3 and the other inhibited by STAT3. These signatures overlapped with those observed in other experimental contexts, including mouse models, and their markers were upregulated in human brains in Alzheimer's disease and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Furthermore, we validated that markers of these signatures were regulated by STAT3 in vivo using a mouse model of neuroinflammation. These results and the platform that we established have the potential to guide the development of therapeutics to selectively modulate different aspects of inflammatory astrocyte reactivity."

https://openalex.org/W4307583652,"The discovery of entorhinal grid cells has generated considerable interest in how and why hexagonal firing fields might emerge in a generic manner from neural circuits, and what their computational significance might be. Here, we forge a link between the problem of path integration and the existence of hexagonal grids, by demonstrating that such grids arise in neural networks trained to path integrate under simple biologically plausible constraints. Moreover, we develop a unifying theory for why hexagonal grids are ubiquitous in path-integrator circuits. Such trained networks also yield powerful mechanistic hypotheses, exhibiting realistic levels of biological variability not captured by hand-designed models. We furthermore develop methods to analyze the connectome and activity maps of our networks to elucidate fundamental mechanisms underlying path integration. These methods provide a road map to go from connectomic and physiological measurements to conceptual understanding in a manner that could generalize to other settings."
https://openalex.org/W4307407864,"DYT1 dystonia is a debilitating neurological movement disorder arising from mutation in the AAA+ ATPase TorsinA. The hallmark of Torsin dysfunction is nuclear envelope blebbing resulting from defects in nuclear pore complex biogenesis. Whether blebs actively contribute to disease manifestation is unknown. We report that FG-nucleoporins in the bleb lumen form aberrant condensates and contribute to DYT1 dystonia by provoking two proteotoxic insults. Short-lived ubiquitylated proteins that are normally rapidly degraded partition into the bleb lumen and become stabilized. In addition, blebs selectively sequester a specific HSP40–HSP70 chaperone network that is modulated by the bleb component MLF2. MLF2 suppresses the ectopic accumulation of FG-nucleoporins and modulates the selective properties and size of condensates in vitro. Our study identifies dual mechanisms of proteotoxicity in the context of condensate formation and establishes FG-nucleoporin-directed activities for a nuclear chaperone network. Kuiper et al. and Prophet et al. implicate DNAJB6/HSP70 chaperone activities in the biogenesis of the nuclear pore complex permeability barrier and find that disease-linked nuclear envelope blebs are enriched in nucleoporin and chaperone condensates."

https://openalex.org/W4307412741,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental disorders. We designed a fast-onset antidepressant that works by disrupting the interaction between the serotonin transporter (SERT) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS) selectively increased the SERT-nNOS complex in the DRN in mice. Augmentation of SERT-nNOS interactions in the DRN caused a depression-like phenotype and accounted for the CMS-induced depressive behaviors. Disrupting the SERT-nNOS interaction produced a fast-onset antidepressant effect by enhancing serotonin signaling in forebrain circuits. We discovered a small-molecule compound, ZZL-7, that elicited an antidepressant effect 2 hours after treatment without undesirable side effects. This compound, or analogous reagents, may serve as a new, rapidly acting treatment for MDD."

https://openalex.org/W4307493709,"HIVACAT T-cell immunogen (HTI) is a novel human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine immunogen designed to elicit cellular immune responses to HIV targets associated with viral control in humans. The AELIX-002 trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate as a primary objective the safety of a combination of DNA.HTI (D), MVA.HTI (M) and ChAdOx1.HTI (C) vaccines in 45 early-antiretroviral (ART)-treated individuals (44 men, 1 woman; NCT03204617). Secondary objectives included T-cell immunogenicity, the effect on viral rebound and the safety of an antiretroviral treatment interruption (ATI). Adverse events were mostly mild and transient. No related serious adverse events were observed. We show here that HTI vaccines were able to induce strong, polyfunctional and broad CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses. All participants experienced detectable viral rebound during ATI, and resumed ART when plasma HIV-1 viral load reached either >100,000 copies ml−1, >10,000 copies ml−1 for eight consecutive weeks, or after 24 weeks of ATI. In post-hoc analyses, HTI vaccines were associated with a prolonged time off ART in vaccinees without beneficial HLA (human leukocyte antigen) class I alleles. Plasma viral load at the end of ATI and time off ART positively correlated with vaccine-induced HTI-specific T-cell responses at ART cessation. Despite limited efficacy of the vaccines in preventing viral rebound, their ability to elicit robust T-cell responses towards HTI may be beneficial in combination cure strategies, which are currently being tested in clinical trials. Vaccines that elicit HIV-specific T-cell responses did not prevent viral rebound in people living with HIV upon antiretroviral treatment (ART) interruption, but associated with longer time off ART in some trial participants, suggesting their immunogenicity may benefit future cure approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4307658815,"Adult kidney organoids have been described as strictly tubular epithelia and termed tubuloids. While the cellular origin of tubuloids has remained elusive, here we report that they originate from a distinct CD24+ epithelial subpopulation. Long-term-cultured CD24+ cell-derived tubuloids represent a functional human kidney tubule. We show that kidney tubuloids can be used to model the most common inherited kidney disease, namely autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), reconstituting the phenotypic hallmark of this disease with cyst formation. Single-cell RNA sequencing of CRISPR–Cas9 gene-edited PKD1- and PKD2-knockout tubuloids and human ADPKD and control tissue shows similarities in upregulation of disease-driving genes. Furthermore, in a proof of concept, we demonstrate that tolvaptan, the only approved drug for ADPKD, has a significant effect on cyst size in tubuloids but no effect on a pluripotent stem cell-derived model. Thus, tubuloids are derived from a tubular epithelial subpopulation and represent an advanced system for ADPKD disease modeling. Adult kidney organoids, or tubuloids, originate from CD24+ epithelial cells. Tubuloids represent a functional kidney tubule and can be used to model autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and study drug response."
https://openalex.org/W4307725084,"The human genome contains hundreds of thousands of regions harboring copy-number variants (CNV). However, the phenotypic effects of most such polymorphisms are unknown because only larger CNVs have been ascertainable from SNP-array data generated by large biobanks. We developed a computational approach leveraging haplotype sharing in biobank cohorts to more sensitively detect CNVs. Applied to UK Biobank, this approach accounted for approximately half of all rare gene inactivation events produced by genomic structural variation. This CNV call set enabled a detailed analysis of associations between CNVs and 56 quantitative traits, identifying 269 independent associations (p < 5 × 10−8) likely to be causally driven by CNVs. Putative target genes were identifiable for nearly half of the loci, enabling insights into dosage sensitivity of these genes and uncovering several gene-trait relationships. These results demonstrate the ability of haplotype-informed analysis to provide insights into the genetic basis of human complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W4307495205,"Precisely controlled development of the somatosensory system is essential for detecting pain, itch, temperature, mechanical touch and body position. To investigate the protein-level changes that occur during somatosensory development, we performed single-cell mass cytometry on dorsal root ganglia from C57/BL6 mice of both sexes, with litter replicates collected daily from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 4. Measuring nearly 3 million cells, we quantified 30 molecularly distinct somatosensory glial and 41 distinct neuronal states across all timepoints. Analysis of differentiation trajectories revealed rare cells that co-express two or more Trk receptors and over-express stem cell markers, suggesting that these neurotrophic factor receptors play a role in cell fate specification. Comparison to previous RNA-based studies identified substantial differences between many protein–mRNA pairs, demonstrating the importance of protein-level measurements to identify functional cell states. Overall, this study demonstrates that mass cytometry is a high-throughput, scalable platform to rapidly phenotype somatosensory tissues. Somatosensory neurons detect pain, temperature and touch. Keeler et al. constructed a single-cell, protein-level atlas of nearly 3 million cells from the mouse dorsal root ganglia, covering 13 days of embryonic and postnatal development."

https://openalex.org/W4307412559,"In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a lack of functional dystrophin leads to myofiber instability and progressive muscle damage that results in fibrosis. While fibrosis is primarily characterized by an accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, there are changes in ECM architecture during fibrosis that relate more closely to functional muscle stiffness. One of these architectural changes in dystrophic muscle is collagen cross-linking, which has been shown to increase the passive muscle stiffness in models of fibrosis including the mdx mouse, a model of DMD. We tested whether the intraperitoneal injections of beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an inhibitor of the cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase, would reduce collagen cross-linking and passive stiffness in young and adult mdx mice compared to saline-injected controls. We found no significant differences between BAPN treated and saline treated mice in collagen cross-linking and stiffness parameters. However, we observed that while collagen cross-linking and passive stiffness scaled positively in dystrophic muscles, collagen fiber alignment scaled with passive stiffness distinctly between muscles. We also observed that the dystrophic diaphragm showed the most dramatic fibrosis in terms of collagen content, cross-linking, and stiffness. Overall, we show that while BAPN was not effective at reducing collagen cross-linking, the positive association between collagen cross-linking and stiffness in dystrophic muscles still show cross-linking as a viable target for reducing passive muscle stiffness in DMD or other fibrotic muscle conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4307496535,"Despite unequivocal roles in disease, transcription factors (TFs) remain largely untapped as pharmacologic targets due to the challenges in targeting protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions. Here we report a chemical strategy to generate modular synthetic transcriptional repressors (STRs) derived from the bHLH domain of MAX. Our synthetic approach yields chemically stabilized tertiary domain mimetics that cooperatively bind the MYC/MAX consensus E-box motif with nanomolar affinity, exhibit specificity that is equivalent to or beyond that of full-length TFs and directly compete with MYC/MAX protein for DNA binding. A lead STR directly inhibits MYC binding in cells, downregulates MYC-dependent expression programs at the proteome level and inhibits MYC-dependent cell proliferation. Co-crystallization and structure determination of a STR:E-box DNA complex confirms retention of DNA recognition in a near identical manner as full-length bHLH TFs. We additionally demonstrate structure-blind design of STRs derived from alternative bHLH-TFs, confirming that STRs can be used to develop highly specific mimetics of TFs targeting other gene regulatory elements. Synthetic transcriptional repressors are engineered from natural DNA-binding domains."

https://openalex.org/W4307407991,"Asymmetric cell division gives rise to two daughter cells that inherit different determinants, thereby acquiring different fates. Polarized trafficking of endosomes containing fate determinants recently emerged as an evolutionarily conserved feature of asymmetric cell division to enhance the robustness of asymmetric cell fate determination in flies, fish and mammals. In particular, polarized sorting of signalling endosomes by an asymmetric central spindle contributes to asymmetric cell division in Drosophila melanogaster. However, how central spindle asymmetry arises remains elusive. Here we identify a moonlighting function of the Elongator complex-an established protein acetylase and tRNA methylase involved in the fidelity of protein translation-as a key factor for central spindle asymmetry. Elongator controls spindle asymmetry by stabilizing microtubules differentially on the anterior side of the central spindle. Accordingly, lowering the activity of Elongator on the anterior side using nanobodies mistargets endosomes to the wrong cell. Molecularly, Elongator regulates microtubule dynamics independently of its acetylation and methylation enzymatic activities. Instead, Elongator directly binds to microtubules and increases their polymerization speed while decreasing their catastrophe frequency. Our data establish a non-canonical role of Elongator at the core of cytoskeleton polarity and asymmetric signalling."
https://openalex.org/W4307412536,"Background Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) was associated with better clinical success and a lower rate of adverse events (AEs) than fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) in recent single center studies with mainly retrospective design and small case numbers (&lt; 50). The aim of this prospective European multicenter study is to compare both drainage procedures using ultrasound-guidance and primary metal stent implantation in patients with malignant distal bile duct obstruction (PUMa Trial). Methods The study is designed as a non-randomized, controlled, parallel group, non-inferiority trial. Each of the 16 study centers performs the procedure with the best local expertise (PTBD or EUS-BD). In PTBD, bile duct access is performed by ultrasound guidance. EUS-BD is performed as an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS), EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CDS) or EUS-guided antegrade stenting (EUS-AGS). Insertion of a metal stent is intended in both procedures in the first session. Primary end point is technical success. Secondary end points are clinical success, duration pf procedure, AEs graded by severity, length of hospital stay, re-intervention rate and survival within 6 months. The target case number is 212 patients (12 calculated dropouts included). Discussion This study might help to clarify whether PTBD is non-inferior to EUS-BD concerning technical success, and whether one of both interventions is superior in terms of efficacy and safety in one or more secondary endpoints. Randomization is not provided as both procedures are rarely used after failed endoscopic biliary drainage and study centers usually prefer one of both procedures that they can perform best.

https://openalex.org/W4307412544,"Effective conservation management strategies require accurate information on the movement patterns and behaviour of wild animals. To collect these data, researchers are increasingly turning to remote sensing technology such as radio-frequency identification (RFID). RFID technology is a powerful tool that has been widely implemented in ecological research to identify and monitor unique individuals, but it bears a substantial price tag, restricting this technology to generously-funded disciplines and projects. To overcome this price hurdle, we provide detailed step-by-step instructions to source the components for, and construct portable RFID loggers in house, at a fraction of the cost (~5%) of commercial RFID units. Here, we assess the performance of these RFID loggers in the field and describe their application in two studies of Australian mammal species; monitoring nest-box use in the Northern quolls ( Dasyurus hallucatus ) and observing the foraging habits of quenda ( Isoodon fusciventer ) at feeding stations. The RFID loggers performed well, identifying quenda in &gt;80% of visits, and facilitating the collection of individual-level behavioural data including common metrics such as emergence time, latency to approach, and foraging effort. While the technology itself is not novel, by lowering the cost per unit, our loggers enabled greater sample sizes, increasing statistical power from 0.09 to 0.75 in the quoll study. Further, we outline and provide solutions to the limitations of this design. Our RFID loggers proved an innovative method for collecting accurate behavioural and movement data. With their ability to successfully identify individuals, the RFID loggers described here can act as an alternative or complementary tool to camera traps. These RFID loggers can also be applied in a wide variety of projects which range from monitoring animal welfare or demographic traits to studies of anti-predator responses and animal personality, making them a valuable addition to the modern ecologists’ toolkit."

According to the findings of this study, it is recommended that the maximum product of spacing (MPSE) estimator of the WBHD is the best estimator according to overall rank table. The actuarial measurements were derived to the suggested distribution. By contrasting the WBHD with other competitive distributions using two different actual data sets collected from the COVID-19 mortality rates, we show the importance and flexibility of the WBHD."

Ursolic acid (UA) is a natural triterpenoid possessing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. However, how PTEN impacts metabolic rewiring and how UA modifies PTEN-driven metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unknown. In the current study, we found that UA protects against PTEN knockout (KO)-induced tumorigenesis at different stages of PCa. Epigenomic CpG methyl-seq revealed UA attenuated PTEN KO-induced differentially methylated regions (DMRs) profiles. Transcriptomic RNA-seq showed UA abrogated PTEN KO-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of PCa-related oncogenes' Has3, Cfh, and Msx1 overexpression, indicating UA plays a crucial role in PTEN KO-mediated gene regulation and its potential consequences on cancer interception. Association analysis of DEGs and DMRs identified that the mRNA expression of tumor suppressor gene BDH2, and oncogenes Ephas, Isg15, and Nos2 were correlated with the promoter CpG methylation status in the early-stage comparison groups indicating UA could regulate the oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes by modulating their promoter methylation at an early stage of prostate tumorigenesis. The metabolomic study showed UA attenuated PTEN KO-regulated cancer-associated metabolisms like purine metabolism/metabolites correlating with RNAseq findings, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolism, as well as epigenetic-related metabolites pyruvate and lactate indicating UA plays a critical role in PTEN KO-mediated metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming and its consequences on cancer development. In this context, UA impacts metabolic rewiring causing epigenetic and transcriptomic reprogramming potentially contributing to the overall protection against prostate-specific PTEN KO-mediated PCa."

The same result holds for the two lockdowns, although the second lockdown was less effective. Hence, Japanese non-compulsory lockdowns influence mobility in a similar way to the increase in infection cases.

This increased attention, however, has also sparked debates about whether the term “being moved” refers to a single distinct profile of emotion components or rather to a range of different emotion profiles.

Participants ( N = 106) provided written descriptions of both a moving personal experience and their conceptual prototype of “being moved,” which were subjected to content analysis to obtain quantitative data for statistical analyses. Based on latent class analyses, we identified two classes for both the personal experiences (joyfully-moved and sadly-moved classes) and the being-moved prototype (basic-description and extended-description classes). Being joyfully moved occurred when social values and positive relationship experiences were salient. Being sadly moved was elicited by predominantly negative relationship experiences and negatively salient social values. For both classes, the most frequently reported consequences for thought/action were continued cognitive engagement, finding meaning, and increased valuation of and striving for connectedness/prosociality. Basic descriptions of the prototype included “being moved” by positive or negative events as instances of the same emotion, with participants in the extended-description class also reporting joy and sadness as associated emotions. Based on our findings and additional theoretical considerations, we propose that the term “being moved” designates an emotion with an overall positive valence that typically includes blends of positively and negatively valenced emotion components, in which especially the weight of the negative components varies. The emotion’s unifying core is that it involves feeling the importance of individuals, social entities, and abstract social values as sources of meaning in one’s life."
https://openalex.org/W4307407887,"Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is frequently mutated in human cancer, but its roles in lymphopoiesis and tissue homeostasis remain poorly defined. Here we show that PTEN orchestrates a two-step developmental process linking antigen receptor and IL-23-Stat3 signalling to type-17 innate-like T cell generation. Loss of PTEN leads to pronounced accumulation of mature IL-17-producing innate-like T cells in the thymus. IL-23 is essential for their accumulation, and ablation of IL-23 or IL-17 signalling rectifies the reduced survival of female PTEN-haploinsufficient mice that model human patients with PTEN mutations. Single-cell transcriptome and network analyses revealed the dynamic regulation of PTEN, mTOR and metabolic activities that accompanied type-17 cell programming. Furthermore, deletion of mTORC1 or mTORC2 blocks PTEN loss-driven type-17 cell accumulation, and this is further shaped by the Foxo1 and Stat3 pathways. Collectively, our study establishes developmental and metabolic signalling networks underpinning type-17 cell fate decisions and their functional effects at coordinating PTEN-dependent tissue homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4307412541,"Objective Medical intensive care unit (MICU) admissions have been declining in people with HIV infection (PWH), but frequency of outpatient polypharmacy (prescription of ≥5 chronic medications) has increased. Among those hospitalized, we examined whether outpatient polypharmacy is associated with subsequent 1-year MICU admission or 10-year all-cause mortality, and if the association varies by HIV status. Design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Using a national electronic health record cohort of Veterans in care, we ascertained outpatient polypharmacy during fiscal year (FY) 2009 and followed patients for 1-year MICU admission and 10-year mortality. We assessed associations of any polypharmacy (yes/no and categorized ≤4, 5–7, 8–9, and ≥10 medications) with 1-year MICU admission and 10-year mortality using logistic and Cox regressions, respectively, adjusted for demographics, HIV status, substance use, and severity of illness. Results Among 9898 patients (1811 PWH) hospitalized in FY2010, prior outpatient polypharmacy was common (51%). Within 1 year, 1532 (15%) had a MICU admission and within 10 years, 4585 (46%) died. Polypharmacy was associated with increased odds of 1-year MICU admission, in both unadjusted (odds ratio (OR) 1.36 95% CI: (1.22, 1.52)) and adjusted models, aOR (95% CI) = 1.28 (1.14, 1.43) and with 10-year mortality in unadjusted, hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) = 1.40 (1.32, 1.48), and adjusted models, HR (95% CI) = 1.26 (1.19, 1.34). Increasing levels of polypharmacy demonstrated a dose-response with both outcomes and by HIV status, with a stronger association among PWH. Conclusions Among hospitalized patients, prior outpatient polypharmacy was associated with 1-year MICU admission and 10-year all-cause mortality after adjusting for severity of illness in PWH and PWoH."
https://openalex.org/W4307449328,"Recent research has included multiple measures of morphological awareness to address the dimensionality of morphological construct in the context of modeling skilled reading. However, a majority of studies have an Anglocentric focus. The current study aims to extend the previous studies to logographic learners by evaluating the dimensionality of morphological awareness in higher-order reading comprehension among Chinese adolescent readers. A total of 686 early adolescent students (339 fifth-grade students and 347 sixth-grade students) participated in the study. They completed a series of morphological awareness measurements (morpheme recognition, morpheme discrimination, and compound structure awareness), vocabulary knowledge, lexical inference and reading comprehension. By testing three alternative path models, the study showed that morphological awareness and vocabulary knowledge were best represented as parallel covariates in predicting Chinese reading comprehension. More important, the study highlighted the mediator of lexical inference in associating morphological awareness, vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension among Chinese readers. Empirical findings suggest that morphological awareness and vocabulary knowledge seem to be under a unitary construct in logographic reading acquisition and that word-meaning inference ability connects the path between morphological awareness and reading comprehension. These findings contribute to the complexity in the conceptualization of Chinese morphological awareness and reading instruction by examining the ways in which the morphological construct supports higher-order reading development."
https://openalex.org/W4307475649,"The interactions between layers of a multiplex network would generate new structural features, the most prominent feature being the existence of link overlaps between layers. How to capture the associations with the network behavior through the structural interaction between the combined layers of the multiplex network is a critical issue. In this paper, a new structure entropy is proposed by combining the overlapping links between the combined layers of a multiplex network. The correlation between layers is evaluated by structure entropy, and the results are consistent with the behaviors exhibited by the network. In addition, the validity and applicability of the proposed method were verified by conducting trials on four sets of real multiplex network data, which included the multiplex social network of a research department at Aarhus, tailor shop multiplex network, C. elegans multiplex network, and the network collected by Vickers from 29 seventh grade students in a school in Victoria."
https://openalex.org/W4307475744,"Agrivoltaics, which integrate photovoltaic power production with agriculture in the same plot of land, have the potential to reduce land competition, reduce crop irrigation, and increase solar panel efficiency. To optimize agrivoltaic systems for crop growth, energy pathways must be characterized. While the solar panels shade the crops, they also emit longwave radiation and partially block the ground from downwelling longwave radiation. A deeper understanding of the spatial variation in incoming energy would enable controlled allocation of energy in the design of agrivoltaic systems. The model also demonstrates that longwave energy should not be neglected when considering a full energy balance on the soil under solar panels."

https://openalex.org/W4307250944,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase (SGSH) deficiency. SGSH removes the sulfate from N-sulfoglucosamine residues on the nonreducing end of heparan sulfate (HS-NRE) within lysosomes. Enzyme deficiency results in accumulation of partially degraded HS within lysosomes throughout the body, leading to a progressive severe neurological disease. Enzyme replacement therapy has been proposed, but further evaluation of the treatment strategy is needed. Here, we used Chinese hamster ovary cells to produce a highly soluble and fully active recombinant human sulfamidase (rhSGSH). We discovered that rhSGSH utilizes both the CI-MPR and LRP1 receptors for uptake into patient fibroblasts. A single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of rhSGSH in MPS IIIA mice resulted in a tissue half-life of 9 days and widespread distribution throughout the brain. Following a single ICV dose, both total HS and the MPS IIIA disease-specific HS-NRE were dramatically reduced, reaching a nadir 2 weeks post dose. The durability of effect for reduction of both substrate and protein markers of lysosomal dysfunction and a neuroimmune response lasted through the 56 days tested. Furthermore, seven weekly 148 μg doses ICV reduced those markers to near normal and produced a 99.5% reduction in HS-NRE levels. A pilot study utilizing every other week dosing in two animals supports further evaluation of less frequent dosing. Finally, our dose-response study also suggests lower doses may be efficacious. Our findings show that rhSGSH can normalize lysosomal HS storage and markers of a neuroimmune response when delivered ICV."
https://openalex.org/W4307440402,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder with an increasing prevalence worldwide. Reduction in blood insulin level alters brain function by inducing oxidative stress with changes in dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmission, ultimately leading to neuropsychological symptoms. The efficacy of currently available psychotropic drugs is not satisfactory. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore the beneficial effects of a combination of the natural herbs, saffron and chamomile, in treating diabetes and its resultant neuropsychological effects using a rodent model of diabetes mellitus.The rats were randomly divided in to eight groups (n = 10), healthy control (HC), diabetic control (DC) and six groups of diabetic rats treated with various concentrations and combinations of saffron and chamomile. Diabetic treatment groups individually received methanolic extract and water decoction of chamomile (30 mg/kg) and saffron (10mg/kg) and their combined half doses (saffron 5mg/kg and chamomile 15mg/kg) for two weeks. Open field test (OFT) and forced swim test (FST) were used to measure the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of herbs, respectively. Finally, biochemical, and neurochemical estimations were made.The present study suggests the therapeutic effects of herbs especially in co-administrated decoction, against diabetes with improved antioxidant profile and enhanced levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Anxiolytic and antidepressant effects were evident with improvements in the OFT and FST. Examination of the cortex of the diabetic group revealed cellular damage and tangle formation, which indicates advanced stages of dementia.This study shows that the use of a combination of saffron and chamomile improves diabetes control and reduces its related psychiatric effects."
https://openalex.org/W4307440655,"Pain-free adults in the general population have been shown to possess unhelpful beliefs that certain movements and postures are harmful to the spine, potentially reinforcing fear-avoidance behaviour. Whether such beliefs occur in individuals undertaking regular powerlifting (PL) and Olympic weightlifting (OWL) training is unclear.In a cross-sectional study design, 67 individuals who participate in OWL and PL training completed an online survey. Demographic characteristics, training history, and self-reported perceptions of harm, on the 40-item Photograph Series of Daily Activities shortened electronic version (PHODA-SeV), were collected. After removing collinear variables, 13 items were entered into a network analysis, in which the adjusted correlations between items, and the centrality indices of each item (i.e., the degree of connection with other symptoms in the network) were quantified.Twenty-one (31.3%) participants had LBP symptoms. The pairwise correlations with the greatest magnitudes were between images of 'leg stretch' and 'jumping' (0.32 [95%CI 0.08 to 0.45]) and two images depicting ironing (0.32 [95%CI 0.05 to 0.54]) respectively. The three most Central (connected) items were 'stair ascend', 'walking with groceries', and 'mopping with spine flexion'.For individuals training in OWL and PL, images reflecting walking, rather than those depicting high spinal flexion angle, had greater connectivity to other activity items. In addition, the strongest correlations were not between items reflecting high spinal flexion angle. Future studies that investigate the relationship between different intensities of OWL and PL training and the dynamics of pain-related fear are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4307440665,"Background The disease burden of diabetes can have wide-ranging implications on patients’ psychological well-being and health-related quality of life. Glycated haemoglobin targets are commonly used to guide patient management in diabetes to reduce the future risk of developing diabetes complications, but little is known of the psychological impact of glycated haemoglobin target-setting. This protocol describes a study to determine the feasibility of evaluating psychological outcomes when setting explicit glycated haemoglobin targets in people with diabetes. Methods This single-centre randomised feasibility study will follow a mixed-methods approach across four sub-studies. In sub-study A, eligible adults (aged 18 and over) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes will complete baseline validated psychometric questionnaires evaluating health-related quality of life (EuroQoL-5D-5L), diabetes-related distress (Problem Areas In Diabetes), self-care (Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities), well-being (Well-Being Quetionnaire-12) and diabetes-related psychosocial self-efficacy (Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Long Form). Participants will be randomised to receive explicit glycated haemoglobin intervention targets 5mmol/mol above or below current glycated haemoglobin readings. Rates of eligibility, recruitment, retention and questionnaire response rate will be measured. Psychometric outcomes will be re-evaluated 3-months post-intervention. Sub-studies B and C will use qualitative semi-structured interviews to evaluate experiences, views and opinions of diabetes patients and healthcare professionals in relation to the acceptability of study processes, the use of glycated haemoglobin targets, the impact of diabetes on psychological well-being and, in sub-study D, barriers to participation in diabetes research. Discussion This mixed-methods study aims to provide a novel insight into the psychological implications of glycated haemoglobin target-setting for people with diabetes in secondary care, alongside testing the feasibility of undertaking a larger project of this nature.

https://openalex.org/W4307441045,"Reference intervals (RIs) help physicians in differentiating healthy from sick individuals. The prothrombin time (PT) and International normalized ratio (INR) fluctuate in coagulation pathway defects and have interlaboratory variability due to the instrument/reagent used. As direct method is difficult in children, we chose an indirect data mining method for the determining PT/INR RIs. The indirect method overcomes the substantial financial and logistic challenges, and ethical restrictions in children, moreover, allows partitioning in more fine-grained age groups. Prothrombin Time/INR measurements performed in patients aged birth-18 years between January 2013 and December 2020, were retrieved from laboratory management system of the Aga Khan Hospital. Reference intervals were computed using an indirect KOSMIC algorithm. The KOSMIC package function on the assumption that the non-pathologic samples follow a Gaussian distribution (after Box-Cox transformation of the data), following an elaborate statistical process to isolate distribution of physiological samples from mixed dataset. A total of 56,712 and 52,245 values were retrieved for PT and INR respectively. After the exclusion of patients with multiple specimens obtained during the study period, RIs were calculated for 37,356 (PT) and 37,192 (INR) children with stratification into 9 age groups. A comparison of 2.5th and 97.5th percentile results with those of established RIs from SickKids Handbook of Pediatric Thrombosis and Hemostasis demonstrated good agreement in between different age groups. This study supports data mining as an alternate approach for establishing PT/INR RIs, specifically in resource-limited settings. The results obtained are specific to studied population and instrument/reagent used. The study also allows understanding of fluctuations in coagulation pathways with increasing age and hence better clinical decision-making based on PT and INR results."
https://openalex.org/W4307468252,"Cachexia is a systemic disease associated with several pathologies, including cancer, that leads to excessive weight loss due to enhanced protein degradation. Previously, we showed that cachectic features in myotubes are provoked by a metabolic shift toward lactic fermentation. Our previous results led us to hyphotesise that increasing pyruvate concentration could impede the metabolic modifications responsible for induction of cachexia in myotubes. Here, we demonstrated that the addition of sodium pyruvate in conditioned media from CT26 colon cancer cells (CM CT26) prevents the onset of either phenotypic and metabolic cachectic features. Myotubes treated with CM CT26 containing sodium pyruvate show a phenotype similar to the healthy counterpart and display lactate production, oxygen consumption, and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity as control myotubes. The use of the Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier inhibitor UK5099, highlights the importance of mitochondrial pyruvate amount in the prevention of cachexia. Indeed, UK5099-treated myotubes show cachectic features as those observed in myotubes treated with CM CT26. Finally, we found that sodium pyruvate is able to decrease STAT3 phosphorylation level, a signaling pathway involved in the induction of cachexia in myotubes. Collectively, our results show that cachexia in myotubes could be prevented by the utilization of sodium pyruvate which impedes the metabolic modifications responsible for the acquisition of the cachectic features."
https://openalex.org/W4307475449,"Many works are designed to improve efficiency or enhance security and privacy of publicly-auditable cloud storage. However, building timeliness for cloud storage has not been well studied. Few works presented time-sensitive cloud storage and only focused on specific issues, such as the earliest creation time of files or resistance against a procrastinating auditor. Therefore, there leaves an absence of building traceable timeliness for publicly-auditable cloud storage. In this paper, we propose a solution PPTPS to build Privacy-Preserving auditable service with Traceable timeliness for Public cloud Storage. First, we use the security properties of the blockchain to provide a time-stamp for each phase. It enables the timeliness of cloud storage. Second, we construct efficient publicly-verifiable cloud storage. Third, a customized random mask solution is proposed to prevent privacy leakage during the auditing phase. Moreover, we formally proved the security of PPTPS. At last, experimental results demonstrate that PPTPS is economically sound and technically viable."

However, some problems still need to be overcome to achieve more precise pancreatic surgical simulation. The present study evaluates the performance of SYNAPSE VINCENT® (version 6.6, Fujifilm Medical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in the semiautomated surgical simulation of the pancreatic parenchyma, pancreatic ducts, and peripancreatic vessels using an artificial intelligence (AI) engine designed with deep learning algorithms. One-hundred pancreatic cancer patients and a control group of 100 nonpancreatic cancer patients were enrolled. The evaluation methods for visualizing the extraction were compared using the Dice coefficient (DC). In the pancreatic cancer patients, tumor size, position, and stagewise correlations with the pancreatic parenchymal DC were analyzed. The relationship between the pancreatic duct diameter and the DC, and between the manually and AI-measured diameters of the pancreatic duct were analyzed. In the pancreatic cancer/control groups, the pancreatic parenchymal DC and pancreatic duct extraction were 0.83/0.86 and 0.84/0.77. The DC of the arteries (portal veins/veins) and associated sensitivity and specificity were 0.89/0.88 (0.89/0.88), 0.85/0.83 (0.85/0.82), and 0.82/0.81 (0.84/0.81), respectively. No correlations were observed between pancreatic parenchymal DC and tumor size, position, or stage. No correlation was observed between the pancreatic duct diameter and the DC. A positive correlation (r = 0.61, p<0.001) was observed between the manually and AI-measured diameters of the pancreatic duct. Extraction of the pancreatic parenchyma, pancreatic duct, and surrounding vessels with the SYNAPSE VINCENT® AI engine assumed to be useful as surgical simulation."
https://openalex.org/W4307475729,"Predicting the admission scores of colleges and universities is significant for high school graduates in the College Entrance Examination in China (which is also called “Gaokao” for short). The practice of parallel application for the students after Gaokao not only puts forward a question about how students could make the best of their scores and make the best choice, but also results in the strong competition among different colleges and universities, with the institutions all striving to admit high-performing students in this examination. However, existing prevailing prediction algorithms and models of the admission score of the colleges and universities based on machine learning methods do not take such competitive relationship into consideration, but simply make predictions for individual college or university, causing low predication accuracy and poor generalization capability. This paper intends to analyze such competitive relationship by extracting the important features (e.g., project, location and score discrepancy) of colleges and universities. A novel competition model incorporating the coarse clustering is thus proposed to make the predictions for colleges and universities in a same cluster. By using Gaokao data of Shanxi province in China from 2016 to 2019, we testify the proposed model in comparison with several benchmark methods. The experimental results show that the precision within the error of 3 points and 5 points are 7.3% and 2.8% higher respectively than the second-best algorithm. It has proven that the competition model has the capability to fit the competitive relationship, thus improving the predication accuracy to a large extent. Theoretically, the method proposed could provide a more advanced and comprehensive view about the analysis of factors that may influence the admission score of higher institutions. Practically, the model proposed with high accuracy could help the students make the best of their scores and apply for the college and universities more scientifically."
