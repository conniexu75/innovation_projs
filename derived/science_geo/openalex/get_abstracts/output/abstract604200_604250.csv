https://openalex.org/W2793103551,"The functions of the paralogous transcriptional coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in bone are controversial. Each has been observed to promote or inhibit osteogenesis in vitro, with reports of both equivalent and divergent functions. Their combinatorial roles in bone physiology are unknown. We report that combinatorial YAP/TAZ deletion from skeletal lineage cells, using Osterix-Cre, caused an osteogenesis imperfecta-like phenotype with severity dependent on allele dose and greater phenotypic expressivity with homozygous TAZ vs. YAP ablation. YAP/TAZ deletion decreased bone accrual and reduced intrinsic bone material properties through impaired collagen content and organization. These structural and material defects produced spontaneous fractures, particularly in mice with homozygous TAZ deletion and caused neonatal lethality in dual homozygous knockouts. At the cellular level in vivo, YAP/TAZ ablation reduced osteoblast activity and increased osteoclast activity, in an allele dose-dependent manner, impairing bone accrual and remodeling. Transcriptionally, YAP/TAZ deletion and small-molecule inhibition of YAP/TAZ interaction with the transcriptional coeffector TEAD reduced osteogenic and collagen-related gene expression, both in vivo and in vitro. These data demonstrate that YAP and TAZ combinatorially promote bone development through regulation of osteoblast activity, matrix quality, and osteoclastic remodeling.-Kegelman, C. D., Mason, D. E., Dawahare, J. H., Horan, D. J., Vigil, G. D., Howard, S. S., Robling, A. G., Bellido, T. M., Boerckel, J. D. Skeletal cell YAP and TAZ combinatorially promote bone development."
https://openalex.org/W2791654447,"Background Many studies have examined the negative impact on smartphone addiction in adolescents. Recent concerns have focused on predictors of smartphone addiction. This study aimed to investigate the association of adolescents’ smartphone addiction with family environment (specifically, domestic violence and parental addiction). We further investigated whether self-control and friendship quality, as predictors of smartphone addiction, may reduce the observed risk. Methods We used the 2013 national survey on internet usage and utilization data from the National Information Agency of Korea. Information on exposure and covariates included self-reported experience of domestic violence and parental addiction, sociodemographic variables, and other variables potentially related to smartphone addiction. Smartphone addiction was estimated using a smartphone addiction proneness scale, a standardized measure developed by national institutions in Korea. Results Adolescents who had experienced domestic violence (OR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.23–2.45) and parental addiction (OR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.24–3.27) were found to be at an increased risk for smartphone addiction after controlling for all potential variables. Furthermore, on classifying adolescents according to their level of self-control and friendship quality the association between domestic violence and parental addiction, and smartphone addiction was found to be significant in the group with adolescents with lower levels of self-control (OR = 2.87; 95% CI: 1.68–4.90 and OR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.34–2.83) and friendship quality (OR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.41–3.85 and OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.26–2.64). Conclusion Our findings suggest that family dysfunction was significantly associated with smartphone addiction. We also observed that self-control and friendship quality act as protective factors against adolescents’ smartphone addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2793463729,"The goal of this study was to identify the intrinsic links that explain the effect of a Western diet (WD) on cognitive dysfunction. Specific pathogen-free, wild-type mice were fed either a control diet (CD) or a high-fat, high-sucrose WD after weaning and were euthanized at 10 mo of age to study the pathways that affect cognitive health. The results showed that long-term WD intake reduced hippocampal synaptic plasticity and the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in the brain and isolated microglia. A WD also activated ERK1/2 and reduced postsynaptic density-95 in the brain, suggesting postsynaptic damage. Moreover, WD-fed mice had increased inflammatory signaling in the brain, ileum, liver, adipose tissue, and spleen, which was accompanied by microglia activation. In the brain, as well as in the digestive tract, a WD reduced signaling regulated by retinoic acid and bile acids (BAs), whose receptors form heterodimers to control metabolism and inflammation. Furthermore, a WD intake caused dysbiosis and dysregulated BA synthesis with reduced endogenous ligands for BA receptors, i.e., farnesoid X receptor and G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor in the liver and brain. Together, dysregulated BA synthesis and dysbiosis were accompanied by systemic inflammation, microglial activation, and reduced neuroplasticity induced by WD.-Jena, P. K., Sheng, L., Di Lucente, J., Jin, L.-W., Maezawa, I., Wan, Y.-J. Y. Dysregulated bile acid synthesis and dysbiosis are implicated in Western diet-induced systemic inflammation, microglial activation, and reduced neuroplasticity."

Relative log expression (RLE) plots are a powerful tool for visualizing such variation in high dimensional data. We provide a detailed examination of these plots, with the aid of examples and simulation, explaining what they are and what they can reveal. RLE plots are particularly useful for assessing whether a procedure aimed at removing unwanted variation, i.e. a normalization procedure, has been successful. These plots, while originally devised for gene expression data from microarrays, can also be used to reveal unwanted variation in many other kinds of high dimensional data, where such variation can be problematic."
https://openalex.org/W2792116003,"Endoglin, a TGF-β coreceptor predominantly expressed in endothelial cells, plays an important role in vascular development and tumor-associated angiogenesis. However, the mechanism by which endoglin regulates angiogenesis, especially during tip cell formation, remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that endoglin promoted VEGF-induced tip cell formation. Mechanistically, endoglin interacted with VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 in a VEGF-dependent manner, which sustained VEGFR2 on the cell surface and prevented its degradation. Endoglin mutants deficient in the ability to interact with VEGFR2 failed to sustain VEGFR2 on the cell surface and to promote VEGF-induced tip cell formation. Further, an endoglin-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAb), TRC105, cooperated with a VEGF-A targeting mAb, bevacizumab, to inhibit VEGF signaling and tip cell formation in vitro and to inhibit tumor growth, metastasis, and tumor-associated angiogenesis in a murine tumor model. This study demonstrate a novel mechanism by which endoglin initiates and regulates VEGF-driven angiogenesis while providing a rationale for combining anti-VEGF and anti-endoglin therapy in patients with cancer.-Tian, H., Huang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2791800810,"Background Turnover intentions refer to employees’ intent to leave the organization and, within call centers, it can be influenced by factors such as relational variables or the perception of the quality of working life, which can be affected by emotional dissonance. This specific job demand to express emotions not felt is peculiar in call centers, and can influence job satisfaction and turnover intentions, a crucial problem among these working contexts. This study aims to detect, within the theoretical framework of the Job Demands-Resources Model, the role of emotional dissonance (job demand), and two resources, job autonomy and supervisors’ support, in the perception of job satisfaction and turnover intentions among an Italian call center. Method The study involved 318 call center agents of an Italian Telecommunication Company. Data analysis first performed descriptive statistics through SPSS 22. A path analysis was then performed through LISREL 8.72 and tested both direct and indirect effects. Results Results suggest the role of resources in fostering job satisfaction and in decreasing turnover intentions. Emotional dissonance reveals a negative relation with job satisfaction and a positive relation with turnover. Moreover, job satisfaction is negatively related with turnover and mediates the relationship between job resources and turnover. Conclusion This study contributes to extend the knowledge about the variables influencing turnover intentions, a crucial problem among call centers. Moreover, the study identifies theoretical considerations and practical implications to promote well-being among call center employees. To foster job satisfaction and reduce turnover intentions, in fact, it is important to make resources available, but also to offer specific training programs to make employees and supervisors aware about the consequences of emotional dissonance."
https://openalex.org/W2790458150,"Educators are increasingly interested in applying neuroscience findings to improve educational practice. However, their understanding of the brain often lags behind their enthusiasm for the brain. We propose that educational psychology can serve as a bridge between basic research in neuroscience and psychology on one hand and educational practice on the other. We evaluated whether taking an educational psychology course is associated with increased neuroscience literacy and reduced belief in neuromyths in a sample of South Korean pre-service teachers. The results showed that taking an educational psychology course was associated with the increased neuroscience literacy, but there was no impact on belief in neuromyths. We consider the implications of these and other findings of the study for redesigning educational psychology courses and textbooks for improving neuroscience literacy."
https://openalex.org/W2789912747,"Recent increases in fructose consumption have raised concerns about the potential adverse intergenerational effects of excess fructose intake. In the present study, we investigated whether excess maternal fructose intake affects hippocampal function in offspring. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 experimental groups: one group received distilled water, one group received 20% fructose water, and one group received 20% glucose water in addition to standard chow during gestation and lactation. Hippocampal function of offspring was evaluated by using novel object recognition and fear conditioning tests. Impaired cognitive performance was observed in the offspring of fructose-fed dams at postnatal d 60, potentially a result of decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that offspring from fructose-fed dams exhibited decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression, whereas pyrosequencing assays revealed increased DNA methylation at the BDNF promoter. The potential association between BDNF transcription and levels of DNA methylation was confirmed on the basis of luciferase activity. Furthermore, longitudinal analysis revealed that increased methylation of the BDNF promoter region was maintained at least until rats reached maturity. These results indicate that epigenetic changes associated with BDNF may underlie hippocampal dysfunction that is induced by early-life exposure to excess maternal fructose consumption.—Yamazaki, M., Yamada, H., Munetsuna, E., Ishikawa, H., Mizuno, G., Mukuda, T., Mouri, A., Nabeshima, T., Saito, K., Suzuki, K., Hashimoto, S., Ohashi, K.

https://openalex.org/W2793456104,"Argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) is a rate-limited enzyme in arginine biosynthesis. The oncogenic potential of ASS1 in terms of prognosis and cancer metastasis in arginine prototrophic gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear at present. We identify differentially expressed proteins in microdissected GC tumor cells relative to adjacent nontumor epithelia by isobaric mass tag for relative and absolute quantitation proteomics analysis. GC cells with stable expression or depletion of ASS1 were further analyzed to identify downstream molecules. We investigated their effects on chemoresistance and cell invasion in the presence or absence of arginine. ASS1 was highly expressed in GC and positively correlated with GC aggressiveness and poor outcome. Depletion of ASS1 led to inhibition of tumor growth and decreased cell invasion via induction of autophagy-lysosome machinery, resulting in degradation of active β-catenin, Snail, and Twist. Ectopic expression of ASS1 in GC cells reversed these effects and protected cancer cells from chemotherapy drug-induced apoptosis via activation of the AKT–mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. ASS1 contributes to GC progression by enhancing aggressive potential resulting from active β-catenin, Snail, and Twist accumulation. Our results propose that ASS1 might contribute to GC metastasis and support its utility as a prognostic predictor of GC—Tsai, C.-Y., Chi, H.-C, Chi, L.-M., Yang, H.-Y., Tsai, M.-M., Lee, K.-F., Huang, H.-W., Chou, L.-F., Cheng, A.-J., Yang, C.-W., Wang, C.-S., Lin, K.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2793626841,"Background This study was conducted to assess the effect of comorbidity, ethnicity, occupation, smoking and place of residence on allergic rhinitis (AR), acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Methods A GA2LEN (The Global Allergy and Asthma European Network) screening questionnaire was sent to a random sample of the Dutch population (n = 16700) in three different areas of the Netherlands. Results Fifty percent (8347) of the questionnaires sent were returned. A total of 29% respondents (27–31% in different areas) met the criteria for AR, 18% (17–21%) for ARS and 16% (13–18%) for CRS. Risk factors for AR were itchy rash, eczema, adverse response after taking a painkiller, asthma, CRS and ARS. Moreover, the risk of AR was twice as low for full-time housewives/househusbands than for people with jobs. The risk of ARS or CRS was significantly higher in respondents with a doctor’s diagnosis of CRS, AR, itchy rash or smoking. The risk of CRS was also significantly higher in respondents with an adverse response after taking painkillers, active smoking or asthma. Caucasians are generally less likely to have AR or CRS than Latin-Americans, Hindustani and African-Creoles, and more likely to have ARS than Asian, Hindustani, Mediterranean and African-Creoles. Conclusions This study found shared and distinct risk factors for AR, ARS and CRS and therefore provides support for the belief that they have shared symptoms but are different diseases with different aetiologies."
https://openalex.org/W2786107426,"Obesity is associated with increased inflammation and insulin resistance. In conditions with chronic immune activation, low plasma vitamin B6-levels are described, as well as an increased kynurenine:tryptophan-ratio (KTR). We investigated circulating tryptophan, kynurenine and its metabolites, neopterin, B-vitamins, CRP, and HbA1c in individuals with obesity before and after bariatric surgery.This longitudinal study included 37 patients with severe obesity, scheduled for bariatric surgery. Blood samples were taken at inclusion and at three months and one year postoperatively.We observed significant positive correlations between HbA1c and both 3-hydroxy-kynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid at inclusion. After surgery, fasting glucose, HbA1C and triglycerides decreased, whereas HDL-cholesterol increased. Tryptophan, kynurenine and its metabolites, except for anthranilic acid, decreased during weight loss. The KTR and CRP decreased while vitamin B6 increased during the year following operation, indicating reduced inflammation (all p<0.05).In patients with obesity subjected to bariatric surgery, levels of 3-hydroxykynurenine and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid seemed to be positively correlated to impaired glucose tolerance. One year following surgery, plasma levels of the kynurenine metabolites were substantially decreased, along with a metabolic improvement. The relation of circulating kynurenine pathway metabolites with biomarkers of metabolic impairment in patients with obesity needs further evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2789612511,"Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with progressive formation of renal cysts, kidney enlargement, hypertension, and typically end-stage renal disease. In ADPKD, inherited mutations disrupt function of the polycystins (encoded by PKD1 and PKD2), thus causing loss of a cyst-repressive signal emanating from the renal cilium. Genetic studies have suggested ciliary maintenance is essential for ADPKD pathogenesis. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) clients include multiple proteins linked to ciliary maintenance. We determined that ganetespib, a clinical HSP90 inhibitor, inhibited proteasomal repression of NEK8 and the Aurora-A activator trichoplein, rapidly activating Aurora-A kinase and causing ciliary loss in vitro. Using conditional mouse models for ADPKD, we performed long-term (10 or 50 wk) dosing experiments that demonstrated HSP90 inhibition caused durable in vivo loss of cilia, controlled cystic growth, and ameliorated symptoms induced by loss of Pkd1 or Pkd2. Ganetespib efficacy was not increased by combination with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, a glycolysis inhibitor showing some promise for ADPKD. These studies identify a new biologic activity for HSP90 and support a cilia-based mechanism for cyst repression.—Nikonova, A. S., Deneka, A. Y., Kiseleva, A.

https://openalex.org/W2786626861,"Animal and human studies suggest that prenatal exposure to stress is associated with adverse health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes. Epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation, is considered one possible underlying mechanism. The 1998 Quebec ice storm provides a unique opportunity to study an independent prenatal stressor on child outcomes. C-peptide is the best measure of endogenous insulin secretion and is widely used in the clinical management of patients with diabetes. The objectives of this study are to determine 1) the extent to which prenatal exposure to disaster-related stress (maternal objective hardship and maternal cognitive appraisal) influences children's C-peptide secretion, and 2) whether DNA methylation of diabetes-related genes mediates the effects of prenatal stress on C-peptide secretion. Children's (n = 30) C-peptide secretion in response to an oral glucose tolerance test were assessed in blood at 13½ years. DNA methylation levels of selected type 1 and 2 diabetes-related genes were chosen based upon the genes associated with prenatal maternal objective hardship and/or cognitive appraisal levels. Bootstrapping analyses were performed to determine the mediation effect of DNA methylation. We found that children whose mothers experienced higher objective hardship exhibited higher C-peptide secretion. Cognitive appraisal was not directly associated with C-peptide secretion. DNA methylation of diabetes-related genes had a positive mediation effect of objective hardship on C-peptide secretion: higher objective hardship predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. Negative mediation effects of cognitive appraisal were observed: negative cognitive appraisal predicted higher C-peptide secretion through DNA methylation. However, only one gene, LTA, remained a significant mediator of cognitive appraisal on C-peptide secretion after the conservative Bonferroni multiple corrections. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation could act as an intervening variable between prenatal stress and metabolic outcomes, highlighting the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in response to environmental factors."

The numerous varieties and strains of Cannabis produce strikingly different scents but to date there have been few, if any, attempts to quantify these olfactory profiles directly. Using standard sensory evaluation techniques with untrained consumers we have validated a preliminary olfactory lexicon for dried cannabis flower, and characterized the aroma profile of eleven strains sold in the legal recreational market in Colorado. We show that consumers perceive differences among strains, that the strains form distinct clusters based on odor similarity, and that strain aroma profiles are linked to perceptions of potency, price, and smoking interest."
https://openalex.org/W2791106104,"An aortic aneurysm (AA) is a focal dilatation of the aortic wall. Occurrence of AA rupture is an all too common event that is associated with high levels of patient morbidity and mortality. The decision to surgically intervene prior to AA rupture is made with recognition of significant procedural risks, and is primarily based on the maximal diameter and/or growth rate of the AA. Despite established thresholds for intervention, rupture occurs in a notable subset of patients exhibiting sub-critical maximal diameters and/or growth rates. Therefore, a pressing need remains to identify better predictors of rupture risk and ultimately integrate their measurement into clinical decision making. In this study, we use a series of finite element-based computational models that represent a range of plausible AA scenarios, and evaluate the relative sensitivity of wall stress to geometrical and mechanical properties of the aneurysmal tissue. Taken together, our findings encourage an expansion of geometrical parameters considered for rupture risk assessment, and provide perspective on the degree to which tissue mechanical properties may modulate peak stress values within aneurysmal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2791225817,"Acute pancreatitis is a common diagnosis worldwide, with gallstone disease being the most prevalent cause (50%). The American College of Gastroenterology recommends urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (within 24 h) for patients with biliary pancreatitis accompanied by cholangitis. Most international guidelines recommend that ERCP be performed within 72 h in patients with biliary pancreatitis and a bile duct obstruction without cholangitis, but the optimal timing for endoscopy is controversial. We investigated the optimal timing for ERCP in patients with biliary pancreatitis and a bile duct obstruction without cholangitis, and whether performing endoscopy within 24 h is superior to performing it after 24 h. We analyzed the clinical data of 505 patients with newly diagnosed acute pancreatitis, from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2014. We divided the patients into two groups according to the timing of ERCP: < 24 h (urgent) and 24–72 h (early).Among the 505 patients, 73 were diagnosed with biliary pancreatitis and a bile duct obstruction without cholangitis. The mean age of the patients was 55 years (range: 26–90 years). Bile duct stones and biliary sludge were identified on endoscopy in 45 (61.6%) and 11 (15.0%) patients, respectively. The timing of ERCP within 72 h was not associated with ERCP-related complications (P = 0.113), and the total length of hospital stay was not different between urgent and early ERCP (5.9 vs. 5.7 days, P = 0.174).

https://openalex.org/W2787655994,"Propionibacterium acnes is thought to be a causative agent of sarcoidosis. Patients with sarcoidosis have circulating immune complexes. We attempted to detect P. acnes-derived immune complexes in sarcoid lesions.We evaluated formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph node samples from 38 sarcoidosis patients and 90 non-sarcoidosis patients (27 patients with necrotizing lymphadenitis, 28 patients with reactive lymphadenitis, 16 patients with colon cancer, 19 patients with gastric cancer) by immunohistochemistry using anti-human immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) and complement (C1q and C3c) antibodies, and a P. acnes-specific monoclonal antibody (PAB antibody) that reacts with the membrane-bound lipoteichoic acid of P. acnes.Small round bodies (SRBs) bound to IgA, IgM, or IgG were detected in sinus macrophages, in 32 (84%), 32 (84%), or 11 (29%) sarcoid samples, respectively, and in 19 (21%), 26 (29%), or no (0%) control samples, respectively. Some of these insoluble immune complexes (IICs) also bound to C1q and C3c. We developed a microwave treatment followed by brief trypsin digestion (MT treatment) to detect PAB-reactive SRBs bound to immunoglobulins (IIC-forming P. acnes). MT treatment revealed abundant IIC-forming P. acnes in most (89%) of the sarcoid samples and sparse distribution in some (20%) of the control samples with lymphadenitis, but no IIC-forming P. acnes was detected in control samples without inflammation. IIC-forming P. acnes were mostly bound to both IgA and IgM. The PAB-reactive antigen and immunoglobulins were both located at the peripheral rim of the IIC-forming P. acnes. Conventional electron microscopy identified many SRBs (0.5-2.0 μm diameter) in sinus macrophages of sarcoid lymph nodes with many IIC-forming P. acnes, some of which were in phagolysosomes with a degraded and lamellar appearance.P. acnes-derived IICs in sinus macrophages were frequent and abundant in sarcoid lymph nodes, suggesting a potential etiologic link between sarcoidosis and this commensal bacterium."
https://openalex.org/W2793750340,"The components of ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system, such as Ub, Ub adaptors, or proteasome subunits, are commonly accumulated with the aggregated proteins in inclusions, but how protein aggregates sequester Ub-related proteins remains elusive. Using N-terminal huntingtin (Htt-N552) and ataxin (Atx)-3 as model proteins, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying sequestration of Ub adaptors by polyQ-expanded proteins. We found that polyQ-expanded Htt-N552 and Atx-3 sequester endogenous Ub adaptors, human RAD23 homolog B (hHR23B) and ubiquilin (UBQLN)-2, into inclusions. This sequestration effect is dependent on the UBA domains of Ub adaptors and the conjugated Ub of the aggregated proteins. Moreover, polyQ-expanded Htt-N552 and Atx-3 reduce the protein level of xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) by sequestration of hHR23B, suggesting that this process may cut down the available quantity of hHR23B and thus affect its normal function in stabilizing XPC. Our findings demonstrate that polyQ-expanded proteins sequester Ub adaptors or other Ub-related proteins into aggregates or inclusions through ubiquitination of the pathogenic proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2790546563,"Cells have developed lineage-specific mechanisms to control proliferation and drive morphologic changes upon differentiation. A hallmark of differentiation is the assembly of signaling molecules that transduce extracellular signals, such as the production of the G protein-regulated enzyme phospholipase Cb (PLCb), which generates calcium signals from sensory stimuli. We found that in most cancerous cell lines there is positive correlation between PLCb 1 levels and cell proliferation. In cells of neuronal lineage, however, reducing PLCb 1 levels increases the rate of proliferation. Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical methods, we find that, in the G1 phase, a cytosolic population of PLCb 1 associates with cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), a neuron-specific enzyme that is activated by cyclin Y to inactivate the antioncogenic protein p27Kip1. Binding of PLCb1 directly inhibits CDK16 activity and in turn reduces the ability of cells to enter the S phase. Activation of Gaq by carbachol causes movement of PLCb from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, reducing its association with CDK16. Similarly, the overexpression of activated Gaq moves PLCb 1 to the membrane, reverses G1 arrest, and promotes proliferation, thereby connecting external stimuli with cell proliferation. Our results present a model in which the transient high expression of PLCb1 that occurs at the onset of differentiation arrests cells in the G1 phase through its association with CDK16 and allows CDK16 to transition to its postmitotic function of neurite outgrowth and trafficking of synaptic vesicles. The novel role of PLCb 1 in neuronal cell proliferation offers a unique interaction that can be manipulated to guide cells into a neuronal phenotype or to develop therapies for neuroblastomas.— Garwain, O., Valla, K., Scarlata, S.

Rbfox3 homozygous knockout (Rbfox3-/-) mice exhibit deficits in visual learning; therefore, understanding the role of RBFOX3 in the retina is critical for interpreting behavioral results. We found Rbfox3 expression was developmentally regulated in the retina and specifically expressed in ganglion cells, amacrine cells and horizontal cells of the retina. We demonstrate deletion of Rbfox3 resulted in a reduction in the thickness of the inner plexiform layer of the retina, where synapses are formed. Number of ganglion cells and amacrine cells is normal with loss of Rbfox3. Innervation of retinal ganglion cells into their targeted brain regions is normal in Rbfox3-/- mice. Importantly, Rbfox3-/- mice displayed normal non-image and image forming functions. Taken together, our results suggest RBFOX3 is dispensable for visual function."
https://openalex.org/W2793620108,"Stroke-induced immune suppression predisposes the host to infections and can contribute to high morbidity and mortality in stroke patients. Because ischemic stroke has a profound effect on the systemic immune response, which may explain the increased susceptibility of stroke patients to infection, an urgent need persists for a better understanding of mechanisms associated with immune suppression; new and effective treatments for stroke can then be identified. NK cells play a key role in early host defense against pathogens by killing infected cells and/or producing cytokines such as IFN-γ. Because the phenotype and function of peripheral NK cells have been widely investigated in ischemic stroke, nCounter Inflammation Gene Array Analysis was used to build immune-related gene profiles of NK cells to comprehensively analyze the molecular signature of NK cells after ischemic brain injury. We observed distinct gene expression profiles reflecting different splenic NK-cell phenotypes and functional properties across the time course of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Based on gene expression and pathway-network analysis, lower expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) were observed in animals with MCAO compared with sham control animals. Genetic activation of STAT3 through the introduction of STAT3 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) plasmid prevented the loss of NK-cell-derived IFN-γ production after MCAO, together with reduced bacterial burden and mortality. Our data suggest that brain ischemia impairs NK-cell-mediated immune defense in the periphery, at least in part through the JAK-STAT3 pathway, which can be readdressed by modulating STAT3 activation status.-Jin, W.-N., Ducruet, A.

https://openalex.org/W2767956668,"Aim We explored the quality of life of adults with cerebral palsy without an intellectual disability and the predictors of quality of life. Background Because cerebral palsy is a disease that manifests in childhood, much of the research into quality of life for those dealing with it focuses on children; there are few studies that evaluate the quality of life of adults with cerebral palsy. Therefore, it is important to consider their perceptions in order to improve their general wellbeing and self-determination. Design This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study. Method Quality of life was measured using the GENCAT Quality of Life Scale. Demographic and personal variables were also collected and examined. Participants comprised 75 adults (58.7 percent men, mean age = 40.84 years) with cerebral palsy who were members of the National Cerebral Palsy Association of Spain between 2014 and 2015. A linear multivariate model was examined as well. Results The overall mean score indicator of participants’ quality of life was 103.29, which corresponds to the 56.6th percentile on the GENCAT scale. Examining the level of qualification, we found significant differences in the factors “personal development” and “self-determination,” and those with a university education obtained higher scores than their less-educated counterparts. Having a partner was related to higher quality of life standard scores. After constructing a linear model, it was observed that maintaining sexual relationships was another factor that increased participants’ quality of life. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of social and romantic relationships to achieve a better quality of life in adults with cerebral palsy who do not have an intellectual disability. Social integration and sexuality education programs should be developed to improve their quality of life."

Both nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and NMDAR play a critical role in the development of the nervous system. Moreover, nAChR can interact with NMDAR, and previous studies have demonstrated modulation of NMDAR by nAChR. In our study, we used an α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) agonist and α7nAChR antagonist to explore the role of α7nAChR and NMDAR in sevoflurane-induced long-term effects on memory and dendritic spine both in vivo and in vitro. The results revealed that the activation of α7nAChR attenuated the development of sevoflurane-induced memory deficit and dendritic spine changes, which might be by regulating NR2B-containing NMDAR trafficking from the intracellular pool to the cell surface pool in the hippocampus. Moreover, we demonstrated that α7nAChR could regulate NR2B-containing NMDAR via Src-family tyrosine kinase (SFK). Thus, our current study indicates that the trafficking of NR2B-containing NMDAR is regulated by α7nAChR via SFK in neonatal rat hippocampus, which may be secondary to sevoflurane-induced cognitive deficits in the developing hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2790691542,"The mechanisms which structure communities have been the focus of a large body of research. Here, we address the question if habitat characteristics describing habitat quality may drive changes in community composition and beta diversity of bromeliad-inhabiting microfauna. In our system, changes in canopy cover along an environmental gradient may affect resource availability, disturbance in form of daily water temperature fluctuations and predation, and thus may lead to changes in community structure of bromeliad microfauna through differences in habitat quality along this gradient. Indeed, we observed distinct changes in microfauna community composition along the environmental gradient explained by changes in the extent of daily water temperature fluctuations. We found beta diversity to be higher under low habitat quality (low canopy cover) than under high habitat quality (high canopy cover), which could potentially be explained by a higher relative importance of stochastic processes under low habitat quality. We also partitioned beta diversity into turnover and nestedness components and we found a nested pattern of beta diversity along the environmental gradient, with communities from the lower-quality habitat being nested subsets of communities from the higher-quality habitat. However, this pattern resulted from an increase in microfauna alpha diversity with an increase in habitat quality. By providing insights into microfauna-environment relationships our results contribute to the mechanistic understanding of community dynamics in small freshwater bodies. Here, we highlight the importance of habitat characteristics representing habitat quality in structuring communities, and suggest that this information may help to improve conservation practices of small freshwater ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2792221206,"Background Selective reporting is wasteful, leads to bias in the published record and harms the credibility of science. Studies on potential determinants of selective reporting currently lack a shared taxonomy and a causal framework. Objective To develop a taxonomy of determinants of selective reporting in science. Design Inductive qualitative content analysis of a random selection of the pertinent literature including empirical research and theoretical reflections. Methods Using search terms for bias and selection combined with terms for reporting and publication, we systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases up to January 8, 2015. Of the 918 articles identified, we screened a 25 percent random selection. From eligible articles, we extracted phrases that mentioned putative or possible determinants of selective reporting, which we used to create meaningful categories. We stopped when no new categories emerged in the most recently analyzed articles (saturation). Results Saturation was reached after analyzing 64 articles. We identified 497 putative determinants, of which 145 (29%) were supported by empirical findings. The determinants represented 12 categories (leaving 3% unspecified): focus on preferred findings (36%), poor or overly flexible research design (22%), high-risk area and its development (8%), dependence upon sponsors (8%), prejudice (7%), lack of resources including time (3%), doubts about reporting being worth the effort (3%), limitations in reporting and editorial practices (3%), academic publication system hurdles (3%), unfavorable geographical and regulatory environment (2%), relationship and collaboration issues (2%), and potential harm (0.4%). Conclusions We designed a taxonomy of putative determinants of selective reporting consisting of 12 categories. The taxonomy may help develop theory about causes of selection bias and guide policies to prevent selective reporting."
https://openalex.org/W2785502685,"The present study investigated differences in the pickup of information about the size and location of an obstacle in the path of locomotion. The main hypothesis was that information about obstacle location is most useful when it is sampled at a specific time during the approach phase, whereas information about obstacle size can be sampled at any point during the last few steps. Subjects approached and stepped over obstacles in a virtual environment viewed through a head-mounted display. In Experiment 1, a horizontal line on the ground indicating obstacle location was visible throughout the trial while information about obstacle height and depth was available only while the subject was passing through a viewing window located at one of four locations along the subject's path. Subjects exhibited more cautious behavior when the obstacle did not become visible until they were within one step length, but walking behavior was at most weakly affected in the other viewing window conditions. In Experiment 2, the horizontal line indicating obstacle location was removed, such that no information about the obstacle (size or location) was available outside of the viewing window. Subjects adopted a more cautious strategy compared to Experiment 1 and differences between the viewing window conditions and the full vision control condition were observed across several measures. The differences in walking behavior and performance across the two experiments support the hypothesis that walkers have greater flexibility in when they can sample information about obstacle size compared to location. Such flexibility may impact gaze and locomotor control strategies, especially in more complex environments with multiple objects and obstacles."
https://openalex.org/W2785552564,"Diacylglycerol (DAG) and monoacylglycerol (MAG) are two natural occurring minor components found in most edible fats and oils. These compounds have gained increasing market demand owing to their unique physicochemical properties. Enzymatic glycerolysis in solvent-free system might be a promising approach in producing DAG and MAG-enriched oil. Understanding on glycerolysis mechanism is therefore of great importance for process simulation and optimization. In this study, a commercial immobilized lipase (Lipozyme TL IM) was used to catalyze the glycerolysis reaction. The kinetics of enzymatic glycerolysis reaction between triacylglycerol (TAG) and glycerol (G) were modeled using rate equation with unsteady-state assumption. Ternary complex, ping-pong bi-bi and complex ping-pong bi-bi models were proposed and compared in this study. The reaction rate constants were determined using non-linear regression and sum of square errors (SSE) were minimized. Present work revealed satisfactory agreement between experimental data and the result generated by complex ping-pong bi-bi model as compared to other models. The proposed kinetic model would facilitate understanding on enzymatic glycerolysis for DAG and MAG production and design optimization of a pilot-scale reactor."
https://openalex.org/W2790087458,"The transmission of Plasmodium within a vertebrate host population is strongly associated with the life history traits of its vector. Therefore the effect of malaria infection on mosquito fecundity and longevity has traditionally received a lot of attention. Several species of malaria parasites reduce mosquito fecundity, nevertheless almost all of the studies have focused only on the first gonotrophic cycle. Yet, during their lifetime, female mosquitoes go through several gonotrophic cycles, which raises the question of whether they are able to compensate the fecundity costs induced by the parasite. The impact of Plasmodium infection on female longevity is not so clear and has produced conflicting results. Here we measured the impact of Plasmodium relictum on its vector’s longevity and fecundity during three consecutive gonotrophic cycles. In accordance with previous studies, we observed a negative impact of Plasmodium infection on mosquito (Culex pipiens) fecundity in the first gonotrophic cycle. Interestingly, despite having taken two subsequent uninfected blood meals, the negative impact of malaria parasite persisted. Nevertheless no impact of infection on mosquito longevity was observed. Our results are not in line with the hypothesis that the reduction of fecundity observed in infected mosquitoes is an adaptive strategy of Plasmodium to increase the longevity of its vector. We discuss the different underlying mechanisms that may explain our results."
https://openalex.org/W2791369778,"Predation impacts development, behavior and morphology of prey species thereby shaping their abundances, distribution and community structure. Non-lethal threat of predation, specifically, can have a strong influence on prey lifehistory characteristics. While investigations often focus on the impact of predation threat on prey in isolation, tests of its interactive effects with food availability and resource competition on prey survival and fitness can improve understanding of costs, benefits and trade-offs of anti-predator strategies. This study, involving Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as a model organism, investigates both simple and interactive effects of predation threat during the larval stage on survival, size at and time to maturity, stored teneral reserves of glycogen, protein and lipid in adults, and adult longevity. Our results show that development times of mosquito larvae were increased (by 14.84% in males and by 97.63% in females), and size of eclosing adults decreased (by 62.30% in males and by 58.33% in females) when exposed to lowered nutrition and elevated intraspecific competition, but that predation had no detectable effect on these simple traits. Teneral reserves of glycogen, protein and lipid and adult longevity were positively correlated with adult body size. Non-lethal predation threat had significant interactive effects with nutrition and larval competition on teneral reserves in males and adult longevity in males and females. The sexes responded differently to conditions encountered as larvae, with the larval environment affecting development and adult characteristics more acutely for females than for males. The outcome of this study shows how threat of predation on juveniles can have long-lasting effects on adults that are likely to impact mosquito population dynamics and that may impact disease transmission."

Despite its variable clinical course, the clinical and immunological factors associated with radiographical severity and progression are not largely unknown. We aimed to study the association between the inflammatory cell and cytokine profiles at the local infected site, and the radiological severity and/or progression of pulmonary MAC infection. In this retrospective cohort study, 22 healthy subjects and 37 consecutive patients who were diagnosed as having pulmonary MAC infection by positive cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were enrolled. The 37 patients were divided into 2 groups based on the predominant BAL inflammatory cell type: the lymphocyte-dominant (LD) group and neutrophil-dominant (ND) groups. The high-resolution computed tomography score in both the lavaged segment and whole lung and cytokines profiles were compared between the 2 groups. The clinical course after the BAL procedure was also compared between the 2 groups. Both the segment and whole lung scores in the ND group were significantly higher than the LD group (P < 0.001). Levels of IL-8 in the BAL fluids were significantly higher in the ND group compared to the LD group (P = 0.01). In contrast, levels of IL-22 were significantly lower in the ND group compared to the LD group (P < 0.001). The prevalence of patients who showed deterioration of the disease was significantly higher in the ND group (83.3%) than the LD group (12.5%) (P < 0.01). Neutrophil-predominant inflammatory response at the infected site is associated with the radiographical severity and progression of pulmonary MAC infection."
https://openalex.org/W2785398025,"Mechanical and kinematical aligning techniques are the usual positioning methods during total knee arthroplasty. However, alteration of the physiological joint line and unbalanced medio-lateral load distribution are considered disadvantages in the mechanical and kinematical techniques, respectively. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the joint line on the strain and stress distributions in an implanted knee and their sensitivity to rotational mal-alignment. Finite element calculations were conducted to analyse the stresses in the PE-Inlay and the mechanical strains at the bone side of the tibia component-tibia bone interface during normal positioning of the components and internal and external mal-rotation of the tibial component. Two designs were included, a horizontal and a physiological implant. The loading conditions are based on internal knee joint loads during walking. A medialization of the stresses on the PE-Inlay was observed in the physiological implant in a normal position, accompanied by higher stresses in the mal-rotated positions. Within the tibia component-tibia bone interface, similar strain distributions were observed in both implant geometries in the normal position. However, a medialization of the strains was observed in the physiological implant in both mal-rotated conditions with greater bone volume affected by higher strains. Although evident changes due to mal-rotation were observed, the stresses do not suggest a local plastic deformation of the PE-Inlay. The strains values within most of the tibia component-tibia bone interface were in the physiological strain zone and no significant bone changes would be expected. The physiological cut on the articular aspect showed no detrimental effect compared to the horizontal implant."
https://openalex.org/W2787194572,"Aim and background We present a typology of cacao agroforest systems in Colombian Amazonia. These systems had yet to be described in the literature, especially their potential in terms of biodiversity conservation. The systems studied are located in a post-conflict area, and a deforestation front in Colombian Amazonia. Cacao cropping systems are of key importance in Colombia: cacao plays a prime role in post conflict resolution, as cacao is a legal crop to replace illegal crops; cacao agroforests are expected to be a sustainable practice, promoting forest-friendly land use. Material and methods We worked in 50 x 2000 m2 agroforest plots, in Colombian Amazonia. A cluster analysis was used to build a typology based on 28 variables characterised in each plot, and related to diversity, composition, spatial structure and light availability for the cacao trees. We included variables related to light availability to evaluate the amount of transmitted radiation to the cacao trees in each type, and its suitability for cacao ecophysiological development. Main results We identified 4 types of cacao agroforests based on differences concerning tree species diversity and the impact of canopy spatial structure on light availability for the cacao trees in the understorey. We found 127 tree species in the dataset, with some exclusive species in each type. We also found that 3 out of the 4 types identified displayed an erosion of tree species diversity. This reduction in shade tree species may have been linked to the desire to reduce shade, but we also found that all the types described were compatible with good ecophysiological development of the cacao trees. Main conclusions and prospects Cacao agroforest systems may actually be achieving biodiversity conservation goals in Colombian Amazonia. One challenging prospect will be to monitor and encourage the conservation of tree species diversity in cacao agroforest systems during the development of these cropping systems, as a form of forest-friendly management enhancing sustainable peace building in Colombia."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the choice of the reference genome on the cgSNV-informed phylogenetic clustering and inferred isolate relationships. We found that using a draft or closed genome of S. Heidelberg as reference did not impact the ability of the cgSNV methodology to differentiate among 145 S. Heidelberg isolates involved in foodborne outbreaks. We also found that using a distantly related genome such as S. Dublin as choice of reference led to a loss in resolution since some sporadic isolates were found to cluster together with outbreak isolates. In addition, the genetic distances between outbreak isolates as well as between outbreak and sporadic isolates were overall reduced when S. Dublin was used as the reference genome as opposed to S.

https://openalex.org/W2793321809,"Cancer patients with hematopoietic tumors exhibit particularly high rates of anxiety disorders and depression, and often develop negative affect. In addition, psychological problems experienced by cancer patients impair their quality of life. When cancer patients feel anxious, they tend to direct their attention toward stimuli associated with threat in the surrounding environment. If attentional bias occurs in patients with hematopoietic tumors, who are at particular risk of developing negative affect, resolution of the bias could be useful in alleviating their anxiety. The current study examined the association between attentional bias and negative affect in patients with hematopoietic tumors and tested the hypothesis that negative affect would be more severe in those who exhibited greater attentional bias. Twenty-seven patients with hematopoietic tumors participated in the study. Reaction time (RT) was measured as the time between the presentation of the threatening and neutral images, and the subject’s button press to indicate choice (neutral expressions). Eight combinations of “threatening” expressions with high emotional valence and “neutral” expressions with low emotional valence were presented. The images used to measure attentional bias were taken from the Japanese Female Facial Expression Database and had been rated as expressive of anger, sadness, or neutrality, with predetermined emotional valence. Psychological testing was performed with the Profile of Mood States (POMS). To examine the association between attentional bias and negative affect, we calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for RTs and POMS. Subjects’ mean RT was 882.9 (SD = 100.9) ms, and 19 of the 27 subjects exhibited slower RTs relative to healthy individuals. RT was significantly positively correlated with Tension-Anxiety (r = .679, p < .01) and Fatigue (r = .585, p < .01) subscale scores. The results of the study suggested that attentional bias toward threatening expressions could be positively correlated with the mental intensity of anxiety and fatigue in patients with hematopoietic tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2787491143,"Introduction The practice of physical activity is an important factor in the prevention of health problems. However, a small portion of the population is physically active. Recent reviews show that physical activity classes in community settings have the potential to increase population levels of physical activity and reduce health inequalities. Objective To evaluate the effect of the Academias da Cidade Program in Belo Horizonte on the practice of physical activity in leisure time (PALT) by non-users living near the program centers. Methods We conducted a home-based health survey in Belo Horizonte (2008–2009) with 1,581 adults who were non-users of the program and who lived within a 1,500-meter radius of one active program center (exposed group) and two nonoperational centers with sites reserved for their construction (unexposed group). We collected data on PALT levels (≥150 minutes/week), which was measured with the Physical Activity International Questionnaire and analyzed with binary logistic regression using the Generalized Estimating Equations method. The propensity score was used as an adjustment variable to control the potential confusion in the measures of effect of exposure studied. Results The overall prevalence of the PALT was 26.5% in the exposed group and 22.7% in the unexposed group. The exposed group was more likely to be active in leisure time (OR = 1.05; CI 95%: 1.01–1.10). When considering the interaction between exposed group and distance, individuals in the exposed group who lived less than 500 meters from the program center were more likely to be active in leisure time (OR = 1.18, CI 95%: 1.03–1.35) compared to their counterparts. Conclusion Promoting physical activity in the community can favorably affect PALT levels among residents, especially those living closest to intervention centers. We believe the Academias da Cidade Program is a promising strategy to facilitate the access to appropriate spaces for the practice of physical activity and contribute to increase the levels physical activity within populations."

S. maltophilia has been recently described as an Amoebae-Resistant Bacteria (ARB) that exists as part of the microbiome of various free-living amoebae (FLA) from waters. Co-culture approaches with Vermamoeba vermiformis demonstrated the ability of this bacterium to resist amoebal digestion. In the present study, we assessed the survival and growth of six environmental and one clinical S. maltophilia strains within two amoebal species: Acanthamoeba castellanii and Willaertia magna. We also evaluated bacterial virulence properties using the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. A co-culture approach was carried out over 96 hours and the abundance of S. maltophilia cells was measured using quantitative PCR and culture approach. The presence of bacteria inside the amoeba was confirmed using confocal microscopy. Our results showed that some S. maltophilia strains were able to multiply within both amoebae and exhibited multiplication rates up to 17.5 and 1166 for A. castellanii and W. magna, respectively. In contrast, some strains were unable to multiply in either amoeba. Out of the six environmental S. maltophilia strains tested, one was found to be virulent. Surprisingly, this strain previously isolated from a soil amoeba, Micriamoeba, was unable to infect both amoebal species tested. We further performed an assay with a mutant strain of S. maltophilia BurA1 lacking the efflux pump ebyCAB gene and found the mutant to be more virulent and more efficient for intra-amoebal multiplication. Overall, the results obtained strongly indicated that free-living amoebae could be an important ecological niche for S. maltophilia."

We sought to determine whether AMPK was necessary for the maintenance of DAPC expression in skeletal muscle. Fast, glycolytic extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and slow, oxidative soleus (Sol) muscles from wild-type mice and from littermates with skeletal muscle-specific knockout of the AMPK β1 and β2 subunits (AMPK β1 β2M-KO; MKO) were analyzed. DAPC mRNA and protein expression were similar between genotypes, with the exception of elevated neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression at the sarcolemma in MKO muscles. The content of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of the DAPC was also not affected by the loss of AMPK. However, MyoD and myogenin expression was diminished in MKO muscles, consistent with previous reports of myopathy in these animals. Furthermore, we observed decrements in extrasynaptic utrophin expression selectively in MKO Sol muscles, likely due to the adaptive accumulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α at the sarcolemma of MKO EDL muscles. Collectively, the evidence indicates that AMPK is sufficient but not essential for the maintenance of DAPC expression in skeletal muscle, yet it is required for preserving extrasynaptic utrophin levels in slow oxidative muscles.—Dial A.

This enhanced cell-damaging effect is also observed in superinfected tissue cultures, leading to a strong decrease in overall cell viability. In our analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms, we observed that, despite enhanced cell damage in superinfection, S. aureus did not increase but rather inhibited influenza virus (IV)-induced apoptosis in cells on the level of procaspase-8 activation. This apparent contradiction was solved when we observed that S. aureus mediated a switch from apoptosis to necrotic cell death of IV-infected cells, a mechanism that was dependent on the bacterial accessory gene regulator ( agr) locus that promotes bacterial survival and spread. This so far unknown action may be a bacterial strategy to enhance dissemination of intracellular S. aureus and may thereby contribute to increased tissue damage and severity of disease.-Van Krüchten, A., Wilden, J.

Previous studies have indicated that reactive gliosis, which is associated with stroke, inhibits neurogenesis from both endogenous and grafted neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) of rodent origin. Here we have assessed whether reactive astrocytes affect the fate of human iPSC-derived NSPCs transplanted into stroke-injured brain. Mice with genetically attenuated reactive gliosis (deficient for GFAP and vimentin) were subjected to cortical stroke and cells were implanted adjacent to the ischemic lesion one week later. At 8 weeks after transplantation, immunohistochemical analysis showed that attenuated reactive gliosis did not affect neurogenesis or commitment towards glial lineage of the grafted NSPCs. Our findings, obtained in a human-to-mouse xenograft experiment, provide evidence that the reactive gliosis in stroke-injured brain does not affect the formation of new neurons from intracortically grafted human iPSC-derived NSPCs. However, for a potential clinical translation of these cells in stroke, it will be important to clarify whether the lack of effect of reactive gliosis on neurogenesis is observed also in a human-to-human experimental setting."

Self-assembled nanostructures were prepared using a modified thin-film hydration technique. The formulae compositions were designed based on response surface statistical design. The prepared self-assembled nanostructures were characterized by testing their drug content, particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, partition coefficient, release half-life and extent. The optimized formulae having the highest drug content, zeta potential, partition coefficient, release half-life and extent with the lowest particle size and polydispersity index were subjected to further investigations including investigation of their physicochemical, morphological characteristics, in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. The optimized formulae were prepared at pH 8.7 (F5 and F6) and composed of L-α-Phosphatidylcholine and drug mixed in a ratio of 1:1 and 2:1 w/w, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2787312730,"Continuous flash suppression (CFS) has become a popular tool for studying unconscious processing, but the level at which unconscious processing of visual stimuli occurs under CFS is not clear. Response priming is a robust and well-understood phenomenon, in which the prime stimulus facilitates overt responses to targets if the prime and target are associated with the same response. We used CFS to study unconscious response priming of shape: arrows with left or right orientation served as primes and targets. The prime was presented near the limen of consciousness and each trial was followed by subjective rating of visibility and a forced-choice response concerning the orientation of the prime in counterbalanced order. In trials without any reported awareness of the presence of the prime, discrimination of the prime's orientation was at chance level. However, priming was elicited in such unconscious trials. Unconscious priming was not influenced by the prime-target onset-asynchrony (SOA)/prime duration, whereas conscious processing, as indicated by the enhanced discriminability of the prime's orientation and conscious priming, increased at the longest SOAs/prime durations. These results show that conscious and unconscious processes can be dissociated with CFS and that CFS-masking does not completely suppress unconscious visual processing of shape."
https://openalex.org/W2789457966,"This paper examines the association between the Great Recession and real assets among families with young children. Real assets such as homes and cars are key indicators of economic well-being that may be especially valuable to low-income families. Using longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 4,898), we investigate the association between the city unemployment rate and home and car ownership and how the relationship varies by family structure (married, cohabiting, and single parents) and by race/ethnicity (White, Black, and Hispanic mothers). Using mother fixed-effects models, we find that a one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a -0.5 percentage point decline in the probability of home ownership and a -0.7 percentage point decline in the probability of car ownership. We also find that the recession was associated with lower levels of home ownership for cohabiting families and for Hispanic families, as well as lower car ownership among single mothers and among Black mothers, whereas no change was observed among married families or White households. Considering that homes and cars are the most important assets among middle and low-income households in the U.S., these results suggest that the rise in the unemployment rate during the Great Recession may have increased household asset inequality across family structures and race/ethnicities, limiting economic mobility, and exacerbating the cycle of poverty."

https://openalex.org/W2794248294,"Range-restricted species generally have specific niche requirements and may often have unique evolutionary histories. Unfortunately, many of these species severely lack basic research, resulting in poor conservation strategies. The phylogenetic relationship of the Critically Endangered Forest Owlet Heteroglaux blewitti has been the subject of a century-old debate. The current classifications based on non-phylogenetic comparisons of morphology place the small owls of Asia into three genera, namely, Athene, Glaucidium, and Heteroglaux. Based on morphological and anatomical data, H. blewitti has been alternatively hypothesized to belong within Athene, Glaucidium, or its own monotypic genus Heteroglaux. To test these competing hypotheses, we sequenced six loci (~4300 bp data) and performed phylogenetic analyses of owlets. Mitochondrial and nuclear trees were not congruent in their placement of H. blewitti. However, both mitochondrial and nuclear combined datasets showed strong statistical support with high maximum likelihood bootstrap (>/ = 90) and Bayesian posterior probability values (>/ = 0.98) for H. blewitti being nested in the currently recognized Athene group, but not sister to Indian A. brama. The divergence of H. blewitti from its sister taxa was between 4.3 and 5.7 Ma coinciding with a period of drastic climatic changes in the Indian subcontinent. This study presented the first genetic analysis of H. blewitti, a Critically Endangered species, and addressed the long debate on the relationships of the Athene-Heteroglaux-Glaucidium complex.

https://openalex.org/W2787603649,"Adenovirus vectors are widely used in gene therapy clinical trials, and preclinical studies with these vectors are often conducted in mice. It is therefore critical to understand whether mouse studies adequately predict the behavior of adenovirus vectors in humans. The most commonly-used adenovirus vectors are derived from adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5). The Ad5 hexon protein can bind coagulation factor X (FX), and binding of FX has a major impact on vector interactions with other blood proteins. In mouse serum, FX protects Ad5 vectors from neutralization by natural antibodies and complement. In the current study, we similarly find that human FX inhibits neutralization of Ad5 vectors by human serum, and this finding is consistent among individual human sera. We show that human IgM and human IgG can each induce complement-mediated neutralization when Ad5 vectors are not protected by FX. Although mouse and human serum had similar effects on Ad5 vectors, we found that this was not true for a chimeric Ad5 vector that incorporated hexon regions from adenovirus serotype 48. Interestingly, this hexon-chimeric vector was neutralized by human serum, but not by mouse serum. These findings indicate that studies in mouse serum accurately predict the behavior of Ad5 vectors in human serum, but mouse serum is not an accurate model system for all adenovirus vectors."

As we have previously reported that the nucleotide receptor P2Y purinoceptor 2 (P2Y2R) regulates the proteasomal catalytic activities, we wonder whether this receptor is involved in the UPS disturbances associated with the neuroinflammation process. With the use of mice expressing a UPS reporter [mice expressing the UPS reporter ubiquitinG76V-green fluorescent protein (UbGFP mice)], we found that LPS-induced acute neuroinflammation status causes a UPS impairment in astrocytes and microglial cells by a mechanism dependent on P2Y2R. In this line, LPS-treated double transgenic UbGFP; P2Y2R-/- mice did not present a UPS impairment in astrocytes or a social interaction deficit as severe as that observed in LPS-treated UbGFP mice. In vivo administration of selective P2Y2R agonist diuridine tetraphosphate reversed the UPS impairment completely in astrocytes and partially in microglial cells, promoting increased expression of the proteasomal β5 subunit by a mechanism dependent on the Src/PI3K/ERK pathway. Altogether, our results suggest that LPS induces unbalanced proteostasis in astrocytes by blocking P2Y2R. Finally, our findings point to the design of selective P2Y2R agonist drugs as a new therapeutic approach to treat the neuroinflammatory status.-De Diego García, L., Sebastián-Serrano, Á., Hernández, I.

https://openalex.org/W2792166435,"Background The SMART trial is a UK-based, multicentre RCT comparing prophylactic radiotherapy and symptom-based (deferred) radiotherapy in 203 patients with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma who had undergone large bore pleural interventions. Using costs and quality of life data collected alongside the clinical trial, we will estimate the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic radiotherapy compared to deferred radiotherapy over a 1-year period. Methods Healthcare utilization and costs were captured during the trial. Utility weights produced by the EQ-5D questionnaire were used to determine quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated over the one-year trial period. Results Costs were similar in the immediate and deferred radiotherapy groups: £5480.40 (SD = £7040; n = 102) and £5461.40 (SD = £7770; n = 101) respectively. There was also no difference in QALY: 0.498 (95% CI: [0.45, 0.547]) in the prophylactic radiotherapy group versus 0.525 (95% CI: [0.471, 0.580]) in the deferred group. At a willingness to pay threshold of £30,000/QALY there was only a 24% chance that prophylactic radiotherapy was cost-effective compared to deferred radiotherapy. Conclusions There was no significant effect of prophylactic radiotherapy on quality of life in the intervention group, nor was there any discernable decrease in healthcare costs. There is little evidence to suggest that prophylactic radiotherapy is a cost-effective intervention in this population. Trial registration ISRCTN72767336 with ISRCTN"
https://openalex.org/W2787699080,"The ability of subjects to identify and reproduce brief temporal intervals is influenced by many factors whether they be stimulus-based, task-based or subject-based. The current study examines the role individual differences play in subsecond and suprasecond timing judgments, using the schizoptypy personality scale as a test-case approach for quantifying a broad range of individual differences. In two experiments, 129 (Experiment 1) and 141 (Experiment 2) subjects completed the O-LIFE personality questionnaire prior to performing a modified temporal-bisection task. In the bisection task, subjects responded to two identical instantiations of a luminance grating presented in a 4deg window, 4deg above fixation for 1.5 s (Experiment 1) or 3 s (Experiment 2). Subjects initiated presentation with a button-press, and released the button when they considered the stimulus to be half-way through (750/1500 ms). Subjects were then asked to indicate their ‘most accurate estimate’ of the two intervals. In this way we measure both performance on the task (a first-order measure) and the subjects’ knowledge of their performance (a second-order measure). In Experiment 1 the effect of grating-drift and feedback on performance was also examined. Experiment 2 focused on the static/no-feedback condition. For the group data, Experiment 1 showed a significant effect of presentation order in the baseline condition (no feedback), which disappeared when feedback was provided. Moving the stimulus had no effect on perceived duration. Experiment 2 showed no effect of stimulus presentation order. This elimination of the subsecond order-effect was at the expense of accuracy, as the mid-point of the suprasecond interval was generally underestimated. Response precision increased as a proportion of total duration, reducing the variance below that predicted by Weber’s law. This result is consistent with a breakdown of the scalar properties of time perception in the early suprasecond range. All subjects showed good insight into their own performance, though that insight did not necessarily correlate with the veridical bisection point. In terms of personality, we found evidence of significant differences in performance along the Unusual Experiences subscale, of most theoretical interest here, in the subsecond condition only. There was also significant correlation with Impulsive Nonconformity and Cognitive Disorganisation in the sub- and suprasecond conditions, respectively. Overall, these data support a partial dissociation of timing mechanisms at very short and slightly longer intervals. Further, these results suggest that perception is not the only critical mitigator of confidence in temporal experience, since individuals can effectively compensate for differences in perception at the level of metacognition in early suprasecond time. Though there are individual differences in performance, these are perhaps less than expected from previous reports and indicate an effective timing mechanism dealing with brief durations independent of the influence of significant personality trait differences."
https://openalex.org/W2790367063,"Background The aim of our study was to determine the relation of alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking on continuous-measured hepatic fat fraction (HFF) in a population free of cardiovascular disease. We suggested a direct correlation of alcohol consumption with HFF and increased HFF in former smokers compared to current smokers. Methods Data from 384 subjects (mean age: 56 years, 58% men) of a population-based cohort study (KORA) were included in a cross-sectional design. Liver fat was assessed by 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a multi-echo Dixon sequence and T2-corrected single voxel multi-echo spectroscopy (1H-MRS). Smoking status was classified as never, former or current smoker and alcohol consumption as non-, moderate (0.1–39.9 g/day for men and 0.1–19.9 g/day for women), or heavy drinker (≥ 40 g/day for men and ≥ 20 g/day for women). Fatty liver disease was defined as HFF≥5.56%. Results Average HFF was 8.8% by 1H-MRS and 8.5% by MRI. Former smokers showed a higher HFF (MRI: β = 2.64; p = 0.006) and a higher FLD prevalence (MRI: OR = 1.91; p = 0.006) compared to never smokers. Current smokers showed decreased odds for FLD measured by 1H-MRS after multivariable adjustment (OR = 0.37; p = 0.007) with never smoker as reference. Heavy drinking was positively associated with HFF (1H-MRS: β = 2.99; p = 0.003) and showed highest odds for FLD (1H-MRS: OR = 3.05; p = 0.008) with non-drinker as reference. Moderate drinking showed a positive association with HFF (1H-MRS: β = 1.54; p = 0.061 and MRI: β = 1.75; p = 0.050). Conclusions Our data revealed lowest odds for FLD in current smokers, moderate drinkers showing higher HFF than non-drinkers and heavy drinkers showing highest HFF and odds for FLD. These findings partly conflict with former literature and underline the importance of further studies to investigate the complex effects on liver metabolism."
