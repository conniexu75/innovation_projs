Like the olefins of carbon chemistry, tetramesityldisilene undergoes addition reactions across the silicon-silicon double bond."
https://openalex.org/W2005430597,Peroxidase has been thought to be the only enzyme that oxidizes monolignol precursors to initiate lignin formation in plants. A laccase was purified from cell walls of differentiating xylem of loblolly pine and shown to coincide in time and place with lignin formation and to oxidize monolignols to dehydrogenation products in vitro. These results suggest that laccase participates in lignin biosynthesis and therefore could be an important target for genetic engineering to modify wood properties or to improve the digestibility of forage crops.
https://openalex.org/W2091719554,"Chemical, paleontological, and mineralogical analyses of a 7.5-meter core from the middle of Lake Valencia, Venezuela, have provided information on the paleoclimatic history of this low-elevation, low-latitude site for the last 13,000 years. The data show that dry climates existed in this region from 13,000 years before present (B.P.) until about 10,000 years B.P. The Lake Valencia Basin was occupied by intermittent saline marshes at that time. About 10,000 years B.P., a permanent lake of fluctuating salinity formed and arboreal plant communities replaced the earlier dominant xeric herbaceous vegetation and marsh plants. By 8500 years B.P., Lake Valencia reached moderate to low salinities and discharged water; the modern vegetation became established at that time. After 8500 years B.P., the lake twice ceased discharging as a result of reduced watershed moisture. The second of these drying episodes is still in progress and has been aggravated by human activities in the watershed."

The amorphous product is converted to a turbostratic form upon heating to 1100 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy reveals a previously unreported morphology composed of hollow tubular structures. The largest of these appear to be approximately 3 micrometers in external diameter and 50 to 100 micrometers in length. Transmission electron microscopy and selected-area electron diffraction also indicate the tube walls to be turbostratic in nature. The mechanism by which the tubes form is not known, although apparent sites of incipient tube growth have been observed."
https://openalex.org/W2086376586,"Despite its acknowledged importance, the role of water in the genesis of subduction zone volcanism is poorly understood. Amphibole dehydration in subducting oceanic crust at a single pressure is assumed to generate the water required for melting, but experimental constraints on the reaction are limited, and little attention has been paid to reactions involving other hydrous minerals. Experiments on an oceanic basalt at pressure-temperature conditions relevant to subducting slabs demonstrate that amphibole dehydration is spread over a depth interval of at least 20 kilometers. Reactions involving other hydrous minerals, including mica, epidote, chloritoid, and lawsonite, also release water over a wide depth interval, and in some subduction zones these phases may transport water to deep levels in the mantle."

The anomaly occurs at the base of a coal bed, at the same stratigraphic position at which several well-known species of Cretaceous-age pollen became extinct."
https://openalex.org/W2075225814,"A blend of ethyl trans-cinnamate, methyl 2-epijasmonate, methyl jasmonate, and (R)-(-)-mellein, identified from the hairpencils of male Oriental fruit moths, attracts sex pheromone-releasing females several centimeters away. The chemicals thereby duplicate the behavioral effect elicited by hairpencil-displaying males during courtship; the chemicals also produce the herbal scent emanating from the hairpencils."
https://openalex.org/W1997821159,"The preservation, age, and stratigraphic relation of an in situ ashfall layer with an underlying desert pavement in Arena Valley, southern Victoria Land, indicate that a cold-desert climate has persisted in Arena Valley during the past 4.3 million years. These data indicate that the present East Antarctic Ice Sheet has endured for this time and that average temperatures during the Pliocene in Arena Valley were no greater than 3 degrees C above present values. One implication is that the collapse of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet due to greenhouse warming is unlikely, even if global atmospheric temperatures rise to levels last experienced during mid-Pliocene times."
https://openalex.org/W2054908288,"In three-dimensional numerical simulations of a rapidly rotating Boussinesq fluid shell, thermally driven convection in the form of columns parallel to the rotation axis generates an alternately directed mean zonal flow with a cylindrical structure. The mean structure at the outer spherical surface consists of a broad eastward flow at the equator and alternating bands of westward and eastward flows at higher latitudes in both hemispheres. The banded structure persists even though the underlying convective motions are time-dependent. These results, although still far from the actual motions seen on Jupiter and Saturn, provide support for theoretical suggestions that thermal convection can account for the remarkable banded flow structures on these planets."
https://openalex.org/W2035802422,"Soldiers of the lower termites Prorhinotermes simplex and Schedorhinotermes lamanianus (Isoptera, Rhinotermitidae) have electrophilic contact poisons used in colony defense. Workers of these termites die when exposed to the defense secretion of the other species, but survive when exposed to chemicals from conspecific soldiers. Detoxication occurs by an initial substrate-specific reduction of the electron-deficient double bond of the nitroalkene (Prorhinotermes simplex) or vinyl ketone (Schedorhinotermes lamanianus) followed by complete catabolism to acetate."
https://openalex.org/W1980618234,"The combustion of wood and yak dung for heating and cooking in a populated Nepal Himalayan valley contributes significantly to the ambient airborne concentrations of lead, copper, aluminum, magnesium, and elemental and organic carbon. A comparison of the concentrations of these elements in fresh snow with corresponding values in air suggests that the pollution aerosol is confined to the valley, with pristine air aloft."

https://openalex.org/W2081064110,"Zooplankton grazers consume appreciable amounts of algae that are not digested. Indigestibility has been considered of adaptive value to the algae and an unqualified disadvantage to the grazer. In Cartesian diver experiments, freshly killed copepods (Acanthocyclops vernalis) produced significant amounts of oxygen when exposed to the light, even after 24 hours of starvation. Also, significant amounts of oxygen were consumed by dead copepods in the dark. These observations suggest that the copepod gut is well suited for photosynthesis by ingested algae."
