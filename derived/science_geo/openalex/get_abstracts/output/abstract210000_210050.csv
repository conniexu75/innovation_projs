https://openalex.org/W2083193178,Deoxyribonucleic acid in the host cell does not contain a sequence complementary to the nucleic acid of an RNA virus. Specific formation of hybridbetween deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid was used as a detecting device. The test was internally controlled and sensitive enough to reveal complementary stretches in the DNA corresponding to 10 percent of the viral ribonucleic acid. The implications of the results for replication and transcription of RNA are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2049168538,"A basic protein with a molecular weight near 17,000, related serologically to the normal serum γ2-globulins, has been isolated in crystalline form from the urine of a patient with multiple myeloma. Proteins of this size along with the Bence-Jones molecules whose inolecular weight is about 35,000 can provide subunits for studies of the structure of the serum γ-globulins."

Acetylcholine and cholinacetylase were found concentrated in the subfraction that contained mainly synaptic vesicles and some membranes, whereas the larger proportion of the acetylcholinesterase was observed in the subfraction that contained torn nerve endings. These results support the idea that synaptic vesicles are the morphological units of acetylcholine within the synapse."

Only the aortas receive blood subjected to considerable mixing."

Living cells with the sex chromosome karyotypes XX and XXY (but not XO or XY) manifested, in late interphase, an object that corresponded in number, location, and shape to the sex chromatin mass found in the same cells after staining."

https://openalex.org/W1987110796,"IT has been shown that the antigenic structure of tumours and of the corresponding normal tissues is different1. Specific antigens were demonstrated in spontaneous, induced and transplanted tumours of mice, rat, rabbits and chickens, as well as in various human tumours by the method of anaphylactic reaction following desensitization. By means of the gel diffusion of Ouchterlony, Zilber et al.2 were able to show an antigen in extracts from a mice hepatoma lacking in normal liver. We were able to confirm this work in a tumour of the rat; we obtained a specific antigen present in the granular fraction of a transplantable hepatoma."

https://openalex.org/W2010220193,Rabbits pretreated with aldosterone exhibited lessened response to the pressor agent angiotensin. This observation may help to explain the absence of hypertension in certain instances in which both the formation of angiotensin and the secretion of aldosterone are above normal.

A repressive effect in two constitutive strains was noted. An increase in the level of penicillinase produced by the constitutive strains was noted for some of the penicillins."

In India, the chewing of dried and earth-cured tobacco along with betel nuts and slaked lime has been linked with oral cancer3,4. Differences in incidence of cancer for various communities occurs according to the site at which tobacco mass is kept in the mouth. The investigations on mice and rats recorded here show the effects of direct contact of tobacco with the buccal mucosa and effects on those organs responsible for its degradation."
