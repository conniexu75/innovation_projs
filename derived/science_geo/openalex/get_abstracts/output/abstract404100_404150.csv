https://openalex.org/W2162452562,"The last decade saw the advent of increasingly realistic epidemic models that leverage on the availability of highly detailed census and human mobility data. Data-driven models aim at a granularity down to the level of households or single individuals. However, relatively little systematic work has been done to provide coupled behavior-disease models able to close the feedback loop between behavioral changes triggered in the population by an individual's perception of the disease spread and the actual disease spread itself. While models lacking this coupling can be extremely successful in mild epidemics, they obviously will be of limited use in situations where social disruption or behavioral alterations are induced in the population by knowledge of the disease. Here we propose a characterization of a set of prototypical mechanisms for self-initiated social distancing induced by local and non-local prevalence-based information available to individuals in the population. We characterize the effects of these mechanisms in the framework of a compartmental scheme that enlarges the basic SIR model by considering separate behavioral classes within the population. The transition of individuals in/out of behavioral classes is coupled with the spreading of the disease and provides a rich phase space with multiple epidemic peaks and tipping points. The class of models presented here can be used in the case of data-driven computational approaches to analyze scenarios of social adaptation and behavioral change."

We hypothesized that reducing or eliminating the expression of the most prominently expressed glucose transporter(s) would decrease the amount of glucose available to breast cancer cells thereby decreasing their metabolic capacity and proliferative potential. Of the 12 GLUT family glucose transporters expressed in mice, GLUT1 was the most abundantly expressed at the RNA level in the mouse mammary tumors from MMTV-c-ErbB2 mice and cell lines examined. Reducing GLUT1 expression in mouse mammary tumor cell lines using shRNA or Cre/Lox technology reduced glucose transport, glucose consumption, lactate secretion and lipid synthesis in vitro without altering the concentration of ATP, as well as reduced growth on plastic and in soft agar. The growth of tumor cells with reduced GLUT1 expression was impaired when transplanted into the mammary fat pad of athymic nude mice in vivo. Overexpression of GLUT1 in a cell line with low levels of endogenous GLUT1 increased glucose transport in vitro and enhanced growth in nude mice in vivo as compared to the control cells with very low levels of GLUT1. These studies demonstrate that GLUT1 is the major glucose transporter in mouse mammary carcinoma models overexpressing ErbB2 or PyVMT and that modulation of the level of GLUT1 has an effect upon the growth of mouse mammary tumor cell lines in vivo."

Exosomes are small secreted vesicles that play an important role in this process of specific elimination. To understand the mechanisms of proteolipidic sorting leading to their biogenesis, we have explored changes in the composition of exosomes released by reticulocytes during their differentiation, in parallel to their physical properties. By combining proteomic and lipidomic approaches, we found dramatic alterations in the composition of the exosomes retrieved over the course of a 7-day in vitro differentiation protocol. Our data support a previously proposed model, whereby in reticulocytes the biogenesis of exosomes involves several distinct mechanisms for the preferential recruitment of particular proteins and lipids and suggest that the respective prominence of those pathways changes over the course of the differentiation process.

The maturation of reticulocytes into erythrocytes is the final step of erythropoiesis. Following expulsion of the nucleus, this process of terminal differentiation, which takes place over the course of a few days, occurs first in the erythroblastic islands of the bone marrow and then in the blood circulation (1Chasis J.A. Mohandas N. Blood. 2008; 112: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). It corresponds to a phase of extensive cellular remodeling, which entails the following: (i) changing from large, motile, and irregularly shaped cells of disperse sizes to erythrocytes, which are small and uniformly biconcave discoid cells; (ii) discarding intracellular organelles; (iii) completing the production of hemoglobin and other erythrocyte-specific proteins; and (iv) modifying the protein and lipid composition of the plasma membrane (2Mel H.C. Prenant M. Mohandas N. Blood. 1977; 49: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gronowicz G. Swift H. Steck T.L. J. Cell Sci. 1984; 71: 177-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Koury M.J. Koury S.T. Kopsombut P. Bondurant M.C. Blood. 2005; 105: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). One of the major processes involved in the elimination of the cellular components is the release of small proteolipidic vesicles, called exosomes, into the extracellular medium after fusion of the multivesicular bodies issued from endosomal compartments with the plasma membrane (5Harding C. Heuser J. Stahl P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 6Blanc L. Vidal M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2010; 17: 177-183PubMed Google Scholar, 7Vidal M. Transfus. Clin. Biol. 2010; 17: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Exosomes are small vesicles (50–100 nm) delineated by a proteolipidic bilayer. They were discovered in the 1980s by Johnstone and co-workers (8Pan B.T. Johnstone R.M. Cell. 1983; 33: 967-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar) during their study of the fate of the transferrin receptor (TfR), 3The abbreviations used are: TfRtransferrin receptorPOPC1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholinecholcholesterolDPPC1,2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineSMsphingomyelinPLphospholipidFCfree cholesterolCEcholesterol esterDPH1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatrieneFSCforward size scatterMVBmultivesicular body. which is eliminated during the course of the reticulocyte maturation. Since their discovery in the content of the context of reticulocyte maturation, the secretion of exosomes has been observed in various cell lines (9Théry C. Zitvogel L. Amigorena S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3754) Google Scholar), and additional roles have been uncovered, such as in the context of the immune system as intermediates of intercellular communications (10Zitvogel L. Regnault A. Lozier A. Wolfers J. Flament C. Tenza D. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Amigorena S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 11Raposo G. Nijman H.W.

Med. 1996; 183: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2461) Google Scholar) and even in the intercellular transfer of material such as mRNA (12Valadi H. Ekström K. Bossios A. Sjöstrand M. Lee J.J. Lötvall J.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (8922) Google Scholar). Moreover, the use of exosomes as biomarkers for various pathologies (13Keller S. Sanderson M.P. Stoeck A. Altevogt P. Immunol. Lett. 2006; 107: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) and as vectors for anti-tumoral vaccination (14Amigorena S. Medicina. 2000; 60: 51-54PubMed Google Scholar) has been proposed. Consequently, a sizable number of studies have sought to understand their biogenesis and functions. From analyses of the proteolipidic composition of exosomes in various cell lines, three different “routes” for the sorting of proteins and lipids into exosomes have been proposed, which would act in parallel in reticulocytes (6Blanc L. Vidal M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2010; 17: 177-183PubMed Google Scholar, 7Vidal M. Transfus. Clin. Biol. 2010; 17: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The first route relies on cytosolic machineries involving the protein Alix and either ESCRT complexes (for endosomal sorting complex required for transport) (15Raiborg C. Stenmark H. Nature. 2009; 458: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) and/or lysobisphosphatidic acid associated with a pH gradient (16Matsuo H. Chevallier J. Mayran N. Le Blanc I. Ferguson C. Fauré J. Blanc N.S. Matile S. Dubochet J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Vilbois F. Gruenberg J. Science. 2004; 303: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The second route is associated with membrane lipid microdomains enriched in ceramides (17Wubbolts R. Leckie R.S. Veenhuizen P.T. Schwarzmann G. Möbius W. Hoernschemeyer J. Slot J.W. Geuze H.J.

Brügger B. Simons M. Science. 2008; 319: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). The third route is initiated on the lumenal side of the endosomal compartment by aggregating factors such as lectins (19Barrès C. Blanc L. Bette-Bobillo P. André S. Mamoun R. Gabius H.J. Vidal M. Blood. 2010; 115: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20Géminard C. De Gassart A. Blanc L. Vidal M.

To date, however, no proteomic or lipidomic characterization of exosomes produced by reticulocytes has yet been reported. The mechanisms regulating the processes of proteolipidic sorting resulting in the secretion of exosomes in these cells that are devoid of nuclei remain unexplained. Indeed, although there is no transcription in reticulocytes, the defects in cell surface expression associated with certain erythroid diseases suggest that exosome biogenesis is subject to regulatory mechanisms (7Vidal M. Transfus. Clin. Biol. 2010; 17: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For those reasons, the complexity of the biogenesis of reticulocyte exosomes is worthy of further investigations. To this end, we have established a protocol for maintaining young reticulocytes in culture in vitro for a week, during which they mature and produce sizable quantities of exosomes. After ensuring that the materials produced indeed had all the physical characteristics of bona fide exosomes, we analyzed their proteolipidic composition over the course of the reticulocytes' maturation process. For this we used mass spectrometry for a thorough characterization of their protein content, whereas the lipid contents were determined by high performance chromatography techniques. This combinatorial approach revealed a specific and sequential sorting of both proteins and lipids in exosomes, suggesting an orchestrated coexistence of the different mechanisms described above. Our study not only contributes to the understanding of the process of exosome biogenesis but also provides hypotheses regarding the involvement of exosomes in particular erythrocytic diseases. For the production of reticulocytes, we used retired Sprague-Dawley male rats (Janvier, France), in which we induced anemia via two injections of an aqueous solution of phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (Sigma, 50 mg/ml) at the dose of 50 mg/kg on days 1 and 2. Rats were then sacrificed on day 5 by terminal exsanguination under pentobarbital anesthesia. Blood clotting was prevented by adding heparin to the syringes used for the collection. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale. Erythrocytes were obtained from the blood of treated and untreated rats. After an initial wash in 1 volume of PBS, blood cells were separated on a Percoll gradient (d: 1.100, 1.105, 1.110, and 1.123 g/ml, 5 min at 500 × g, 5 min at 1500 × g, and 45 min at 3500 × g). Young reticulocytes were collected in the 1.100 density band and washed three times with DPBS, and their purity was assessed by FACS analysis (see supplemental Fig. S1). Purified reticulocytes were placed in culture at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in 33 volumes of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 5 mm adenosine, 10 mm inosine (Sigma), and 4.5% exosome-free fetal calf serum, obtained by overnight ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Exosomes were isolated after 36, 84, and 156 h of culture (called D2, D4, and D7, respectively) by differential centrifugation; cells were first separated by gentle centrifugation (1500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), before placing them back in culture in fresh medium. For flow cytometry reagents, monoclonal hybridoma supernatants from F16.4.4 and MRC-OX18 (anti-rat MHCI) and MRC-OX26 (anti-rat CD71) were home-produced; goat anti-mouse Alexa488, Alexa647-conjugated human transferrin, and Syto12 nucleic acid stain were purchased from Invitrogen. 1,6-Diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene OR). The following chemicals were used: cholesterol, 1,2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), brain sphingomyelin, and EDTA were purchased from Sigma; MOPS, sodium azide (NaN3), and all other chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). The purity of phospholipids and sterols was tested by thin layer chromatography with chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v) as migration solvent. Their detection was performed with Dittmer's reagent. Stock solutions of lipids were prepared in chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v) and stored at 4 °C. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by a standard phosphate assay according to Zak et al. (59Zak B. Dickenman R.C. White E.G. Burnett H. Cherney P.J. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1954; 24: 1307-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). All water used was purified through a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For staining with antibodies (OX26, OX18, and F16.4.4), pellets of 7·106 cells were resuspended in 50 μl of tissue culture supernatant or in FACS buffer (DPBS, 2% fetal bovine serum) for the negative controls and incubated at 4 °C for 45 min. Samples were then washed three times in FACS buffer, before incubation with Alexa488 anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200, Invitrogen) for 45 min at 4 °C, and three final washes before analysis. Staining with transferrin-Alexa647 (Invitrogen) was carried out with 5 μl of 5 mg/ml stock solution in a final volume of 50 μl, for 90 min at 4 °C, followed by three washes in FACS buffer. Staining with Syto12 was carried out with a final concentration of 5 μm applied 10 min before FACS analysis without rinsing. All FACS acquisitions were carried out on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and raw data were subsequently analyzed with FlowJo software (Version 7.6; TreeStar Inc.). All analyses were gated on live cells as determined by forward and side scatter. Analyses carried out on separate days were performed using the same staining solutions, the same machine, and exactly the same settings, ensuring each time that identical intensities were obtained for the negative and positive controls (nucleated cells). Supernatants from the maturing reticulocytes, containing exosomes, were first centrifuged (20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) to remove cellular debris. Exosomes were then recovered from that supernatant by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 120 min at 4 °C). The pellet (exosome fraction) was washed twice by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C) in Hepes 20 mm, NaCl 150 mm, pH 7.2, and the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer with complete antiprotease (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method. Phospholipid (PL) concentrations were measured with an optimized Rouser procedure (21Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). Exosomes were layered on top of a 10-ml discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.5–2.5 m sucrose) and spun in a swinging ultracentrifuge rotor (Beckman SW41). Gradients were centrifuged at equilibrium for 16 h at 200,000 × g after which 900-μl fractions were collected from the top of the tubes. Each volume was divided in two, and 900 μl of water was added to each. Samples were then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and each pellet was resuspended in Laemmli buffer before separation by SDS-PAGE. Gels were analyzed by silver or Coomassie Blue staining. Specimens were prepared for EM using the conventional negative staining procedure. Drops of purified exosomes (5–10 μl corresponding to 1–5 μg of protein) were absorbed on Formvar carbon-coated grids for 20 min. The drops were then blotted, and the grids were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, washed with water, and negatively stained with uranyl acetate (1%) for 10 min. Grids were examined with a transmission electron microscope (Jeol 1200 EX) at 80 kV. Images were acquired using a digital camera (AMT-USA) at a ×40–300,000 magnification. The diameter of exosomes was evaluated using the software AMT Advantage HR camera system. Measurements were performed on 40 pictures taken on two separate preparations of D2, D4, and D7 exosomes. In total, around 150 vesicles were measured for each condition. After reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues, each sample, corresponding to 20 μg of proteins, was separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and each lane was cut into 10 slices and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. For the initial preliminary analysis, the tryptic digests were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS using a Qq-Tof mass spectrometer (QSTAR Pulsar XL, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and the two subsequent analyses were run on an UltiMate 3000 system (Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) as described previously (22Mouton-Barbosa E. Roux-Dalvai F. Bouyssié D. Berger F. Schmidt E. Righetti P.G. Guerrier L. Boschetti E. Burlet-Schiltz O. Monsarrat B. de Peredo A.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2010; 9: 1006-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), except that peptides were eluted using a 0–50% gradient of solvent B during 55 min at a 300 nl/min flow rate. Mascot (2.3.01) was used to automatically extract peak lists from .raw files. MS/MS data were searched against Rattus sequences in the public data base UniProt Knowledgebase release 2010_09, which consists of Swiss-Prot release 2010_09 and TrEMBL release 2010_09. Protein hits were automatically validated using in-house software MFPaQ version 4.0. Mascot results were parsed with the in-house developed software Mascot File Parsing and Quantification (MFPaQ) version 4.0 (23Bouyssié D. Gonzalez de Peredo A. Mouton E. Albigot R. Roussel L. Ortega N. Cayrol C. Burlet-Schiltz O. Girard J.P. Monsarrat B. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1621-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and protein hits were automatically validated if they satisfied one of the following criteria: identification with at least one top ranking peptide with a score greater than the significance threshold score for p < 0.001 or at least two top ranking peptides with a score greater than the significance threshold score for p < 0.05. Validated proteins were submitted to a relative quantification using MS/MS spectral counting, which has been adapted from the method described by Liu et al. (24Liu H. Sadygov R.G. Yates 3rd, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 4193-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). This strategy does not require any labeling of proteins but is based on the counting of the total number of MS/MS spectra identified for a protein. For neutral lipid molecular species analysis, lipids, corresponding to 20 nmol of phospholipids, were extracted from D2, D4, and D7 exosomes according to Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42799) Google Scholar) in chloroform/methanol/water (2.5:2.5:2.1, v/v/v) in the presence of the following internal standards, 2 μg of stigmasterol, 2 μg of ceramide NC15 (prepared according to Vieu et al. (26Vieu C. Tercé F. Chevy F. Rolland C. Barbaras R. Chap H. Wolf C. Perret B. Collet X. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 510-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), 2 μg of cholesteryl heptadecanoate, 2 μg of glyceryl triheptadecanoate. Chloroform phases were evaporated to dryness, and dissolved in 20 μl of ethyl acetate. The lipid extract (1 μl) was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography on a FOCUS Thermo Electron system using Zebron-1 Phenomenex fused silica capillary columns (5-m × 0.32-mm inner diameter, 0.50-μm film thickness) according to Barrans et al. (27Barrans A. Collet X. Barbaras R. Jaspard B. Manent J. Vieu C. Chap H. Perret B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11572-11577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The raise of oven temperature was programmed from 200 to 350 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, and the carrier gas was hydrogen (0.5 bar). The injector and the detector were at 315 and 345 °C, respectively. The dried neutral lipid extracts were submitted to a mild alkaline treatment in methanolic NaOH, 0.6 n (1 ml), and then to sialylation in 50 μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide (1% trimethylsilyl chloride)/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) overnight at room temperature. Crude extracts (5 μl) were directly analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography according to Vieu et al. (26Vieu C. Tercé F. Chevy F. Rolland C. Barbaras R. Chap H. Wolf C. Perret B. Collet X. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 510-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on a 4890 Hewlett-Packard system using a RESTEK RTX-50 fused silica capillary column (30-m × 0.32-mm inner diameter, 0.1-μm film thickness). Oven temperature was programmed to raise from 195 to 310 °C at a rate of 3.5 °C/min, and the carrier gas was hydrogen (0.5 bar). The injector and the detector were at 310 and 340 °C respectively. The phospholipid composition of the lipid extracts of D2, D4, and D7 exosomes obtained by the Folch procedure (60Folch J. Ascoli I. Lees M. Meath J.A. LeBaron N. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 833-841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was determined by HPTLC (nano-SILGUR-20, Macherey Nagel) following Yao and Rastetter (28Yao J.K. Rastetter G.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Plates were labeled with I2 vapor for 1 h, before scanning at 300 dpi resolution. The intensities of the various spots corresponding to the different lipid species were then quantified with the ImageJ software. The ratios of the various lipids were then calculated using these values because we found that, under the conditions used, equivalent amounts of purified standards of dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, POPC, brain SM, and bovine phosphatidylserine led to very comparable intensities of I2 coloration for these four classes of PL. Samples of exosomes containing adjusted amounts of proteins were separated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE (clearPAGETM, CBS Scientific) and then transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were stained with Ponceau Red to validate that all samples contained similar amounts of protein. Primary antibodies were all used at the indicated dilution in TBS 0.1% Tween, 5% nonfat milk/rabbit anti-class I MHC polyclonal serum (1:1000), raised against a peptide corresponding to RT1.Aa cytoplasmic tail (gift from Simon Powis, University of Saint Andrews), rabbit anti-proteasome (Enzo Life Sciences, BML-PW8155, 1:1000), rabbit anti-Hsp90 (Cell Signaling Technology, C4565, 1:1000), mouse monoclonal BB70 anti-Hsc70 (Assay designs, SPA822, 1:1000), rabbit anti-Tsg101 (Abcam®, ab30871, 1:400), rabbit anti-STAM (Abcam, ab76061, 1:300), rabbit anti-Vps36 (Abcam, ab76331, 1:100), and rabbit anti-CHMP4B/CHMP4C (Abcam, ab76334, 1:300). Proteins were visualized by ECL detection system (Perbio Science) using anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP-conjugated IgG (Bio-Rad, dilution: 1:10,000). Liposomes were prepared by mixing appropriate volumes of lipid stock solutions. Solvent was evaporated under a nitrogen stream, and samples were pumped under vacuum for 2 h (1 torr). The dried lipid samples were hydrated in MOPS buffer (10 mm, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, pH 7.4) at room temperature or heated to 60 °C for DPPC preparations. Samples were vortexed for 4 min to obtain multilamellar vesicles (at final concentrations of 0.05 mm) and were then sonicated for 8 min at a temperature above the Tm using a VibraCell tip sonicator (Sonic & Materials Inc, Danby, CT) delivering 12.5 watts to obtain a mixture of unilamellar vesicles that were resized by 11 successive extrusions through a mini-extruder with a pore size of 0.05 μm (Avanti Polar Lipid, Alabaster AL). The size distribution of those small unilamellar vesicles was checked by quasi-elastic light scattering using a DynaPro device (Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) and exhibited a monomodal size distribution with a mean diameter of 57 ± 6 nm. For fluorescence measurements, amounts of exosomes corresponding to 10–20 nmol of phospholipids were resuspended in 1 ml of Hepes buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). To ensure that the anisotropy measurements would not be significantly affected, we always checked that the optical density of the mixture was less than 0.08 at 348 nm. DPH labeling was then carried out at a molecular ratio of 1 probe/360 phospholipids, by adding stock solutions of DPH dissolved in dimethylformamide (5 μl maximum). Exosome/DPH suspensions were incubated 15–30 min at room temperature under gentle agitation before the experiment. Small unilamellar vesicles used as controls were labeled using a similar protocol. The experiments were carried out with a homemade automatic system (29Leborgne N. Dupou-Cézanne L. Teulières C. Canut H. Tocanne J.F. Boudet A.M. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Labeled samples were placed in a closed housing system, thermostatically controlled by Peltier elements. The temperature increased from 18 to 50 ± 0.1 °C at a rate of 1 °C/3 min. Wavelengths of 348 nm for excitation and 426 nm for emission were used. Polarized fluorescence intensities were corrected for the relative sensitivity of the two detection systems by determining, at each measurement point, the G factor according to Lakowicz (30Lakowicz J.R. Principe of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Springer Science, Heidelberg, Germany2006: 353-369Google Scholar) and shown in Equation 1,An=(Ivv-GlVH)/(IVV+2G×IVH)(Eq. 1) where IVH corresponds to the intensity of horizontally polarized emission after vertically polarized excitation. Fluorescence anisotropy values were determined within an error of 2.5%. To produce large numbers of reticulocytes of similar maturation states, we chose to use retired male rats because of their relatively large size and to induce anemia over 2 days by injection of high doses of phenylhydrazine (31Flanagan J.P.

This treatment provokes the precipitation of hemoglobin in the circulating red blood cells and thus causes extensive hemolysis, but it is neither painful nor stressful for the rats because, contrary to exsanguinations, it requires minimal intervention. The hematopoietic system then responds via the induction of a massive production of new reticulocytes, which end up leaving the bone marrow for the bloodstream in an immature state. Three days after the end of the treatment, those reticulocytes can amount to as much as 40% of the circulating red blood cells, compared with 2 or 3% in a normal untreated animal. Less dense than mature erythrocytes, those reticulocytes can be enriched via a Percoll gradient. Under our experimental conditions, the reticulocyte purity after this enrichment was always found to exceed 90% both by flow cytometry after staining with Syto12 (supplemental Fig. S1) and by optical microscopy after methylene blue coloration (not shown). The purified reticulocytes were then placed in culture for up to 10 days, with the medium being changed on D2, D4, and D7, and exosomes were recovered from the cell culture supernatants via ultracentrifugation. When the physical state of the cells was monitored by flow cytometry using forward size scatter (FSC, size) and side size scatter (granulosity) (Fig. 1), there was no sign of significant cell death up to day 7 (Fig. 1, events with FSC <40,000). Furthermore, on day 7, the reticulocytes displayed an increase of FSC, with a sizable proportion of the cells shifting toward a peak of FSC value similar to that of mature red blood cells (Fig. 1, around 125,000). This was accompanied by a very noticeable increase of their hemoglobin content, as detected by visual inspection of the cell pellets (data not shown). Three days later, however, most of the cells showed the much reduced FSC typical of dead cells, which underlines the fact that, in our system, the reticulocytes are all rather well synchronized, but suggesting that, even if the in vitro conditions used allow for their differentiation to progress quite far, certain factors must be missing to generate fully mature long lived red blood cells. Worthy of note, very low amounts of exosomes were recovered in the D10 culture medium, supporting the notion that the materials recovered on previous days are bona fide exosomes that are actively secreted by differentiating reticulocytes and not vesicles released by dying cells. The maturation state of reticulocytes over 7 days was further monitored by flow cytometry on D0, D2, D4, and D7, using three different parameters. First, using fluorescent transferrin, we saw a decrease in the amount of TfR present at the surface of reticulocytes (Fig. 2A), which correlated with a decrease of labeling with anti-TfR antibodies (data not shown). Second, we followed the changes of the RNA content of the reticulocytes as revealed by Syto12 staining, and we found a progressive decrease, with levels of staining approaching those seen in mature red blood cells (Fig. 2B). Finally, because mature red blood cells carry minimal amounts of MHC class I molecules on their surface (albeit more in rodents than in humans), we also stained the maturing reticulocytes with antibodies directed against MHC class I molecules and recorded a similar progressive decrease (Fig. 2C). Although our protocol includes many washing steps, we were initially concerned that remaining traces of phenylhydrazine may hinder the capacity of the reticulocytes to differentiate. In light of our results, however, it seems that, under the cell culture conditions used, the reticulocytes harvested from rats having received this drastic treatment undergo a maturation process that is similar to what happens physiologically in vivo. A further argument lies with the fact that although native hemoglobin is nonfluorescent, the precipitated hemoglobin that results from the phenylhydrazine treatment becomes highly autofluorescent over a broad spectrum"
https://openalex.org/W2093278247,"Coastal landscapes are being transformed as a consequence of the increasing demand for infrastructures to sustain residential, commercial and tourist activities. Thus, intertidal and shallow marine habitats are largely being replaced by a variety of artificial substrata (e.g. breakwaters, seawalls, jetties). Understanding the ecological functioning of these artificial habitats is key to planning their design and management, in order to minimise their impacts and to improve their potential to contribute to marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Nonetheless, little effort has been made to assess the role of human disturbances in shaping the structure of assemblages on marine artificial infrastructures. We tested the hypothesis that some negative impacts associated with the expansion of opportunistic and invasive species on urban infrastructures can be related to the severe human disturbances that are typical of these environments, such as those from maintenance and renovation works.Maintenance caused a marked decrease in the cover of dominant space occupiers, such as mussels and oysters, and a significant enhancement of opportunistic and invasive forms, such as biofilm and macroalgae. These effects were particularly pronounced on sheltered substrata compared to exposed substrata. Experimental application of the disturbance in winter reduced the magnitude of the impacts compared to application in spring or summer. We use these results to identify possible management strategies to inform the improvement of the ecological value of artificial marine infrastructures.We demonstrate that some of the impacts of globally expanding marine urban infrastructures, such as those related to the spread of opportunistic, and invasive species could be mitigated through ecologically-driven planning and management of long-term maintenance of these structures. Impact mitigation is a possible outcome of policies that consider the ecological features of built infrastructures and the fundamental value of controlling biodiversity in marine urban systems."
https://openalex.org/W4234964068,"After decades of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, the development of a definitive diagnostic test for this disease has remained elusive. The discovery of blood-borne biomarkers yielding an accurate and relatively non-invasive test has been a primary goal. Using human protein microarrays to characterize the differential expression of serum autoantibodies in AD and non-demented control (NDC) groups, we identified potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD. The differential significance of each biomarker was evaluated, resulting in the selection of only 10 autoantibody biomarkers that can effectively differentiate AD sera from NDC sera with a sensitivity of 96.0% and specificity of 92.5%. AD sera were also distinguishable from sera obtained from patients with Parkinson's disease and breast cancer with accuracies of 86% and 92%, respectively. Results demonstrate that serum autoantibodies can be used effectively as highly-specific and accurate biomarkers to diagnose AD throughout the course of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2101694670,"Deficient wound healing in diabetic patients is very frequent, but the cellular and molecular causes are poorly defined. In this study, we evaluate the hypothesis that high glucose concentrations inhibit cell migration. Using CHO.K1 cells, NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, mouse embryonic fibroblasts and primary skin fibroblasts from control and diabetic rats cultured in 5 mM D-glucose (low glucose, LG), 25 mM D-glucose (high glucose, HG) or 25 mM L-glucose medium (osmotic control - OC), we analyzed the migration speed, protrusion stability, cell polarity, adhesion maturation and the activity of the small Rho GTPase Rac1. We also analyzed the effects of reactive oxygen species by incubating cells with the antioxidant N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC). We observed that HG conditions inhibited cell migration when compared to LG or OC. This inhibition resulted from impaired cell polarity, protrusion destabilization and inhibition of adhesion maturation. Conversely, Rac1 activity, which promotes protrusion and blocks adhesion maturation, was increased in HG conditions, thus providing a mechanistic basis for the HG phenotype. Most of the HG effects were partially or completely rescued by treatment with NAC. These findings demonstrate that HG impairs cell migration due to an increase in oxidative stress that causes polarity loss, deficient adhesion and protrusion. These alterations arise, in large part, from increased Rac1 activity and may contribute to the poor wound healing observed in diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W1964397583,"For sea turtles nesting on beaches surrounded by coral reefs, the most important element of hatchling recruitment is escaping predation by fish as they swim across the fringing reef, and as a consequence hatchlings that minimize their exposure to fish predation by minimizing the time spent crossing the fringing reef have a greater chance of surviving the reef crossing. One way to decrease the time required to cross the fringing reef is to maximize swimming speed. We found that both water temperature and nest temperature influence swimming performance of hatchling green turtles, but in opposite directions. Warm water increases swimming ability, with hatchling turtles swimming in warm water having a faster stroke rate, while an increase in nest temperature decreases swimming ability with hatchlings from warm nests producing less thrust per stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2050385053,"Osterix (Osx) is an osteoblast-specific transcription factor essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Osx knock-out mice lack bone completely. Satb2 is critical for osteoblast differentiation as a special AT-rich binding transcription factor. It is not known how Satb2 is transcriptionally regulated during bone formation. In this study, quantitative real-time RT-PCR results demonstrated that Satb2 was down-regulated in Osx-null calvaria. In stable C2C12 mesenchymal cells using the tetracycline (Tet)-Off system, overexpression of Osx stimulated Satb2 expression. Moreover, inhibition of Osx by siRNA led to repression of Satb2 expression in osteoblasts. These results suggest that Osx controls Satb2 expression. Transient transfection assay showed that Osx activated 1kb Satb2 promoter reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. To define the region of Satb2 promoter responsive to Osx activation, a series of deletion mutants of Satb2 constructs were made, and the minimal region was narrowed down to the proximal 130 bp of the Satb2 promoter. Further point mutation studies found that two GC-rich region mutations disrupted the Satb2 130bp promoter activation by Osx, suggesting that these GC-rich binding sites were responsible for Satb2 activation by Osx. Gel shift assay showed that Osx bound to the Satb2 promoter sequence directly. ChIP assays indicated that endogenous Osx associated with the native Satb2 promoter in osteoblasts. Importantly, Satb2 siRNA significantly inhibited Osx-induced osteoblast marker gene expressions. Taken together, our findings indicate that Osx is an upstream regulator of Satb2 during bone formation. This reveals a new additional link of the transcriptional regulation mechanism that Osx controls bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2169290064,"Background/Objectives Ambient air pollution can alter cytokine concentrations as shown in vitro and following short-term exposure to high air pollution levels in vivo. Exposure to pollution during late pregnancy has been shown to affect fetal lymphocytic immunophenotypes. However, effects of prenatal exposure to moderate levels of air pollutants on cytokine regulation in cord blood of healthy infants are unknown. Methods In a birth cohort of 265 healthy term-born neonates, we assessed maternal exposure to particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 µm or less (PM10), as well as to indoor air pollution during the last trimester, specifically the last 21, 14, 7, 3 and 1 days of pregnancy. As a proxy for traffic-related air pollution, we determined the distance of mothers' homes to major roads. We measured cytokine and chemokine levels (MCP-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1ß, TNF-α and GM-CSF) in cord blood serum using LUMINEX technology. Their association with pollution levels was assessed using regression analysis, adjusted for possible confounders. Results Mean (95%-CI) PM10 exposure for the last 7 days of pregnancy was 18.3 (10.3–38.4 µg/m3). PM10 exposure during the last 3 days of pregnancy was significantly associated with reduced IL-10 and during the last 3 months of pregnancy with increased IL-1ß levels in cord blood after adjustment for relevant confounders. Maternal smoking was associated with reduced IL-6 levels. For the other cytokines no association was found. Conclusions Our results suggest that even naturally occurring prenatal exposure to moderate amounts of indoor and outdoor air pollution may lead to changes in cord blood cytokine levels in a population based cohort."
https://openalex.org/W1987359639,"Nanoarchaeum equitans, the only cultured representative of the Nanoarchaeota, is dependent on direct physical contact with its host, the hyperthermophile Ignicoccus hospitalis. The molecular mechanisms that enable this relationship are unknown. Using whole-cell proteomics, differences in the relative abundance of >75% of predicted protein-coding genes from both Archaea were measured to identify the specific response of I. hospitalis to the presence of N. equitans on its surface. A purified N. equitans sample was also analyzed for evidence of interspecies protein transfer. The depth of cellular proteome coverage achieved here is amongst the highest reported for any organism. Based on changes in the proteome under the specific conditions of this study, I. hospitalis reacts to N. equitans by curtailing genetic information processing (replication, transcription) in lieu of intensifying its energetic, protein processing and cellular membrane functions. We found no evidence of significant Ignicoccus biosynthetic enzymes being transported to N. equitans. These results suggest that, under laboratory conditions, N. equitans diverts some of its host's metabolism and cell cycle control to compensate for its own metabolic shortcomings, thus appearing to be entirely dependent on small, transferable metabolites and energetic precursors from I. hospitalis."
https://openalex.org/W2018877307,"Big environmental disturbances have big ecological effects, yet these are not always what we might expect. Understanding the proximate effects of major disturbances, such as severe wildfires, on individuals, populations and habitats will be essential for understanding how predicted future increases in the frequency of such disturbances will affect ecosystems. However, researchers rarely have access to data from immediately before and after such events. Here we report on the effects of a severe and extensive forest wildfire on mortality, reproductive output and availability of key shelter resources for an arboreal marsupial. We also investigated the behavioural response of individuals to changed shelter resource availability in the post-fire environment.We fitted proximity-logging radiotransmitters to mountain brushtail possums (Trichosurus cunninghami) before, during and after the 2009 wildfires in Victoria, Australia. Surprisingly, we detected no mortality associated with the fire, and despite a significant post-fire decrease in the proportion of females carrying pouch young in the burnt area, there was no short-term post-fire population decline. The major consequence of this fire for mountain brushtail possums was the loss of over 80% of hollow-bearing trees. The types of trees preferred as shelter sites (highly decayed dead standing trees) were those most likely to collapse after fire. Individuals adapted to resource decline by being more flexible in resource selection after the fire, but not by increased resource sharing.Despite short-term demographic resilience and behavioural adaptation following this fire, the major loss of decayed hollow trees suggests the increased frequency of stand-replacing wildfires predicted under climate change will pose major challenges for shelter resource availability for hollow-dependent fauna. Hollow-bearing trees are typically biological legacies of previous forest generations in post-fire regrowth forests but will cease to be recruited to future regrowth forests if the interval between severe fires becomes too rapid for hollow formation."
https://openalex.org/W1992449688,"The malignancy of a tumor depends on the capability of cancer cells to metastasize. The process of metastasis involves cell invasion through connective tissue and transmigration through endothelial monolayers. The expression of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptor CD24 is increased in several tumor types and is consistently associated with increased metastasis formation in patients. Furthermore, the localization of β1-integrins in lipid rafts depends on CD24. Cell invasion is a fundamental biomechanical process and usually requires cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) mainly through β1 heterodimeric integrin receptors. Here, we studied the invasion of A125 human lung cancer cells with different CD24 expression levels in three-dimensional ECMs. We hypothesized that CD24 expression increases cancer cell invasion through increased contractile forces. To analyze this, A125 cells (CD24 negative) were stably transfected with CD24 and sorted for high and low CD24 expression. The invasiveness of the CD24high and CD24low transfectants was determined in three-dimensional ECMs. The percentage of invasive cells and their invasion depth was increased in CD24high cells compared with CD24low cells. Knockdown of CD24 and of the β1-integrin subunit in CD24high cells decreased their invasiveness, indicating that the increased invasiveness is CD24- and β1-integrin subunit-dependent. Fourier transform traction microscopy revealed that the CD24high cells generated 5-fold higher contractile forces compared with CD24low cells. To analyze whether contractile forces are essential for CD24-facilitated cell invasion, we performed invasion assays in the presence of myosin light chain kinase inhibitor ML-7 as well as Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632. Cell invasiveness was reduced after addition of ML-7 and Y27632 in CD24high cells but not in CD24neg cells. Moreover, after addition of lysophosphatidic acid or calyculin A, an increase in pre-stress in CD24neg cells was observed, which enhanced cellular invasiveness. In addition, inhibition of the Src kinase or STAT3 strongly reduced the invasiveness of CD24high cells, slightly reduced that of CD24low cells, and did not alter the invasiveness of CD24neg cells.

https://openalex.org/W2072237815,"Despite recent progress, therapy for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) is still inadequate. Dysregulated Notch signaling in CCRCC contributes to tumor growth, but the full spectrum of downstream processes regulated by Notch in this tumor form is unknown.We show that inhibition of endogenous Notch signaling modulates TGF-β dependent gene regulation in CCRCC cells. Analysis of gene expression data representing 176 CCRCCs showed that elevated TGF-β pathway activity correlated significantly with shortened disease specific survival (log-rank test, p = 0.006) and patients with metastatic disease showed a significantly elevated TGF-β signaling activity (two-sided Student's t-test, p = 0.044). Inhibition of Notch signaling led to attenuation of both basal and TGF-β1 induced TGF-β signaling in CCRCC cells, including an extensive set of genes known to be involved in migration and invasion. Functional analyses revealed that Notch inhibition decreased the migratory and invasive capacity of CCRCC cells.An extensive cross-talk between the Notch and TGF-β signaling cascades is present in CCRCC and the functional properties of these two pathways are associated with the aggressiveness of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2081961955,"The processes of memory reconsolidation and extinction have received increasing attention in recent experimental research, as their potential clinical applications begin to be uncovered. A number of studies suggest that amnestic drugs injected after reexposure to a learning context can disrupt either of the two processes, depending on the behavioral protocol employed. Hypothesizing that reconsolidation represents updating of a memory trace in the hippocampus, while extinction represents formation of a new trace, we have built a neural network model in which either simple retrieval, reconsolidation or extinction of a stored attractor can occur upon contextual reexposure, depending on the similarity between the representations of the original learning and reexposure sessions. This is achieved by assuming that independent mechanisms mediate Hebbian-like synaptic strengthening and mismatch-driven labilization of synaptic changes, with protein synthesis inhibition preferentially affecting the former. Our framework provides a unified mechanistic explanation for experimental data showing (a) the effect of reexposure duration on the occurrence of reconsolidation or extinction and (b) the requirement of memory updating during reexposure to drive reconsolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2041563956,"Global climate change appears to be one of the main threats to biodiversity in the near future and is already affecting the distribution of many species. Currently threatened species are a special concern while the extent to which they are sensitive to climate change remains uncertain. Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) is classified as endangered and a conservation focus on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Using measures of species range shift, we explored how the distribution of Przewalski's gazelle may be impacted by projected climate change based on a maximum entropy approach. We also evaluated the uncertainty in the projections of the risks arising from climate change. Modeling predicted the Przewalski's gazelle would be sensitive to future climate change. As the time horizon increased, the strength of effects from climate change increased. Even assuming unlimited dispersal capacity of gazelles, a moderate decrease to complete loss of range was projected by 2080 under different thresholds for transforming the probability prediction to presence/absence data. Current localities of gazelles will undergo a decrease in their occurrence probability. Projections of the impacts of climate change were significantly affected by thresholds and general circulation models. This study suggests climate change clearly poses a severe threat and increases the extinction risk to Przewalski's gazelle. Our findings 1) confirm that endangered endemic species is highly vulnerable to climate change and 2) highlight the fact that forecasting impacts of climate change needs an assessment of the uncertainty. It is extremely important that conservation strategies consider the predicted geographical shifts and be planned with full knowledge of the reliability of projected impacts of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2159407048,"Early telencephalic development involves transformation of neuroepithelial stem cells into radial glia, which are themselves neuronal progenitors, around the time when the tissue begins to generate postmitotic neurons. To achieve this transformation, radial precursors express a specific combination of proteins. We investigate the hypothesis that micro RNAs regulate the ability of the early telencephalic progenitors to establish radial glia. We ablate functional Dicer, which is required for the generation of mature micro RNAs, by conditionally mutating the Dicer1 gene in the early embryonic telencephalon and analyse the molecular specification of radial glia as well as their progeny, namely postmitotic neurons and basal progenitors. Conditional mutation of Dicer1 from the telencephalon at around embryonic day 8 does not prevent morphological development of radial glia, but their expression of Nestin, Sox9, and ErbB2 is abnormally low. The population of basal progenitors, which are generated by the radial glia, is disorganised and expanded in Dicer1-/- dorsal telencephalon. While the proportion of cells expressing markers of postmitotic neurons is unchanged, their laminar organisation in the telencephalic wall is disrupted suggesting a defect in radial glial guided migration. We found that the laminar disruption could not be accounted for by a reduction of the population of Cajal Retzius neurons. Together, our data suggest novel roles for micro RNAs during early development of progenitor cells in the embryonic telencephalon."

However, the role of Shiga toxins and other virulence factors in the survival of E. coli O157:H7 is poorly defined. The aim of this study was to determine if the virulence factors, stx1, stx2, stx1–2, and eae in E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 play any significant role in the growth of this pathogen in rich media and in soils. Isogenic deletion mutants that were missing one of four virulence factors, stx1, stx2, stx1–2, and eae in E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 were constructed, and their growth in rich media and survival in soils with distinct texture and chemistry were characterized. The survival data were successfully analyzed using Double Weibull model, and the modeling parameters of the mutant strains were not significantly different from those of the wild type. The calculated Td (time needed to reach the detection limit, 100 CFU/g soil) for loamy sand, sandy loam, and silty clay was 32, 80, and 110 days, respectively. It was also found that Td was positively correlated with soil structure (e.g. clay content), and soil chemistry (e.g. total nitrogen, total carbon, and water extractable organic carbon). The results of this study showed that the possession of Shiga toxins and intimin in E. coli O157:H7 might not play any important role in its survival in soils. The double deletion mutant of E. coli O157:H7 (stx1−stx2−) may be a good substitute to use for the investigation of transport, fate, and survival of E. coli O157:H7 in the environment where the use of pathogenic strains are prohibited by law since the mutants showed the same characteristics in both culture media and environmental samples."
https://openalex.org/W2092837160,"Studies in animal models have indicated that dietary isothiocyanates (ITCs) exhibit cancer preventive activities through carcinogen detoxification-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The carcinogen detoxification-independent mechanism of cancer prevention by ITCs has been attributed at least in part to their ability to induce apoptosis of transformed (initiated) cells (e.g. through suppression of IκB kinase and nuclear factor κB as well as other proposed mechanisms). In the current studies we show that ITC-induced apoptosis of oncogene-transformed cells involves thiol modification of DNA topoisomerase II (Top2) based on the following observations. 1) siRNA-mediated knockdown of Top2α in both SV40-transformed MEFs and Ras-transformed human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells resulted in reduced ITC sensitivity. 2) ITCs, like some anticancer drugs and cancer-preventive dietary components, were shown to induce reversible Top2α cleavage complexes in vitro. 3) ITC-induced Top2α cleavage complexes were abolished by co-incubation with excess glutathione. In addition, proteomic analysis revealed that several cysteine residues on human Top2α were covalently modified by benzyl-ITC, suggesting that ITC-induced Top2α cleavage complexes may involve cysteine modification. Interestingly, consistent with the thiol modification mechanism for Top2α cleavage complex induction, the thiol-reactive selenocysteine, but not the non-thiol-reactive selenomethionine, was shown to induce Top2α cleavage complexes. In the aggregate, our results suggest that thiol modification of Top2α may contribute to apoptosis induction in transformed cells by ITCs."

A single-dose of LcED III immunization in mice without extra adjuvant formulation is sufficient to elicit neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes of dengue viruses. In addition, strong memory responses were elicited in mice immunized with a single-dose of LcED III.

The task engages kinaesthetic and sensorimotor processes and is considered a standard example of motor imagery. However, in this study we find that while motor imagery holds across egocentric views of the stimuli (where the hands are likely to be one's own), it does not appear to hold across allocentric views (where the hands are likely to be another person's). First, we find that psychophysical sensitivity, d', is clearly demarcated between egocentric and allocentric views, being high for the former and low for the latter. Secondly, using mixed effects methods to analyse the chronometric data, we find high positive correlation between response times across egocentric views, suggesting a common use of motor imagery across these views. Correlations are, however, considerably lower between egocentric and allocentric views, suggesting a switch from motor imagery across these perspectives. We relate these findings to research showing that the extrastriate body area discriminates egocentric (‘self’) and allocentric (‘other’) views of the human body and of body parts, including hands."

Of these the highest values were found for benefits that are likely to improve biodiversity outcomes, carbon emission reductions and improved recreational values. Of the activities that could be undertaken to provide the services, feral animal control attracted the highest level of support followed by coastal surveillance, weed control and fire management.

https://openalex.org/W2012802922,"Background Pancreatic cancer is one of the direct causes of cancer-related death. High level of chemoresistance is one of the major obstacles of clinical treatment. In recent years, cancer stem cells have been widely identified and indicated as the origin of chemoresistance in multi-types of solid tumors. Increasing evidences suggest that cancer stem cells reside in the cells capable of forming holoclones continuously. However, in pancreatic cancer, holoclone-forming cells have not been characterized yet. Therefore, the goal of our present study was to indentify the holoclone-forming pancreatic cancer stem cells and develop an in vitro continuous colony formation system, which will greatly facilitate the study of pancreatic cancer stem cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC3 was submitted to monoclonal cultivation to generate colonies. Based on the morphologies, colonies were classified and analyzed for their capacities of secondary colony formation, long-term survival in vitro, tumor formation in vivo, and drug resistance. Flowcytometry and quantitative RT-PCR were performed to detect the expression level of cancer stem cells associated cell surface markers, regulatory genes and microRNAs in distinct types of colonies. Three types of colonies with distinct morphologies were identified and termed as holo-, mero-, and paraclones, in which only holoclones generated descendant colonies of all three types in further passages. Compared to mero- and paraclones, holoclones possessed higher capacities of long-term survival, tumor initiation, and chemoresistance. The preferential expression of cancer stem cells related marker (CXCR4), regulatory genes (BMI1, GLI1, and GLI2) and microRNAs (miR-214, miR-21, miR-221, miR-222 and miR-155) in holoclones were also highlighted. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that the pancreatic tumor-initiating cells with high level of chemoresistance were enriched in holoclones derived from BxPC3 cell line. Generation of holoclones can serve as a novel model for studying cancer stem cells, and attribute to developing new anti-cancer drugs."

In the hippocampal dentate gyrus, we found that Cav-1 knockout mice revealed remarkably higher levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the more abundant formation of newborn neurons than wild type mice. We then studied the potential mechanisms of Cav-1 in modulating VEGF signaling and neuronal differentiation in isolated cultured NPCs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic embryonic rat NPCs were exposed to 1% O₂ for 24 h and then switched to 21% O₂ for 1, 3, 7 and 14 days whereas normoxic NPCs were continuously cultured with 21% O₂. Compared with normoxic NPCs, hypoxic NPCs had down-regulated expression of Cav-1 and up-regulated VEGF expression and p44/42MAPK phosphorylation, and enhanced neuronal differentiation. We further studied the roles of Cav-1 in inhibiting neuronal differentiation by using Cav-1 scaffolding domain peptide and Cav-1-specific small interfering RNA. In both normoxic and hypoxic NPCs, Cav-1 peptide markedly down-regulated the expressions of VEGF and flk1, decreased the phosphorylations of p44/42MAPK, Akt and Stat3, and inhibited neuronal differentiation, whereas the knockdown of Cav-1 promoted the expression of VEGF, phosphorylations of p44/42MAPK, Akt and Stat3, and stimulated neuronal differentiation. Moreover, the enhanced phosphorylations of p44/42MAPK, Akt and Stat3, and neuronal differentiation were abolished by co-treatment of VEGF inhibitor V1. These results provide strong evidence to prove that Cav-1 can inhibit neuronal differentiation via down-regulations of VEGF, p44/42MAPK, Akt and Stat3 signaling pathways, and that VEGF signaling is a crucial target of Cav-1. The hypoxia-induced down-regulation of Cav-1 contributes to enhanced neuronal differentiation in NPCs."
https://openalex.org/W2000064313,"The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) are currently difficult-to-treat multiple-organ dysfunction disorders that result from the defective biogenesis of peroxisomes. Genes encoding Peroxins, which are required for peroxisome biogenesis or functions, are known causative genes of PBDs. The human peroxin genes PEX3 or PEX16 are required for peroxisomal membrane protein targeting, and their mutations cause Zellweger syndrome, a class of PBDs. Lack of understanding about the pathogenesis of Zellweger syndrome has hindered the development of effective treatments. Here, we developed potential Drosophila models for Zellweger syndrome, in which the Drosophila pex3 or pex16 gene was disrupted. As found in Zellweger syndrome patients, peroxisomes were not observed in the homozygous Drosophila pex3 mutant, which was larval lethal. However, the pex16 homozygote lacking its maternal contribution was viable and still maintained a small number of peroxisome-like granules, even though PEX16 is essential for the biosynthesis of peroxisomes in humans. These results suggest that the requirements for pex3 and pex16 in peroxisome biosynthesis in Drosophila are different, and the role of PEX16 orthologs may have diverged between mammals and Drosophila. The phenotypes of our Zellweger syndrome model flies, such as larval lethality in pex3, and reduced size, shortened longevity, locomotion defects, and abnormal lipid metabolisms in pex16, were reminiscent of symptoms of this disorder, although the Drosophila pex16 mutant does not recapitulate the infant death of Zellweger syndrome. Furthermore, pex16 mutants showed male-specific sterility that resulted from the arrest of spermatocyte maturation. pex16 expressed in somatic cyst cells but not germline cells had an essential role in the maturation of male germline cells, suggesting that peroxisome-dependent signals in somatic cyst cells could contribute to the progression of male germ-cell maturation. These potential Drosophila models for Zellweger syndrome should contribute to our understanding of its pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2009310921,"To gain insight in the molecular basis of copper homeostasis during meiosis, we have used DNA microarrays to analyze meiotic gene expression in the model yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Profiling data identified a novel meiosis-specific gene, termed mfc1+, that encodes a putative major facilitator superfamily-type transporter. Although Mfc1 does not exhibit any significant sequence homology with the copper permease Ctr4, it contains four putative copper-binding motifs that are typically found in members of the copper transporter family of copper transporters. Similarly to the ctr4+ gene, the transcription of mfc1+ was induced by low concentrations of copper. However, its temporal expression profile during meiosis was distinct to ctr4+. Whereas Ctr4 was observed at the plasma membrane shortly after induction of meiosis, Mfc1 appeared later in precursor vesicles and, subsequently, at the forespore membrane of ascospores. Using the fluorescent copper-binding tracker Coppersensor-1 (CS1), labile cellular copper was primarily detected in the forespores in an mfc1+/mfc1+ strain, whereas an mfc1Δ/mfc1Δ mutant exhibited an intracellular dispersed punctate distribution of labile copper ions. In addition, the copper amine oxidase Cao1, which localized primarily in the forespores of asci, was fully active in mfc1+/mfc1+ cells, but its activity was drastically reduced in an mfc1Δ/mfc1Δ strain. Furthermore, our data showed that meiotic cells that express the mfc1+ gene have a distinct developmental advantage over mfc1Δ/mfc1Δ mutant cells when copper is limiting. Taken together, the data reveal that Mfc1 serves to transport copper for accurate and timely meiotic differentiation under copper-limiting conditions.

Taken together, the data reveal that Mfc1 serves to transport copper for accurate and timely meiotic differentiation under copper-limiting conditions. Copper has a wealth of diverse functions in biological systems, making it essential to all aerobic organisms (1Kim B.E. Nevitt T. Thiele D.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 2Turski M.L. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 717-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Typically, copper serves as a catalytic and a structural cofactor for many enzymes that are intimately linked to cellular functions such as respiration, iron transport, and superoxide anion detoxification. However, because of its proclivity to change redox state, excess copper can react with hydrogen peroxide to produce the highly cytotoxic hydroxyl radical (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). It can also be deleterious by interfering with the biogenesis of Fe-S clusters (4Macomber L. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8344-8349Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is critical that organisms use homeostatic mechanisms to acquire and maintain sufficient concentrations of copper while preventing its accumulation to protect cells from its unwanted cytotoxic effects. Meiosis is an essential form of cell division through which sexually reproducing organisms reduce their chromosome number by half, generating haploid gametes from diploid germ cells (5Handel M.A. Schimenti J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 6Marston A.L. Amon A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Meiosis shows two major differences relative to the mitotic cell cycle. First, following premeiotic DNA replication, recombination takes place between homologous chromosomes in meiotic prophase. Second, after recombination, two consecutive nuclear divisions occur without an intervening S-phase. In the first division, homologous chromosomes are separated, and in the second division, sister chromatids are segregated. Once the two nuclear divisions have been completed, a differentiation program is induced to generate haploid cells. Of significance, errors occurring in any of these steps or homeostatic micronutrient imbalances during this process can lead to a meiotic block, timely meiotic defects, or abnormal haploid cells (7Hassold T. Hunt P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar, 8Kim A.M. Vogt S. O'Halloran T.V. Woodruff T.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although the transport of copper across membranes is crucial to provide this metal to copper-dependent proteins, copper homeostasis has been poorly studied during meiotic differentiation. We have therefore used DNA microarrays to analyze meiotic gene expression in Schizosaccharomyces pombe to investigate the molecular determinants of the copper homeostatic machinery involved in the meiotic program. The fission yeast S. pombe is one of the best understood model systems to investigate fundamental meiotic processes (9Harigaya Y. Yamamoto M. Chromosome Res. 2007; 15: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is frequently used to decipher key molecular aspects of meiotic division, from its initiation through to the generation of mature spores. S. pombe follows essentially a meiotic process similar to germ line cells in higher eukaryotes, except that a fusion of two haploid cells of opposite mating type (zygote formation by conjugation) precedes entry into meiosis. A fundamental concept in the yeast cell cycle originates during G1, at which point the diploid cell becomes committed to either the mitotic cell cycle or the meiotic program. S. pombe is a key model because growth conditions and temperature-sensitive mutants have been developed that allow the synchronization of cells for their entry into the meiotic program (10Bähler J. Schuchert P. Grimm C. Kohli J. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The three frequently analyzed types of meiosis in S. pombe are called zygotic, azygotic, and pat1-induced meiosis (11Doll E. Molnar M. Cuanoud G. Octobre G. Latypov V. Ludin K. Kohli J. Genetics. 2008; 180: 727-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In response to nitrogen source starvation, haploid cells of opposite mating type fuse, and the resulting zygote usually undergoes meiosis immediately by a process called zygotic meiosis. However, if the resulting zygote is returned to nitrogen-rich media before commitment to meiosis, it can resume vegetative growth and form colonies of diploid cells. Diploid cells will undergo azygotic meiosis in response to nitrogen starvation. Azygotic meiosis is more synchronous than zygotic meiosis but less synchronous than pat1-induced meiosis. S. pombe cells growing mitotically carry an active Pat1 kinase that inhibits the cells from entering meiosis (12Yamamoto M. Egel R. The Molecular Biology of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany2004: 297-309Crossref Google Scholar). Under conditions of nitrogen starvation, the mating type loci are activated and that enables expression of the inhibitor Mei3 of the Pat1 kinase. Cells harboring the pat1-114 mutation show temperature-sensitive growth and undergo meiosis and sporulation at the restrictive temperature (34 °C), thus bypassing the Mei3-dependent inactivation pathway of Pat1. In S. pombe, meiosis is accompanied and driven by an extensive gene expression program during which several genes are either induced or repressed (13Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Bähler J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Transcriptional profiles of the meiotic cell cycle have defined four successive waves of gene expression that coincide with major meiotic phases. These are as follows: wave 1, in response to nutrient starvation (nutrient-responsive genes); wave 2, which involves premeiotic replication and recombination (early genes); wave 3, where meiotic divisions (middle genes) occur, and wave 4, which is associated with spore formation (late genes) (13Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Bähler J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 14Mata J. Wilbrey A. Bähler J. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R217Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the case of copper transport into mitotically growing S. pombe cells, it is thought that Cu2+ is reduced to Cu+ by a putative cell surface reductase before being transported by a heteroprotein complex composed of two integral membrane proteins encoded by the ctr4+ and ctr5+ genes (15Beaudoin J. Laliberté J. Labbé S. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Ioannoni R. Beaudoin J. Mercier A. Labbé S.

A clear interdependence between Ctr4 and Ctr5 has been established because the trafficking of either protein to the cell surface requires the concomitant trafficking of the other (17Zhou H. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Beaudoin J. Thiele D.J. Labbé S. Puig S.

As is the case for most of the Ctr 4The abbreviations used are: Ctrcopper transporterCAOcopper amine oxidaseCherryred fluorescent proteinEMMEdinburgh minimal mediumFSMforespore membraneTTMammonium tetrathiomolybdateYESyeast extract plus supplementMFSmajor facilitator superfamily. transporters, Ctr4 and Ctr5 contain extracellular N-terminal methionine residues organized as MX2M and/or MXM motifs (denoted Mets motifs) that play an important role in copper transport when cells are grown under conditions of copper starvation (19Puig S. Thiele D.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 20Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Analysis of S. pombe cells expressing Ctr4 and Ctr5 N-terminal mutated regions has revealed that, although the greatest efficiency in copper transport is achieved when both N termini are present, at least one N-terminal region provided by either protein is sufficient for copper transport (15Beaudoin J. Laliberté J. Labbé S. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified a third Ctr transporter, named Ctr6, which homotrimerizes in the vacuolar membrane and serves to transport intravacuolar stores of copper (21Bellemare D.R. Shaner L. Morano K.A. Beaudoin J. Langlois R. Labbe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46676-46686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Upon uptake into cells, copper is distributed to copper-requiring enzymes through the use of copper chaperones (22O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 23Robinson N.J. Winge D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 537-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). A combination of observations in S. pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed that Atx1 delivers copper to Ccc2, a P-type ATPase on the Golgi membrane that transports copper into the secretory pathway where it can be incorporated into newly synthesized cuproproteins (24Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Using mutant strains and protein-protein interaction assays, our group has reported that the fully active copper amine oxidase Cao1 is dependent on the presence of Atx1 (25Peter C. Laliberté J. Beaudoin J. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 1781-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which copper is loaded into Cao1 via Atx1 is currently unknown. SOD1 receives copper from a direct interaction with Pccs (also named Ccs1) (26Culotta V.C. Klomp L.W. Strain J. Casareno R.L. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 27Laliberté J. Whitson L.J. Beaudoin J. Holloway S.P. Hart P.J. Labbé S. J. Biol.

In the mitochondrial intermembrane space, Cox17 has been demonstrated to target copper to cytochrome c oxidase via the Sco1 and Cox11 proteins (28Cobine P.A. Pierrel F. Winge D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, the genes encoding proteins that are members of the copper transporter family are regulated at the level of transcription (29Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15472-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). They are induced under conditions of copper starvation and repressed under copper-replete conditions. Regulation of the copper transporters is mediated by cis-acting promoter elements, termed CuSEs, found as repeats in the ctr4+, ctr5+, and ctr6+ promoters (21Bellemare D.R. Shaner L. Morano K.A. Beaudoin J. Langlois R. Labbe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46676-46686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol.

Despite the essential role of copper during meiotic differentiation (8Kim A.M. Vogt S. O'Halloran T.V. Woodruff T.K. Nat. Chem.

We have used S. pombe azygotic and pat1-driven meiotic systems, as well as DNA microarrays to investigate the mechanistic aspects of copper homeostasis during the generation of spores. Here, we report the identification of a new meiosis-specific copper transporter that we denoted as Mfc1 for “Major facilitator copper transporter 1.” Although the Mfc1 amino acid sequence displays no overall sequence homology with Ctr-like proteins, it harbors four putative Mets motifs. Similarly to many fungal ctr-like genes, the mfc1+ gene was transcriptionally induced under low copper conditions and turned off under copper-replete conditions. However, mfc1+ exhibited a distinct meiotic temporal expression profile when compared with that of ctr4+. In the presence of exogenous copper (2 μm), artificial mitotic expression of Mfc1 functionally complemented ctr4Δ ctr5Δ cells defective in copper transport. The uptake of 64Cu was consistently observed in ctr4Δ ctr5Δ cells expressing a functional mfc1+ allele. In cells undergoing synchronous meiosis, microscopic analyses revealed that a functional Mfc1-Cherry protein localizes at the forespore membrane during middle to late meiosis. Interestingly, an mfc1Δ/mfc1Δ mutant strain displayed a strong reduction of copper amine oxidase activity and an abnormal distribution of labile copper ions within the ascus. Taken together, our findings describe the discovery of a novel type of forespore membrane copper transporter that participates in the timely developmental process of meiosis under copper-limiting conditions. All S. pombe strains used in this work are listed in Table 1. General methods to handle fission yeast cells were performed as described previously (33Sabatinos S.A. Forsburg S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2010; 470: 759-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Complete medium YES (0.5% yeast extract, 2% glucose, and 225 mg/liter adenine, histidine, leucine, uracil, and lysine) and synthetic Edinburgh minimal medium (EMM) supplemented with adenine only (225 mg/liter) or 75 mg/liter adenine, histidine, leucine, uracil, and lysine were used for cultures of S. pombe strains. Haploid cells of opposite mating types were induced to conjugate on solid malt extract (ME) medium. The h+/h− diploid strains used for azygotic meiosis were isolated as follows. Haploid cells of opposite mating type were fused on ME medium, and the resulting zygotes were returned to rich media (YES) before commitment to meiosis. At this point, diploid cells can undergo azygotic meiosis following a synchronized nitrogen-starvation shock. To induce azygotic meiosis, the media used were EMM lacking nitrogen (EMM-N) supplemented with 10 mg/liter of adenine or 10 mg/liter of adenine, histidine, leucine, uracil, and lysine. Diploid strains homozygous for the mating type (h+/h+) were generated by protoplast fusion as described previously (34Matsuyama A. Yabana N. Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M.

To shift all cells as rapidly as possible, each flask was shaken and warmed to 50 °C in a water bath with swirling for 15 s before being transferred to a shaking water bath maintained at the restrictive temperature (34 °C). Meiosis progression of zygotes was monitored by adding 5 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 stain (Invitrogen) at different times following meiotic induction. Two approaches were selected to ectopically express Mfc1 in cells proliferating in mitosis. First, the constitutive mitotic cuf1+ promoter up to −2092 from the start codon of the cuf1+ gene was isolated by PCR and then inserted into the pSP1 vector (36Cottarel G. Beach D. Deuschle U. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) at the ApaI and PstI sites. The resulting plasmid was denoted pSP-2092cuf1+prom. The full-length coding region of mfc1+ was isolated by PCR, using primers that corresponded to the initiator and stop codons of the ORF SPAPB1A11.01 from S. pombe strain FY435 genomic DNA. Because the primers contained PstI and XbaI restriction sites, the purified DNA fragment was digested with these restriction enzymes and cloned into the corresponding sites of pSP-2092cuf1+prom. The resulting plasmid was named pSPcuf1prom-mfc1+. Second, using an identical approach, we substituted the ctr4+ promoter in place of the cuf1+ promoter. This new plasmid was denoted pSPctr4prom-mfc1+ and had the ctr4+ promoter driving the heterologous mitotic expression of the mfc1+ gene. The GFP coding sequence derived from pSF-GP1 (37Kim J. Hirsch J.P. Genetics. 1998; 149: 795-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was isolated by PCR, using primers designed to generate XmaI and NotI sites at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively, of the GFP gene. The resulting DNA fragment was used to clone the GFP gene into pSPcuf1prom-mfc1+ and pSPctr4prom-mfc1+ plasmids, in which XmaI and NotI restriction sites were previously engineered by PCR and placed in-frame immediately before the stop codon. The resulting pSPcuf1prom-mfc1+ and pSPctr4prom-mfc1+ plasmid derivatives were denoted pSPcuf1prom-mfc1+-GFP and pSPctr4prom-mfc1+-GFP, respectively. An ApaI-XmaI DNA fragment containing the ctr4+ promoter and the ctr4+ gene (without its stop codon) was isolated by PCR from the pSK-737ctr4+ plasmid (29Beaudoin J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15472-15480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this PCR product was inserted in-frame in front of the start codon of the Cherry-coding sequence (38Nevitt T. Thiele D.J. PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1001322Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which had previously been inserted into pBPade6+ plasmid (15Beaudoin J. Laliberté J. Labbé S. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with the use of XmaI and SstI restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid was named pBPctr4+-Cherry. To generate the pJK210ctr4+-GFP plasmid, we subcloned the ctr4+-GFP fusion allele from pBPctr4+-GFP (15Beaudoin J. Laliberté J. Labbé S. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using PstI and SpeI and then inserted it into the corresponding sites of pJK210 (39Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To express Mfc1 during meiosis, we ensured that the mfc1+, mfc1+-Cherry, and mfc1+-GFP genes were under the control of the mfc1+ promoter. To generate the pJK148mfc1+ plasmid and its derivatives, an ApaI-XmaI PCR-amplified DNA segment containing the mfc1+ locus starting at −800 from the translational start codon up to the penultimate codon or the stop codon was inserted into the ApaI and XmaI sites of pJK148 (39Keeney J.B. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 849-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To create a plasmid that has the mfc1+ gene fused in-frame with Cherry, an XmaI-SstI fragment containing the Cherry-coding sequence was isolated by PCR and inserted into the corresponding sites of pJK148mfc1+ (which has the penultimate codon), generating the pJK148mfc1+-Cherry plasmid. Using a similar strategy, we added by PCR the restriction sites XmaI and SstI at the beginning and the end of the GFP gene, and the PCR product obtained was cloned into the corresponding sites of pJK148mfc1+ (which has the penultimate codon), producing the pJK148mfc1+-GFP plasmid. Plasmid pJK210GFP-Psy1 was constructed by introducing the following DNA fragments into pJK210. The first DNA segment was an XbaI-BamHI psy1+ promoter fragment up to −505 from the start codon of the psy1+ gene. The second DNA segment was a BamHI-SalI PCR-amplified fragment containing the GFP gene without its stop codon. Finally, the third DNA sequence was a SalI-Asp718 PCR-amplified fragment containing the psy1+ locus starting at the initiator codon up to the stop codon. The resulting fluorescent protein product (GFP-Psy1) served as a forespore membrane marker. The sad1+ gene containing its promoter region up to −610 from the start codon was isolated by PCR using primers designed to generate BamHI and XmaI sites and then cloned into the corresponding restriction sites of pJK210. In the design, the stop codon of sad1+ was removed to make a fusion protein with the fluorescent coding fragment of Cherry. Subsequently, a copy of the Cherry gene was amplified by PCR using primers designed to generate XmaI and SstI sites at the upstream and downstream termini of the ORF. The PCR product obtained was then cloned in-frame with the sad1+ gene using the XmaI and SstI sites. The resulting plasmid was denoted pJK210sad1+-Cherry and the fluorescent protein product served as a spindle pole body marker. The nmt1+ promoter (3X or 41X) up to position −1178 from the start codon of the nmt1+ gene was isolated from pREP3X or pREP41X (40Forsburg S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2955-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) by PCR using primers that contained ApaI and PstI sites. Subsequently, the ApaI-PstI DNA fragment (either from pREP3X or pREP41X) was exchanged with the ApaI-PstI DNA fragment in plasmid pJK148mfc1+-Cherry to generate pJK148nmt1-mfc1+-Cherry, which expresses the Mfc1-Cherry fusion protein under the control of the nmt1+ promoter (3X or 41X). Total RNA was extracted by a hot phenol method (41Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Bähler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and quantified spectrophotometrically. In the case of RNase protection assays, 15 μg of RNA per reaction were used, as described previously (42Mercier A. Watt S. Bähler J. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To generate pSKmfc1+, a 200-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragment from the mfc1+ gene was amplified and"
https://openalex.org/W2037923342,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) of the H5N1 subtype has been reported to infect pigeons asymptomatically or induce mild symptoms. However, host immune responses of pigeons inoculated with HPAIVs have not been well documented. To assess host responses of pigeons against HPAIV infection, we compared lethality, viral distribution and mRNA expression of immune related genes of pigeons infected with two HPAIVs (A/Pigeon/Thailand/VSMU-7-NPT/2004; Pigeon04 and A/Tree sparrow/Ratchaburi/VSMU-16-RBR/2005; T.sparrow05) isolated from wild birds in Thailand. The survival experiment showed that 25% of pigeons died within 2 weeks after the inoculation of two HPAIVs or medium only, suggesting that these viruses did not cause lethal infection in pigeons. Pigeon04 replicated in the lungs more efficiently than T.sparrow05 and spread to multiple extrapulmonary organs such as the brain, spleen, liver, kidney and rectum on days 2, 5 and 9 post infection. No severe lesion was observed in the lungs infected with Pigeon04 as well as T.sparrow05 throughout the collection periods. Encephalitis was occasionally observed in Pigeon04- or T.sparrow05-infected brain, the severity, however was mostly mild. To analyze the expression of immune-related genes in the infected pigeons, we established a quantitative real-time PCR analysis for 14 genes of pigeons. On day 2 post infection, Pigeon04 induced mRNA expression of Mx1, PKR and OAS to a greater extent than T.sparrow05 in the lungs, however their expressions were not up-regulated concomitantly on day 5 post infection when the peak viral replication was observed. Expressions of TLR3, IFNα, IL6, IL8 and CCL5 in the lungs following infection with the two HPAIVs were low. In sum, Pigeon04 exhibited efficient replication in the lungs compared to T.sparrow05, but did not induce excessive host cytokine expressions. Our study has provided the first insight into host immune responses of pigeons against HPAIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2010943397,"Analysis of bone microstructure in ornithopod and theropod dinosaurs from Victoria, Australia, documents ontogenetic changes, providing insight into the dinosaurs' successful habitation of Cretaceous Antarctic environments. Woven-fibered bone tissue in the smallest specimens indicates rapid growth rates during early ontogeny. Later ontogeny is marked by parallel-fibered tissue, suggesting reduced growth rates approaching skeletal maturity. Bone microstructure similarities between the ornithopods and theropods, including the presence of LAGs in each group, suggest there is no osteohistologic evidence supporting the hypothesis that polar theropods hibernated seasonally. Results instead suggest high-latitude dinosaurs had growth trajectories similar to their lower-latitude relatives and thus, rapid early ontogenetic growth and the cyclical suspensions of growth inherent in the theropod and ornithopod lineages enabled them to successfully exploit polar regions."
https://openalex.org/W2130511131,"Social deprivation is associated with higher rates of preterm birth and subsequent infant mortality. Our objective was to identify risk factors for preterm birth in the UK's largest maternity unit, with a particular focus on social deprivation, and related factors.Retrospective cohort study of 39,873 women in Liverpool, UK, from 2002-2008. Singleton pregnancies were stratified into uncomplicated low risk pregnancies and a high risk group complicated by medical problems. Multiple logistic regression, and generalized additive models were used to explore the effect of covariates including area deprivation, smoking status, BMI, parity and ethnicity on the risk of preterm birth (34⁺⁰ weeks). In the low risk group, preterm birth rates increased with deprivation, reaching 1.6% (CI₉₅ 1.4 to 1.8) in the most deprived quintile; the unadjusted odds ratio comparing an individual in the most deprived quintile, to one in the least deprived quintile was 1.5 (CI₉₅ 1.2 to 1.9). Being underweight and smoking were both independently associated with preterm birth in the low risk group, and adjusting for these factors explained the association between deprivation and preterm birth. Preterm birth was five times more likely in the high risk group (RR 4.8 CI₉₅ 4.3 to 5.4), and there was no significant relationship with deprivation.Deprivation has significant impact on preterm birth rates in low risk women. The relationship between low socio-economic status and preterm births appears to be related to low maternal weight and smoking in more deprived groups."
https://openalex.org/W2154134157,"Background The plant cell walls play an important role in somatic embryogenesis and plant development. Pectins are major chemical components of primary cell walls while homogalacturonan (HG) is the most abundant pectin polysaccharide. Developmental regulation of HG methyl-esterification degree is important for cell adhesion, division and expansion, and in general for proper organ and plant development. Methodology/Principal Findings Developmental localization of pectic homogalacturonan (HG) epitopes and the (1→4)-β-D-galactan epitope of rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) and degree of pectin methyl-esterification (DM) were studied during somatic embryogenesis of banana (Musa spp. AAA). Histological analysis documented all major developmental stages including embryogenic cells (ECs), pre-globular, globular, pear-shaped and cotyledonary somatic embryos. Histochemical staining of extracellularly secreted pectins with ruthenium red showed the most intense staining at the surface of pre-globular, globular and pear-shaped somatic embryos. Biochemical analysis revealed developmental regulation of galacturonic acid content and DM in diverse embryogenic stages. Immunodots and immunolabeling on tissue sections revealed developmental regulation of highly methyl-esterified HG epitopes recognized by JIM7 and LM20 antibodies during somatic embryogenesis. Cell walls of pre-globular/globular and late-stage embryos contained both low methyl-esterified HG epitopes as well as partially and highly methyl-esterified ones. Extracellular matrix which covered surface of early developing embryos contained pectin epitopes recognized by 2F4, LM18, JIM5, JIM7 and LM5 antibodies. De-esterification of cell wall pectins by NaOH caused a decrease or an elimination of immunolabeling in the case of highly methyl-esterified HG epitopes. However, immunolabeling of some low methyl-esterified epitopes appeared stronger after this base treatment. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that both low- and highly-methyl-esterified HG epitopes are developmentally regulated in diverse embryogenic stages during somatic embryogenesis. This study provides new information about pectin composition, HG methyl-esterification and developmental localization of pectin epitopes during somatic embryogenesis of banana."
https://openalex.org/W2066485437,"The application of viral elements in tumor therapy is one facet of cancer research. Recombinant capsid protein VP1 (rVP1) of foot-and-mouth disease virus has previously been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines. Here, we aim to further investigate its apoptotic mechanism and possible anti-metastatic effect in murine models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common human cancers worldwide.Treatment with rVP1 inhibited cell proliferation in two murine HCC cell lines, BNL and Hepa1-6, with IC₅₀ values in the range of 0.1-0.2 µM. rVP1 also induced apoptosis in these cells, which was mediated by Akt deactivation and dissociation of Ku70-Bax, and resulted in conformational changes and mitochondrial translocation of Bax, leading to the activation of caspases-9, -3 and -7. Treatment with 0.025 µM rVP1, which did not affect the viability of normal hepatocytes, suppressed cell migration and invasion via attenuating CCL2 production. The production of CCL2 was modulated by Akt-dependent NF-κB activation that was decreased after rVP1 treatment. The in vivo antitumor effects of rVP1 were assessed in both subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models of HCC in immune-competent BALB/c mice. Intratumoral delivery of rVP1 inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth as a result of increased apoptosis. Intravenous administration of rVP1 in an orthotopic HCC model suppressed tumor growth, inhibited intra-hepatic metastasis, and prolonged survival. Furthermore, a decrease in the serum level of CCL2 was observed in rVP1-treated mice.The data presented herein suggest that, via inhibiting Akt phosphorylation, rVP1 suppresses the growth, migration, and invasion of murine HCC cells by inducing apoptosis and attenuating CCL2 production both in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant protein VP1 thus has the potential to be developed as a new therapeutic agent for HCC."
https://openalex.org/W1977111489,"We examined the effects of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) on the initiation of atherosclerosis. ATGL was recently identified as a rate-limiting triglyceride (TG) lipase. Mutations in the human ATGL gene are associated with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy, a rare genetic disease characterized by excessive accumulation of TG in multiple tissues. The cardiac phenotype, known as triglyceride deposit cardiomyovasculopathy, shows massive TG accumulation in both coronary atherosclerotic lesions and the myocardium. Recent reports show that myocardial triglyceride content is significantly higher in patients with prediabetes or diabetes and that ATGL expression is decreased in the obese insulin-resistant state. Therefore, we investigated the effect of decreased ATGL activity on the development of atherosclerosis using human aortic endothelial cells. We found that ATGL knockdown enhanced monocyte adhesion via increased expression of TNFα-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Next, we determined the pathways (MAPK, PKC, or NFκB) involved in ICAM-1 up-regulation induced by ATGL knockdown. Both phosphorylation of PKC and degradation of IκBα were increased in ATGL knockdown human aortic endothelial cells. In addition, intracellular diacylglycerol levels and free fatty acid uptake via CD36 were significantly increased in these cells. Inhibition of the PKC pathway using calphostin C and GF109203X suppressed TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression. In conclusion, we showed that ATGL knockdown increased monocyte adhesion to the endothelium through enhanced TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression via activation of NFκB and PKC. These results suggest that reduced ATGL expression may influence the atherogenic process in neutral lipid storage diseases and in the insulin-resistant state."
https://openalex.org/W1993426475,"Inappropriate food intake-related obesity and more importantly, visceral adiposity, are major risk factors for the onset of type 2 diabetes. Evidence is emerging that nutriment-induced β-cell dysfunction could be related to indirect induction of a state of low grade inflammation. Our aim was to study whether hyperphagia associated obesity could promote an inflammatory response in pancreatic islets leading to ß-cell dysfunction. In the hyperphagic obese insulin resistant male Zucker rat, we measured the level of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and estimated their production as well as the expression of their receptors in pancreatic tissue and β-cells. Our main findings concern intra-islet pro-inflammatory cytokines from fa/fa rats: IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα expressions were increased; IL-1R1 was also over-expressed with a cellular redistribution also observed for IL-6R. To get insight into the mechanisms involved in phenotypic alterations, abArrays were used to determine the expression profile of proteins implicated in different membrane receptors signaling, apoptosis and cell cycle pathways. Despite JNK overexpression, cell viability was unaffected probably because of decreases in cleaved caspase3 as well as in SMAC/DIABLO and APP, involved in the induction and amplification of apoptosis. Concerning β-cell proliferation, decreases in important cell cycle regulators (Cyclin D1, p35) and increased expression of SMAD4 probably contribute to counteract and restrain hyperplasia in fa/fa rat islets. Finally and probably as a result of IL-1β and IL-1R1 increased expressions with sub-cellular redistribution of the receptor, islets from fa/fa rats were found more sensitive to both stimulating and inhibitory concentrations of the cytokine; this confers some physiopathological relevance to a possible autocrine regulation of β-cell function by IL-1β. These results support the hypothesis that pancreatic islets from prediabetic fa/fa rats undergo an inflammatory process. That the latter could contribute to β-cell hyperactivity/proliferation and possibly lead to progressive β-cell failure in these animals, deserves further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2060129262,"The prevailing view is that signaling machineries for the neurotransmitter GABA are also expressed by cells outside the CNS. In cultured murine calvarial osteoblasts, mRNA was constitutively expressed for both subunits 1 and 2 of metabotropic GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R), along with inhibition by the GABA(B)R agonist baclofen of cAMP formation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and Ca(2+) accumulation. Moreover, baclofen significantly inhibited the transactivation of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) gene in a manner sensitive to a GABA(B)R antagonist, in addition to decreasing mRNA expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2), osteocalcin, and osterix. In osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells stably transfected with GABA(B)R1 subunit, significant reductions were seen in ALP activity and Ca(2+) accumulation, as well as mRNA expression of osteocalcin, osteopontin, and osterix. In cultured calvarial osteoblasts from GABA(B)R1-null mice exhibiting low bone mineral density in tibia and femur, by contrast, both ALP activity and Ca(2+) accumulation were significantly increased together with promoted expression of both mRNA and proteins for BMP2 and osterix. No significant change was seen in the number of multinucleated cells stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase during the culture of osteoclasts prepared from GABA(B)R1-null mice, whereas a significant increase was seen in the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells in co-culture of osteoclasts with osteoblasts isolated from GABA(B)R1-null mice. These results suggest that GABA(B)R is predominantly expressed by osteoblasts to negatively regulate osteoblastogenesis through down-regulation of BMP2 expression toward disturbance of osteoclastogenesis after down-regulation of RANKL expression in mouse bone."
https://openalex.org/W2036746366,"Thrombomodulin (TM) is an integral membrane glycoprotein, which occurs as both a chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan (PG) form (β-TM) and a non-PG form without a CS chain (α-TM) and hence is a part-time PG.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (185) Google Scholar). TM binds to thrombin with high affinity and acts as a mediator of endothelial anticoagulant defenses. Comparative studies on the anticoagulant effects of α-TM and β-TM revealed that the CS chain of β-TM plays an indispensable role in regulating the anticoagulation function (2Nawa K. Sakano K. Fujiwara H. Sato Y. Sugiyama N. Teruuchi T. Iwamoto M. Marumoto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). β-TM exhibits higher affinity for thrombin than α-TM and more effectively inhibits thrombin-mediated clotting activity. In addition, platelet factor 4, which prevents the formation of a complex between heparin and antithrombin III, leading to blood coagulation, binds to β-TM but not to α-TM (3Dudek A.Z. Pennell C.A. Decker T.D. Young T.A. Key N.S. Slungaard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31785-31792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The platelet factor 4/β-TM complex displays anticoagulant activity by inactivating the clotting factors Va and VIIIa through limited proteolysis (3Dudek A.Z. Pennell C.A. Decker T.D. Young T.A. Key N.S. Slungaard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31785-31792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the CS moiety of TM is essential for its biological functions. However, the control mechanism for the glycanation step has not been clarified.CS-PGs are ubiquitous components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix and participate in diverse biological processes such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and the development of the nervous system (4Sugahara K.

CS chains have a linear polymeric structure composed of the disaccharide units -4GlcUAβ1–3GalNAcβ1-. During the chain elongation step of CS biosynthesis, GlcUA residues are sulfated at C-2 and/or GalNAc residues are sulfated C-4 and/or C-6 in various combinations by multiple sulfotransferases, producing characteristic sulfation patterns that are critical for binding to a variety of functional proteins (6Sugahara K. Mikami T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This structural variability is the basis for the wide range of biological activities of CS chains.CS chains are synthesized on Ser residues in core proteins through the so-called carbohydrate-protein linkage region, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, where Xyl represents d-xylose. Even α-TM, a non-PG form of TM, contains this tetrasaccharide structure at least in certain circumstances (7Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the nonreducing terminal GlcUA residue in an α-TM preparation isolated from human urine was demonstrated to be 3-O-sulfated (8Wakabayashi H. Natsuka S. Mega T. Otsuki N. Isaji M. Naotsuka M. Koyama S. Kanamori T. Sakai K. Hase S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5436-5442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, 3-O-sulfation might be a key modification for the biosynthesis of part-time PGs. However, the GlcUA 3-O-sulfotransferase has not been identified although most of the sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of CS chains have been cloned (9Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).The human natural killer-1 (HNK-1) carbohydrate epitope has a sulfated trisaccharide structure, GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)β1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc (10Morita I.

Because CS-PGs are also generated in all organs, HNK-1ST may be able to transfer a sulfate group from PAPS to CS.In this study, we examined the sulfotransferase activity of HNK-1ST toward the GAG linkage region as well as various CS isoforms and demonstrated that HNK-1ST transferred a sulfate group from PAPS to the nonreducing terminal GlcUA residues in these substrates in vitro. HNK-1ST may be involved in regulating the biosynthesis of not only the HNK-1 epitope but also part-time PGs.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we found that HNK-1ST transfers a sulfate group from PAPS to the tetraosyl peptide of the GAG-core protein linkage region, presumably to the C-3 position of the nonreducing terminal GlcUA residue, because the reaction product was recognized by the HNK-1 antibody. This is the first identification of sulfotransferase activity that can catalyze 3-O-sulfation on a GlcUA residue in the GAG-core protein linkage region, the structure of which had been identified in an oligosaccharide synthesized on α-TM from human urine (8Wakabayashi H. Natsuka S. Mega T. Otsuki N. Isaji M. Naotsuka M. Koyama S. Kanamori T. Sakai K. Hase S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5436-5442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To investigate the physiological significance of the GlcUA(3-O-sulfate) structure in α-TM, the presence or absence of the structure in blood-borne α-TM was analyzed. Human TM was purified from a serum sample of a normal subject by immunoprecipitation using anti-human TM antibody and protein G-Sepharose, and the precipitate was subjected to Western blotting under reducing conditions. A band having a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa was detected by the monoclonal antibody HNK-1 (supplemental Fig. 3), suggesting that α-TM in human blood also bears a GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing oligosaccharide.The sulfotransferase activity of HNK-1ST toward the GAG-core protein linkage region was higher than that toward the glucuronylneolactotetraosylceramide (Table 1), although it should be noted that the latter is less water-soluble than the former. The biological significance of the sulfation in the linkage region is unknown. However, the sulfated GlcUA residue may play an important role in the production of part-time CS-PGs. HNK-1ST may transfer a sulfate group to the nonreducing terminal GlcUA of the linkage region tetrasaccharide of α-TM to regulate the glycanation step during the synthesis of CS chains on TM. When a sulfate group is transferred to the nonreducing terminal GlcUA of the linkage region of TM, it may become a non-PG form, α-TM. Otherwise, the polymerization of CS chains may proceed by a default mechanism to generate a PG form, β-TM. Because the linkage region tetrasaccharide is common to CS and heparan sulfate, another interesting possibility cannot be excluded: that 3-O-sulfation of the GlcUA residue in the linkage region is also involved in the generation of part-time heparan sulfate PGs (1Fransson L.Å. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (185) Google Scholar).The HNK-1 antibody was demonstrated to recognize GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing CS structures, in addition to the HNK-1 epitope oligosaccharide, GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-Gal-GlcNAc. The expression of human GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S, which transfer a GlcUA residue to the precursor structure, Galβ1-4GlcNAc, and are responsible for the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 epitope, is restricted to the brain and liver and to the adrenal glands and trachea, respectively (34Mitsumoto Y. Oka S. Sakuma H. Inazawa J. Kawasaki T. Genomics. 2000; 65: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Marcos I. Galán J.J. Borrego S. Antiñolo G. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 47: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the staining by HNK-1 antibody is observed not only in the brain but also at endocrine cells in the gut and pancreas, where neither of the GlcATs is expressed (36Shioda Y. Nagura H. Tsutsumi Y. Shimamura K. Tamaoki N. Histochem. J. 1984; 16: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Expression of HNK-1ST is ubiquitous, and CS-PGs are widely produced by animal cells. Thus, the oligosaccharides recognized by the HNK-1 antibody in the organs where GlcATs are not expressed may contain GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-bearing CS structures including non-PG forms of part-time PGs.HNK-1ST also transferred a sulfate group to the C-3 position of the nonreducing terminal GlcUA residue in Chn or Chn oligosaccharides but not in CS isoforms (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). This is the first demonstration of sulfotransferase activity catalyzing 3-O-sulfation on a GlcUA residue in Chn. However, because the affinity of HNK-1ST for the Chn oligosaccharides was relatively low (Table 2), it is not clear whether this transfer reaction to Chn and Chn oligosaccharides plays a significant role in the regulation of the elongation of growing CS chains. Although Hiraoka et al. (18Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20188-20196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) previously analyzed the HNK-1ST activity toward Chn and CS isoforms, it was not detectable presumably because of much weaker reactivity to Chn when compared with the HNK-1 precursor oligosaccharide. 3-O-Sulfated GlcUA-containing disaccharide units have been found in CS preparations from sea cucumber as well as cartilages of squid and king crab (37Seno N. Murakami K. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 103: 190-194Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 38Kinoshita A. Yamada S. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sugahara K. J. Biol.

Although CSase ABC is commonly used to depolymerize CS chains from various mammalian tissues and organs to analyze their disaccharide composition, the enzyme converts the GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing disaccharide to a GalNAc monosaccharide (21Fongmoon D.

This might explain why the GlcUA(3-O-sulfate) structure has not been reported in CS preparations from mammalian tissues. Whether mammals also synthesize GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing CS remains to be investigated.HNK-1ST transferred a sulfate group to the nonreducing terminal GlcUA in Chn but not to the internal GlcUA. Because the GalNAc transferase catalyzing CS chain elongation cannot transfer a GalNAc residue to the 3-O-sulfated GlcUA residue located at the nonreducing end of the growing CS chain (41Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Ujikawa M. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), this specific sulfation observed in this study may serve as a termination signal for the CS chain elongation and regulate the chain length of CS during its biosynthesis. Although no GlcUA(3-O-sulfate) residue has ever been found at the nonreducing terminus of CS chains, the nonreducing terminal structure of CS has not been sufficiently characterized because of only 1 mol of the nonreducing disaccharide per single CS chain. However, Plaas et al. (42Plaas A.H. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) noted that CS chains often have GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) at the nonreducing end, which may serve as a termination signal.Among the oligosaccharides used as substrates in this study, HNK-1ST transferred a sulfate group to the nonreducing terminal GlcUA residue of nonsulfated Chn oligosaccharides, but not sulfated oligosaccharides from CS. The sulfate group(s) on GalNAc residue(s) appears to have an inhibitory effect on the sulfotransferase activity. However, disaccharide structures composed of a 3-O-sulfated GlcUA and sulfated GalNAc residue, GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) and GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate), have been detected in CS preparations from squid cartilage (38Kinoshita A.

In addition, GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) has been demonstrated in CS from king crab cartilage (37Seno N. Murakami K. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 103: 190-194Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These disaccharide units may be formed by the transfer of a sulfate group from PAPS to the C-4 or C-6 position of the GalNAc residue in the GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing precursor structure, GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-GalNAc, by chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase and 6-O-sulfotransferase, respectively. Alternatively, 3-O-sulfotransferase from squid and king crab may transfer a sulfate group from PAPS to the C-3 position of the internal GlcUA residue flanked by sulfated GalNAc residues. Cloning and characterization of the HNK-1ST orthologs of squid and king crab will be of great interest to elucidate the mechanism of the biosynthesis of GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing CS chains.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (185) Google Scholar). TM binds to thrombin with high affinity and acts as a mediator of endothelial anticoagulant defenses. Comparative studies on the anticoagulant effects of α-TM and β-TM revealed that the CS chain of β-TM plays an indispensable role in regulating the anticoagulation function (2Nawa K. Sakano K. Fujiwara H. Sato Y. Sugiyama N. Teruuchi T. Iwamoto M. Marumoto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). β-TM exhibits higher affinity for thrombin than α-TM and more effectively inhibits thrombin-mediated clotting activity. In addition, platelet factor 4, which prevents the formation of a complex between heparin and antithrombin III, leading to blood coagulation, binds to β-TM but not to α-TM (3Dudek A.Z. Pennell C.A. Decker T.D. Young T.A. Key N.S. Slungaard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31785-31792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The platelet factor 4/β-TM complex displays anticoagulant activity by inactivating the clotting factors Va and VIIIa through limited proteolysis (3Dudek A.Z. Pennell C.A. Decker T.D. Young T.A. Key N.S. Slungaard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31785-31792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the CS moiety of TM is essential for its biological functions. However, the control mechanism for the glycanation step has not been clarified.CS-PGs are ubiquitous components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix and participate in diverse biological processes such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and the development of the nervous system (4Sugahara K.

CS chains have a linear polymeric structure composed of the disaccharide units -4GlcUAβ1–3GalNAcβ1-. During the chain elongation step of CS biosynthesis, GlcUA residues are sulfated at C-2 and/or GalNAc residues are sulfated C-4 and/or C-6 in various combinations by multiple sulfotransferases, producing characteristic sulfation patterns that are critical for binding to a variety of functional proteins (6Sugahara K. Mikami T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This structural variability is the basis for the wide range of biological activities of CS chains.CS chains are synthesized on Ser residues in core proteins through the so-called carbohydrate-protein linkage region, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, where Xyl represents d-xylose. Even α-TM, a non-PG form of TM, contains this tetrasaccharide structure at least in certain circumstances (7Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the nonreducing terminal GlcUA residue in an α-TM preparation isolated from human urine was demonstrated to be 3-O-sulfated (8Wakabayashi H.

Thus, 3-O-sulfation might be a key modification for the biosynthesis of part-time PGs. However, the GlcUA 3-O-sulfotransferase has not been identified although most of the sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of CS chains have been cloned (9Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).The human natural killer-1 (HNK-1) carbohydrate epitope has a sulfated trisaccharide structure, GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)β1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc (10Morita I.

Oka S. J. Biochem. 2008; 143: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HNK-1ST transfers a sulfate group from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to the C-3 position of the nonreducing terminal GlcUA residue in the HNK-1 antigen precursor trisaccharide, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAc (15Ong E.

Although the expression of GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S is restricted to HNK-1-positive cells, the expression pattern of HNK-1ST is wider than that of the HNK-1 epitope (15Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O.

Because CS-PGs are also generated in all organs, HNK-1ST may be able to transfer a sulfate group from PAPS to CS. In this study, we examined the sulfotransferase activity of HNK-1ST toward the GAG linkage region as well as various CS isoforms and demonstrated that HNK-1ST transferred a sulfate group from PAPS to the nonreducing terminal GlcUA residues in these substrates in vitro. HNK-1ST may be involved in regulating the biosynthesis of not only the HNK-1 epitope but also part-time PGs. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we found that HNK-1ST transfers a sulfate group from PAPS to the tetraosyl peptide of the GAG-core protein linkage region, presumably to the C-3 position of the nonreducing terminal GlcUA residue, because the reaction product was recognized by the HNK-1 antibody. This is the first identification of sulfotransferase activity that can catalyze 3-O-sulfation on a GlcUA residue in the GAG-core protein linkage region, the structure of which had been identified in an oligosaccharide synthesized on α-TM from human urine (8Wakabayashi H. Natsuka S. Mega T. Otsuki N. Isaji M. Naotsuka M. Koyama S. Kanamori T. Sakai K. Hase S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5436-5442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To investigate the physiological significance of the GlcUA(3-O-sulfate) structure in α-TM, the presence or absence of the structure in blood-borne α-TM was analyzed. Human TM was purified from a serum sample of a normal subject by immunoprecipitation using anti-human TM antibody and protein G-Sepharose, and the precipitate was subjected to Western blotting under reducing conditions. A band having a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa was detected by the monoclonal antibody HNK-1 (supplemental Fig. 3), suggesting that α-TM in human blood also bears a GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing oligosaccharide.The sulfotransferase activity of HNK-1ST toward the GAG-core protein linkage region was higher than that toward the glucuronylneolactotetraosylceramide (Table 1), although it should be noted that the latter is less water-soluble than the former. The biological significance of the sulfation in the linkage region is unknown. However, the sulfated GlcUA residue may play an important role in the production of part-time CS-PGs. HNK-1ST may transfer a sulfate group to the nonreducing terminal GlcUA of the linkage region tetrasaccharide of α-TM to regulate the glycanation step during the synthesis of CS chains on TM. When a sulfate group is transferred to the nonreducing terminal GlcUA of the linkage region of TM, it may become a non-PG form, α-TM. Otherwise, the polymerization of CS chains may proceed by a default mechanism to generate a PG form, β-TM. Because the linkage region tetrasaccharide is common to CS and heparan sulfate, another interesting possibility cannot be excluded: that 3-O-sulfation of the GlcUA residue in the linkage region is also involved in the generation of part-time heparan sulfate PGs (1Fransson L.Å. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 406-411Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (185) Google Scholar).The HNK-1 antibody was demonstrated to recognize GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing CS structures, in addition to the HNK-1 epitope oligosaccharide, GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-Gal-GlcNAc. The expression of human GlcAT-P and GlcAT-S, which transfer a GlcUA residue to the precursor structure, Galβ1-4GlcNAc, and are responsible for the biosynthesis of the HNK-1 epitope, is restricted to the brain and liver and to the adrenal glands and trachea, respectively (34Mitsumoto Y. Oka S. Sakuma H. Inazawa J. Kawasaki T. Genomics. 2000; 65: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Marcos I. Galán J.J. Borrego S. Antiñolo G. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 47: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the staining by HNK-1 antibody is observed not only in the brain but also at endocrine cells in the gut and pancreas, where neither of the GlcATs is expressed (36Shioda Y. Nagura H. Tsutsumi Y. Shimamura K. Tamaoki N. Histochem. J. 1984; 16: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Expression of HNK-1ST is ubiquitous, and CS-PGs are widely produced by animal cells. Thus, the oligosaccharides recognized by the HNK-1 antibody in the organs where GlcATs are not expressed may contain GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-bearing CS structures including non-PG forms of part-time PGs.HNK-1ST also transferred a sulfate group to the C-3 position of the nonreducing terminal GlcUA residue in Chn or Chn oligosaccharides but not in CS isoforms (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). This is the first demonstration of sulfotransferase activity catalyzing 3-O-sulfation on a GlcUA residue in Chn. However, because the affinity of HNK-1ST for the Chn oligosaccharides was relatively low (Table 2), it is not clear whether this transfer reaction to Chn and Chn oligosaccharides plays a significant role in the regulation of the elongation of growing CS chains. Although Hiraoka et al. (18Hiraoka N. Nakagawa H. Ong E. Akama T.O. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Although CSase ABC is commonly used to depolymerize CS chains from various mammalian tissues and organs to analyze their disaccharide composition, the enzyme converts the GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing disaccharide to a GalNAc monosaccharide (21Fongmoon D.

This might explain why the GlcUA(3-O-sulfate) structure has not been reported in CS preparations from mammalian tissues. Whether mammals also synthesize GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing CS remains to be investigated.HNK-1ST transferred a sulfate group to the nonreducing terminal GlcUA in Chn but not to the internal GlcUA. Because the GalNAc transferase catalyzing CS chain elongation cannot transfer a GalNAc residue to the 3-O-sulfated GlcUA residue located at the nonreducing end of the growing CS chain (41Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Ujikawa M. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), this specific sulfation observed in this study may serve as a termination signal for the CS chain elongation and regulate the chain length of CS during its biosynthesis. Although no GlcUA(3-O-sulfate) residue has ever been found at the nonreducing terminus of CS chains, the nonreducing terminal structure of CS has not been sufficiently characterized because of only 1 mol of the nonreducing disaccharide per single CS chain. However, Plaas et al. (42Plaas A.H. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) noted that CS chains often have GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) at the nonreducing end, which may serve as a termination signal.Among the oligosaccharides used as substrates in this study, HNK-1ST transferred a sulfate group to the nonreducing terminal GlcUA residue of nonsulfated Chn oligosaccharides, but not sulfated oligosaccharides from CS. The sulfate group(s) on GalNAc residue(s) appears to have an inhibitory effect on the sulfotransferase activity. However, disaccharide structures composed of a 3-O-sulfated GlcUA and sulfated GalNAc residue, GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-GalNAc(6-O-sulfate) and GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate), have been detected in CS preparations from squid cartilage (38Kinoshita A.

In addition, GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-GalNAc(4-O-sulfate) has been demonstrated in CS from king crab cartilage (37Seno N. Murakami K. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 103: 190-194Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These disaccharide units may be formed by the transfer of a sulfate group from PAPS to the C-4 or C-6 position of the GalNAc residue in the GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing precursor structure, GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-GalNAc, by chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase and 6-O-sulfotransferase, respectively. Alternatively, 3-O-sulfotransferase from squid and king crab may transfer a sulfate group from PAPS to the C-3 position of the internal GlcUA residue flanked by sulfated GalNAc residues. Cloning and characterization of the HNK-1ST orthologs of squid and king crab will be of great interest to elucidate the mechanism of the biosynthesis of GlcUA(3-O-sulfate)-containing CS chains.

https://openalex.org/W2079120967,"The trafficking protein particle complex 4 (TRAPPC4) is implicated in vesicle-mediated transport, but its association with disease has rarely been reported. We explored its potential interaction with ERK2, part of the ERK1/2 complex in the Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase/ Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (ERK-MAPK) pathway, by a yeast two-hybrid screen and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down. Further investigation found that when TRAPPC4 was depleted, activated ERK1/2 specifically decreased in the nucleus, which was accompanied with cell growth suppression and apoptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Overexpression of TRAPPC4 promoted cell viability and caused activated ERK1/2 to increase overall, but especially in the nucleus. TRAPPC4 was expressed more highly in the nucleus of CRC cells than in normal colonic epithelium or adenoma which corresponded with nuclear staining of pERK1/2. We demonstrate here that TRAPPC4 may regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis in CRC by interaction with ERK2 and subsequently phosphorylating ERK1/2 as well as modulating the subcellular location of pERK1/2 to activate the relevant signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2019120715,"Because hepatic cancer stem cells (HCSCs) are believed to derive from the conversion of hepatic normal stem cells (HNSCs), the identification of the differences that distinguish HCSCs from HNSCs is important.The HCC model was established in F344 rats by DEN induction. Using FACS analysis, side population cells from HCC (SP-HCCs) were isolated from the epithelial-like cells of HCC tissues, and the side population cells from normal liver (SP-NLCs) were isolated from syngeneic normal liver cells. The expression of stem cell markers was detected in both freshly isolated and amplified subpopulations. After induction with HGF, the differentiation of each subpopulation was analyzed by detection of early and late liver markers. In vivo, the biological characteristics of SP-HCCs and SP-NLCs were analyzed by repairing injured livers or forming tumors in nude mice. In addition, the expression of miRNAs was examined in both populations by miRNA array and QRT-PCR.SP-NLCs and SP-HCCs were 4.30±0.011% and 2.100±0.010% of the whole population, respectively. Both SP-NLCs and SP-HCCs displayed greater expression of stem cell markers (CD133 and EpCAM) than NSP-NLCs and NSP-HCCs, respectively (P<0.01), both after fresh isolation and amplification. Upon HGF induction, SP-NLCs generated many ALB positive cells and few CK-7 positive cells, but NSP-NLCs could generate only ALB positive cells. In contrast, SP-HCCs gave rise to only AFP positive cells. As few as 5 × 10⁵ SP-NLCs were capable of repairing liver injury, while the same number of NSP-NLCs could not repair the liver. Furthermore, only 1 × 10⁴ SP-HCCs were necessary to initiate a tumor, while NSP-HCCs could not form a tumor. Compared to SP-NLCs, 68 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated miRNAs were present in SP-HCCs (P<0.01).Based on the decisive roles of some miRNAs in the genesis of HCSCs, miRNAs may contribute to the different characteristics that distinguish SP-HCCs from SP-NLCs."

We report here that mda-9/syntenin, a positive regulator of cancer metastasis, regulates the activation of Akt (also known as protein kinase B) by facilitating ILK adaptor function during adhesion to type I collagen (COL-I) in human breast cancer cells. COL-I stimulation induced the phosphorylation and plasma membrane translocation of Akt. Inhibition of mda-9/syntenin or expression of mutant ILK (E359K) significantly blocked the translocation of both ILK and Akt to the plasma membrane. mda-9/syntenin associated with ILK, and this association was increased at the plasma membrane by COL-I stimulation. Knockdown of mda-9/syntenin impaired COL-I-induced association of ILK with Akt and plasma membrane targeting of ILK-Akt complex. These results demonstrated that mda-9/syntenin regulates the activation of Akt by controlling the plasma membrane targeting of Akt via a mechanism that facilitates the association of Akt with ILK at the plasma membrane during adhesion to COL-I.

Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 209-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). We recently showed that transient induction of mda-9/syntenin during adhesion to FN is dependent on PKCα activation and enhances the FN-induced assembly of integrin β1 signaling complexes with FAK and c-Src, activating FAK and its downstream pathways (15Hwangbo C. Kim J. Lee J.J. Lee J.H. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The role of mda-9/syntenin in regulation of signaling of extracellular matrices other than FN has not been well elucidated. mda-9/syntenin also increases the migratory and invasive potential of HEK 293T cells toward COL-I though a pathway involving phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and ERK1/2 (11Meerschaert K. Bruyneel E. De Wever O. Vanloo B. Boucherie C. Bracke M. Vandekerckhove J. Gettemans J. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 1790-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms by which mda-9/syntenin regulates activation of these kinases in response to COL-I is still unknown. Integrins are α and β heterodimeric cell-surface receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix proteins (16Watt F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3919-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to the extracellular integrin domain induces conformational changes and integrin clustering for activation of signaling cascades and recruitment of multiprotein complexes to focal adhesions (17Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Subsequently, kinase activity-lacking integrins transmit messages through a variety of intracellular protein kinases and adaptor molecules, including FAK, ILK, and paxillin (18Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 19Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin.

Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). ILK plays a central role in signaling transductions that are initiated by cell-matrix interactions and that regulate biochemical processes, such as growth, proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis (21McDonald P.C. Fielding A.B. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3121-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). ILK was initially described as an integrin β1 subunit-binding protein with involvement in kinase signaling pathways (18Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Structurally, ILK comprises an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain and a C-terminal kinase-like domain (18Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 22Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. Mol.

EMBO J. 2010; 29: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). By means of its ankyrin repeat domain, ILK binds to PINCH1 (24Chiswell B.P. Zhang R. Murphy J.W. Boggon T.J. Calderwood D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20677-20682Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase-like domain interacts directly with other components of integrin-based adhesion plaques, including paxillin and α-parvin (22Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 26Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1568-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ILK, PINCH1, and α-parvin form a ternary complex termed IPP, which localizes to focal adhesion and functions as a signaling platform for at least β1 and β3 integrin by interfacing with the actin cytoskeleton and many diverse signaling pathways (20Legate K.R. Montañez E. Kudlacek O. Fässler R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Formation of the ILK-PINCH1-α-parvin triad is a prerequisite for recruitment of ILK, PINCH1, and α-parvin to integrin adhesions (27Zhang Y. Chen K. Tu Y. Velyvis A. Yang Y. Qin J. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4777-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), implying a functional interdependency of these proteins. ILK has also been shown to act as a serine/threonine kinase and to directly activate several signaling pathways, including that of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3α/β and members of the MAPK signaling pathway (28Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 29Hannigan G. Troussard A.A. Dedhar S. Nat. Rev.

PLoS One. 2010; 5: e12356Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that ILK is a pseudokinase and that it acts as a distinct adaptor protein linking integrin and α-parvin (22Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Wickström S.A. Lange A. Montanez E. Fässler R.

Chem. 2011; 286: 21886-218895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study we provide evidence to show that mda-9/syntenin positively regulates the ILK adaptor function for the assembly of integrin β1-IPP signaling complexes, which activate integrin signaling pathways, including Akt, ERK1/2, and Rac1, during adhesion to COL-I in human breast cancer cells. Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and HEK 293T17 cell line were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640. Human melanoma line C8161 was a gift from Dr. Danny R. Welch (The University of Alabama at Birmingham) and maintained in DMEM. All media were supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT). All cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Antibodies for ILK, phospho-PKCα (Thr-638/641), phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser-9/21), phospho-mTOR (Ser-2448), phospho-p70S6K (Thr-389), phospho-4EBP (Ser-65), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), phospho-FAK (Tyr-397), FAK, and Myc were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MT). Antibodies for α-tubulin, PINCH1, and FLAG were from Sigma. Protein A/G plus agarose bead and antibodies for syntenin, integrin β1, α-parvin, β-parvin, Akt, hemagglutinin (HA), GST, ErbB2, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies for PKCα, FN, and COL-I were from BD Biosciences. Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs were from Invitrogen. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated phalloidin was from Enzo Life Sciences (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). Expression vectors for FLAG-tagged mda-9/syntenin, PKCα, the dominant negative (DN)-PKCα, and DN-Rac1 were described previously (15Hwangbo C. Kim J. Lee J.J. Lee J.H. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for the FLAG-Akt, DN-Akt, and DN-PI3K were obtained from Dr. N. Fujita (Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan). A mutant ILK (E359K) was created using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). For construction of HA-ILK, Myc-α-parvin, and FLAG-PINCH1, the open reading frames of ILK, α-parvin, and PINCH1 were amplified by PCR, digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and cloned in-frame into the polylinker of the pCMV-HA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), pCMV-Myc (Clontech), and pCMV-Tag2B (Agilent Technologies), respectively. Three kinds of syntenin mutants were generated from syntenin cDNA as a template using the following primer sets: Syn-M1 (Arg-105—Pro-271), 5′-CGCGGATCCAGAGCAGAAATTAAGCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCCTCGAGTTAAGGCATGATTGTAATAGTAAC-3′ (antisense); Syn-M2 (deletion from Arg-113—Asp-192), 5′-CGCTCTAGAAGGCCCTTTGAACGGACG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCTCTAGAACGAATCCCTTGCTTAAT-3′ (antisense); Syn-M3 (Met-1—Arg-193), 5′-CGCGGATCCTCTCTCTATCCATCTCTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCCTCGAGTTACCTGTCACGAATGGTCAT-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were ligated into pCMV-Tag2B (Agilent Technologies) with in-frame. All constructs and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pSUPER shRNA-producing plasmids (pSUPER/syntenin and pSUPER-scramble) were previously described (15Hwangbo C. Kim J. Lee J.J. Lee J.H. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). siRNAs for mda-9/syntenin, ILK and scramble control were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For construction of GST-syntenin1–298 and GST-Akt379–480, the corresponding open reading frames were amplified by PCR, digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and cloned in-frame into the polylinker of the pGEX4T-1. Each construct was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells, and ampicillin was applied to select bacteria carrying the expression constructs. Isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at 0.1 mm and purified by the affinity column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were described previously (8Koo T.H. Lee J.J. Kim E.M. Kim K.W. Kim H.D. Lee J.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4080-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15Hwangbo C. Kim J. Lee J.J. Lee J.H. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors mixture (BD Biosciences)) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, equivalent amounts of cell lysates were incubated with the appropriate antibodies and followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed, and the eluted precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and probed with the proper antibodies. The signal was detected using an ECL system (Intron, Seongnam, Korea). Kinase assays were performed as described previously with some modifications (32Tan C. Cruet-Hennequart S. Troussard A. Fazli L. Costello P. Sutton K. Wheeler J. Gleave M. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells were serum-starved for 12 h and allowed to adhere to COL-I-coated dishes (10 μg/ml) for the indicated periods of time in the absence of serum. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-ILK or anti-Akt, then the activity of ILK or Akt was measured. Briefly, immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with cell lysis buffer and wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors mixture) and subjected to kinase assay in kinase buffer (added 200 μm ATP in wash buffer); 2 μg of GST-GSK-3α/β (Cell Signaling Technology) or GST-Akt379–480 protein was added as the kinase substrate, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylation of GSK3 or AKT was measured by Western blot analysis using phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser-9/21) or phospho-AKT (Ser-473) antibody (Cell signaling). In vitro binding assays were performed as described previously (33Ling L. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23852-23860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The GST-fused syntenin or GST (2 μg each) was immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose beads (40 μl volume of 80% beads slurry) and equilibrated in the binding buffer consisting of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 10% glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The recombinant Myc-ILK (Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD) was added in the affinity beads then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed 4 times, and the bound proteins were eluted in 30 μl of the 20 mm reduced glutathione in the buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Cells were washed with PBS, incubated in hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitors mixture), and lysed by 15 strokes of a prechilled 1-ml Dounce homogenizer with a tight-fitting pestle. Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The cytoplasmic fraction was obtained by centrifuging supernatants at 21,000 × g at 4 °C for 45 min, and the pellets containing cellular membranes were washed 3 times in hypotonic lysis buffer and resuspended in lysis buffer. Cell migration and invasion assays were performed as described previously (8Koo T.H. Lee J.J. Kim E.M. Kim K.W. Kim H.D. Lee J.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4080-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34Kim K.K. Lee J.J. Yang Y. You K.H. Lee J.H. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lower surface of the filters was coated with 6.5 μg COL-I. Cells were seeded in triplicate on the upper part of each chamber. The cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filter were fixed with methanol. Then the cells were stained and counted in at least five randomly selected microscopic fields (×100) per filter. A commercially available ELISA Rac1 activation assay kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Briefly, captured Rac1 was cross-linked to the plate and detected by sequential incubations with an anti-Rac1 primary antibody and an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The relative amount of bound Rac1 was then measured by developing the plate with an HRP-detection reagent and recording the luminescence signal. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described (15Hwangbo C. Kim J. Lee J.J. Lee J.H. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with primary and appropriate secondary antibodies. F-actin was stained with FITC-conjugated phalloidin. Confocal images were acquired by using a Zeiss LSM510 META NLO inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany; Korea Basic Science Institute Chuncheon Center) equipped with an external argon, HeNe laser, and HeNe laser II. Using a C-Apochromat 63X NA1.2 water immersion objective (Zeiss), images were captured at the colony midsection. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. unless otherwise specified. Statistical significance was assessed by 2-tailed unpaired student's t test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To investigate the molecular mechanism of mda-9/syntenin for inducing cell migration and invasion, we analyzed the effect of COL-I stimulation on mda-9/syntenin expression and PKCα, Akt, and FAK activation in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1A) and C8161 cells (supplemental Fig. 1), which have high endogenous mda-9/syntenin expression levels (8Koo T.H. Lee J.J. Kim E.M. Kim K.W. Kim H.D. Lee J.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4080-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9Boukerche H. Su Z.Z. Emdad L. Baril P. Balme B. Thomas L. Randolph A. Valerie K. Sarkar D. Fisher P.B. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10901-10911Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Unlike FN stimulation (15Hwangbo C. Kim J. Lee J.J. Lee J.H. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), COL-I stimulation did not significantly increase the expression levels of mda-9/syntenin, phospho-PKCα, and phospho-FAK in either cell line. However, COL-I stimulation significantly increased the expression level of phospho-Akt within 30 min, after which this induction showed a gradual return to the basal level (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that Akt activation could be predominantly induced at an early time during adhesion to COL-I in these cancer cells. We next examined the question of whether mda-9/syntenin regulates Akt activation during adhesion to COL-I. Transfection of mda-9/syntenin siRNA into MDA-MB-231 significantly reduced the phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK-3α/β, a well known downstream target molecule of Akt that is induced by COL-I stimulation (Fig. 1B). In contrast, overexpression of mda-9/syntenin into MCF-7 cells increased COL-I-induced Akt and GSK-3α/β phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Using a DN of Akt, we sought to determine whether or not Akt affected mda-9/syntenin-induced cell migration toward COL-I. mda-9/syntenin overexpression into MCF-7 cells induced cell migration toward COL-I; however, this effect was blocked by the DN of Akt but not PKCα. Of particular interest, mutant ILK (E359K), which is known to disrupt the interaction between ILK and both α-parvin and paxillin (24Chiswell B.P. Zhang R. Murphy J.W. Boggon T.J. Calderwood D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20677-20682Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), significantly suppressed mda-9/syntenin-induced cell migration toward COL-I (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that mda-9/syntenin may be involved in regulation of COL-I-induced activation of Akt and cell migration through the mediation of ILK. Overexpression of mutant ILK (E359K) suppressed COL-I-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2A), as did transfection of mda-9/syntenin shRNA. Because ILK has been shown to directly phosphorylate Akt (28Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 29Hannigan G. Troussard A.A. Dedhar S. Nat. Rev.

PLoS One. 2010; 5: e12356Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we next determined whether or not the kinase activity of ILK is required for COL-I-induced Akt phosphorylation. We thus performed in vitro kinase assays using Akt and GSK-3α/β as ILK substrates. ILK coimmunoprecipitated from MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with COL-I showed no effect on Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2B) and GSK-3α/β phosphorylation (Fig. 2C), confirming that ILK is a pseudokinase (22Fukuda K. Gupta S. Chen K. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 819-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Wickström S.A. Lange A. Montanez E. Fässler R.

In contrast, Akt coimmunoprecipitated from MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated with COL-I significantly phosphorylated GSK-3α/β. We next determined whether ILK affected the translocation of Akt to plasma membrane. Transfection of mutant ILK (E359K) significantly impaired the plasma membrane translocation of Akt (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that ILK adaptor function could be required for Akt activation during adhesion to COL-I. We next examined whether mda-9/syntenin affects the plasma membrane translocation of Akt during adhesion to COL-I. Overexpression of mda-9/syntenin increased the plasma membrane targeting of Akt in MCF-7 cells as assessed by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3A). COL-I stimulation further increased the colocalization of Akt with mda-9/syntenin at the plasma membrane. Moreover, translocation of mda-9/syntenin to the plasma membrane was increased by COL-I stimulation. We further confirmed this result with membrane fractionation, where overexpression of mda-9/syntenin again increased the membrane targeting of Akt and COL-I stimulation further increased translocation of Akt and mda-9/syntenin to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). Moreover, transfection of mda-9/syntenin siRNA into MDA-MB-231 significantly reduced plasma membrane translocation of Akt after COL-I stimulation (see Fig. 5C). However, overexpression of mda-9/syntenin did not show any effect on ILK kinase activity during adhesion to COL-I (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results suggest that mda-9/syntenin may be involved in the activation of Akt by regulating translocation of Akt to plasma membrane during adhesion to COL-I.FIGURE 5mda-9/syntenin regulates the association between ILK and Akt at the plasma membrane in response to COL-I. A, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with HA-tagged ILK or HA-tagged ILK (E359K) vector together with the indicated amount of Myc-tagged mda-9/syntenin vector. Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Akt antibody. The immunoprecipitates (IP) and whole cell lysates (Input) were blotted with the indicated antibodies. B, MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected a control shRNA (Co) or mda-9/syntenin-targeted shRNA (Sy) were transfected with HA-tagged ILK vector or HA-tagged ILK (E359K) vector, and then the cells were adhered to COL-I-coated dishes for the indicated periods of time. Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates and whole cell lysates (Input) were blotted with the indicated antibodies. C, MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with a control siRNA (Co), mda-9/syntenin-targeted siRNA (Sy), or HA-tagged ILK (E359K) vector were plated onto COL-I-coated dishes for the indicated periods of time and then fractionated into cytosol and plasma membrane fraction. Both fractions were blotted with the indicated antibodies. ErbB2 was used as the membrane protein marker, and GAPDH was used as the cytosol protein marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"
https://openalex.org/W1981999511,"Recombination is a mechanism whereby positive sense single stranded RNA viruses exchange segments of genetic information. Recent phylogenetic analyses of naturally occurring recombinant flaviviruses have raised concerns regarding the potential for the emergence of virulent recombinants either post-vaccination or following co-infection with two distinct wild-type viruses. To characterize the conditions and sequences that favor RNA arthropod-borne virus recombination we constructed yellow fever virus (YFV) 17D recombinant crosses containing complementary deletions in the envelope protein coding sequence. These constructs were designed to strongly favor recombination, and the detection conditions were optimized to achieve high sensitivity recovery of putative recombinants. Full length recombinant YFV 17D virus was never detected under any of the experimental conditions examined, despite achieving estimated YFV replicon co-infection levels of ∼2.4 x 10⁶ in BHK-21 (vertebrate) cells and ∼1.05 x 10⁵ in C₇10 (arthropod) cells. Additionally YFV 17D superinfection resistance was observed in vertebrate and arthropod cells harboring a primary infection with wild-type YFV Asibi strain. Furthermore recombination potential was also evaluated using similarly designed chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replicons towards validation of this strategy for recombination detection. Non-homologus recombination was observed for CHIKV within the structural gene coding sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication of capsid and E3 gene. Based on these data, it is concluded that even in the unlikely event of a high level acute co-infection of two distinct YFV genomes in an arthropod or vertebrate host, the generation of viable flavivirus recombinants is extremely unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W2103595387,"The Fanconi anemia (FA) gene family is a recent addition to the complex network of proteins that respond to and repair certain types of DNA damage in the human genome. Since little is known about the regulation of this novel group of genes at the DNA level, we characterized the promoters of the eight genes (FANCA, B, C, E, F, G, L and M) that compose the FA core complex. The promoters of these genes show the characteristic attributes of housekeeping genes, such as a high GC content and CpG islands, a lack of TATA boxes and a low conservation. The promoters functioned in a monodirectional way and were, in their most active regions, comparable in strength to the SV40 promoter in our reporter plasmids. They were also marked by a distinctive transcriptional start site (TSS). In the 5' region of each promoter, we identified a region that was able to negatively regulate the promoter activity in HeLa and HEK 293 cells in isolation. The central and 3' regions of the promoter sequences harbor binding sites for several common and rare transcription factors, including STAT, SMAD, E2F, AP1 and YY1, which indicates that there may be cross-connections to several established regulatory pathways. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and siRNA experiments confirmed the shared regulatory responses between the prominent members of the TGF-β and JAK/STAT pathways and members of the FA core complex. Although the promoters are not well conserved, they share region and sequence specific regulatory motifs and transcription factor binding sites (TBFs), and we identified a bi-partite nature to these promoters. These results support a hypothesis based on the co-evolution of the FA core complex genes that was expanded to include their promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2170891738,"The dispersal ability of queens is central to understanding ant life-history evolution, and plays a fundamental role in ant population and community dynamics, the maintenance of genetic diversity, and the spread of invasive ants. In tropical ecosystems, species from over 40 genera of ants establish colonies in the stems, hollow thorns, or leaf pouches of specialized plants. However, little is known about the relative dispersal ability of queens competing for access to the same host plants.We used empirical data and inverse modeling--a technique developed by plant ecologists to model seed dispersal--to quantify and compare the dispersal kernels of queens from three Amazonian ant species that compete for access to host-plants. We found that the modal colonization distance of queens varied 8-fold, with the generalist ant species (Crematogaster laevis) having a greater modal distance than two specialists (Pheidole minutula, Azteca sp.) that use the same host-plants. However, our results also suggest that queens of Azteca sp. have maximal distances that are four-sixteen times greater than those of its competitors.We found large differences between ant species in both the modal and maximal distance ant queens disperse to find vacant seedlings used to found new colonies. These differences could result from interspecific differences in queen body size, and hence wing musculature, or because queens differ in their ability to identify potential host plants while in flight. Our results provide support for one of the necessary conditions underlying several of the hypothesized mechanisms promoting coexistence in tropical plant-ants. They also suggest that for some ant species limited dispersal capability could pose a significant barrier to the rescue of populations in isolated forest fragments. Finally, we demonstrate that inverse models parameterized with field data are an excellent means of quantifying the dispersal of ant queens."
https://openalex.org/W1995819195,"Background Due to scanty individual health data in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), health planners often use imperfect data sources. Frequent national-level data are considered essential, even if their depth and quality are questionable. However, quality in-depth data from local sentinel populations may be better than scanty national data, if such local data can be considered as nationally representative. The difficulty is the lack of any theoretical or empirical basis for demonstrating that local data are representative where data on the wider population are unavailable. Thus these issues can only be explored empirically in a complete individual dataset at national and local levels, relating to a LMIC population profile. Methods and Findings Swedish national data for 1925 were used, characterised by relatively high mortality, a low proportion of older people and substantial mortality due to infectious causes. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of Sweden then and LMICs now are very similar. Rates of livebirths, stillbirths, infant and cause-specific mortality were calculated at national and county levels. Results for six million people in 24 counties showed that most counties had overall mortality rates within 10% of the national level. Other rates by county were mostly within 20% of national levels. Maternal mortality represented too rare an event to give stable results at the county level. Conclusions After excluding obviously outlying counties (capital city, island, remote areas), any one of the remaining 80% closely reflected the national situation in terms of key demographic and mortality parameters, each county representing approximately 5% of the national population. We conclude that this scenario would probably translate directly to about 40 LMICs with populations under 10 million, and to individual states or provinces within about 40 larger LMICs. Unsubstantiated claims that local sub-national population data are “unrepresentative” or “only local” should not therefore predominate over likely representativity."
https://openalex.org/W2014547666,"Extinction risks are increasing for amphibians due to rising threats and minimal conservation efforts. Nearly one quarter of all threatened/extinct amphibians in the IUCN Red List is purportedly at risk from the disease chytridiomycosis. However, a closer look at the data reveals that Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (the causal agent) has been identified and confirmed to cause clinical disease in only 14% of these species. Primary literature surveys confirm these findings; ruling out major discrepancies between Red List assessments and real-time science. Despite widespread interest in chytridiomycosis, little progress has been made between assessment years to acquire evidence for the role of chytridiomycosis in species-specific amphibian declines. Instead, assessment teams invoke the precautionary principle when listing chytridiomycosis as a threat. Precaution is valuable when dealing with the world's most threatened taxa, however scientific research is needed to distinguish between real and predicted threats in order to better prioritize conservation efforts. Fast paced, cost effective, in situ research to confirm or rule out chytridiomycosis in species currently hypothesized to be threatened by the disease would be a step in the right direction. Ultimately, determining the manner in which amphibian conservation resources are utilized is a conversation for the greater conservation community that we hope to stimulate here."
https://openalex.org/W1974562454,"Bacteria are key components in all ecosystems. However, our knowledge of bacterial metabolism is based solely on the study of cultivated organisms which represent just a tiny fraction of microbial diversity. To access new enzymatic reactions and new or alternative pathways, we investigated bacterial metabolism through analyses of uncultivated bacterial consortia.We applied the gene context approach to assembled sequences of the metagenome of the anaerobic digester of a municipal wastewater treatment plant, and identified a new gene which may participate in an alternative pathway of lysine fermentation.We characterized a novel, unique aminotransferase that acts exclusively on Coenzyme A (CoA) esters, and proposed a variant route for lysine fermentation. Results suggest that most of the lysine fermenting organisms use this new pathway in the digester. Its presence in organisms representative of two distinct bacterial divisions indicate that it may also be present in other organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2023403382,"The formation of adhesion complexes is the rate-limiting step for collagen phagocytosis by fibroblasts, but the role of Ca2+ and the potential interactions of actin-binding proteins in regulating collagen phagocytosis are not well defined. We found that the binding of collagen beads to fibroblasts was temporally and spatially associated with actin assembly at nascent phagosomes, which was absent in gelsolin null cells. Analysis of tryptic digests isolated from gelsolin immunoprecipitates indicated that non-muscle (NM) myosin IIA may bind to gelsolin. Immunostaining and immunoprecipitation showed that gelsolin and NM myosin IIA associated at collagen adhesion sites. Gelsolin and NM myosin IIA were both required for collagen binding and internalization. Collagen binding to cells initiated a prolonged increase of [Ca2+]i, which was absent in cells null for gelsolin or NM myosin IIA. Collagen bead-induced increases of [Ca2+]i were associated with phosphorylation of the myosin light chain, which was dependent on gelsolin. NM myosin IIA filament assembly, which was dependent on myosin light chain phosphorylation and increased [Ca2+]i, also required gelsolin. Ionomycin-induced increases of [Ca2+]i overcame the block of myosin filament assembly in gelsolin null cells. We conclude that gelsolin and NM myosin IIA interact at collagen adhesion sites to enable NM myosin IIA filament assembly and localized, Ca2+-dependent remodeling of actin at the nascent phagosome and that these steps are required for collagen phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2080890077,"The development of consistent left-right (LR) asymmetry across phyla is a fascinating question in biology. While many pharmacological and molecular approaches have been used to explore molecular mechanisms, it has proven difficult to exert precise temporal control over functional perturbations. Here, we took advantage of acoustical vibration to disrupt LR patterning in Xenopus embryos during tightly-circumscribed periods of development. Exposure to several low frequencies induced specific randomization of three internal organs (heterotaxia). Investigating one frequency (7 Hz), we found two discrete periods of sensitivity to vibration; during the first period, vibration affected the same LR pathway as nocodazole, while during the second period, vibration affected the integrity of the epithelial barrier; both are required for normal LR patterning. Our results indicate that low frequency vibrations disrupt two steps in the early LR pathway: the orientation of the LR axis with the other two axes, and the amplification/restriction of downstream LR signals to asymmetric organs."
https://openalex.org/W1964244540,"Background Understanding where mutant CFTR is localised in airway epithelia is essential in guiding the best therapeutic approach to correct the dysfunction of the CFTR protein. The widely held paradigm is that CF patients harbouring the commonest mutation, CFTR-delF508, trap CFTR within the endoplasmic reticulum and target it for degradation. However there are conflicting reports concerning expression and localisation of CFTR-delF508 in lung tissue. To attempt to resolve this fundamental issue we developed a novel approach to measure CFTR-delF508 in the lower airways of patients who have undergone lung transplantation for advanced CF. By sampling CF and non-CF epithelium simultaneously from the same individual, confounding factors of different airway microenvironments which may have influenced previous observations can be overcome. Methods Epithelia sampled by bronchial brushing above (CF) and below (non-CF) the bronchial anastomosis were stained for CFTR and the localisation and level of expression assessed (n = 12). Results There was no significant difference in the proportion of tall columnar cells showing CFTR immunostaining as a discrete band at the apical membrane in cells harbouring the CFTR-delF508 mutation compared to non-CF cells (p = 0.21, n = 12). However, the amount of CFTR expressed at the apical surface was reduced by ∼50% in CF cells compared to non-CF cells (p = 0.04, n = 5). Conclusions Our novel observation challenges the prevailing paradigm that CFTR is essentially absent from the apical membrane of respiratory cells harbouring the CFTR-delF508 mutation. Moreover, it raises the possibility that the new generation of CFTR potentiators may offer a realistic therapeutic option for CF patients."
https://openalex.org/W1997307658,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is located on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria and is responsible for maintaining outer membrane stability, which is a prerequisite for cell survival. Furthermore, it represents an important barrier against hostile environmental factors such as antimicrobial peptides and the complement cascade during Gram-negative infections. The sugar 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) is an integral part of LPS and plays a key role in LPS functionality. Prior to its incorporation into the LPS molecule, Kdo has to be activated by the CMP-Kdo synthetase (CKS). Based on the presence of a single Mg2+ ion in the active site, detailed models of the reaction mechanism of CKS have been developed previously. Recently, a two-metal-ion hypothesis suggested the involvement of two Mg2+ ions in Kdo activation. To further investigate the mechanistic aspects of Kdo activation, we kinetically characterized the CKS from the hyperthermophilic organism Aquifex aeolicus. In addition, we determined the crystal structure of this enzyme at a resolution of 2.10 Å and provide evidence that two Mg2+ ions are part of the active site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2057904628,"Social species that maintain individualised relationships with certain others despite continuous changes in age, reproductive status and dominance rank between group members ought to be capable of individual recognition. Tests of “true” individual recognition, where an individual recognises unique features of another, are rare, however. Often kinship and/or familiarity suffice to explain dyadic interactions. The complex relationships within a greylag goose flock suggest that they should be able to recognise individuals irrespective of familiarity or kinship. We tested whether six-week-old hand-raised greylags can discriminate between two of their siblings. We developed a new experimental protocol, in which geese were trained to associate social siblings with geometrical symbols. Subsequently, focals were presented with two geometrical symbols in the presence of a sibling associated with one of the symbols. Significant choice of the geometrical symbol associated with the target present indicated that focals were able to distinguish between individual targets. Greylag goslings successfully learned this association-discrimination task, regardless of genetic relatedness or sex of the sibling targets. Social relationships within a goose flock thus may indeed be based on recognition of unique features of individual conspecifics."
https://openalex.org/W2010598094,"The highly conserved members of the zic family of zinc-finger transcription factors are primarily known for their roles in embryonic signaling pathways and regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. This study describes sexual phenotype differences in abundances of zic2 mRNA in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, a region strongly implicated in sexual behavior and function, in an adult teleost, Thalassoma bifasciatum. The bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) is a valuable model for studying neuroendocrine processes because it displays two discrete male phenotypes, initial phase (IP) males and territorial, terminal phase (TP) males, and undergoes socially-controlled protogynous sex change. Previously generated microarray-based comparisons suggested that zic2 was upregulated in the brains of terminal phase males relative to initial phase males. To further explore this difference, we cloned a 727 bp sequence for neural zic2 from field-collected animals. Riboprobe-based in situ hybridization was employed to localize zic2 signal in adult bluehead brains and assess the relative abundance of brain zic2 mRNA across sexual phenotypes. We found zic2 mRNA expression was extremely abundant in the granular cells of the cerebellum and widespread in other brain regions including in the thalamus, hypothalamus, habenula, torus semicircularis, torus longitudinalis, medial longitudinal fascicle and telencephalic areas. Quantitative autoradiography and phosphorimaging showed zic2 mRNA hybridization signal in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus was significantly higher in terminal phase males relative to both initial phase males and females, and silver grain analysis confirmed this relationship between phenotypes. No significant difference in abundance was found in zic2 signal across phenotypes in the habenula, a brain region not implicated in the control of sexual behavior, or cerebellum."
