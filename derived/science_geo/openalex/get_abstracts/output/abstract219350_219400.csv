https://openalex.org/W2028036560,"The notion of the adult heart as terminally differentiated organ without self-renewal potential has been undermined by the existence of a subpopulation of replicating myocytes in normal and pathological states. The origin and significance of these cells has remained obscure for lack of a proper biological context. We report the existence of Lin(-) c-kit(POS) cells with the properties of cardiac stem cells. They are self-renewing, clonogenic, and multipotent, giving rise to myocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells. When injected into an ischemic heart, these cells or their clonal progeny reconstitute well-differentiated myocardium, formed by blood-carrying new vessels and myocytes with the characteristics of young cells, encompassing approximately 70% of the ventricle. Thus, the adult heart, like the brain, is mainly composed of terminally differentiated cells, but is not a terminally differentiated organ because it contains stem cells supporting its regeneration. The existence of these cells opens new opportunities for myocardial repair."
https://openalex.org/W2023420720,"HIV-1 and other retroviruses exit infected cells by budding from the plasma membrane, a process requiring membrane fission. The primary late assembly (L) domain in the p6 region of HIV-1 Gag mediates the detachment of the virion by recruiting host Tsg101, a component of the class E vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) machinery. We now show that HIV Gag p6 contains a second region involved in L domain function that binds AIP1, a homolog of the yeast class E Vps protein Bro1. Further, AIP1 interacts with Tsg101 and homologs of a subunit of the yeast class E Vps protein complex ESCRT-III. AIP1 also binds to the L domain in EIAV p9, and this binding correlates perfectly with L domain function. These observations identify AIP1 as a component of the viral budding machinery, which serves to link a distinct region in the L domain of HIV-1 p6 and EIAV p9 to ESCRT-III."
https://openalex.org/W1978141733,"HIV release requires TSG101, a cellular factor that sorts proteins into vesicles that bud into multivesicular bodies (MVB). To test whether other proteins involved in MVB biogenesis (the class E proteins) also participate in HIV release, we identified 22 candidate human class E proteins. These proteins were connected into a coherent network by 43 different protein-protein interactions, with AIP1 playing a key role in linking complexes that act early (TSG101/ESCRT-I) and late (CHMP4/ESCRT-III) in the pathway. AIP1 also binds the HIV-1 p6Gag and EIAV p9Gag proteins, indicating that it can function directly in virus budding. Human class E proteins were found in HIV-1 particles, and dominant-negative mutants of late-acting human class E proteins arrested HIV-1 budding through plasmal and endosomal membranes. These studies define a protein network required for human MVB biogenesis and indicate that the entire network participates in the release of HIV and probably many other viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2011055466,"Organisms modulate their growth according to nutrient availability. Although individual cells in a multicellular animal may respond directly to nutrient levels, growth of the entire organism needs to be coordinated. Here, we provide evidence that in Drosophila, coordination of organismal growth originates from the fat body, an insect organ that retains endocrine and storage functions of the vertebrate liver. In a genetic screen for growth modifiers, we identified slimfast, a gene that encodes an amino acid transporter. Remarkably, downregulation of slimfast specifically within the fat body causes a global growth defect similar to that seen in Drosophila raised under poor nutritional conditions. This involves TSC/TOR signaling in the fat body, and a remote inhibition of organismal growth via local repression of PI3-kinase signaling in peripheral tissues. Our results demonstrate that the fat body functions as a nutrient sensor that restricts global growth through a humoral mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2028175193,"Receptor signaling at the plasma membrane often releases calcium from intracellular stores. For example, inositol triphosphate (IP3) produced by receptor-coupled phospholipase C activates an intracellular store calcium channel, the IP(3)R. Conversely, stores can induce extracellular calcium to enter the cell through plasma membrane channels, too. How this ""reverse"" coupling works was unclear, but store IP(3)Rs were proposed to bind and regulate plasma membrane TRP cation channels. Here, we demonstrate that the adaptor protein, termed Homer, facilitates a physical association between TRPC1 and the IP(3)R that is required for the TRP channel to respond to signals. The TRPC1-Homer-IP(3)R complex is dynamic and its disassembly parallels TRPC1 channel activation. Homer's action depends on its ability to crosslink and is blocked by the dominant-negative immediate early gene form, H1a. Since H1a is transcriptionally regulated by cellular activity, this mechanism can affect both short and long-term regulation of TRPC1 function."
https://openalex.org/W2156504663,"ABCG5 (G5) and ABCG8 (G8) are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that limit intestinal absorption and promote biliary excretion of neutral sterols. Mutations in either ABCG5 or ABCG8 result in an identical clinical phenotype, suggesting that these two half-transporters function as heterodimers. Expression of both G5 and G8 is required for either protein to be transported to the plasma membrane of cultured cells. In this paper we used immunofluorescence microscopy to confirm, in vivo, that G5 is localized to the apical membranes of mouse enterocytes and hepatocytes. Other ABC half-transporters function as homodimers or as heterodimers with other subfamily members. To determine whether G5 or G8 complex with other ABCG half-transporters, we co-expressed G1, G2, and G4 with either G5 or G8 in cultured cells. G1, G2, and G4 co-immunoprecipitated with G5, and G4 co-immunoprecipitated with G8, but the putative dimers were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Adenovirus-mediated expression of either G5 or G8 in the liver of G5G8 null mice resulted in ER retention of the expressed proteins and no increase in biliary cholesterol. In contrast, co-expression of G5 and G8 resulted in transit of the proteins out of the ER and a 10-fold increase in biliary cholesterol concentration. Finally, adenoviral expression of G2 in the presence or absence of G5 or G8 failed to promote sterol excretion into bile. These experiments indicate that G5 and G8 function as obligate heterodimers to promote sterol excretion into bile.

Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic ABC transporters consist of two modules, a magnesium-dependent ATPase catalytic domain and a transmembrane domain containing 6–12 membrane-spanning segments (2Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). ABC transporters are divided into half-transporters, which contain one ATPase domain and one membrane-spanning domain, and full-transporters, which contain paired modules in tandem (2Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). G5 and G8 are both half-transporters belonging to the G subfamily of ABC proteins. Like the other three members of the human G subfamily of ABC transporters (ABCG1, ABCG2, and ABCG4), the ATPase catalytic domains of G5 and G8 are located N-terminal to the transmembrane domain.Mutations in either ABCG5 or ABCG8 cause sitosterolemia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of both plant-derived (primarily sitosterol) and animal-derived (cholesterol) sterols in plasma and tissues (3Berge K.E.

In mice, G5 and G8 limit the absorption of dietary sterols and promote the excretion of cholesterol into bile (6Yu L. Li-Hawkins J. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin.

A. 2003; 99: 16237-16242Crossref Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In sitosterolemia there is a generalized increase in the absorption of dietary neutral sterols and a defect in the efflux of these sterols into bile (8Miettinen T.A. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 10: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9Salen G. Shore V. Tint G.S. Forte T. Shefer S. Horak I. Horak E. Dayal B. Nguyen L. Batta A.K. et al.J.

These changes in sterol trafficking result in deposition of neutral sterols in skin as xanthomas and in coronary arteries, resulting in premature atherosclerosis.G5 and G8 are both glycoproteins (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). If recombinant G5 or G8 is expressed alone in cultured cells, the recombinant protein is retained in the ER and remains sensitive to endoglycosidase (Endo) H, an enzyme that removes only immature, high mannose N-linked glycans that have failed to undergo processing to mature oligosaccharides in the Golgi complex. If both half-transporters are expressed in the same cell, the N-linked sugars become insensitive to Endo H and sensitive to neuraminidase, which cleaves sialic acid residues added in the trans-Golgi complex. As G5 and G8 transit through the Golgi complex to the cell surface, the changes in sugar content increase the apparent molecular mass of each protein on SDS-PAGE gels (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). When both proteins are expressed in polarized hepatocytes (WIF-B cells), the proteins are transported to the apical domain (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), but the locations of G5 and G8 within enterocytes and hepatocytes in vivo remain to be determined.It is generally accepted that ABC half-transporters function as homo- or heterodimers. The observations that co-expression of G5 and G8 is required for either protein to reach the cell surface and that the two proteins co-immunoprecipitate when co-expressed in cultured cells (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), are consistent with these two members of the G subfamily functioning as a heterodimer. It remains possible that homodimers of either G5 or G8 are functional. Differentially epitope-tagged variants of G8 co-precipitate, but the putative dimers fail to exit the ER (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Additional evidence that G5 and G8 must heterodimerize to transport sterols comes from the molecular analysis of sitosterolemia. Mutations in either ABCG5 or ABCG8 cause a disease of clinically identical phenotype (3Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A. Yu L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H.

Moreover, the two genes are located in a head-to-head orientation on chromosome 2; this orientation is typical for genes that encode subunits of functional complexes that share common regulatory sequences (viz. divergent promoters) (13Trappe R. Doenecke D. Albig W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Ikeda S. Mochizuki A. Sarker A.H. Seki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ABCG5 and ABCG8 have similar tissue- and cell-specific patterns of expression and are coordinately regulated (3Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A. Yu L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2000; 290: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 15Repa J.J. Berge K.E.

In Drosophila, eye color is determined by three members of the G subfamily of ABC half-transporters: white, brown, and scarlet (16Ewart G.D. Howells A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The white gene product heterodimerizes with either brown or scarlet to transport amino acids into pigment granules (17Ewart G.D. Cannell D. Cox G.B. Howells A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10370-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chen H. Rossier C. Lalioti M.D. Lynn A. Chakravarti A. Perrin G. Antonarakis S.E. Am. J. Hum.

Given this precedent, it is possible that G5 or G8 form functional heterodimers with other G subfamily members expressed in the liver and intestine.ABCG2, which was originally identified in cells resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs, is expressed on the apical (lumenal) surface of enterocytes and hepatocytes (20Maliepaard M. Scheffer G.L. Faneyte I.F. van Gastelen M.A. Pijnenborg A.C. Schinkel A.H. van De Vijver M.J. Scheper R.J. Schellens J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3458-3464PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rocchi E.

G2 plays a crucial role in the excretion of chlorophyll metabolites into bile (22Jonker J.W. Buitelaar M. Wagenaar E. Van Der Valk M.A. Scheffer G.L. Scheper R.J. Plosch T. Kuipers F. Elferink R.P. Rosing H. Beijnen J.H. Schinkel A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15649-15654Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Although G2 forms a homodimer and can transport substrates in the absence of any other subfamily member in cultured cells (23Ozvegy C. Litman T. Szakacs G. Nagy Z. Bates S. Varadi A. Sarkadi B.

ABCG4 is expressed predominantly in the brain, eye, spleen, and bone marrow and is expressed at low levels in the liver (28Oldfield S. Lowry C. Ruddick J. Lightman S. Biochim. Biophys.

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 26: 67-75Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The physiological functions and dimerization partners of G1 and G4 are not known.The present study confirms that cell surface G5 and G8 are localized to the apical membranes of enterocytes and hepatocytes in vivo. Co-expression of G1, G2, and G4 fail to support trafficking of G5 or G8 beyond the ER in cultured cells. In addition, G5 and G8 require co-expression for trafficking and biliary cholesterol excretion in G5G8 null mice.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning of ABCG Subfamily Members—Epitope-tagged mouse G5 (mG5-Myc) and mouse G8 (mG8-HA) cDNA expression constructs were described previously (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Human ABCG1-Myc/His and ABCG2 expression plasmids were kindly provided by Peter Edwards (UCLA) and Daniel Garry (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), respectively. The human ABCG4 cDNA was amplified from an IMAGE clone (identification number 1537140, accession number AA912226) using two oligonucleotides (5′-CTGGCTAGCATGGCGGAGAAGGCG-3′ and 5′-AACTCGAGTCAGCGGCCGCTTCTCTCTGACTT-3′) and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The ABCG4 cDNA was cloned into the NheI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/Zeo. A 93-bp fragment containing three copies of an immunogenic epitope (YPYDVPDYAG) from hemagluttinin (HA) (30Tokiwa G. Tyers M. Volpe T. Futcher B. Nature. 1994; 371: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was inserted into a NotI site within the 3′ oligonucleotide.Human ABCG5 and ABCG8 cDNAs were amplified by PCR from a human liver cDNA pool (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using Pfu polymerase and oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding region (ABCG5 forward, 5′-CTGGCTAGCATGGTGACCTCTATCT, and reverse, 5′-AACTCGAGTCAGCGGCCGCTCCTGCTAATGAG; and ABCG8 forward, 5′-CTGGCTAGCATGGCCGGGAAGGCGGCA, and reverse, 5′-AACTCGAGTCAGCGGCCGCTCCAGTCTTGACT). ABCG5 and ABCG8 cDNAs were cloned into the NheI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) and pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+), respectively. Attempts to ligate the complete ABCG5 cDNA into pcDNA3.1(+) failed repeatedly. Therefore, the complete cDNA was amplified and digested with NheI and BamHI, BamHI and EcoRI, or EcoRI and XhoI. The resultant fragments were subcloned in series into pcDNA3.1(+) to form the ABCG5 cDNA expression construct. The 3′ oligonucleotide used for the initial amplification also contained a NotI site upstream of the internal stop codon and XhoI site. A 105-bp fragment encoding three copies of a Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLN) (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) was inserted into the ABCG5 cDNA clone at the NotI site. In addition, a cDNA encoding three copies of the FLAG epitope (DYKDHD) was generated using over-lapping oligonucleotides (5′-TAGCGGCCGCATGGATTACAAGGATCACGA, 5′-TGATCCTTGTAATCTCCGTCGTGATCCTTG, 5′-TTACAAGGATCACGACGGAGATTACAAGGA, and 5′-TAGCGGCCGCCGTCGTGATCCTTGTAATCT), amplified by PCR, and inserted into the NotI site of the ABCG5 expression construct.Cell Culture—CHO-K1 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Ham's F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (50%, v/v) containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator (8.8% CO2). HEK-293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator (8.8% CO2).Development of Monoclonal Antibody to ABCG8—G5G8-/- mice were given a single intrasplenic injection (100 μg in phosphate-buffered saline; day 0) of a cDNA encoding full-length mABCG8 in the pcDNA 3.1/Zeo mammalian expression plasmid, followed by two intramuscular injections of the same cDNA (100 μg each; days 28 and 42) and four additional injections (300 μg each, intraperitoneally; days 56, 70, 84, and 98) of a recombinant fragment (amino acids 1–350) of mouse G8 protein. The fragment of mouse G8 was expressed in Escherichia coli using the pET28a expression system. Serum was collected from mice on day 84 and screened for immunoreactivity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by immunoblotting using the recombinant G8 protein. Once a positive response was established, the recombinant protein was administered 3 days prior to removal of the spleen. A 5:1 ratio of spleen/myeloma (SP2/0-IL 6) cells were fused with 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol and plated in 96-well plates (31Velasco-Miguel S. Richardson J.A. Gerlach V.L. Lai W.C. Gao T. Russell L.D. Hladik C.L. White C.L. Friedberg E.C. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 91-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The clones were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot analysis.Isolation of Plasma Membrane Sheets—Plasma membrane sheets were isolated from mouse liver using an established procedure developed for rats with minor modifications (32Tuma P.L. Hubbard A.L. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 3.2.1-3.2.16Google Scholar). Briefly, five mice (∼30 g) were anesthetized with halothane and killed by guillotine. The livers were dissected and perfused via the portal vein with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline. The livers were pooled, weighed and minced on ice. The subsequent steps of the procedure were performed exactly as described (32Tuma P.L. Hubbard A.L. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 3.2.1-3.2.16Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Mice were anesthetized with 0.8 mg of pentobarbital and perfused via the left ventricle with Hanks' balanced salt solution (40 ml) and 40 ml of Fix-1 solution (3% paraform-aldehyde, 3 mm picric acid, 4 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5). The liver and intestines were dissected and placed in Fix-1 for 2 h. Fix-1 solution was aspirated, and the samples were incubated with two changes of Fix-2 solution (60% methanol, 8% acetic acid, 2% trichloroacetic acid, 30% methylchloroform) for 12 h each. Fix-2 solution was aspirated, and the samples were incubated with three changes of 70% ethanol for 30 min each. The samples were transferred to 100% ethanol for 16 h, dehydrated in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. The sections (10 μm) were cut, floated onto positively charged slides, and post-fixed in -20 °C methanol for 5 min. Incubation with primary and secondary antibodies as well as confocal imaging were performed as described previously (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).Transfections and Cell Lysates—The CHO-K1 cells were seeded (1 × 105 cells/dish) in 35-mm dishes. The expression plasmids (1 μg/dish) were transiently transfected into the CHO-K1 cells using FuGene (6 μl of FuGene/μg of DNA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), incubated in 0.3 ml of Triton lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 8.0) for 30 min at 4 °C and scraped with a rubber policeman. The cells and lysis buffer were transferred to a 1.5-ml tube and centrifuged for 15 min (15,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatants were transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.Immunoprecipitations—Immunoprecipitations were conducted essentially as described (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 48 h after transfection, the lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) containing protease inhibitors and 0.5% (w/v) digitonin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The lysates were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C on a rotator in the presence of the indicated antibodies and protein A agarose. The pellets were washed in digitonin lysis buffer three times for 10 min at 4 °C on a rotator. Analysis of several detergents indicated that G5/G8 heterodimers were more stable in digitonin than in Nonidet P-40, Triton or CHAPS. 2G. A. Graf, L. Yu, C. Cohen, and H. H. Hobbs, unpublished observations.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—The protein concentrations of cell lysates and fractions were determined using the Bio-Rad Dc assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein sample buffer was added to a final concentration of 1×, and the samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were size-fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels at 50 mA and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 50 V for 2 h. The membranes were incubated in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 5% milk) for 60 min at 22 °C prior to the addition of polyclonal antibodies directed against calnexin (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), the Myc (A14) or HA (Y11) epitopes (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or monoclonal antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope (M2; Sigma) or ABCG2 (BXP-21; Signet, Dedham, MA). Primary antibodies were diluted in buffer A and incubated with membranes for 60 min at 22 °C. The membranes were washed three times for 5 min in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.2% nonfat milk). Horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was diluted (1:10,000) and incubated with membranes for 60 min at 22 °C. The membranes were washed three times for 5 min in buffer B and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Protein loading was assessed by visual inspection of Ponceau S-stained membranes.Adenoviral Injections of G2, G5, and G8—Recombinant adenoviral vectors containing cDNAs for ABCG2, ABCG5, and ABCG8 were generated by in vitro cre-lox recombination as described previously (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The viruses were propagated in HEK-293 cells, purified on cesium chloride gradients, and dialyzed in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The mice were infected with adenovirus (5 × 1012 particles/kg) by tail vein injection. After 72 h, the mice were anesthetized with halothane and killed by exsanguination. Serum and bile were collected and analyzed for neutral sterol concentrations by gas liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy as described (7Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K.

Liver tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until processing for membrane preparation, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis.RESULTSRecombinant, epitope-tagged G5 is localized to the apical surface of polarized hepatocytes when co-expressed with G8 (11Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To confirm that the glycoproteins were present on the apical surfaces of cells in vivo, immunofluorescence microscopy was used to localize G5 in the intestine of wild-type, G5G8 null (G5G8-/-), and G5G8 transgenic mice (Fig. 1). No signal was apparent in the small intestine of G5G8-/- mice, demonstrating the specificity of the antibody. In contrast, the apical surface of the villi was stained in the sections from the wild-type mice and in mice expressing ∼14 copies of a human fragment containing both ABCG5 and ABCG8 (6Yu L. Li-Hawkins J. Hammer R.E. Berge K.E. Horton J.D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) (G5G8Tg). Punctate intracellular signal was also seen in the cytoplasm of enterocytes. When the same antibody was used to examine the liver, the signal was too low in wild-type animals to convincingly localize the protein (data not shown). Therefore, we examined the localization of ABCG8 in liver membranes from wild-type and G5G8Tg mice using immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). Antibodies directed against apical (APN), basolateral (HA321), and tight junction markers were used to define domains within the plasma membrane sheets (Fig. 2A). The localization of ABCG8 was compared with the tight junction protein ZO-1, which defines the border between apical and basolateral domains (Fig. 2B) (33Balda M.S. Anderson J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C918-C924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signal for human ABCG8 was essentially circumscribed by the ZO-1 signal, indicating that cell surface ABCG8 is highly enriched, if not present exclusively on the apical membranes of hepatocytes in vivo. An identical pattern was observed for mouse ABCG5 (data not shown).Fig. 2Immunofluorescence microscopy of human G8 in plasma membranes isolated from the livers of wild-type and G5G8Tg mice. Hepatic plasma membranes from wild-type (WT) and G5G8Tg mice were isolated, spotted on 24-mm2 coverslips, fixed in -20 °C methanol, and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. A, domains from the isolated plasma membranes were determined using antibodies directed against APN (apical), HA321(basolateral), and ZO-1 (tight junctions). B, to determine the localization of human G8 in plasma membranes of G5G8Tg mice, fixed plasma membrane sheets from wild-type and G5G8Tg mice were incubated with a rabbit antihuman G8 polyclonal antibody and a monoclonal antibody directed against the tight junctional marker ZO-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To address the possibility that G5 or G8 form functional complexes with other ABCG subfamily members, we first compared the sequences of the human ABCG transporters by multiple sequence alignment using Clustal W within the Biology Workbench Suite (San Diego Supercomputer Center; Fig. 3). Little sequence conservation was apparent between the proteins except in the nucleotide binding fold, including the Walker A motif (Fig. 3A), the Walker B motif (Fig. 3B), and the signature sequence (Fig. 3C). In addition, three other amino acid residues that are highly conserved within the ABC transporter subfamily were conserved in these five subfamily members: the glutamine in the Q loop, the aspartate in the D loop, and the histidine in the so-called switch region (2Klein I. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 237-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The relative sequence identity and evolutionary distance between subfamily members was determined by ProtDist (Table I) and illustrated in a rooted phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3B). ABCG1 and ABCG4 are more closely related to each other, but the other members of the subfamily are equally divergent. Surprisingly, ABCG5 and ABCG8 are only slightly more closely related to one another than to any of the other three members within the subfamily.Fig. 3Alignment of the human G subfamily members, relative evolutionary distance, and expression constructs.A, the inferred amino acid sequence for each G subfamily member was aligned using Clustal W within the Biology Workbench Suite (San Diego Supercomputer Center.

https://openalex.org/W1988294401,"It is poorly understood how apoptotic signals arising from DNA damage are transmitted to mitochondria, which release apoptogenic factors into the cytoplasm that activate downstream destruction programs. Here, we identify histone H1.2 as a cytochrome c-releasing factor that appears in the cytoplasm after exposure to X-ray irradiation. While all nuclear histone H1 forms are released into the cytoplasm in a p53-dependent manner after irradiation, only H1.2, but not other H1 forms, induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria in a Bak-dependent manner. Reducing H1.2 expression enhanced cellular resistance to apoptosis induced by X-ray irradiation or etoposide, but not that induced by other stimuli including TNF-alpha and UV irradiation. H1.2-deficient mice exhibited increased cellular resistance in thymocytes and the small intestine to X-ray-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that histone H1.2 plays an important role in transmitting apoptotic signals from the nucleus to the mitochondria following DNA double-strand breaks."

Initiation of replication within a DNA restriction fragment gives rise to a characteristic initiation or “bubble” arc, whereas origin-less fragments that are passively replicated by forks moving from one end to the other generate characteristic “Y” arcs (5Brewer B.J.

Mitochondrial DNA of mammals is a closed circular molecule of ∼16.5 kb; it encodes 13 proteins that contribute to oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Replication of mtDNA has been studied in a number of organisms using N/N 2D-AGE (9Han Z. Stachow C. Chromosoma. 1994; 103: 162-170PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lockshon D. Zweifel S.G. Freeman-Cook L.L.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 684-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The patterns of RIs obtained were consistent with conventional coupled leading and lagging strand (or strand-coupled) replication. However, for many years it was believed, based initially on electron microscopic images of the mtDNA of cultured cells, that mammalian mtDNA was replicated primarily via a unique, strand-asymmetric, unidirectional mechanism (13Clayton D.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 693-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). More recently, we used N/N 2D-AGE to demonstrate that human, mouse, and rat mtDNA replication involves conventional double-stranded RIs with coupled leading and lagging strand synthesis in addition to the partially single-stranded molecules that appeared consistent with a strand-asymmetric mechanism (14Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In a later study, the isolation procedure was improved, and the more highly purified mitochondria yielded only replication intermediates that were substantially duplex; moreover, the partially single-stranded forms seen in the previous study could be generated by RNase H treatment. Hence, it was concluded that mammalian mtDNA replication intermediates contain extensive ribonucleotide patches and that the apparent strand-asymmetric replication intermediates result from RNA degradation during isolation (15Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Two major objections to the conclusions of this study were raised recently; the first objection is that partially single-stranded molecules (including products of strand-asymmetric replication) would not be detected by N/N 2D-AGE because of branch-migration, and the second objection is that the blocked restriction sites could arise from transcription intermediates (16Bogenhagen D.F. Clayton D.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 357-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, intact, partially single-stranded replication intermediates have been analyzed successfully using N/N 2D-AGE (17Belanger K.G. Mirzayan C. Kreuzer H.E. Alberts B.M. Kreuzer K.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2166-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and, in any case, branch migration of nascent DNA strands would produce a linear, single-strand arc on neutral/neutral two-dimensional agarose gels (18Holt I.J. T. J. H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 355-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Transcription intermediates would inevitably be partially single-stranded whether or not replication was occurring on the same molecule, whereas the novel, slow-moving, Y-like arcs we described were substantially duplex (15Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Although extensive ribonucleotide incorporation created duplex RIs akin to strand-coupled RIs (15Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), it was not known where or by what mechanism these intermediates originated. When we previously screened the mammalian mitochondrial genome for origins of replication, we detected initiation arcs exclusively in restriction fragments that included the previously defined strand-asymmetric origin of replication, OH (14Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we proposed that strand-coupled replication was unidirectional, with an origin close to or coincident with OH (Fig. 1C). OH has been mapped precisely in humans (19Crews S. Ojala D. Posakony J. Nishiguchi J. Attardi G. Nature. 1979; 277: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) at nucleotide position (np) 191 of the 16,569 bp mtDNA molecule (20Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7681) Google Scholar). It was mapped at np 16,008 of the (differently numbered) 16,298-bp rat mitochondrial genome (21Gadaleta G. Pepe G. De Candia G. Quagliariello C. Sbisa E. Saccone C. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 28: 497-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and at np 16,065 in the mitochondrial genome of mouse (22Bibb M.J. Van Etten R.A. Wright C.T. Walberg M.W. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1981; 26: 167-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). However, our previous study (14Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) did not exclude an alternative model, namely bi-directional, strand-coupled replication, initiating at one or more sites downstream of OH and followed by fork arrest at OH (Fig. 1D, and Fig. 2, scenarios labeled II and III). Our original interpretation depended on the assumption that molecules derived from OH-containing fragments coincident with a simple Y arc represented broken bubbles (14Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The assumption was tenuous, given that it had been shown earlier that broken bubbles form arcs distinct from a simple Y arc (23Kalejta R.F. Lin H.B. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4923-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here we report that more detailed mapping studies refute our previous model. Instead, they support the alternative proposition in which initiation of strand-coupled (θ) replication occurs downstream of OH. Initiation of strand-coupled mtDNA replication is not restricted to the large non-coding region, which contains the major promoters for the two strands of mammalian mtDNA. Moreover, strand-coupled θ replication is the major mechanism of replication of mammalian mtDNA irrespective of ribonucleotide incorporation. Mitochondrial DNA was extracted from highly purified mitochondria of human placenta and mouse or rat liver as described previously (15Yang M.Y. Bowmaker M. Reyes A. Vergani L. Angeli P. Gringeri E. Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Cell. 2002; 111: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) with one modification. Whereas mitochondria were previously lysed immediately after pelleting following isolation from a density sucrose gradient, in this study purified mitochondria were resuspended in 75 mm NaCl and 50 mm EDTA (pH 7.6) with 500 μg/ml proteinase K without detergent. After incubation at 50 °C for 30 min, mitochondria were lysed by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the incubation was extended for a further 120 min. DNA was precipitated from solution after successive phenol and chloroform extractions and resuspended in 10 mm Tris and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.6). Mitochondrial DNA (0.1-1 μg) was digested with restriction endonucleases under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Where indicated, single-strand nuclease treatment was with one unit of S1 nuclease (Promega) for 120 s at 37 °C after restriction digestion. Two-dimensional Agarose Gel Electrophoresis and Hybridization— For fragments of 2-5 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size, neutral/neutral, two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis was performed by the standard method (3Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, first dimension electrophoresis was at 0.7 V/cm for 20 h at room temperature in a 0.4% agarose gel without ethidium bromide; the second dimension gel was 1% agarose with 300 ng/ml ethidium bromide, and electrophoresis was at 6 V/cm for 4 h at 4 °C. In the case of fragments of >5 kb, first dimension electrophoresis was in a 0.35% agarose gel at 1.5 V/cm for 20 h, and second dimension electrophoresis was 3 at V/cm for 18 h in a 0.875% agarose gel. After Southern blotting, specific regions of human, mouse, or rat mtDNA were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and then radioactively labeled using random primers. Five microliters of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with three units of Klenow DNA polymerase and 50 ng of DNA that had been annealed with 50 ng of hexadeoxyribonucleotides for 15-30 min at 37 °C.

Southern hybridization was carried out in 0.25 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 7% SDS buffer overnight at 65 °C. Post-hybridization washes were 1× SSC followed by 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, both for 30 min at 65 °C. Filters were exposed to x-ray film and developed after 0.5-10 days. Initiation Arc Intensity Increases with Increasing Distance from OH—DNA fragments containing a unique unidirectional origin located toward one end, such that the incipient replication fork passes through much of the fragment, will not produce a simple Y arc. Rather, the RIs will initially contribute only a bubble arc (illustrated in Fig. 2A). However, AccI- and DraI-digested fragments of human and mouse mtDNA containing OH lacked an appreciable bubble arc (Fig. 3, A and D). Although bubble arcs arising from a unidirectional origin located close to the center of a fragment can be difficult to distinguish from simple Y arcs, a bubble arc was detected previously in the same fragment of mtDNA of a tumor cell line (14Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Thus, the AccI result cannot be reconciled with unidirectional replication from OH. Furthermore, our previous suggestion that the Y-like species resulted from bubbles broken during processing (14Holt I.J. Lorimer H.E. Jacobs H.T. Cell. 2000; 100: 515-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) is undermined by other observations. First, Hamlin and co-workers have shown that broken replication bubbles form arcs distinct from a simple Y arc (23Kalejta R.F. Lin H.B. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4923-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Second, intact bubble arcs were seen with other enzymes such as HincII and ClaI (e.g.Fig 3, B and E). Third, both DraI and AccI were subsequently found to yield intact bubble arcs from human or rat mtDNA when probed for fragments lacking OH (see below). Moreover, as detailed in Fig. 2, aspects of the results from the OH-containing HincII fragment of human placental mtDNA, in particular the simple Y arc arising from the unit length fragment (1n), can only be reconciled with initiation of replication at one or more sites outside the fragment in some molecules. On the other hand, the weak bubble arc indicates that replication does initiate within the fragment, at least in a minority of molecules, though not necessarily at OH. A slightly larger OH-containing ClaI fragment of mouse mtDNA gave a similar result, i.e. a bubble arc accompanied by a slightly more pronounced Y arc (Fig 3E). The relative abundance of bubble and Y molecular species altered markedly when still larger fragments of human or mouse mtDNA were studied; the bubble arc signal increased considerably, with a concomitant decrease in signal from the simple Y arc (Fig. 3, C and F). Moreover, the absence of a detectable ascending Y arc close to 1n in the OH-containing 6.6-kbp AflIII fragment of mouse mtDNA indicates that replication rarely initiates outside the fragment. Thus, both human and mouse mtDNA fragments containing OH exhibited a trend according to size; bubble arcs were barely detectable in small fragments (1.5 and 2 kbp downstream of OH), moderate in intermediate sized fragments (3-4 kb downstream of OH), and prominent in large fragments (≥6 kb downstream of OH). The quantitative differences described above were reproducible both between and within different samples; the gels shown have been selected on the basis of image quality. Therefore, these data suggest that replication initiates frequently at multiple sites downstream of OH and only rarely at or near OH. Two straightforward and readily testable predictions stem from these conclusions. First, initiation arcs should be detectable in fragments of mammalian mtDNA lacking OH; second, the initiation arcs should not map to a single site. Strand-coupled Replication Initiates in Fragments of Human and Mouse mtDNA Lacking OH—Analysis of a number of mtDNA fragments lacking OH, derived from purified human placenta and mouse liver mitochondria, revealed bubble arcs on neutral/neutral two-dimensional agarose gels (Figs. 4 and 5). For example, human mtDNA fragments spanning np 13,366-16,456 (NciI) and np 13,366-16,390 (AvaII) both lack OH (located at np 191); therefore, the bubble arcs associated with these fragments (Fig 4, A-C) must have arisen from initiation at sites other than OH. In the case of the np 13,366-16,456 and np 13,366-16,390 human mtDNA fragments (Fig. 4, A-C), a complete Y arc was also detected, indicating that strand-coupled replication frequently initiates at sites outside the fragment. This conclusion was confirmed when the filter shown in Fig. 4A was reprobed for the NciI fragment spanning np 8,152-12,125, revealing a weak bubble arc (Fig. 4D). The disparity in signal between the bubble arcs of the two NciI fragments (np 13,366-16,456 and np 8,152-12,125) indicates that more initiation events occur in the fragment adjacent to (but not containing) OH. Additional prominent non-standard arcs (slow moving Y-like arcs) were evident in many cases (e.g.Fig. 4, A′-D′); these are the result of blocked restriction enzyme sites attributable to extensive ribonucleotide incorporation on the newly synthesized mitochondrial L-strand (for details, see Ref. 15Yang M.Y.

Purified mouse liver mtDNA samples were digested with NsiI (panel A), BglI (panel B), AccI (panel C), PflMI (panel D), AvrII (panel E), BsaI (panel F), BamHI (panel G), or XbaI (panel H). Gel blots were hybridized with probe m2 (panels A and B), m3 (panels C-F), or m4 (panel G). Each detected fragment lacks OH. A schematic map at the top shows the restriction sites for mouse mtDNA that define the fragments analyzed in panels A-G.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A number of fragments of mouse mtDNA lacking OH analyzed by N/N 2D-AGE also revealed a complete bubble arc and a complete Y arc, such as an NsiI fragment spanning np 10,758-15,903 (Fig. 5A) and a BglI fragment spanning np 12,664-15,949 (Fig. 5B). Bubble arcs were also detected in a XbaI fragment (np10,907-15,973), a PsiI fragment (np 10,971-15,590), and a BanII fragment (np 12,959-15,742), which similarly lack OH (data not shown). A unidirectional origin located close to the common end of these various fragments, around np 15,500, with synthesis away from OH, could explain these data. However, a complete bubble arc was also detected associated with an AccI fragment of mouse mtDNA spanning np 9,599-14,647 (Fig 5C) and a PflMI fragment spanning np 10,836-14,604 (Fig. 5D). Thus, if unidirectional replication is to account for these findings, there must be a third origin close to the ends of these fragments around np 14,500, with the direction of synthesis again away from OH. Alternatively, bi-directional replication initiates at multiple sites downstream of OH, with one advancing fork undergoing arrest upon reaching OH. Consistent with the latter interpretation is the pronounced thickening of the descending portion of the Y arc in several fragments, most notably as seen in Fig. 5D. Moreover, multiple unidirectional origins of similar strength cannot account for the abrupt termination of the Y arc in OH-containing fragments, which indicates that many replication intermediates share a common end mapping at or near OH. Although OH acting as the major unidirectional origin would be compatible with this observation, the absence of bubble arcs in some OH-containing fragments (Fig 3, A and D) and their weakness in others (Fig. 3, B and E) categorically contradict this idea. Therefore, only bidirectional replication from multiple origins with the subsequent arrest of one advancing fork at OH is compatible with all the data (Fig. 2C, scenarios labeled II and III). Analysis of larger fragments of mouse mtDNA, such as a 6.65-kbp AvrII fragment (np 8,178-14,825) (Fig. 5E) and a 7.15 kbp BsaI fragment (np 7,735-14,884) (Fig. 5F), yielded a similar ratio of bubble to simple Y molecules as smaller fragments, such as the AccI fragment spanning np 9,599-14,647 (Fig. 5C). This suggests that the first fork to exit the fragment does so at the OH proximal end (14,825, 14,884, or 14,647). Only large fragments containing OH produced a prominent bubble arc; therefore, the majority of bubbles of 5 kb or more include a fork that has reached and stalled at OH. As mentioned above, the OH-containing AflIII fragment of mouse mtDNA lacked a portion of the ascending Y arc close to 1n, suggesting that few origins are located in the 2 kb of the fragment furthest from OH (circa np 10,118-12,000). Further evidence that origins are not scattered throughout the mouse mitochondrial genome came from a 6.9 kb BamHI fragment (np 4,275-11,167) and a 7.6kb XbaI fragment (np 938-8,529), each of which lacked a bubble arc and was associated with a simple Y arc (Fig 5, G and H, respectively). Other fragments of mammalian mtDNA that lacked an initiation arc are described below. Replication Origins of Rat mtDNA Map to a Broad Region Downstream of OH—Analysis of mtDNA replication intermediates in rat liver lends support to the idea that bidirectional initiation in a zone downstream of OH is general among mammalian mtDNAs. As with human and mouse mtDNA, bubble arc versus Y arc intensity was greater in large fragments containing OH than small OH-containing fragments (Fig. 6, A versus B and C). The presence of a prominent simple Y arc arising from 1n in the small fragments (Fig. 6, B and C) again suggests that initiation events occur not only downstream of OH but also outside these fragments, i.e. at nucleotide numbers below 13,811. Moreover, given that the bubble arc was more truncated than the Y arc in such fragments, unidirectional θ replication initiating at OH is excluded as a major mode of replication for rat liver mitochondria. Unidirectional replication from OH would produce a bubble arc that extended to a point in line with the terminus of the bubble arc (marked with a vertical broken line in Fig. 6C). The smear on the descending Y arc that ends abruptly in a pronounced spot (Fig. 6D) suggests that replication fork arrest occurs at multiple loci. Therefore, the data in rat are consistent with the initiation of bidirectional replication in the OH-distal portion of the restriction fragment (np ∼14,500-15,000), followed by stalling of the rightward-moving replication fork within a ∼500-bp region terminating at OH. Alternative initiation events further from OH within this fragment, or outside the fragment altogether, could account for the prominent Y arc signal. The replication forks coming from these more OH-distal origins would also stall near OH and would contribute to the strength of the pause region signal on the Y arc. To test for the possibility of alternative initiation events OH-distal to 14,500, we examined other restriction fragments of rat mtDNA. Analysis of the 4.6-kb AccI fragment (np 9,236-13,841), the MfeI fragment (np 10.815-14,701), and the BamHI fragment (np 9,361-14,436) all yielded bubble arcs (Fig 6, E-J). Bgll and Bcll fragments of rat mtDNA adjacent to, yet lacking, OH and mapping between np 12,643 and np 15,927 were also associated with bubble arcs (Fig. 6, K and L). These data support the view that rat mtDNA replication is initiated by a strand-coupled θ mechanism at multiple sites downstream of OH. Fine Mapping of the Origin of Strand-coupled Replication in Rat mtDNA—Analysis of overlapping fragments of DNA has been used previously to map origins of replication, (e.g. Ref. 24Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Methods. 1999; 18: 418-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A complete bubble arc is consistent with bidirectional replication from an origin located at the center of a fragment; in practice, an origin anywhere within the central third of a fragment (sometimes called the “detection zone”) gives rise to a clear bubble arc, whereas origins closer to the ends of fragments are difficult, if not impossible, to detect by N/N 2D-AGE (25Linskens M.H. Huberman J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Where replication is unidirectional, only origins at the extreme end of a fragment will produce a complete bubble arc. Accordingly, overlapping fragments on either side of a fragment in which such an origin is located will, in one case, lack the origin, whereas in the other case the pattern formed will be a truncated bubble arc accompanied by a double Y arc. None of these scenarios is consistent with the results. In the case of rat mtDNA, the AccI (np 9,237-13,842), BamHI (np 9,361-14,436), BglI (np 12,643-15,927), and BclI (np 12,012-15,861) fragments cover a region that overlaps the extreme fragments (AccI and BglI) by less than half their length, yet all were associated with essentially complete bubble arcs (Fig. 6, D-J). A discrete origin, whether bidirectional or unidirectional, would give alterations in the patterns of bubble-, Y-, and X-shaped replication intermediates when overlapping fragments were compared. The only explanation consistent with the data is that bidirectional θ replication initiates at different positions in different molecules and that these origins are scattered throughout an extensive zone stretching approximately from 500 base pairs downstream of OH (in the rat) to the ND4 gene. Based on this analysis, θ replication initiates in a zone that spans approximately np 11,500-15,500 of rat mtDNA (Fig. 6M). The data sets for mouse and human indicate mtDNA initiation zones of np 11,300-15,500 and np 10,500-16,000, respectively. Discrete origins, such as the SV40 origin, give rise to bubble arcs that are particularly prominent near their apex (26Kalejta R.F. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4915-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The prominent apex of the bubble arc of mouse mtDNA (Fig. 3F) contrasts with that of human (Fig. 3C) and is consistent with a narrower initiation zone in mouse than human mtDNA. In any event, the exact boundaries of the initiation zone may be slightly outside of the defined limits, because origins of θ replication located near one end of a fragment are difficult to detect (25Linskens M.H. Huberman J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 647-652C"

Fibrillization of purified recombinant α-synuclein is inefficient in vitro but can be enhanced by the addition of various agents including glycosaminoglycans and polycations. Here we report that fatty acids and structurally related anionic detergents greatly accelerate fibrillization of recombinant α-synuclein at low micromolar concentrations with lag times as short as 11 min and apparent first order growth rate constants as fast as 10.4 h–1. All detergents and fatty acids were micellar at active concentrations because of an α-synuclein-dependent depression of their critical micelle concentrations. Other anionic surfaces, such as those supplied by anionic phospholipid vesicles, also induced α-synuclein fibrillization, with resultant filaments originating from their surface. These data suggest that anionic surfaces presented as micelles or vesicles can serve to nucleate α-synuclein fibrillization, that this mechanism underlies the inducer activity of anionic surfactants, and that anionic membranes may serve this function in vivo.

The PCR product was cloned directly into PCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The construct was then digested with NdeI and HindIII and ligated into expression vectors pT7c and pT7II. These vectors drive the expression of poly-His-tagged and non-tagged α-synuclein, respectively (38Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). His-tagged α-synuclein protein was expressed and purified as described previously for tau protein (38Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32789-32795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), whereas non-tagged α-synuclein was prepared as in Antony et al. (31Antony T. Hoyer W. Cherny D. Heim G. Jovin T.M. Subramaniam V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3235-3240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) except that Mono Q chromatography was used as the anion exchange resin. Because these preparations behaved similarly in all assays described below, the His-tagged form was used for experimentation for ease of preparation. α-Synuclein Aggregation—Under standard conditions α-synuclein (4–70 μm) was aggregated in assembly buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for up to 44 h without agitation unless noted otherwise. Reactions were performed in the presence and absence of various aggregation inducers prepared by serial dilution of stock solutions. Control reactions were normalized for 1:1 H2O:isopropyl alcohol vehicle, which was limited to 5% in all reactions. Samples were processed for transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy assays as described below. Electron Microscopy Assay—Aliquots of α-synuclein aggregation reactions (50 μl) were removed, treated with 2% glutaraldehyde (final concentration), adsorbed onto Formvar/carbon-coated 300 mesh grids (1 min), and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate (1–2 min) as described previously (39King M.E. Ahuja V. Binder L.I. Kuret J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14851-14859Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Images were viewed in a Phillips CM 12 transmission electron microscope operated at 65 kV. Random images were captured on film at 22,000–100,000× magnification, digitized at 600 dots-per-inch resolution, and processed using Adobe Photoshop. Fluorescence Assay—α-Synuclein (4–70 μm) was aggregated at 37 °C in assembly buffer as described above except that the reactions contained 20 μm ThT. Resultant changes in fluorescence were monitored at λex = 440 nm and λem = 485 nm (40Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 41Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10737-10744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). To assay the degree of α-synuclein fibrillization under near equilibrium conditions, fluorescence was measured after 16 h of incubation in a FlexStation plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA). To assay fibrillization in real time, fluorescence was measured with continuous stirring at a constant rate for up to 44 h in a PTI fluorimeter (1-nm bandwidth, 800 V, gain 12.5, and slit 16). These reactions (4 ml) were initiated by the addition of 30–70 μl of C12H25SO4Na (20 mm). Kinetic Analysis—Fluorescence time courses were fit to the linear logistic differential equation (42Naiki H. Gejyo F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) log(Ft/(F∞ – Ft)) = mt + b, where Ft is the ThT fluorescence at time t, F∞ is the ThT fluorescence at equilibrium, and m and b are the slope and y intercept of each straight line. From these plots, the half-time to maximum fluorescence, t50, was determined as the time when log(Ft/(F∞ –Ft) = 0 (42Naiki H. Gejyo F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The apparent first order rate constant for growth of ThT fluorescence, kapp, was derived from the slope m, where kapp = m(ln 10), and reported in units of time–1. Lag times, which were defined as the time point where the tangent of the point of maximum polymerization rate intersected the abscissa of sigmoidal reaction progress curves (43Evans K.C. Berger E.P. Cho C.G. Weisgraber K.H. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), were calculated as t50 – 2τ, where τ = 1/kapp (44Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Vyas S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6036-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Both kapp and lag time are comparable with values calculated using integral logistic equations (44Nielsen L. Khurana R. Coats A. Frokjaer S. Brange J. Vyas S. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6036-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Although they are composite parameters unequal to underlying elementary rate constants, they are useful for purposes of comparison. Because α-synuclein fibrillization follows a nucleation-dependent mechanism (45Wood S.J. Wypych J. Steavenson S. Louis J.C. Citron M. Biere A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19509-19512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), lag time was assumed to reflect filament nucleation, whereas kapp was taken as the macroscopic rate constant for the entire filament population during the exponential phase of growth. CMC Measurements—Detergents or arachidonic acid suspended in assembly buffer at varying concentrations (1 μm–50 mm) were incubated 1 h in the presence of 10 μmN-phenyl-1-naphthylamine, after which fluorescence intensity was read directly in a PTI fluorimeter (λex = 346 nm; λem = 420 nm; 1-nm bandwidth, 800 V, gain 12.5, and slit 16) jacketed at 37 °C. When present, α-synuclein was maintained at 4 μm for the positively charged detergents and at 15 μm for the anionic detergents and arachidonic acid. CMCs were estimated from abscissa intercepts after least squares linear regression as described previously (46Brito R.M. Vaz W.L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and were expressed as CMC ± S.E. of the estimate. Only data points within 5-fold of the CMC were used to calculate CMC. Nomenclature—Polyoxyethylene detergents of formula CH3(CH2)y-O(CH2CH2)x-H are referred to as C(y+1)Ex, where y and x are the number of methylene and oxyethylene groups, respectively. Sodium alkyl sulfate detergents of structureO∥CH3(CH2)y-O-S-O-Na∥OStructure I and alkyl tetramethyl ammonium bromide detergents of structureCH3|CH3(CH2)y-N+-CH3•Br-|CH3Structure II are referred to by their full chemical formulas. Examples within each of these classes differed only in the number of methylene groups present (y). Efficient Induction of α-Synuclein Aggregation—Experimentation began with arachidonic acid because this fatty acid had been shown to induce α-synuclein oligomerization in vitro (37Perrin R.J. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41958-41962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Pilot electron microscopic assays showed that arachidonic acid did indeed induce the fibrillization of 4–70 μm recombinant α-synuclein after just 4 h of incubation at 37 °C without agitation (Fig. 1A). Filaments mostly had non-twisted morphology under these conditions, with widths varying from 5 to 14 nm (Fig. 1A). As α-synuclein concentrations were raised, however, significant numbers of twisted filaments with estimated widths of 12–20 nm were observed (Fig. 1B). In contrast, incubations with vehicle alone invariably produced few filaments over 16 h of incubation, even at 30 μm α-synuclein (Fig. 1C; see time course below). Together these data confirmed that arachidonic acid was an efficacious accelerator of α-synuclein fibrillization and that the resultant filaments were morphologically similar to both those obtained from protracted incubation of recombinant α-synuclein without inducer and to those found in disease tissue (6Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6469-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar, 7Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 22Conway K.A. Lee S.J. Rochet J.C. Ding T.T. Williamson R.E. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because arachidonic acid shares chemical properties with detergents, a series of ionic and nonionic synthetic detergents also were tested for the ability to induce recombinant α-synuclein polymerization. For purposes of comparison, the analysis included the established α-synuclein fibrillization inducer heparin (30Cohlberg J.A. Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1502-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Nonionic detergents tested included the polyoxyethylenes Tween 20, C8E4, C10E6, C10E8, C12E23, and C14E8, cationic detergents included C15H34BrN and C19H42BrN, zwitterionic detergents included zwittergent 3–16, and anionic detergents included alkyl sulfates containing 12–20 carbons. Of these only the anionic detergents were capable of inducing significant α-synuclein fibrillization (using both transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence aggregation assays) when tested at 25–5000 μm concentration for up to 16 h (Fig. 1D). Although heparin induced a small amount of fibrillization within 16 h as shown previously (30Cohlberg J.A. Li J. Uversky V.N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1502-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), the signal produced in the fluorescence assay was negligible relative to those obtained from anionic detergents and arachidonic acid (Fig. 2). Together these data showed that both straight alkyl chain anionic detergents and fatty acids (but not cationic or nonionic detergents) were strong inducers of α-synuclein fibrillization and far more efficacious than heparin. Mechanism of Detergent-mediated α-Synuclein Fibrillization—To assess potency, fibrillization activity of fatty acids and alkyl sulfates was quantified as a function of both inducer and α-synuclein concentrations. All resultant dose-response curves were biphasic (representative data from fluorescence assays are shown only for the anionic detergent C12H25SO4Na in Fig. 2). Some of the curves showed a clear abscissa intercept, which was especially pronounced for short-chain detergents. For C12H25SO4Na, this threshold was ∼100 μm, below which no fibrillization activity was detectable after 16 h of incubation (Fig. 2). Above this threshold concentration, maximal filament yield increased with increasing detergent concentration to an optimum and then decreased. The optimal detergent concentration depended on α-synuclein concentration (Fig. 2). Plots of optimal inducer concentration versus α-synuclein concentration were linear for arachidonic acid and all anionic detergents tested except C12H25SO4Na, showing that fibrillization efficiency depends on the detergent:α-synuclein ratio (Fig. 3). Under optimal detergent/α-synuclein ratios, the minimum α-synuclein concentration required to support measurable detergent-induced fibrillization (i.e. the x axis intercept) was between 1 and 2 μm for all inducers. These data suggest that the minimal concentration of α-synuclein required to support fibrillization is no greater than low micromolar under these conditions. Detergent-induced α-Synuclein Fibrillization Correlates with Micelle Formation—The molar ratio of detergent:α-synuclein yielding maximum activity differed for each detergent tested (Fig. 3). Replots of these data revealed a log-linear inverse relationship with alkyl chain length, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions were a major determinant of inducer potency (Fig. 4). To determine whether these hydrophobic interactions involved detergent micellization, CMC values for arachidonic acid and alkyl sulfate detergents were measured in the presence and absence of α-synuclein. Consistent with earlier observations (47Wilson D.M. Binder L.I. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 2181-2195PubMed Google Scholar) the CMC for arachidonic acid in assembly buffer alone was measured as 236 ± 12 μm, which was well above the concentration required for acceleration of α-synuclein fibrillization. When CMC was measured in assembly buffer complete with α-synuclein at 15 μm, however, the CMC decreased to 10.3 ± 4.8 μm. This magnitude of CMC depression is similar to that induced by tau protein (48Chirita C.N. Necula M. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25644-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These data show that fatty acids such as arachidonic acid aggregate to form micelles at much lower concentrations in the presence of α-synuclein than in its absence. These observations were extended to a series of alkyl sulfate detergents, which follow a log-linear relationship between CMC and alkyl chain length when analyzed in water (49Huibers P.D.T. Lobanov V.S. Katritzky A.R. Shah D.O. Karelson M. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1997; 187: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The slope of this relationship is proportional to the free energy contribution of transferring methylene groups from solvent to micelles (49Huibers P.D.T. Lobanov V.S. Katritzky A.R. Shah D.O. Karelson M. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1997; 187: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). When measured in the presence of assembly buffer (without α-synuclein), the relationship between log CMC and alkyl chain length remained linear but was depressed (relative to values measured in water) because of the presence of neutral electrolyte (100 mm NaCl) in the buffer (50Corrin M.L. Harkins W.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1947; 69: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The free energy of micelle formation per methylene group determined from the slope of this plot was 264 ± 65 kcal/mol (Fig. 5). When measured in assembly buffer complete with α-synuclein, however, CMC values depressed still further, so that they were one order of magnitude below values observed in buffer alone (Fig. 5). Yet the free energy of micelle formation per methylene group determined from the slope of this plot (237 ± 38 kcal/mol) was statistically indistinguishable (p < 0.05) from the value determined for assembly buffer alone. These data show that α-synuclein exerted a profound effect on the micellization of anionic detergents, that the micelles formed in the presence of α-synuclein resembled authentic micelles with respect to their free energies of formation, and that anionic micelles were present under all assembly conditions that yielded α-synuclein filaments (e.g.Fig. 1). Anionic Liposomes Induce α-Synuclein Fibrillization—To determine whether lipids could substitute for anionic detergents as fibrillization inducers, α-synuclein (5–50 μm) was incubated (4.5 h at 37 °C) with liposomes freshly prepared from 25–400 μm PS, PA, PC, PI, PIP, or PIP2 and analyzed using the electron microscopy assay. CMCs for these lipids in aqueous solution have been estimated in the nanomolar range (51King M.D. Marsh D. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1224-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), assuring that they were almost completely vesicular before incubation with α-synuclein protein. Examination of reaction products by electron microscopy showed the presence of vesicles and abundant filaments and/or filamentous conglomerates with the anionic liposomes composed of PS, PA, PI, PIP, and PIP2 (data for PS, PA, and PIP are"

The cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory activity of p27Kip1 is regulated by changes in its concentration and its subcellular localization. Several reports suggest that phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at serine 10, threonine 157, and threonine 187 regulate its localization. We have previously identified that carboxyl-terminal threonine 198 (Thr198) in p27Kip1 is a novel phosphorylation site and that Akt is associated with the phosphorylation at the site (Fujita, N., Sato, S., Katayama, K., and Tsuruo, T. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 28706-28713). We show herein that activation of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK kinase/MEK) pathway also regulates phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Thr198. MAPKs were not directly associated with p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Thr198, but the p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs) could bind to and directly phosphorylate p27Kip1 at Thr198 in a Ras/Raf/MEK-dependent manner. RSK-dependent phosphorylation promoted the p27Kip1 binding to 14-3-3 and its cytoplasmic localization. To prove the direct relationship between 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic localization, we constructed a p27Kip1-R18 fusion protein in which the R18 peptide was fused to the carboxyl-terminal region of p27Kip1. The R18 peptide is known to interact with 14-3-3 independent of phosphorylation. The p27Kip1-R18 distributed mainly in the cytosol, whereas mutant p27Kip1-R18 (p27Kip1-R18-K2) that had no 14-3-3 binding capability existed mainly in the nucleus. These results indicate that RSKs play a crucial role in cell cycle progression through translocation of p27Kip1, in addition to Akt, to the cytoplasm in a phosphorylationand 14-3-3 binding-dependent manner.

Such CDK activities are regulated by association with cyclins and small CDK inhibitors, including the INK4 family (p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d) and the CIP/KIP family (p21Waf1/Cip1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2) (1.Sherr C.J.

In many human cancers, reduced p27Kip1 expression is frequently observed, and this reduction is reported to correlate with tumor progression and poor patient survival (4.Slingerland J. Pagano M. J.

Thus, p27Kip1 may play a crucial role in tumor suppression by inhibiting abnormal cell cycle progression. cyclin-dependent kinase bromodeoxyuridine mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 wild type constitutively active 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase. The expression of p27Kip1 is transcriptionally and post-translationally regulated. The phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway negatively regulate p27Kip1 transcription via Forkhead transcription factors (8.Medema R.H. Kops G.J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M.

The protein's nuclear import depends on its nuclear localization signal near the carboxyl terminus and its association with nuclear pore-associated protein 60 (25.Zeng Y. Hirano K. Hirano M.

The nuclear export of p27Kip1 was mediated by interaction with the fifth component of the COP9 signalosome complex Jab1-CSN5 (27.Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J.

Recently, human kinase-interacting stathmin and Akt were identified as being responsible for Ser10 phosphorylation (32.Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M.F. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G.J. Nabel E.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 33.Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We have identified carboxyl-terminal Thr198 as a novel Akt-dependent phosphorylation site (33.Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation at the Thr198 residue promoted p27Kip1 binding to 14-3-3 and the Thr198-phosphorylated p27Kip1 dominantly localized in the cytoplasm, phosphorylation at Thr198 might also be associated with p27Kip1 cytoplasmic localization. In addition to the Akt-dependent pathway, the pathway to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was found to affect p27Kip1 regulation. Activation of the MAPK pathway was known to be associated with the nuclear export of p27Kip1 (34.Delmas C. Aragou N. Poussard S. Cottin P. Darbon J.M. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12443-12451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although MAPK has shown to phosphorylate p27Kip1 directly (35.Kawada M. Yamagoe S. Murakami Y. Suzuki K. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), Ser10 and Thr187 phosphorylation have not appeared as key events regulating p27Kip1 localization (34.Delmas C. Aragou N. Poussard S. Cottin P. Darbon J.M. Manenti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12443-12451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We then studied whether Thr198 phosphorylation was involved in p27Kip1 nuclear export. We found that activating the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway induced p27Kip1 phosphorylation at the Thr198 residue. Interestingly, MAPKs themselves were rarely involved in Ras/Raf/MEK-dependent phosphorylation at Thr198. We identified p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinases (RSKs; also known as MAPK-activated protein kinases, MAPKAP-K1/K2) as the kinase necessary for Thr198 phosphorylation. RSK-dependent phosphorylation induced 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic localization of p27Kip1 through a Thr198 phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. To prove the direct relationship between 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic localization of p27Kip1, we constructed a p27Kip1 protein fused to the R18 peptide. The R18 peptide has been reported to bind to 14-3-3 independent of phosphorylation (36.Wang B. Yang H. Liu Y.C. Jelinek T. Zhang L. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The p27Kip1-R18 fusion protein was localized mainly in cytoplasm, whereas the mutant p27Kip1-R18-K2, which had no 14-3-3 binding capability, localized mainly in the nucleus. These results indicate that RSKs promote 14-3-3 binding to p27Kip1 by phosphorylation at the Thr198 residue, allowing its cytoplasmic localization. Reagents and Cell Culture Conditions—The recombinant active rat RSK1, active mouse Rsk2 (Y707A), and active human Akt1 proteins were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). LY294002 and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate were purchased from Sigma. PD98059 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Our previously identified PDK1 inhibitor UCN-01 was kindly provided by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan) (37.Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T.

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human lung cancer A549 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid Construction—The constitutively active (CA) human akt1 (E40K) in a pHM6 vector (Roche Applied Science), WT and mutant human p27Kip1 in a pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Sigma), and human WT 14-3-3θ, -β, -ζ, -η, and -ϵ in a pHM6 vector were established in our laboratory (33.Fujita N.

The pFLAG-CMV-2 vector containing a p27Kip1-R18(Asp) chimera was established by generating an EcoRV site at the 3′ end of p27Kip1 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and by ligating the R18 peptide-coding sequence (36.Wang B. Yang H. Liu Y.C. Jelinek T. Zhang L. Ruoslahti E. Fu H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12499-12504Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) to the EcoRV site. Because generation of the EcoRV site led to the conversion of a carboxyl-terminal threonine codon to an aspartic acid codon, we further mutated the aspartic acid codon to an alanine codon to generate the p27Kip1-R18. The codons of both aspartic acid 12 and glutamic acid 14 in the R18 peptide-coding sequence were further converted to lysine codons to make a p27Kip1-R18 chimera with no binding capability to the 14-3-3 protein (p27Kip1-R18(Asp)-K2 and p27Kip1-R18-K2) (36.Wang B.

Mouse WT MAPK2 cDNA was amplified by PCR with a pUSEamp-mouse MAPK2 plasmid (Upstate Biotechnology) in which the internal EcoRI site had been mutated, and the EcoRI-EcoRI fragment of the cDNA was subcloned into a pHM6 vector. Human full-length WT PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome 10) cDNA (WT PTEN) was generated by PCR with an NIH/MGC clone (MGC ID3937787) as the template (43.Strausberg R.L.

Human WT 14-3-3σ cDNA was obtained by PCR with an NIH/MGC clone (MGC ID2822397) as the template (43.Strausberg R.L. Feingold E.A. Klausner R.D. Collins F.S. Science. 1999; 286: 455-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The PCR products were cloned into a pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Then PTEN and 14-3-3σ cDNAs were subcloned into a pFLAG-CMV-2 or a pHM6 vector. All plasmid DNAs used for transfection were purified with an EndoFree Qiagen plasmid Maxi kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Transient Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) or LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (47.Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In some experiments, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated using an NE-PER extraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Endogenous p27Kip1 was immunoprecipitated with protein A-agarose that had been conjugated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to p27Kip1 (MBL, Tokyo, Japan). For Western blot analysis, we used the following: antibodies to phospho-Akt (Thr308), MEK1, or Ras (Upstate Biotechnology); antibodies to Akt or phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate (Cell Signaling Technology); antibodies to p27Kip1 or Topoisomerase IIβ (BD Biosciences, Lexington, KY); antibodies to MAPK, 14-3-3β (H-8), phospho-p27Kip1 (Ser10), or GST (B-14) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); an antibody to phospho-p27Kip1 (Thr187) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA); an antibody to phospho-MAPK (pTEpY) (Promega, Madison, WI); an antibody to HA tag (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science); or an antibody to FLAG tag (clone M2; Sigma). Subsequently, membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. After washing several times, the membranes were developed with an ECL system, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Purification of Recombinant GST-tagged p27Kip1 Protein—Cultures of Escherichia coli containing a pGEX-6P-3 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) encoding WT p27Kip1 cDNA were induced for 2 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C with shaking (39.Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39360-39367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, and recombinant proteins were purified using GST purification modules according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Phosphorylation of p27Kip1 Protein—GST-tagged p27Kip1 protein was incubated with recombinant active RSK1, active RSK2, or active Akt in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm MOPS, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 112.5 μm ATP, and 17 mm magnesium chloride) at 30 °C for2hinthe presence or absence of 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were electrophoresed and the levels of incorporated radioactivity were visualized and quantified with a BAS1000 Bio-Imaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The reactions were also electrophoresed and immunoblotted using antibodies to GST, phospho-p27Kip1 (Ser10), phospho-p27Kip1 (Thr187), or phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate. Immunostaining—293T cells were transfected with a pFLAG-CMV-2 vector encoding the p27Kip1-R18 or p27Kip-R18-K2. After transfection for 24 h, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in medium containing 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma) and 1 μm fluorodeoxyuridine. After washing, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 18 h at 23 °C. After blocking, we incubated the cells with anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:250 dilution; Sigma) for 1 h, washed them with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated them with Oregon Green-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:500 dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h. After washing, we denatured the DNA by treatment with 4 n HCl for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed twice and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:100 dilution; Sigma) for 1 h, rinsed, and incubated with rhodamine red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:500 dilution; Molecular Probes) for 1 h. After washing, we visualized cells using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX-70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CCD camera. Involvement of the Ras/MEK Pathway in p27Kip1 Phosphorylation at Threonine 198 —We previously identified a novel phosphorylation site, carboxyl-terminal Thr198, in p27Kip1 (33.Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Serine/threonine kinase Akt was able to phosphorylate the site. To confirm the role of Akt-mediated phosphorylation, we transfected WT and mutant PTEN cDNAs to suppress Akt kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, WT PTEN expression almost perfectly down-regulated the phospho-Thr308-Akt level (third panel, lane 3). However, the p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Thr198 that could be detected by an anti-phospho-Akt substrate antibody (33.Fujita N. Sato S. Katayama K. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28706-28713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) was not completely suppressed. This result suggests that other kinases might also be associated with p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Thr198. Expression of C124S- or G129R-PTEN without lipid phosphatase activity (44.Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar, 45.Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T.

Stolarov J.P. Hemmings B.A. Wigler M.H. Downes C.P. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13513-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) had no effect on either phospho-Akt or phospho-p27Kip1 level (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). We further checked the role of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway in p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Thr198 by treating cells with PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Consistent with the PTEN transfection assay, LY294002 down-regulated but could not perfectly suppress p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Thr198 (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Interestingly, treatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 also reduced phospho-p27Kip1 level without affecting p27Kip1 expression (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Therefore, MEKs might be involved in the p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Thr198. When FLAG-tagged p27Kip1 was co-transfected with the active form of H-ras, p27Kip1 was phosphorylated at the Thr198 residue (Fig. 1C). Because transfection of the active form of MEK1 could more effectively phosphorylate p27Kip1 at Thr198 than WT MEK1 (Fig. 1C), we found both the PI3K-Akt pathway and the Ras/MEK1 pathway to be involved in p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Thr198. Critical Role of RSKs for p27Kip1 Phosphorylation at Threonine 198 —MAPK has been reported to directly phosphorylate p27Kip1 (35.Kawada M. Yamagoe S. Murakami Y. Suzuki K. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), so we examined whether MAPK was also associated with p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Thr198 by transfecting WT p27Kip1 together with MAPK. In some experiments, the active form of MEK1 was further transfected to activate MAPK. As shown in Fig. 1C, transfection of the active form of MEK1 increased the amount of phospho-p27Kip1 (Thr198). However, transfection of MAPK could promote p27Kip1 phosphorylation only slightly, even when MAPK was activated by cotransfection with the active form of MEK1 (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Moreover, in vitro incubation of active MAPK and p27Kip1 revealed that MAPK provided only trace levels of Thr198 phosphorylation (data not shown). These results suggest that the Ras/MEK cascade was involved in p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Thr198 although MAPK itself was not. PDK1 inhibitor UCN-01 (37.Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) could almost perfectly down-regulated the phospho-p27Kip1 (Thr198) level (Fig. 1B, lane 6). We hypothesized that RSKs were involved in p27Kip1 phosphorylation, because both MAPK and PDK1 are essential for RSK activation (48.Jensen C.J. Buch M.B. Krag T.O. Hemmings B.A. Gammeltoft S. Frodin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27168-27176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As expected, transfection of RSK1 or RSK2 together with the active form of MEK1 dramatically enhanced the phospho-p27Kip1 (Thr198) level (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6), whereas transfection of RSK1 or RSK2 alone could not induce the p27Kip1 phosphorylation (lanes 7 and 8). To check whether kinase activity of RSK1 was essential for p27Kip1 phosphorylation, we generated a kinase-dead form of RSK1 by converting Asp205 to Asn (D205N-RSK1) (42.Schouten G.J. Vertegaal A.C. Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Toebes M. Dorsman J.C. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3133-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Transfection of D205N-RSK1 together with the active form of MEK1 did not induce p27Kip1 phosphorylation at Thr198 (Fig. 2C, lane 2), although WT RSK1 together with the active form of MEK1 did (lane 3). Therefore, we determined kinase activity of RSKs to be essential for p27Kip1 phosphorylation. We then examined RSK binding to p27Kip1 and found that RSK1 and RSK2 were co-immunoprecipitated with p27Kip1 (Fig. 2D, lanes 5 and 6). These results suggest that RSKs interact directly with and phosphorylate p27Kip1in vivo. RSKs Directly Phosphorylate p27Kip1 at Threonine 198 and Serine 10 Residues—Thus, we sought to determine whether p27Kip1 was directly phosphorylated by RSKs. When the GST-tagged WT p27Kip1 was incubated in vitro with the recombinant active RSK1 or RSK2, p27Kip1 was phosphorylated (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). This result indicates that p27Kip1 is one of the substrates of RSKs. We then checked the phosphorylation site of p27Kip1 by Western blot analysis using anti-phosphop27Kip1 antibodies. Fig. 3B shows that p27Kip1 was phosphorylated by RSK1 at the Thr198 and Ser10 residues (top and second panels). As we have previously reported, Akt also phosphorylated p27Kip1 at Thr198 and Ser10"
https://openalex.org/W2087067449,"Cdc42 is a Ras-related protein that has been implicated in the control of normal cell growth, and when improperly regulated, in cellular transformation and invasiveness. A variety of extracellular stimuli, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), activate Cdc42. Here, we show that activation of Cdc42 protects the EGF receptor from the negative regulatory activity of the c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase. Activated Cdc42 binds to p85Cool-1 (for cloned-out-of-library)/beta-Pix (for Pak-interactive exchange factor), a protein that directly associates with c-Cbl. This inhibits the binding of Cbl by the EGF receptor and thus prevents Cbl from catalyzing receptor ubiquitination. The role played by Cdc42 in regulating the timing of EGF receptor-Cbl interactions is underscored by the fact that constitutively active Cdc42(F28L), by persistently blocking the binding of Cbl to these receptors, leads to their aberrant accumulation and sustained EGF-stimulated ERK activation, thus resulting in cellular transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2004351850,"Tuba is a novel scaffold protein that functions to bring together dynamin with actin regulatory proteins. It is concentrated at synapses in brain and binds dynamin selectively through four N-terminal Src homology-3 (SH3) domains.

Direct binding partners include N-WASP and Ena/VASP proteins. Forced targeting of the C-terminal SH3 domain to the mitochondrial surface can promote accumulation of F-actin around mitochondria. A Dbl homology domain present in the middle of Tuba upstream of a Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain activates Cdc42, but not Rac and Rho, and may thus cooperate with the C terminus of the protein in regulating actin assembly. The BAR domain, a lipid-binding module, may functionally replace the pleckstrin homology domain that typically follows a Dbl homology domain.

Fission of clathrin-coated and other endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane involves the cooperation of several membrane-associated proteins, among which the GTPase dynamin plays a key role (1.Conner S.D.

Amphiphysin has a three-domain structure with an evolutionarily conserved N-terminal module of ∼250 amino acids called the Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) 1The abbreviations used are: BARBin/amphiphysin/RvsSH3Src homology-3DHDbl homologyPHpleckstrin homologyHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsmant-N-methylanthraniloyl-MALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: BARBin/amphiphysin/RvsSH3Src homology-3DHDbl homologyPHpleckstrin homologyHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferaseRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsmant-N-methylanthraniloyl-MALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein. domain, a variable central region, and a C-terminal Src homology-3 (SH3) domain that binds dynamin. Endophilin has a similar domain structure (2.Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Although the N-terminal domain of endophilin is substantially divergent in amino acid composition from the BAR domain of amphiphysin, it shares some similarity at critical sites, leading to its classification as a BAR domain (8.Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). 2See smart.embl-heidelberg.de/smart/get_members.pl?WHAT=NRDB_COUNT&NAME=BAR.2See smart.embl-heidelberg.de/smart/get_members.pl?WHAT=NRDB_COUNT&NAME=BAR. Accordingly, the BAR domains of amphiphysin and endophilin share functional similarities because they both can bind and deform lipid bilayers and mediate homo- and heterodimerization (6.Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 8.Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J.

Dynamin also can bind and deform lipid bilayers, and it has been proposed that endophilin and amphiphysin might help to recruit and possibly assist dynamin in the generation of membrane curvature at endocytic pits (8.Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 10.Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar).The closest homologue of amphiphysin and endophilin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is Rvs167, that forms a stable heterodimer with Rsv161; Rvs167 has a domain structure like amphiphysin, whereas Rvs161 (homologous to the mammalian protein Bin3) possesses only a BAR domain. Mutation of either one or both components of this heterodimer in yeast produces defects in endocytosis and actin function (11.Lombardi R. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6016-6022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such a dual phenotype is typical of most mutations in actin regulatory and endocytosis genes in yeast (12.Munn A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1535: 236-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These observations, together with results from a variety of studies in mammalian cells, have suggested a link between endocytosis and actin, although such a link has remained mechanistically elusive (13.Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F111-F116Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 14.Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Foci of actin can often be seen at endocytic sites (15.Merrifield C.J. Feldman M.E. Wan L. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), and endocytic vesicles with actin tails have also been observed (16.Merrifield C.J. Moss S.E. Ballestrem C. Imhof B.A. Giese G. Wunderlich I. Almers W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these actin tails contain both dynamin and dynamin-interacting proteins (17.Lee E. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18.Orth J.D. Krueger E.W. Cao H. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).Several binding partners of dynamin are either physically or functionally linked to actin or actin regulatory proteins. These include, among others, syndapin/pacsin and intersectin/DAP160 (13.Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F111-F116Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 14.Schafer D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Intersectin, in particular, represents a striking example of a multidomain protein that links dynamin to proteins that directly or indirectly control actin polymerization, such as the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphatase, synaptojanin, N-WASP (neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein), and the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 (19.Hussain N.K. Jenna S. Glogauer M. Quinn C.C. Wasiak S. Guipponi M. Antonarakis S.E. Kay B.K. Stossel T.P. Lamarche-Vane N. McPherson P.S. Nat.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19108-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). N-WASP is a member of the WASP superfamily of proteins that includes SCAR/WAVE. All members of this family possess a conserved C terminus that can bind to and activate the Arp2/3 complex, a collection of proteins that catalyzes the nucleation of actin filaments (21.Mullins R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). N-WASP exists predominantly in an autoinhibited state. When activated Cdc42 or the adaptor protein Nck binds to N-WASP, this autoinhibition is relieved. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate can further activate N-WASP in combination with Cdc42 and Nck (22.Rohatgi R. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 23.Rohatgi R. Nollau P. Ho H.Y. Kirschner M.W. Mayer B.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Intersectin functions to bring together N-WASP and, through the guanyl nucleotide exchange activity of its Dbl homology (DH) domain, activated GTP-bound Cdc42, thus activating Arp2/3 and promoting actin nucleation (19.Hussain N.K. Jenna S. Glogauer M. Quinn C.C. Wasiak S. Guipponi M. Antonarakis S.E. Kay B.K. Stossel T.P. Lamarche-Vane N. McPherson P.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The endocytic protein syndapin/pacsin, which, like intersectin, binds both dynamin and N-WASP, can promote N-WASP-dependent actin nucleation (25.Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6083-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, intersectin and syndapin function as molecular links between endocytosis and actin assembly.The Arp2/3 complex plays a key role in generating actin-based protrusive forces that can drive the movement of vesicles and intracellular pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes (26.Welch M.D. Rosenblatt J. Skoble J. Portnoy D.A. Mitchison T.J. Science. 1998; 281: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Members of the Ena (Enabled)/VASP (vaodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) protein family (Mena (mammalian Enabled), VASP, and EVL (Ena-VASP-like)) greatly accelerate the actin-based movement of Listeria (27.Laurent V. Loisel T.P. Harbeck B. Wehman A. Grobe L. Jockusch B.M. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 28.Geese M. Loureiro J.J.

Ena/VASP proteins are concentrated in the tips of filopodia and lamellipodia and are known to regulate actin filament geometry in protruding lamellipodia (29.Bear J.E. Svitkina T.M. Krause M. Schafer D.A. Loureiro J.J. Strasser G.A. Maly I.V. Chaga O.Y. Cooper J.A. Borisy G.G. Gertler F.B.

At a molecular level, Ena/VASP proteins are thought to antagonize the activity of capping proteins, thereby permitting increased actin filament elongation at barbed ends and decreasing the density of branched structures by an unknown mechanism (29.Bear J.E.

In most of these proteins, which generally contain a C-terminal SH3 domain, the BAR domain is located in the N terminus. However, in three homologous vertebrate sequences, the BAR domain is not located at the N terminus, but is instead found downstream of a DH domain. Most DH modules characterized thus far are located upstream of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and the lipid-binding properties of the PH domain are thought to play a critical role in the localization and regulation of DH domain activity (32.Rossman K.L. Cheng L. Mahon G.M. Rojas R.J. Snyder J.T. Whitehead I.P. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18393-18400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have characterized one of these three proteins, which we have named Tuba. In an independent line of study, we identified the mouse homolog of Tuba in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the Ena/VASP protein EVL as bait. Collectively, our study demonstrates that Tuba is a large scaffold protein that binds dynamin and a variety of actin regulatory proteins and that activates Cdc42. Our results suggest that Tuba functions as in important link between dynamin function, Rho GTPase signaling, and actin dynamics regulated by WASP/WAVE superfamily and Ena/VASP proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Reagents—The following antibodies were used in this study: rat anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal epitope (clone 3F10, Roche Applied Science), anti-dynamin polyclonal antibody DG1 (our laboratory) and monoclonal antibody Hudy-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-amphiphysin-1 monoclonal antibody-3 (33.Floyd S.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8104-8110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and anti-N-WASP polyclonal antibody (gifts of P. Aspenstrom (Ludvig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) and M. W. Kirschner (Harvard Medical School)), anti-CR16 polyclonal antibody (gift of H. Y. Ho and M. W. Kirschner), anti-WAVE1 polyclonal antibody (gift of John Scott, Vollum Institute), anti-Mena monoclonal antibody (our laboratory), anti-green fluorescent protein polyclonal antibody (Clontech), anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-synaptotagmin monoclonal antibody (gift of Reinhard Jahn, Max-Planck Institute for Biological Chemistry, Göttingen, Germany), and anti-GM-130 antibody (Graham Warren, Yale University). Anti-Tuba polyclonal antibodies were generated by injecting rabbits with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein encompassing the final 292 amino acids of human Tuba. The antibodies were affinity-purified on the antigen coupled to SulfoLink beads (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A GST fusion protein of the PH domain of phospholipase Cδ was kind gift of Antonella De Matteis (Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Italy). A GST fusion protein of the BAR domain of amphiphysin-1 was described previously (10.Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The KIAA1010 clone was obtained from the Kazusa Institute. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—To obtain the full-length sequence of Tuba from the KIAA1010 clone, human skeletal muscle Marathon-Ready cDNAs (Clontech) were utilized for 5′-RACE using KIAA1010-specific primers and the Advantage 2 PCR enzyme system (Clontech). Based on this sequence, a full-length clone was generated by PCR using probes corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the Tuba sequence and human brain Marathon-Ready cDNAs (Clontech) as a template. Nucleotide sequencing confirmed the sequences of KIAA1010 and of the N-terminal region of the protein obtained by 5′-RACE with the exception of the absence in KIAA1010 of 40 amino acids in the second half of the BAR domain (see Fig. 1A). Multiple clones generated by PCR in different amplification cycles yielded only sequences including the 40 amino acids. The nucleotide sequence of human Tuba has been deposited in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank under accession number AY196211.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Full-length EVL was used as bait in the LexA two-hybrid system (Clontech) to probe an embryonic day 19 mouse library. Two independent clones of Tuba comprising amino acids 1502–1577 and 1092–1577 (see Fig. 1A) were identified as strong interactors. Full-length murine Tuba was constructed by ligating the larger of the two clones with fragments generated by reverse transcription-PCR using Tuba-specific primers and a mouse cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence of mouse Tuba has been deposited in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank under accession number AY383729.Affinity Chromatography—GST or GST fusion proteins of SH3 domain-containing regions of Tuba were bound to glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with a Triton X-100-solubilized rat brain extract. Bound material was recovered by centrifugation, followed by elution with SDS and separation by SDS-PAGE.For biochemical analysis of the interaction of the SH3-6 domain of Tuba with actin regulatory proteins in non-neuronal cell extracts, D7 fibroblastic cells, which lack endogenous expression of all Ena/VASP proteins, were used (34.Bear J.E. Loureiro J.J. Libova I. Fassler R. Wehland J. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Uninfected or infected D7 cells were grown to confluency and extracted in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation and used for affinity chromatography experiments as described above. 10–15 μg of GST or GST fusion protein was incubated with 1 mg of lysate.Immunocytochemistry of Brain Tissue—Immunofluorescence of frozen rat brain sections was performed by standard procedures on formaldehyde-perfused brains. Anti-Tuba immunogold labeling was performed on lysed synaptosomes embedded in agarose, followed by Epon embedding and thin sectioning as described (35.De Camilli P. Harris Jr., S.M. Huttner W.B. Greengard P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1355-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar).Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assays—Exchange assays using bacterially expressed and purified Rho GTPases were performed essentially as described (36.Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In particular, 2 μm RhoA(C190S), Rac1(C188S), or Cdc42(C188S) was added to buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 400 nm mant-GTP (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and allowed to equilibrate for 5 min before adding the indicated concentrations of His-tagged Tuba DH domain or 200 nm His-tagged Vav2 DH-PH fragment. Increased fluorescence indicative of mant-GTP binding to GTPases was monitored using a PerkinElmer LS-55 spectrophotometer (λex = 360 nm and λem = 440 nm, slits = 5/5 nm) thermostatted to 25 °C. Fluorescence was normalized to the initial value at the start of the experiment. A fragment containing the DH and BAR domains of Tuba is insoluble upon expression in Escherichia coli, preventing a comparison of exchange rates between this larger portion of Tuba and the isolated DH domain of Tuba.Transferrin Uptake—Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with pcHA (pcDNA3-based vector)-full-length Tuba or pcHA-Tuba SH3-1,2,3,4 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and incubated overnight. They were then washed with serum-free medium and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h in the presence of Alexa-transferrin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) during the last 7 min before a brief wash with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by fixation with 4% formaldehyde. Cells were stained by immunofluorescence according to standard procedures.Peptide Binding—Overlapping SPOTs peptides corresponding to the proline-rich regions of mouse N-WASP (amino acids 217–399), SCAR/WAVE1 (amino acids 274–402), EVL (amino acids 157–210), and Mena (amino acids 277–351) were custom-synthesized by Sigma. All peptides are 12-mers offset by three amino acids, and each spot carries an equivalent amount of peptide (5 nmol) covalently attached to the membrane. A negative control peptide was added (no. 118 on the blot) that contains a known proline-rich binding site for Ena/VASP proteins that does not bind SH3 domains. The Tuba SH3-6 domain in pGEX-2TK was labeled by phosphorylating with protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP. The relative intensity of each spot was calculated by converting the PhosphorImager scan into an 8-bit image and measuring the average pixel intensity in a 74-pixel circle centered over each spot in Scion Image. This value was then divided by the background (the average intensity value of the 10 lowest spots) for comparison.Mitochondrial Targeting of the Tuba SH3-6 Domain—The mouse Tuba SH3-6 domain was fused in-frame to a modified retroviral expression vector downstream of an ATG start codon and upstream of a fusion between DsRed2 and the mitochondrial targeting sequence from the L. monocytogenes protein ActA (excluding Ena/VASP-binding regions) (37.Pistor S. Chakraborty T. Niebuhr K. Domann E. Wehland J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This construct, referred to as SH3-6-mito, was used to transiently transfect CAD cells. Cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips 24 h post-transfection. The medium was replaced with serum-free medium to induce differentiation 3–4 h after plating. Cells were incubated for an additional 24–36 h before fixation with 4% formaldehyde. Previously established procedures were used to visualize cells by immunofluorescence.Miscellaneous—We carried out Western and Northern blotting following standard procedures. For Northern blotting, human multipletissue RNA blots were obtained from Clontech. For multiple-tissue Western blotting, tissues were isolated and prepared as described previously (38.McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Far-Western assays and gel overlays were carried out using standard procedures. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (38.McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar).RESULTSTuba Is a Novel BAR Domain-containing Protein—A BLAST search for proteins containing a domain related to the BAR domain of amphiphysin-1 revealed a large number of sequences. In one (KIAA1010), the putative BAR domain is not located at the N terminus of the protein as in most other sequences, but downstream of a DH domain (Fig. 1A). Although the overall homology to the amphiphysin-1 BAR domain is limited (24% identical and 39% similar) (Fig. 1B), similarities are concentrated in regions generally conserved among the Bin/amphiphysin family. This region in KIAA1010 is currently identified as a BAR domain by protein module-recognizing algorithms such as those of the Pfam and SMART programs.We undertook 5′-RACE using human cDNAs from muscle and brain to isolate a full-length protein corresponding to KIAA1010. This protein, which we have named Tuba in line with the tradition of naming large synaptic proteins after musical instruments (39.Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Appeltauer U. Takei K. Kindler S. Veh R.W. De Camilli P. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar), comprises 1577 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 178 kDa. The corresponding gene is located on human chromosome 10. The domain structure of Tuba (Fig. 1A) includes four N-terminal SH3 domains (referred to as SH3-1, SH3-2, SH3-3, and SH3-4), a predicted coiled-coil domain, a DH domain, the BAR domain, and two additional C-terminal SH3 domains (SH3-5 and SH3-6). In addition, a proline-rich low complexity region containing putative SH3 domain-binding sites is present upstream of the coiled-coil region (Fig. 1A).In an independent line of study, a yeast two-hybrid screen aimed at identifying ligands for the Ena/VASP family protein EVL from an embryonic mouse library led to the isolation of two independent clones highly homologous to the C terminus of KIAA1010 (Fig. 1A) (data not shown). Reverse transcription-PCR using an embryonic mouse cDNA library was carried out to obtain the full-length gene, which turned out to be the mouse ortholog of Tuba. Mouse Tuba is 70% identical and 77% similar to human Tuba, has a similar domain structure, and is encoded by a gene located on mouse chromosome 19.Searches through genomic and expressed sequence tag data bases revealed numerous expressed sequence tags to two genes that encode proteins homologous to the C-terminal half of Tuba in both human and mouse. We have named these proteins Tuba2 and Tuba3 (Fig. 1A). Tuba2 is located on human chromosome 4 and mouse chromosome 3, and Tuba3 is located on human chromosome 5 and mouse chromosome 8. Tuba2 is 41% identical and 60% similar to Tuba, and Tuba3 is 25% identical and 41% similar to Tuba. Tuba2 is 31% identical and 48% similar to Tuba3. Recent searches have also revealed what appears to be an alternately spliced form of Tuba that is similar in structure to Tuba2 and Tuba3 (Fig. 1A).A putative ortholog of Tuba, GEI-18 (GEX interactor-18), was identified in Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 1A) (40.Tsuboi D. Qadota H. Kasuya K. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two alternate transcripts of GEI-18 are described that comprise the N- and C-terminal halves of the protein. Although not recognized by Pfam or SMART, the region C-terminal of the DH domain in GEI-18 appears to be very similar to a BAR domain. A comparison of the BAR domains of the Tuba family of proteins with each other and human amphiphysin-1 is shown in Fig. 1B.Tuba Is Ubiquitous—Northern blot analysis of human tissues with a probe corresponding to the C terminus of Tuba (nucleotides 4035–4540) revealed two transcripts of 7.3 and 6 kb (Fig. 2A) whose levels varied in different tissues. A probe directed against the N-terminal half of the protein (nucleotides 1246–1696) recognized only the larger transcript (data not shown). A third transcript of 4.5 kb was observed in a number of mouse tissues with a larger probe corresponding to the C terminus of mouse Tuba (nucleotides 2971–4742) (data not shown). This Tuba mRNA likely encodes only the second half of the protein, i.e. a Tuba splice variant similar in domain structure to the homologous proteins Tuba2 and Tuba3 (Fig. 1A). When tested by Western blotting against various rat tissues, affinity-purified antibodies generated against the C terminus of Tuba recognized a band at the expected molecular mass of full-length Tuba (∼180 kDa). The band was the strongest in testis, followed by brain, heart, liver, spleen, and lung. In addition, the same antibodies recognized lower molecular mass bands at ∼105 and 75 kDa with differential tissue distribution that may represent alternatively spliced forms of Tuba or proteolytic C-terminal fragments (Fig. 2B). The 75-kDa band may also represent cross-reactivity of the antibodies against either Tuba2 or Tuba3, whose molecular masses are predicted to be in this range. Collectively, these data indicate that Tuba has a broad tissue distribution and may exist in multiple isoforms.Fig. 2Ubiquitous expression of Tuba transcripts and their protein products.A, multiple-tissue Northern blot using a probe directed against the 3′-end of Tuba.

High fat diets induce diabetes and arterial calcification in male low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) -/- mice; calcification occurs via Msx2 signaling that promotes the osteogenic differentiation of arterial myofibroblasts. We studied regulation of arterial osteogenesis by human parathyroid hormone (PTH) (1-34) (also called teriparatide) in LDLR -/- mice fed diabetogenic diets for 4 weeks. LDLR -/- mice were treated with vehicle or 0.4 mg/kg of PTH(1-34) subcutaneously five times/week. Gene expression was determined from single aortas and hind limb RNA by fluorescence reverse transcription-PCR. Valve calcification was determined by histological staining of cardiac sections using image analysis to quantify valve leaflet mineralization. PTH(1-34) increased bone mineral content (by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) in LDLR -/- mice, with induction of osseous osteopontin (OPN) expression and serum OPN levels (>150 nM); PTH(1-34) did not significantly change serum glucose, lipids, body weight, or fat mass. PTH(1-34) suppressed aortic OPN and Msx2 expression >50% and decreased cardiac valve calcification 80% (8.3 +/- 1.5% versus 1.4 +/- 0.5%; p < 0.001). Of the known circulating regulators of vascular calcification (OPN, osteoprotegerin, and leptin), PTH(1-34) regulated only serum OPN. We therefore studied actions of PTH(1-34) and OPN in vitro on cells induced to mineralize with Msx2. OPN (5-50 nM) reversed Msx2-induced mineralization. PTH(1-34) inhibited mineralization by 40% and down-regulated Msx2 in aortic myofibroblasts. PTH(1-34) inhibits vascular calcification and aortic osteogenic differentiation via direct actions and potentially via circulating OPN. PTH(1-34) exerts beneficial actions at early stages of macrovascular disease responses to diabetes and dyslipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W2090277550,"Photosystem I of higher plants is characterized by a typically long wavelength fluorescence emission associated to its light-harvesting complex I moiety. The origin of these low energy chlorophyll spectral forms was investigated by using site-directed mutagenesis of Lhca1–4 genes and in vitro reconstitution into recombinant pigment-protein complexes. We showed that the red-shifted absorption originates from chlorophyll-chlorophyll (Chl) excitonic interactions involving Chl A5 in each of the four Lhca antenna complexes. An essential requirement for the presence of the red-shifted absorption/fluorescence spectral forms was the presence of asparagine as a ligand for the Chl a chromophore in the binding site A5 of Lhca complexes. In Lhca3 and Lhca4, which exhibit the most red-shifted red forms, its substitution by histidine maintains the pigment binding and, yet, the red spectral forms are abolished. Conversely, in Lhca1, having very low amplitude of red forms, the substitution of Asn for His produces a red shift of the fluorescence emission, thus confirming that the nature of the Chl A5 ligand determines the correct organization of chromophores leading to the excitonic interaction responsible for the red-most forms. The red-shifted fluorescence emission at 730 nm is here proposed to originate from an absorption band at ∼700 nm, which represents the low energy contribution of an excitonic interaction having the high energy band at 683 nm. Because the mutation does not affect Chl A5 orientation, we suggest that coordination by Asn of Chl A5 holds it at the correct distance with Chl B5.

Photosystem I is a multisubunit pigment-protein complex of the chloroplast membrane acting as a plastocyanin/ferredoxin oxido-reductase in oxygenic photosynthesis.

Although these spectral forms account for only a small percentage of the total absorption, their effect in the energy transfer and trapping of PSI is very prominent (1.Gobets B. van Grondelle R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1057: 80-99Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar), with at least 80% of excitation in the complex transiting through them on their way to P700 (2.Croce R. Zucchelli G. Garlaschi F.M. Bassi R. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8572-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It has been widely proposed that these forms represent the low energy contributions of excitonic interactions, which involve two or more Chl molecules (3.Gobets B. Van Amerongen H. Monshouwer R.

Although the presence of low energy-absorbing Chls is ubiquitous in the PSI of different organisms, their amounts and energies appear to be highly species-dependent (1.Gobets B. van Grondelle R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1057: 80-99Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the PSI of higher plants, the red forms are associated with the outer antenna, LHCI (6.Bassi R. Simpson D. Eur. J.

These complexes, localized on one side of the core complex (9.Boekema E.J. Jensen P.E. Schlodder E. van Breemen J.F. van Roon H. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P.

Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As for their properties, Lhca2 and Lhca4 differ from Lhca1 and Lhca3 in many respects. The first two have higher Chl b content with respect to Lhca1 and Lhca3 and bind two carotenoid molecules per polypeptide rather than three (12.Castelletti S. Morosinotto T. Robert B. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Croce R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4226-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For their folding, Lhca2 and Lhca4 require both Chl a and Chl b, whereas Lhca1 and Lhca3 are stable with Chl a only (12.Castelletti S. Morosinotto T. Robert B. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Croce R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4226-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13.Schmid V.H.R. Potthast S. Wiener M. Bergauer V. Paulsen H. Storf S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37307-37314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra, yielding information of pigment organization within the complex, also show strong similarities between Lhca2 and Lhca4 on one hand and Lhca3 and Lhca1 on the other (12.Castelletti S. Morosinotto T. Robert B. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Croce R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4226-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The close relation between Lhca2 and Lhca4 is confirmed by sequence analysis, which shows 55% identity and 75% homology (14.Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the distribution of red forms does not fit into the picture, because these are associated mainly with Lhca3 and Lhca4 (fluorescence emission at 725–730 nm), whereas Lhca1 and Lhca2 have emission at higher energy (702 nm) (12.Castelletti S. Morosinotto T. Robert B. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Croce R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4226-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13.Schmid V.H.R. Potthast S. Wiener M. Bergauer V. Paulsen H.

A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Based on high homology between proteins with different content in red forms, a sequence motif associated with the presence of lowest absorption band, common to Lhca3 and Lhca4 and not present in Lhca1 and Lhca2, should possibly be detected. In fact, Lhca3 and Lhca4 have Asn as the ligand for Chl A5 instead of His (Fig. 1), which is in this position in all other components of Lhc family, including Lhca1 and Lhca2 (14.Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), which show no or a low amount of red-shifted spectral forms. It should be noted that Chl A5 has been involved in red forms together with Chl B5 (16.Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this work, the effect of the presence of Asn as ligand for Chl A5 in Lhca complexes was analyzed in relation to the appearance of the red emission, which characterizes the antenna complexes of Photosystem I. We show that an essential requirement for the presence of the red-shifted absorption/fluorescence spectral forms was the presence of Asn as ligand for the Chl a in the binding site A5 of Lhca complexes. Conversely, substitution of the His ligand with Asn produces a shift of Lhca1 fluorescence emission to lower energy. We conclude that His versus Asn binding of Chl A5 controls the strength of the interaction with Chl B5 by changing the interchromophore distance.

Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The chlorophyll-to-carotenoid ratio and the Chl a/b ratio was measured independently by fitting the spectrum of acetone extracts with the spectra of individual purified pigments (19.Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7343Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy—The absorption spectra at room temperature and 100 K were recorded using an SLM-Aminco DK2000 spectrophotometer in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol (60% at low temperature) and 0.06% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. The wavelength sampling step was 0.4 nm, the scan rate was 100 nm/min, and the optical pathlength was 1 cm. Chlorophyll concentration was ∼10 μg/ml. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured using a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorometer and corrected for the instrumental response. The samples were excited at 440, 475, and 500 nm. The spectral bandwidth was 5 nm (excitation) and 3 nm (emission). Chlorophyll concentration was ∼0.02 μg/ml in 60 and 80% (Lhca1 only) glycerol and 0.03% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. LD spectra were obtained as described by using samples oriented uniaxially by the polyacrylamide gel-squeezing technique (20.Haworth P. Arntzen C.J. Tapie P. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 679: 428-435Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The CD spectra and denaturation temperature measurements were measured at 10 °C on a Jasco 600 spectropolarimeter. The wavelength sampling step was 0.5 nm, the scan rate was 100 nm/min, and spectra were recorded with eight accumulations. The OD of the samples was 1 at the maximum in the Qy transition for all complexes, and the samples were in the same solution described for absorption measurements. All spectra presented were normalized to the polypeptide concentration based on the Chl binding stoichiometry as described (16.Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Denaturation temperature measurements were performed by following the decay of the CD signal at 459 nm while increasing the temperature from 20 to 80 °C with a time slope of 1 °C per min and a resolution of 0.2 °C. The thermal stability of the protein was determined by finding the t½ of the signal decay. Mutation Asn-His in Lhca3 and Lhca4 —Lhca proteins are strongly conserved, and residues coordinating Chl ligands are identical in the four members of the sub-family. The only exception is the ligand of Chl A5, a His in Lhca1 and Lhca2, which is substituted by Asn in Lhca3 and Lhca4. Because this difference correlates with the presence of a strong red-shifted fluorescence emission band at ∼730 nm, we proceeded to mutate residues Asn-62 (Lhca3) and Asn-47 (Lhca4) into His. After overexpression in bacteria and reconstitution in vitro with purified pigments, mutant Lhca3 and 4 complexes were obtained having a monomeric aggregation state as determined by gradient ultracentrifugation (not shown). The pigment composition of the Asn → His (NH) mutant (Lhca3-N62H and Lhca4-N47H), as compared with the WT complexes reconstituted in the same conditions, is reported in Table I. It is worth noting that the conservative mutation leaves the number and relative ratio of the chromophores in the complexes unchanged with respect to their WT counterparts. Nevertheless, spectroscopic analysis shows that Lhca3-N62H and Lhca4-N47H have lost their low energy absorption features present in WTs (Fig. 2). This is confirmed by low temperature fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. 3). In Lhca3, the emission peak is shifted from 725 nm in the WT to 686 nm in the mutant. In WT Lhca4 the emission maximum is at 730 nm, whereas the mutation yields a complex with a 686-nm peak, although an additional emission is present at around 702 nm. The difference between WT and mutant absorption spectra showed that the loss of absorption in the red tail of the Qy transition was compensated by an increase at around 675 nm (676 in Lhca3 and 674 in Lhca4). A second positive contribution in the difference absorption spectrum was visible at 683 nm. No significant difference is observed in Chl b and carotenoid absorption regions, thus indicating that the mutation does not affect the energy levels of these pigments. It has been suggested that the red forms are the result of strong excitonic interactions between antenna Chls (3.Gobets B. Van Amerongen H. Monshouwer R. Kruip J. Rögner M. van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 75-85Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 16.Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To analyze this aspect, the CD spectra of the four samples were recorded (Fig. 4). Both Lhca3 and Lhca4 WT were characterized by the presence of a large negative contribution at wavelength longer than 700 nm. Upon mutation, this signal disappeared, together with a positive contribution at 680–681 nm. The shape of the signal in the CD difference spectra (Fig. 4, dash-dot lines) suggests the loss in the mutants of an excitonic interaction with the low energy contribution at 700–705 nm and the high energy band around 682–683 nm, in complete agreement with the absorption spectra in which two positive contributions at these wavelengths were lost upon mutation.Table IPigment composition of reconstituted complexesSampleChl a/bChl/CarChlTCarTChl bViolaLuteβ-Car/NeoDTLhca1-WT4.02 ± 0.133.45 ± 0.14102.90 ± 0.131.99 ± 0.071.091.520.2854.2 ± 1.5Lhca1-HN4.1 ± 0.063.2 ± 0.169.52.96 ± 0.072.04 ± 0.071.081.630.2651.2 ± 1.8Lhca2-WT1.85 ± 0.155.02 ± 0.18101.99 ± 0.073.52 ± 0.190.471.5053.3 ± 1.9Lhca2-HN2.43 ± 0.054.60 ± 0.1191.96 ± 0.052.63 ± 0.030.481.4843.2 ± 1.6Lhca3-WT5.50 ± 0.133.70 ± 0.09102.70 ± 0.061.54 ± 0.030.631.700.3745.6 ± 1.4Lhca3-NH5.60 ± 0.293.68 ± 0.19102.72 ± 0.141.52 ± 0.070.651.740.3339.5 ± 1.5Lhca4-WT2.38 ± 0.114.83 ± 0.20102.07 ± 0.092.96 ± 0.090.361.7247.2 ± 0.8Lhca4-NH2.36 ± 0.094.91 ± 0.08102.04 ± 0.092.97 ± 0.120.351.680.0849.5 ± 1.9 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Fluorescence emission at 77 K of Lhca3 and Lhca4 WT and NH mutant.

To check whether the Asn versus His exchange had affected the orientation of the Chls, linear dichroism spectra of the complexes were measured (Fig. 5). The spectra of WTs are identical to those of the corresponding mutant proteins in the 460–520 nm region, an indication that no changes occur in the carotenoid orientation. In the mutants, the positive contribution at long wavelengths is substituted by a new absorption around 676 nm, which still exhibited positive LD. The comparison of the difference absorption and LD spectra (Figs. 2 and 5) suggests that Chl A5, although changing its ligand residue, maintains the same orientation as in the WT. We therefore exclude the proposal that the loss of the excitonic interaction might be due to a change in the orientation of Chls as a consequence of the mutation. Mutation His → Asn in Lhca1 and Lhca2—The above results clearly demonstrate that the presence of Asn as a ligand for Chl A5 is a requirement for the presence of the red-most forms. To test the hypothesis that this feature is also sufficient for the presence of this spectroscopic property, Lhca1 and Lhca2, which have His ligand at their A5 site (H47 and H52, respectively) and show emission at 702 nm (13.Schmid V.H.R. Potthast S. Wiener M. Bergauer V. Paulsen H. Storf S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37307-37314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), were mutated to Asn-47 and Asn-52. Both mutant proteins yielded a refolded monomeric product. In the case of Lhca2, the recombinant complex was unstable as judged from heat denaturation data (Table I). This suggests that the His → Asn exchange is affecting the folding of Lhca2, thus preventing a selective evaluation of the effect of ligand exchange. On this basis, this sample will not be analyzed any further in this work. In the case of Lhca1, a stable mutant complex was obtained. The fluorescence spectra was shifted by 11 nm toward the red compared with the WT (Fig. 6A). Consistently, the absorption and LD spectra showed an increase in the red-most absorption region of Lhca1-H47N as compared with WT. Additional features are the loss of the 684 nm (positive LD) and of the 678 nm (negative LD) absorption bands (Fig. 5, B and D), probably due to small differences in pigment content. Moreover, the CD spectrum of the mutant is red-shifted and shows increased negative signal above 700 nm (Fig. 5C). We can therefore conclude that the substitution of His with Asn as ligand for Chl A5 in Lhca1 allows the interactions that yield the red forms to be established. Chlorophyll a is essential for plant photosynthesis. This single molecular species catalyzes a number of functions including light harvesting, excitation energy transfer, charge separation, and electron transport. Such a unique performance depends largely on the modulation of its physico-chemical properties by the environment provided by specific binding proteins. In reaction centers, the presence of dimers of the Chl molecule confers the “special” nature of a primary donor. In antenna proteins, energy levels of each individual chlorophyll chromophore are modulated by interactions with amino acid groups and carotenoid molecules to optimize both energy transfer and photoprotection (21.Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22.Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 314: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In Photosystem II, the protein environment also provides modulation of chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime and, thus, of the efficiency of energy transfer to P680 by undergoing conformational changes induced by the binding of violaxanthin versus zeaxanthin to an allosteric site called L2 (24.Morosinotto T. Caffarri S. Dall'Osto L. Bassi R. Physiol. Plant. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). The most dramatic example of modulation of the spectroscopic properties of Chl is found in PSI with the presence of long wavelength absorption forms extending light harvesting to the low energy region of the spectrum not absorbed by PSII pigments of the shading canopy (25.Rivadossi A. Zucchelli G. Garlaschi F.M. Jennings R.C. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 60: 209-215Crossref Google Scholar). Although PSII fluoresces in the 675–695 nm range, PSI exhibits fluorescence emission at ∼735 nm, thus implying a 60 nm shift with respect to fluorescence emission of Chl a in solution. These characteristics have been attributed to the LHCI complex and, more recently, associated with the two Lhca gene products Lhca3 and Lhca4 (12.Castelletti S. Morosinotto T. Robert B. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Croce R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4226-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the structural features responsible for the origin of red forms are still unknown, although mutation analysis of Lhca1 has suggested Chls A5 and possibly B5 to be involved in the low energy absorption band (16.Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The involvement of Chl A5 was also suggested in the case of Lhca4, because the deletion of the N-terminal protein domain abolished the red emission (26.Schmid V.H. Paulsen H. Rupprecht J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9126-9131Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Analysis of the protein sequences has identified a difference in the ligand for Chl A5 in Lhca3/4 as compared with Lhca1/2. In the first two complexes, an Asn is present in this position, whereas His is the ligand in the other two, as it is in all other higher plant antenna complexes, which do not exhibit red-shifted emission. To determine the role of the ligand, this residue was mutated in all four Lhca proteins, substituting His for Asn in Lhca1 and Lhca2 and Asn for His in Lhca3 and Lhca4. Is Asn, as Ligand for Chl A5, Necessary to Yield to the Low Energy Absorption Forms?—Although Lhc proteins differ in the number of Chl ligands, site A5 belongs to the highly conserved core domain formed by transmembrane helices A and B. The His residue in the A5 ligand position was shown to bind a Chl a molecule in all of the Lhc proteins analyzed to date (i.e. Lhcb1, Lhcb4, and Lhca1) by the loss of a Chl upon mutation of the ligand residue to a non-binding Phe residue. It is important to note that, in both Lhca3 and Lhca4, the substitution of Asn with His did not influence either the number or the composition of pigments bound to the complex. Nevertheless, the mutation led to the loss of the red forms in both Lhca3 and 4, proving that Asn has a major role, as ligand of Chl A5, in effecting their presence. Moreover, only very specific spectral changes were obtained as a result of the mutation, whereas the spectra were unaffected at most wavelengths. Thus, the Asn to His substitution has a very specific effect, whereas it does not influence the overall properties of the pigment-protein complexes. We conclude that coordination through His induces a re-organization of chromophores involved in the interaction(s) responsible for the red-most spectral feature in the WT complexes. Orientation and distance are the major determinants in excitonic interactions. In this case, LD analysis shows that the orientation of the Chls is not affected by the mutation. On this basis, we suggest that the main effect of the mutation is to increase the distance between the two interacting Chls. This is realistic considering the structure of the two residues, with Asn having smaller steric hindrance as compared with His (Fig. 8). It has to be considered that the His versus Asn substitution appears to be a usual tool for modulation of Chl-Chl interactions in Lhc proteins; Chl A2, when coordinated by Asn in Lhcb1, establishes excitonic interactions with neighbor pigments, namely Chl B2 and Chl A4. This interaction is absent in Lhcb4 (CP29) in which His is the ligand for Chl A2 (21.Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22.Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol.

Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7343Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Is the Presence of Asn as Ligand for Chl A5 Sufficient to Lead to the Red Forms?—A complete mutation analysis of Lhca1 complex showed that the red-most spectral form in this complex, emitting at 702 nm, originates by an interaction between Chls in sites A5 and B5 (16.Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Upon mutation of the His ligand for Chl A5 in Lhca1, the fluorescence emission of Lhca1-H47N showed a 11-nm red shift as compared with the WT, a clear indication of the formation of a new red spectral form. The absorption and LD spectra display a small but clearly detectable increase in the absorption at wavelengths of >700 nm. Gaussian analysis of the difference LD spectra, where the signal is more clearly detectable, indicates that the newly formed band absorbs with a maximum at 700 nm. The pigment complement of Lhca1-HN is similar to that of the WT, although not identical, as was the case for Lhca3-NH and Lhca4-NH. By normalizing the number of Chls to the carotenoid content, a value of 9.5 Chls in the mutant versus 10 in the WT is obtained. It therefore appears that the Asn introduced in Lhca1 as Chl A5 ligand, although able to coordinate Chl, cannot produce 100% occupancy of the site as is the case in the WT. We conclude that the Lhca1 H47N mutant yields a mixed population in which ∼50% of the complexes lose the Chl A5 ligand. This is confirmed by preliminary results showing incomplete energy equilibration among Chl a chromophores, although Chl b to Chl a energy transfer is complete. Nevertheless, this experiment shows that the presence of Asn is sufficient to generate the red forms in Lhca1. Our failure to obtain a similar result with Lhca2 suggests, however, that the overall structure of the complex must be suited to host the Chl A5 in the new location. The Lhca2-HN mutant, in fact, looses pigments and does not exhibit red-shifted fluorescence. Energy Levels of the Interacting Chls—To determine the energy levels of the interacting Chls, the difference absorption spectra (WT minus mutant) of Lhca3 and Lhca4 were analyzed in terms of Gaussian bands. The data, for Lhca4 only, are reported in Fig. 7 and are fully consistent with the data for Lhca3. Three Gaussian components are required for a satisfactory description of the difference spectrum, i.e. two positives at 683 nm (FWHM = 15.4 nm) and 700 nm (FWHM = 31.8 nm) and one negative at 675 nm (FWHM = 9.3 nm). The two positive bands are likely to represent the high and the low energy bands of the excitonic interaction, respectively. This proposal is supported by the analysis of the CD spectra; the mutation led to the loss of one negative component at around 703–705 nm and of a positive component at 680 nm. The negative band represents the absorption of the monomers in the absence of the interaction. Considering that the 675-nm band is the only negative contribution observed in the spectra, it can be concluded that the monomers are isoenergetics. Similar values for the absorption of monomeric Chl A5 were found in LHCII and CP29 (21.Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22.Remelli R. Varotto C. Sandona D. Croce R. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33510-33521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), thus supporting the present conclusion. We have to highlight the fact that the bandwidth of the red-most transition is very large, as is expected in the case of a Chl dimer because of strong electronphonon coupling, whereas the absorption at 675 nm has the FWHM typical of a Chl monomer. The low energy transition responsible for the fluorescence emission at 730 nm in a native LHCI preparation composed of Lhca heterodimers was proposed to be lying at 711 nm and to be associated with Lhca4 (27.Ihalainen J.A. Gobets B. Sznee K. Brazzoli M. Croce R. Bassi R. van Grondelle R. Korppi-Tommola J.E.I. Dekker J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8625-8631Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Such a 711-nm band is not detectable in our difference spectra. We notice, however, that in order to describe the red absorption tail of both Lhca4 and Lhca3 with a form peaking at 709–711 nm having an FWHM of ∼30 nm (as the fluorescence line narrowing data suggest; Ref. 28.Ihalainen J.A. Rätsep M. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. Croce R. Bassi R. Korppi-Tommola J.E.I. Freiberg A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 9086-9093Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) a second Gaussian band with maximum around 697 nm and FWHM of 25 nm would be required. This model with two red-shifted forms, however, would imply an oscillator strength of <1 Chl per Lhca4 monomer associated with the 711-nm form in both Lhca3 and Lhca4 (data not shown). Although a scenario implying more than one red-shifted form in Lhca proteins cannot be discarded without complementary experiments, at present we favor the simpler hypothesis that the 730-nm fluorescence emission band originates from a single absorption form with the maximum of ∼700 nm on the basis of the following considerations. First, the values of the Huang-Rhys factors and the mean frequencies of the phonon distribution for the red band of LHCI, as calculated from fluorescence line narrowing measurements, are 2.7 and 0.2 and 110 cm–1 and 190 cm–1, respectively (28.Ihalainen J.A. Rätsep M. Jensen P.E. Scheller H.V. Croce R. Bassi R. Korppi-Tommola J.E.I. Freiberg A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 9086-9093Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, a value of 670 cm–1 for the Stokes shift (2S1v1 + 2S2v2) can be proposed, localizing the absorption band responsible for the 730-nm fluorescence emission in Lhca4 (735 nm in LHCI) at 700–705 nm. Second, the band shape of the red-most part of the absorption and LD spectra are identical, implying that if two components are present, then they must have the same dipole orientation of their Qy transition, which seems unlikely. Third, the CD spectra show the red-most minimum at 703–705 nm, in agreement with the data obtained in the native LHCI preparation (minimum at 706 nm) (27.Ihalainen J.A. Gobets B. Sznee K. Brazzoli M. Croce R. Bassi R. van Grondelle R. Korppi-Tommola J.E.I. Dekker J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8625-8631Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The absorption maximum associated to this CD signal is thus expected to be shorter than 705 nm. It has also been proposed that Chl b participates in the interaction yielding the red forms in Lhca4 (29.Schmid V.H. Thome P. Ruhle W. Paulsen H. Kuhlbrandt W. Rogl H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The absorption difference spectra for Lhca3 and Lhca4 do not show any contribution in the Chl b region. If a Chl b was directly involved in the interaction, a shift of this band upon loss of the interaction is expected. On the basis of the present data we can then exclude a direct involvement of Chl b molecules in the red emission forms. This conclusion is in agreement with the previous suggestion that Chl b involvement was indirect and due to a structural role for Chl B6 (12.Castelletti S. Morosinotto T. Robert B. Caffarri S. Bassi R. Croce R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4226-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16.Morosinotto T. Castelletti S. Breton J. Bassi R. Croce R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36253-36261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Based on the above considerations, we conclude that the two bands of the excitonic interaction lye at 683 and 700 nm and a value of 180 cm–1 can thus be obtained for the resonance interaction energy, V12. The red shift observed for the two excitonic bands, as compared with the absorption of the monomers, is due to the displacement energy as was already observed for dimers of Chl in solution (30.Sauer K. Lindsay J.G. Schultz A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 2681-2689Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31.Van Amerongen H. Valkunas L. van Grondelle R. Photosynthetic Excitons. World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore2000: 52Google Scholar). An oscillator strength of 1.17 Chl molecules per monomer is associated with the 700-nm absorption band in Lhca4. From this value, the angle between the dipole transition moments of the interacting monomers can be calculated to be ∼80°. A model for the organization of the two interacting Chls in WT and the mutants Lhca3 and Lhca4 is proposed in Fig. 8, which is based on the structure of LHCII (32.Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). In the LD spectra, the 700-nm band shows a positive contribution, which indicates that the angle between the dipole transition moment and the normal to the membrane plane is >54.7°. As for the 683-nm contribution, it does not appear in the LD spectrum, thus suggesting that the Chl responsible for this absorption has a dipole transition moment oriented at the magic angle. Conclusion—In this work, we have identified the primary role for an Asn residue as a ligand for Chl A5 in determining the chromophore organization yielding the most red-shifted spectral forms of Lhca3 and Lhca4, from which originates the far red fluorescence emission band typical of PSI. The presence of Asn in that position is necessary for the formation of the red-shifted band. It also appears to be sufficient in complexes where Chl binding to site A5 by an Asn residue is allowed. Its role is to keep the two Chls close enough for excitonic interaction. We also suggest that the differences in transition energy and amplitude of red-most bands in the individual Lhca1–4 antenna complexes depends on the strength of the interaction most probably between the same Chl pair, namely Chl A5 and B5. The finding that the fluorescence emission spectrum of Lhca4, upon mutation of Asn-47 to His, closely resembles that of Lhca2-WT supports this conclusion. Our analysis also strongly suggests that the 730-nm emission band originates from a broad absorption around 700 nm. This transition represents the low energy contribution of an excitonic interaction, the high-energy band of which was found at 683 nm. The possibility that the 700-nm absorption contains more than a single contribution cannot be completely discarded, and this point needs to be analyzed further."
https://openalex.org/W2099283142,"Myoblast fusion is essential for the formation and regeneration of skeletal muscle. In a genetic screen for regulators of muscle development in Drosophila, we discovered a gene encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, called loner, which is required for myoblast fusion. Loner localizes to subcellular sites of fusion and acts downstream of cell surface fusion receptors by recruiting the small GTPase ARF6 and stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange. Accordingly, a dominant-negative ARF6 disrupts myoblast fusion in Drosophila embryos and in mammalian myoblasts in culture, mimicking the fusion defects caused by loss of Loner. Loner and ARF6, which also control the proper membrane localization of another small GTPase, Rac, are key components of a cellular apparatus required for myoblast fusion and muscle development. In muscle cells, this fusigenic mechanism is coupled to fusion receptors; in other fusion-competent cell types it may be triggered by different upstream signals."

Recently confluent cultures of REKs were trypsinized, suspended in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (high glucose) as above except with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), applied on the collagen gels, and grown for 3 days with culture medium present both beneath and above the insert.

To study the early effects of KGF on intracellular hyaluronan, some of the monolayer cultures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 10 turbidity reducing units/ml Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan), washed with HBSS, and incubation continued in new medium with KGF and 10 units/ml hyaluronidase at 37 °C for 120 min.Staining of Hyaluronan in Monolayer Cultures—REKs grown in 8-well chamber slides were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (PB), for 20 min, washed with PB, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in 1% BSA-PB for 30 min.

The staining for hyaluronan was done as above, except that all the incubation solutions and washing buffers contained 0.05% saponin, and the incubations were done at 4 °C. The samples were postfixed with 1% reduced osmium tetroxide for 15 min, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections were cut on Formvar-coated copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed in a type 1200 EX microscope from JEOL (Tokyo, Japan).Confocal Microscopy—The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed, and treated with Streptomyces hyaluronidase as described above. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1% BSA-PB for 10 min, the cells were incubated with bHABC (5 μg/ml) and an anti-rat CD44 antibody (OX50, BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA, 1:100) overnight at 4 °C, washed, treated with Texas Red streptavidin (Vector, 1:1000) and FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Vector, 1:200) for 1 h at room temperature, washed, mounted with Vectashield (Vector), and viewed with an UltraView confocal scanner (PE-Wallac-LSR, Oxford, UK), built on a Nikon TE300 microscope. Ten optical sections from the top to the bottom of the cells were taken using a 100×/1.3 numeric aperture objective. Further image processing was done with Photoshop software (Adobe, San Jose, CA).Optical Density Measurements—Optical densities of the cells stained for hyaluronan using DAB were analyzed by a Leitz BK II microscope with 16×/0.45 numeric aperture objective (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany) and a digital camera (Photometrics CH 200, Roper Scientific Inc., Trenton, NJ) as described previously (27.Tammi R.

Area-integrated mean optical density values for the DAB chromogen were calculated for each whole digitized area, excluding possible artifact areas. In the densitometric assays, the hyaluronan remaining after Streptomyces hyaluronidase treatment of non-permeabilized cells was designated as “intracellular,” whereas in the chemical assays (see below) the term “intracellular” represents hyaluronan resistant to peeling of the pericellular hyaluronan with trypsin-EDTA. These two techniques give parallel results for the intracellular pool, but the values from the trypsin-EDTA method are somewhat higher (28.Tammi R. Rilla K. Pienimäki J.P. MacCallum D.K. Hogg M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35111-35122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Histological Analyses of the Organotypic Cultures—Two-week-old cultures were fixed overnight in 2% buffered paraformaldehyde containing 0.5% glutaraldehyde, or in Histochoice® (Amresco, Solon, OH). After fixation the cultures were washed with PB, pH 7.4, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 3-μm-thick vertical sections.Morphometry—Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections were systematically sampled by taking six digital images with a CoolSNAP camera (Roper Scientific) from each culture at constant intervals using a 20× objective and a 1.25× intermediate lens (Nikon Microphot FXA microscope). The heights of the basal cells, vital epidermis, and stratum corneum were each measured using the NIH Image 1.62/fat software for Macintosh (Wayne Rashband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Thresholding of areas exhibiting background intensity was used to exclude the areas between separated corneocytes in the stratum corneum measurements. Data from six cultures were analyzed for each group.Hyaluronan Staining of the Sections—Aldehyde-fixed sections were rehydrated, treated for 5 min with 1% H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidases, and stained for hyaluronan using bHABC, avidin-biotin, and DAB, as described above. The sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin for 1 min, washed, dehydrated, and mounted in DPX (Gurr®, BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, UK).Immunocytochemistry—Histochoice-fixed, deparaffinized sections were first incubated in target unmasking fluid (TUF™, Monosan, Uden, The Netherlands) at 95 °C, then for 5 min with 1% H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidases, washed with PB, and incubated in 1% BSA in PB for 30 min to block nonspecific binding. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-keratin 10 (Monosan, 1:10 dilution in 1% BSA), polyclonal anti-filaggrin (a generous gift of Dr. Beverly Dale-Crunk, University of Washington, Seattle, WA; 1:5,000 dilution) or monoclonal anti-CD44 (OX50, 1:50), followed by an 1-h incubation with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:50, Vector) or biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (1:70, Vector). The bound antibodies were visualized with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase and DAB, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted as described above. The controls included sections treated in the same way but with the primary antibody omitted.Western Blotting—The epidermis from organotypic REK cultures was rinsed with ice-cold PBS and homogenized in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.13 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml aprotinin as described before (24.Pasonen-Seppänen S.

Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) from the extracts were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon™-NC membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding was blocked by 5% defatted milk powder and 0.2% Tween 20 in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (blocking buffer), overnight at 4 °C (24.Pasonen-Seppänen S. Suhonen T.M.

The membranes were incubated for 2 h with the anti-filaggrin antibody (1:9,000 dilution in the blocking buffer) or the anti-keratin 10 antibody (1:100). After washes in blocking buffer, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA; 1:20,000) for filaggrin, and with an anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; 1:20,000 dilution) for keratin 10. The immune complexes were visualized using the NEN™ chemiluminescence detection kit according to instructions from the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).In Vitro Hyaluronan Synthase Assay—The assay was done essentially as described (31.Spicer A.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 373-382PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent REK cells (16-24 × 106) were incubated for 14 h with 0-100 ng/ml KGF, membrane fraction isolated and incubated with 0.5 mm UDP-GlcNAc and 0.05 mm UDP-GlcA (both from Sigma), the latter containing 2.5 μCi of UDP-[14C]GlcA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), for 2 h at 37 °C. The samples were boiled with 1% SDS, incorporated activity separated by paper chromatography, quantified by liquid scintillation counting, and expressed as picomoles of GlcA incorporated/mg of protein in the membrane fraction (31.Spicer A.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 373-382PubMed Google Scholar).Metabolic Labeling Assay—REKs were seeded into 6-well plates at 200,000 cells/well, and grown until subconfluent (2 days). Fresh medium containing [3H]glucosamine (20 μCi/ml) and [35S]SO4 (10 μCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK), and the appropriate amounts of KGF (0, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml) were added to the cells and incubated for 6 or 18 h. The medium and two 0.3-ml HBSS (EuroClone) washes of the cell layer were combined and designated “medium.” Cell surface-associated hyaluronan was detached with 0.5 ml of 0.05% trypsin (w/v), 0.02% EDTA (w/v) for 10 min at 37 °C, and the cells were pelleted and washed with 250 μl of HBSS. The trypsin solution and the HBSS wash were combined and designated “pericellular,” whereas the cell pellet was designated as the “intracellular” hyaluronan pool. Hyaluronan and other glycosaminoglycans were purified and quantitated from the different cellular compartments after determination of the specific activity of the hexosamines as described in detail previously (25.Tammi R.H.

After proteinase K inactivation by boiling for 10 min, 50 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid was added to precipitate proteins by centrifugation (15 min, 13,000 × g). Dialyzed supernatants were evaporated, dissolved in 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, and digested for 3 h at 37 °C with 2 milliunits of Streptococcus hyaluronidase (Seikagaku), dried, and derivatized overnight at 37 °C in 5 μl of 0.1 m 2-aminoacridone (Lambda Fluoreszenztechnologie GmbH, Graz, Austria) in 3:17 (v/v) acetic acid:dimethyl sulfoxide, and 5 μl of 1 m NaBH3CN. The 2-aminoacridone-derivatized disaccharides were stored at -20 °C until electrophoresis as described (16.Rilla K. Lammi M.J. Sironen R. Törrönen K. Luukkonen M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J.

Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), with the following modification; 30% polyacrylamide gels were cast in the laboratory in 100 mm Tris borate buffer, pH 8.9, and the same buffer was used as the running buffer. The intensities of the hyaluronan disaccharide bands derived from the samples and hyaluronan standards (Healon®, Amersham Biosciences) were digitized on a UV light box using a CCD camera. Quantitative image processing was done with NIH Image.Hyaluronan Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Organotypic cultures were changed into 1.5 ml of serum-free medium with KGF (0, 2, and 20 ng/ml) and continued for 24 h. The medium, epidermis, and collagen support were each analyzed separately, the latter two after extraction with 2 × 2 ml of acetone at 4 °C over 2 days, and digestion of the residue overnight at 60 °C with 250 μg/ml papain (Sigma) in 5 mm cysteine and 5 mm EDTA. After incubation, the samples were boiled for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme, centrifuged at 13,000 × g, and the pellet discarded. Maxisorp Plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml hyaluronan-binding complex (26.Tammi R. ågren U.M. Tuhkanen A.L. Tammi M. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 29: 1-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), washed with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (Tween-PBS), and blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Standard hyaluronan (Provisc, Algon Laboratories Inc., Fort Worth, TX) at 150 ng/ml concentrations and samples diluted into 1% BSA in PBS (100 μl) were added to the wells for 1 h at 37 °C, the plates washed with Tween-PBS, and incubated with 1 μg/ml bHABC for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed with Tween-PBS. Horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin complex (Vector) was added for 1 h at 37 °C, washed with Tween-PBS, and 1 mg/ml O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) and 0.03% H2O2 in 0.1 m phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5, were added at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped after 15 min with 50 μl of 4 m H2SO4 and the absorbance read at 490 nm. Each sample and standard were done in triplicate.Molecular Mass of Hyaluronan—Aliquots (0.5 ml) of radiolabeled culture medium, trypsin supernatant, and cell extract were subjected to gel filtration on a 1 × 30-cm column of Sephacryl S-1000 (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated, and eluted at 0.4 ml/min with 0.15 m sodium acetate, 0.1% CHAPS (Sigma), 0.05% Hibitane®, pH 6.8. From each fraction, one aliquot was incubated overnight at 37 °C with 12.5 milliunits of Streptomyces hyaluronidase, whereas another received buffer only. Both aliquots were precipitated in 1% cetylpyridinium chloride (Sigma) with 5 μg of carrier hyaluronan. The increase of [3H]glucosamine in the supernatant of the hyaluronidase-treated aliquot was a specific measure of hyaluronan. The void volume of the Sephacryl S-1000 column (V0) was considered to be in the first hyaluronan-positive fractions emerging in the chromatogram of Healon GV with the mean molecular mass of 6 × 106 Da (Amersham Biosciences), and the total volume (Vt) in the elution position of glucuronic acid. The size distribution of hyaluronan in the samples was estimated from the Kav values of known hyaluronan standards, provided by the resin manufacturer.RT-PCR—Total RNA from monolayer cultures treated with KGF for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, was isolated using the RNeasy® Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), and from the 2-week-old organotypic cultures with the TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, treated with DNase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), quantitated with a spectrophotometer, and equal amounts taken to the RT-PCR reactions with the GeneAmp® Gold RNA PCR reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the primers, temperatures, and cycles shown in Table I. The RT-PCR products separated on 1.5% agarose gels were digitized by BioDocII™ video documentation system (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) and quantitated by ethidium bromide fluorescence by using the NIH Image software.Table IPrimers, annealing temperatures, and cycle numbers used in the RT-PCR reactionsHas15′-GCT CTA TGG GGC GTT CCT C-3′ (left)57 °C35-375′-CAC ACA TAA GTG GCA GGG TCC-3′ (right)Has25′-TCG GAA CCA CAC TGT TTG GAG TG-3′62 °C33-355′-CCA GAT GTA AGT GAC TGA TTT GTC CC-3′Has35′-ACT CTG CAT CGC TGC CTA CC-3′66 °C335′-ACA TGA CTT CAC GCT TGC CC-3′CD445′-TTG GGG ACT ACT TTG CCT CTT A-3′55 °C335′-CCA CTG CTG ACA TCC TCA TCT A-3′Profilaggrin5′-CTC AGG GCA TCG CTC GTC A-3′64 °C345′-GCT GGT GGC GGT CTT CGT G-3′GAPDH5′-TGA TGC TGG TGC TGA GTA TG-3′60 °C325′-GGT GGA AGA ATG GGA GTT GC-3′ Open table in a new tab Cell Proliferation—The REKs were seeded into 24-well plates at 60,000 cells/well, KGF added on the next day, and cells counted 24, 48, and 72 h later using a hemocytometer.Two-week-old organotypic REK cultures were incubated with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine for 1 h, washed with PBS, and fixed overnight with Histochoice®. The deparaffinized sections were first incubated in TUF™ as above, immunostained with an anti-BrdUrd antibody, and counterstained with propidium iodide (0.01 μg/ml; Sigma) according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Ten fields per culture were counted for labeled nuclei using a 20× objective and 1.25× intermediate lens.Cell Migration—The cells were seeded at 600,000 cells/well on 6-well plates, and grown for 24 h. A cell-free area was introduced by scraping the monolayer crosswise with a sterile 1000-μl pipette tip, and the medium was replaced with new medium containing the appropriate concentration of KGF. The area covered by the cells in eight crossing areas in duplicate wells of each growth factor concentration was measured immediately after scraping and 24 h later using an Olympus CK2 inverted phase contrast microscope (Olympus Optical Co.

In some cases, the export of target proteins is induced upon environmental or cellular cues, resulting in conditional gene expression. The small Maf proteins appear to be critical regulators of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, an anti-oxidant defense enzyme that degrades heme into iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin. Although ho-1 is repressed by Bach1/small Maf heterodimers, it is activated by Nrf2/small Maf heterodimers, indicating that Bach1 and Nrf2 compete with each other. We anticipated that the nuclear concentration of Bach1 might be regulated to ensure that the entire system effectively responds to various stimuli. We carried out detailed domain analysis of Bach1 in an effort to understand how various inducers of HO-1 inactivate Bach1. We show here that cadmium, a strong inducer of HO-1, activates the nuclear export of Bach1. This cadmium-induced export of Bach1 was mediated in trans by its C-terminal region that is conserved between Bach1 and Bach2. The nuclear export of Bach2 was also induced by cadmium, indicating that the cadmium responsibility is shared between Bach1 and Bach2. The nuclear export of Bach1 was dependent on Crm1/Exportin-1 as well as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) activity. These results indicate that the nuclear export of Bach1 constitutes an important regulatory mechanism to relieve the Bach1-mediated repression of genes such as ho-1.

Cells possess an enormous repertoire of gene responses to cellular and environmental stimuli. To a large extent, gene responses consist of programmed interactions between transcription factors and their target cis-DNA sites. Oxidative stress responses are critical to cell survival, because cells cannot avoid reactive oxygen species as long as they use molecular oxygen.

Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar). HO-1 is one of the rate-limiting enzymes involved in heme degradation, generating ferrous iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, which is rapidly reduced to bilirubin. Carbon monoxide, biliverdin, and bilirubin have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in vivo (1.Shibahara S. Kitamuro T. Takahashi K. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2.Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar). Thus, HO-1 is an antioxidant defense enzyme that converts heme into antioxidants. Although its role in lower eukaryotes is not clear, HO-1 is essential for higher eukaryotes to cope with various aspects of cellular stress and to regulate cellular iron metabolism (3.Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar).

Recent studies have revealed that the induction of ho-1 expression involves the interplay of various basic-leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factors on critical enhancer elements, including the StRE (stress responsive element (11.Inamdar N.M. Ahn Y.I. Alam J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)) or MARE (Maf recognition element (12.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell.

StRE and MARE are similar to each other and embed the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element (TRE), a binding motif for AP-1 transcription factors (12.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, MARE can be bound in vitro by various heterodimeric bZip factors, including NF-E2, NF-E2-related factors (Nrf1, Nrf2, and Nrf3), Maf and AP-1 families (13.Andrews N.C.

Bach1 forms heterodimers with the small Maf proteins that bind to MARE just like the Nrf/small Maf heterodimers (20.Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M.

Gene targeting experiments in mice revealed that, under normal conditions, Bach1 binds to the enhancers of ho-1 to repress its expression (26.Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments further indicated that Bach1 repressor activity is dominant over activators of HO-1, such as Nrf2, effectively keeping HO-1 expression at low levels under normal conditions (26.Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a competitive interplay between the Bach1-containing repressor dimers and Nrf-containing activator dimers. For the system to be effective in regulating inducible gene expression, the activities or nuclear concentrations of Bach1 and/or Nrf proteins must be under dynamic control. We recently reported that heme regulates the DNA binding activity of Bach1 through a direct interaction in vitro (26.Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 27.Ogawa K. Sun J. Taketani S. Nakajima O. Nishitani C. Sassa S. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Shibahara S. Fujita H. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2835-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The Bach1-heme interaction is mediated by evolutionarily conserved multiple heme regulatory motifs, including the cysteine-proline (CP) dipeptide sequence in Bach1. Increased levels of heme abrogate this repressor function of Bach1 by binding to Bach1 and thus inhibiting its DNA-binding activity. In the absence of Bach1 activity, other factors such as Nrf2 appear to bind to MAREs and activate HO-1 expression (26.Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of ho-1 involves a direct sensing of heme levels by Bach1, analogous to the sensitivity of the lac repressor to lactose, generating a simple feedback loop whereby the substrate affects the repressor. Notwithstanding the recent progress, it remains unclear how ho-1 is induced by the vast array of stimuli. Aside from heme, conditions resulting in induction may increase the activities of MARE activators such as Nrf2. Indeed, cadmium stabilizes Nrf2 by inhibiting its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (28.Stewart D. Killeen E. Naquin R. Alam S. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2396-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In addition to the regulation of Nrf2 activity, other inducers may also inhibit Bach1 activity. In this respect, a comparison of Bach1 with its related factor, Bach2, may yield some clues. We previously showed that the subcellular localization of Bach2 is regulated by nuclear export (29.Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K.

In cultured cells under normal conditions, Bach2 is localized in the cytoplasm through its C-terminal conserved cytoplasmic localization signal (CLS). CLS directs leptomycin B-sensitive and Crm1/Exportin1-dependent nuclear export. Oxidative stressors abort CLS activity and induce the accumulation of Bach2 in the nucleus. The CLS-like sequence is highly conserved among mouse as well as human Bach2 and Bach1 (29.Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15370-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that Bach1 is regulated by conditional nuclear export, we carried out a detailed domain analysis of Bach1 in an effort to identify regions that might specify its subcellular localization. Our results indicated that at least two inducers of ho-1, cadmium and heme, inactivate the repressor Bach1 in distinct ways to achieve conditional gene expression and suggest that the interpretation of various stimuli by Bach1 is critical in ho-1 regulation.

The cells were treated with chemical reagents at the indicated concentrations. Immunocytochemistry—293T cells were transfected with various Bach1 expression plasmids and cultured for 24 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. After fixing, the cells were washed in PBS and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were washed and treated for 30 min at 37 °C with the anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:500–1:1000. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and then treated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Sigma) diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS at a concentration of 1:200 at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing, cells were counterstained with 10 μm Hoechst 33342 and mounted in Vectashield (Vector). The cells were then examined by fluorescence microscopy. GFP Observation—293T cells were transfected with the GFP fusion expression plasmids and cultured for 24 h. The subcellular localization of GFP fusion proteins was examined using fluorescence microscopy after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. To examine the effects of reagents, transfected cells were treated with 20 ng/ml leptomycin B or 10 μm CdCl2 for the indicated periods at the end of incubation. Image Acquisition—The images were taken with a Leica epifluorescence microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device camera controlled by Qfluoro software (Leica). Adobe Photoshop was used for the presentation of the images. Reporter Assays—The MARE reporter pRBGP2 possesses three copies of the MARE derived from the chicken β-globin enhancer as previously described (15.Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). 293T cells were seeded in 12-well dishes 16 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with the reporter and effector plasmids by lipofection. To examine the effects of various reagents, cells were cultured for an additional 16 h and treated with vehicle or inducing agents for 4 h. To examine the effects of kinase inhibitors, cells were cultured in serum-free medium. Kinase inhibitors were added 2 h prior to the addition of CdCl2 and maintained during the remainder of the incubation period. The preparation of cell extracts and measurement of luciferase activity were carried out as previously described (29.Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T. Motohashi H. Hayashi N.

Three independent experiments, carried out in duplicate, were performed, and the results were averaged and diagrammed with the standard errors. Bach1 Export from Nuclei Is Dependent on Crm1/Exportin-1— When overexpressed in various mammalian cells, Bach1 accumulates within the cytoplasmic region with clear nuclear exclusion. To test whether the cytoplasmic-dominant accumulation involves nuclear export, we expressed FLAG-tagged Bach1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and treated the cells with leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of Crm1. As shown in Fig. 1A, LMB induced efficient nuclear accumulation of Bach1, establishing that Bach1 is regulated by nuclear export. Based on this observation, we then examined how and when the subcellular localization of Bach1 is regulated. Multiple Domains of Bach1 Regulate Subcellular Localization—The nuclear export of Bach2 is mediated by the CLS (29.Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15370-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The CLS is a non-canonical type of nuclear export signal (NES) whose activity is inhibited by oxidative stressors such as diethyl maleic acid. Because the corresponding region of Bach1 is well conserved, we hypothesized that a deletion of the putative CLS from Bach1 would result in nuclear accumulation. To define regions involved in the regulation of Bach1 subcellular localization, we constructed various truncated versions of Bach1 tagged with FLAG at the N termini (Fig. 1B). Bach1ΔC1 lacked the C-terminal 14 amino acids and thus the entire putative CLS. When expressed in 293 cells and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C), the deletion C1 resulted in slower migration through the gels (compare ΔC1 and ΔBTBΔC1 with the others). The reason for the slower mobility is not known. Unexpectedly, Bach1ΔC1 accumulated within the cytoplasmic region just as the Bach1 wild-type (Fig. 2, A and B). By sequentially removing the C-terminal region, we found that Bach1ΔC2 was excluded from nuclei, whereas Bach1ΔC3 showed considerable accumulation in nuclei (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, the region between residues 636 and 685 is critical for cytoplasmic accumulation. Further deletion (ΔC4) completely abolished cytoplasmic staining, suggesting that the leucine zipper inhibits nuclear accumulation in this assay. Bach1 and Bach2 possess the BTB/POZ domain in their N-terminal regions. The BTB/POZ domain is found in various nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins and is known to mediate protein-protein interactions (for a review, see Ref. 32.Yoshida C. Tokumasu F. Hohmura K.I. Bungert J. Hayashi N. Nagasawa T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Takeyasu K. Igarashi K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This domain mediates transcriptional repression through its ability to recruit the corepressors SMRT and N-CoR, as demonstrated for BCL-6 and PLZF (33.Dhordain P. Albagli O. Lin R.J. Ansieau S.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1804-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The Bach1 BTB domain mediates oligomer formation, generating a multivalent DNA-binding complex (25.Igarashi K. Hoshino H. Muto A. Suwabe N. Nishikawa S. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11783-11790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32.Yoshida C. Tokumasu F. Hohmura K.I. Bungert J. Hayashi N. Nagasawa T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Takeyasu K. Igarashi K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, removing the BTB domain of Bach1 (Bach1ΔBTB) resulted in nuclear accumulation (Fig. 2). These results indicated that the cytoplasmic localization of Bach1 is regulated by multiple domains. Even in the absence of the putative CLS, other regions such as amino acids 636–685 and the BTB domain inhibit nuclear accumulation. This is in clear contrast to Bach2, where the deletion of CLS is sufficient to cause nuclear accumulation of Bach2 in many cell types (Ref. 29.Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15370-15376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and data not shown). One of the interesting observations described above is that the LMB treatment resulted in the nuclear accumulation of Bach1, whereas the deletion of CLS was not sufficient to cause nuclear accumulation. This fact suggests that Bach1 also possesses an additional NES. To examine whether the region spanning amino acids 636–685 contains a NES, we fused the region to EGFP (see Fig. 1) and examined its subcellular localization in the absence or presence of LMB. Like EGFP, the fusion protein was distributed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 3). LMB did not increase the nuclear signal or diminish the cytoplasmic signal. These results indicate that the region examined does not function as a NES. One possibility is that this region facilitates interaction with a cytoplasmic protein. Although the fusion protein tested in Fig. 3 did not show a clear nuclear exclusion, the small size of the protein may allow diffusion into nuclei, obscuring cytoplasmic retention. Alternatively, the region 636–685 may collaborate with other regions on Bach1 to strengthen cytoplasmic interaction. This is consistent with above observations that ΔC4 showed more efficient nuclear accumulation than ΔC3 (Fig. 2). We recently found a cytoskeletal protein that binds Bach1 depending on the presence of this region. 2C. Yamazaki and K. Igarashi, unpublished data. Together, these observations suggest that the region spanning amino acids 636–685 is not a NES and rather plays a role in the cytoplasmic anchoring of Bach1. Cadmium Activates the Nuclear Export of Bach1—Our previous observations suggested that ho-1 is repressed by Bach1 under normal conditions. In a simple model, Bach1 may accumulate within nuclei under normal conditions. This model predicts that the subcellular localization of Bach1 may be further regulated in trans through interaction with co-functioning proteins. As previously reported (36.Katsuoka F. Motohashi H. Tamagawa Y. Kure S. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the overexpression of MafK together with Bach1 resulted in significant nuclear accumulation of Bach1 (Fig. 4A, upper panel, and B). Heterodimer formation may stabilize nuclear accumulation through DNA binding, because Bach1 displays poor DNA binding by itself. In any case, a substantial amount of Bach1 may be localized in the nucleus when MafK or other small Maf proteins are available. Having established that the localization of Bach1 is determined by multiple layers of regulation, we wished to examine the subcellular localization of Bach1 and MafK upon cadmium treatment, a condition that induces HO-1. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), when transfected cells were treated with 10 μm cadmium for 4 h, Bach1 accumulated in the cytoplasmic region and excluded from the nuclear region. Although MafK showed a cytoplasmic staining upon cadmium treatment, it did not show a clear nuclear exclusion like Bach1 and a significant nuclear staining of MafK remained. This observation suggested that Bach1 and MafK affected each other's localization. The translocation of Bach1 was inhibited by simultaneous treatment with LMB, suggesting the involvement of Crm1-dependent nuclear export in this process (Fig. 4B). Bach2 responded to MafK expression and cadmium in a similar way as Bach1 (Fig. 4C), indicating that both Bach1 and Bach2 share similar responses toward cadmium. Cadmium may inhibit the interaction between Bach1 and MafK, allowing for the nuclear export of liberated Bach1. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of cadmium upon the Bach1ΔBTB that had accumulated in the nuclear region independent of MafK under normal culture conditions. We found that, although Bach1ΔBTB showed nuclear-dominant accumulation when expressed alone, it displayed cytoplasmic-dominant accumulation upon cadmium treatment (Fig. 5A, compare upper two panels). Quantification of the distribution under the two conditions clearly indicated that Bach1ΔBTB did not accumulate within the nuclear compartment in the presence of cadmium (Fig. 5B). This observation indicates that the observed cadmium effect on Bach1 does not involve changes in the Bach1-MafK interaction and that the BTB domain is not necessary"

However, the functions and mechanisms of oligomerization remain poorly understood for most GPCRs, including the α-factor receptor (STE2 gene product) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Results of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescence microscopy, endocytosis assays of receptor oligomerization in living cells, and agonist binding assays indicated that amino acid substitutions affecting the glycine residues of the GXXXG motif impaired α-factor receptor oligomerization and biogenesis in vivo but did not significantly impair agonist binding affinity. Mutant receptors exhibited signaling defects that were not due to impaired cell surface expression, indicating that oligomerization promotes α-factor receptor signal transduction.

Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar), and biochemical evidence indicates that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of GABABR1 and GABABR2 interact via non-covalent coiled-coil motifs (19.Kuner R. Kohr G. Grunewald S. Eisenhardt G. Bach A. Kornau H.C. Science. 1999; 283: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). TM6 may provide a contact site in β-adrenergic receptor dimers because a synthetic peptide corresponding to this region inhibits receptor dimer formation as detected by SDS-PAGE (13.Hebert T.E.

In other receptors, TM1 may provide a dimer or oligomer contact site, as suggested by computational studies of μ-opioid receptors (22.Filizola M. Weinstein H. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and atomic force microscopy and surface-area modeling of rhodopsin (23.Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Palczewski K. Engel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21655-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Dimer/oligomer interfaces involving TM4-TM4 and/or TM4/5-TM4/5 contacts have also been suggested for dopamine D2 receptors (24.Guo W. Shi L. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4385-4388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), rhodopsin (23.Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Palczewski K. Engel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21655-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), and γ-opioid receptors (22.Filizola M. Weinstein H. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on the preceding lines of evidence, various classes of GPCRs may differ in the TM domains they use to form a dimer interface. Alternatively, a given GPCR may have several contact sites involving multiple TM domains, resulting in the formation of oligomeric arrays. Indeed, intersubunit cysteine cross-linking studies of C5a receptors have led to the hypothesis that TM1 provides a dimer contact site, whereas an interface involving TM4/5 is used to assemble oligomeric arrays (25.Klco J.M. Lassere T.B. Baranski T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35345-35353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A variation of this mechanism has been suggested by atomic force microscopy and modeling studies of rhodopsin, which suggest that TM4/5 forms the dimer interface and TM1 is used to assemble dimers into oligomeric arrays (23.Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Palczewski K. Engel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21655-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that GPCRs of different classes may be segregated into separate arrays because different TM domain contacts are used to stabilize dimer and oligomer interfaces. To define the mechanisms and functions of GPCR oligomerization, we have studied the G protein-coupled α-factor receptor of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (STE2 gene product) as a genetically and biophysically tractable model. We showed initially by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments with intact cells or membrane fractions that this GPCR is constitutively dimeric/oligomeric in vivo (1.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Subsequent FRET studies of α-factor receptor deletion mutants suggested that TM1 is an important dimerization/ oligomerization interface, which may also involve the extracellular N terminus and TM2 (26.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41463-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Here we have explored the functions and mechanisms of GPCR oligomerization in vivo by characterizing oligomerization-defective point mutants of the α-factor receptor. The results suggest that a GXXXG motif in TM1 resembling the well characterized transmembrane dimerization domain of glycophorin A mediates oligomerization of the α-factor receptor, and that oligomerization promotes receptor biogenesis and signaling. Because similar sequence motifs are present in TM1 or other TMs of many mammalian GPCRs, the results obtained may be applicable toward understanding the mechanisms of dimer/oligomer formation by a variety of receptors. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were KBY58 (MATaura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3-Δ1 trp1 bar1Δ ste2Δ (27.Stefan C.J. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1835-1841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) and JE114-8A (MATaura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3-Δ1 trp1 sst2-1 ste2Δ::LEU2 (28.Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Cell. 1988; 55: 221-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar)), which lacks the RGS protein encoded by the SST2 gene. Deletion of the α-factor receptor structural gene (STE2) in these strains ensured that various receptor mutants expressed from plasmids were the only receptors present in cells. Unless stated otherwise, receptor constructs used in this study lacked sequences encoding the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, which is dispensable for agonist binding and signaling but is required for receptor internalization and desensitization (28.Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Cell. 1988; 55: 221-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Use of receptors lacking their C-terminal domains was required to detect FRET between co-expressed CFP- and YFP-tagged α-factor receptors, because the size and/or flexibility of the C-terminal domains of full-length receptors prevents detection of FRET (1.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 29.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Methods. 2002; 27: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Homophilic interaction between receptor point mutants was studied by co-expression of receptors from their native STE2 promoter on the high copy plasmids pRS423STE2Δtail-YFP and pRS424STE2Δtail-CFP (29.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Methods. 2002; 27: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Receptor mutants used for assays of agonist signaling and binding retained the full-length C-terminal tail and were expressed from the native STE2 promoter on a single copy plasmid pRS314STE2-3xmyc (30.Stefan C.J. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All mutations were created by use of the Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. The wild type receptor used in endocytosis assays of receptor oligomerization (1.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) was overexpressed from the constitutive PGK promoter on the high copy pPGK plasmid (31.Kang Y. Kane J. Kurjan J. Stadel J.M. Tipper D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FRET—Scanning fluorometry of intact viable yeast cells co-expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged wild type or mutant α-factor receptors was used to detect FRET between oligomerized receptors in vivo, as described in detail previously (1.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 29.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Methods. 2002; 27: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and irradiated in 3-ml glass cuvettes. Cells were irradiated at 425 nm to excite CFP and fluorescence emission was recorded from 450 to 610 nm, or irradiated at 510 nm to excite YFP and fluorescence emission was recorded from 520-610 nm. The FRET component of the emission spectrum obtained from cells co-expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged receptors was obtained by subtracting components due to CFP emission and YFP emission produced by direct excitation at 425 nm. The apparent efficiency of FRET was calculated by dividing the integrated FRET spectrum by the integrated emission spectrum obtained upon direct excitation of YFP (510 nm; emission recorded from 520 to 610 nm). Pheromone Response and Agonist Binding Assays—Quantitative assays of agonist-induced growth arrest (halo assays) were used to analyze receptor function (32.Sprague G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The responsiveness of cells to pheromone was determined by comparing the size of the zone of growth inhibition (halo) formed in response to various doses of α-factor in sterile paper disks applied to lawns of cells embedded in agar. Methods used to purify 35S-labeled α-factor and perform ligand-binding assays with inviable and intact cells have been described (30.Stefan C.J. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33.Blumer K.J. Reneke J.E. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10836-10842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding data were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard and fitted by nonlinear least squares regression. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled α-factor. Fluorescence Imaging and Endocytosis Assays of Receptor Oligomerization—Fluorescence and Nomarski images of cells expressing wild type and various receptor mutants tagged with YFP were captured by using a DAGE cooled CCD camera mounted on an Olympus BH-2 or IX81 microscope equipped with a PlanApo100UV ×100 objective, as described previously (27.Stefan C.J. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1835-1841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Endocytosis assays were performed as described previously (1.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells co-expressing full-length untagged wild type receptors overexpressed from the PGK1 promoter on the high copy plasmid pPGK and various tailless receptor mutants tagged with YFP expressed from the STE2 promoter on single copy plasmids were treated with agonist (5 μm α-factor). Images were collected before and at the indicated times after agonist treatment. 1000 cells were scored visually for the presence of motile endosomes (34.Chang F.S. Stefan C.J. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Yeast cells (KBY58) expressing YFP-tagged wild type or mutant forms of tailless α-factor receptors were grown to midlog phase, harvested, and lysed on ice by agitation with glass beads in buffer A (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide containing 8 m urea), transferred to nitro-cellulose, and blocked in 3% non-fat milk plus 3% bovine serum albumin in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20). Blots were incubated with a rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (gift of P. Silver, Harvard Medical School) diluted 1:2000 in PBST containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Blots were washed and incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) diluted 1:2000 in PBST. After blots were washed, proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). A Glycophorin A-like Dimerization Motif in TM1 of the α-Factor Receptor—Because our previous studies indicated that TM1 is critical for α-factor receptor oligomerization (26.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41463-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the purpose of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism by which TM1 promotes oligomerization by identifying point mutations that affect oligomerization in vivo. Besides providing insight into the mechanistic principles of α-factor receptor oligomerization, such mutants could also be used to assess effects on receptor biogenesis and function. Inspection of the TM1 sequence revealed a motif (52AIMF-GVRCGAAL63) similar to the GXXXG motif within the single transmembrane domain of glycophorin A that mediates dimerization of this membrane protein (35.Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Hunt J.F. Adair B.D. Bormann B.J. Dempsey C.E. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7683-7689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Engelman D.M. Adair B.D. Brunger A. Flanagan J.M. Hunt J.F. Lemmon M.A. Treutlein H. Zhang J. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1993; 48: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence motif in the α-factor receptor may be functionally important because saturation mutagenesis of TM1 has revealed that the two glycine residues are intolerant to substitution, in contrast to other regions of TM1 that are tolerant to a variety of amino acid substitutions (37.Martin N.P. Celic A. Dumont M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 765-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By modeling TM1 as an α-helix (37.Martin N.P. Celic A. Dumont M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 765-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), consistent with structural analyses of TM1 peptides (38.Xie H. Ding F.X. Schreiber D. Eng G. Liu S.F. Arshava B. Arevalo E. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15462-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39.Ding F.X. Xie H. Arshava B. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8945-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we compared the potential structure of this motif with that of the glycophorin A transmembrane domain (Fig. 1A) determined by NMR (40.MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 41.Smith S.O. Song D. Shekar S. Groesbeek M. Ziliox M. Aimoto S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6553-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the TM1 model and the glycophorin A transmembrane domain, the two glycine residues of the GXXXG motif form a groove on one side of the helix. Immediately adjacent to the groove of glycophorin A is a ridge of four bulky hydrophobic amino acids. Likewise, in TM1 of the α-factor receptor, three of four putative ridge residues have bulky side chains. In the glycophorin A dimer (Fig. 1A), the ridge residues of one subunit pack into the glycine groove of the other subunit, forming an extensive interface stabilized by van der Waals interactions. The GXXXG motif in TM1 of the α-factor receptor may be available to form a dimer/oligomer interface because mutagenesis and modeling studies suggest a receptor structure in which these residues are oriented toward the lipid rather than TM domains in the receptor monomer (Fig. 1B) (42.Parrish W. Eilers M. Ying W. Konopka J.B. Genetics. 2002; 160: 429-443PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations Affecting the Glycine Residues in the Glycophorin A-like Motif in TM1 Impair α-Factor Receptor Oligomerization and Biogenesis—We used information from mutagenesis of the glycophorin A dimerization motif to direct our studies aimed at determining whether the GXXXG motif in the α-factor receptor is involved in oligomerization. In glycophorin A, the glycine residues forming the groove are critical for dimerization. Substitution of either glycine residue with alanine significantly impairs dimerization, and replacement of a glycine residue with a bulky hydrophobic amino acid such as leucine more strongly disrupts dimerization (43.Lemmon M.A. Treutlein H.R. Adams P.D. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 44.Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 45.MacKenzie K.R. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, single alanine substitutions affecting residues of the ridge have less dramatic effects, probably because the remaining residues of the ridge provide contacts sufficient to stabilize the glycophorin A dimer. Accordingly, we targeted the glycine residues (Gly56 and Gly60) predicted to form the groove of the GXXXG motif in TM1 of the α-factor receptor, and we compared the ability of CFP- and YFP-tagged wild type and mutant receptors to self-associate in FRET experiments employing intact cells. The results indicated that receptors in which Gly56 or Gly60 was replaced by alanine displayed a significantly reduced ability to self-associate in vivo (FRET efficiency 6.4 ± 2.0% and 7.5 ± 1.6% for G56A and G60A mutants, respectively; Fig. 2A and Table I), as compared with the ability of wild type receptors to self-associate (FRET efficiency 12.4 ± 1.8%; Fig. 2A and Table I). The effects of these mutations on FRET efficiency were not due to significant differences in protein expression as indicated by immunoblotting of whole cell extracts (Fig. 2B). However, plasma membrane targeting of the glycine → alanine single mutant receptors was reduced 3-6-fold as indicated by the results of agonist binding assays using intact, inviable cells (Table I and data not shown). The results of these experiments also indicated that mutant receptors were not severely misfolded because their agonist binding affinities were similar to that of wild type receptors (Table I). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that GFP-tagged tailless mutant receptors were retained in the ER to a greater extent than wild type tailless receptors (Fig. 3), whereas full-length GFP-tagged mutant receptors displayed reduced cell surface expression and increased accumulation in endosomes and the lysosome-like vacuole as shown by co-staining with FM 4-64 (Fig. 3 and data not shown). However, ER targeting defects were unlikely to explain the reduced efficiency of FRET observed with tailless mutant receptors, because we have shown previously (26.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41463-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that wild type receptors self-associate with similar efficiency (FRET efficiency) in ER and plasma membrane fractions. Therefore, the present results suggested that oligomerization is required for efficient targeting of the α-factor receptor to the plasma membrane.Table IEffects of substitutions of the GXXXG motif in TM1 of the α-factor receptor on oligomerization, agonist binding affinity, and cell surface expression Oligomerization efficiency was determined by FRET and endocytosis assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” FRET efficiencies were calculated as the average of results from at least three independent transformants assayed in duplicate. Endocytosis efficiencies were calculated as the percentage of cells containing endosomes labeled with tail-less GFP-tagged forms of the indicated receptors under conditions where wild type untagged receptors were co-expressed, and cells were treated 1 h with agonist (5 μm).

This double mutant receptor was severely impaired in the ability to self-associate as indicated by a FRET efficiency (4.9 ± 1.0%; Fig. 2 and Table I) near the nonspecific background established in our previous studies (∼2-3% (26.Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41463-41472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, whereas this double mutant receptor was expressed normally at the protein level (Fig. 2B), it strongly mislocalized to the ER (tailless mutant) and the vacuole (full-length mutant) (Fig. 3). Consistent with these results, agonist binding assays revealed that cell surface expression of this mutant receptor was reduced 20-fold (Table I). However, the double mutant receptor had relatively normal agonist binding affinity, again indicating that mutations affecting the glycine residues of the GXXXG motif did not result in receptors that were grossly misfolded. Therefore, these results reinforced the conclusion that oligomerization is required for efficient biogenesis of the α-factor receptor. To provide an independent means of determining whether mutat"

Runx2 has therefore largely been regarded as a bone-specific transcription factor. Runx2–/– mice die shortly after birth and therefore the role of Runx2 in later developing tissues remains unclear. Here we show that the Runx2 protein is expressed in several mammary epithelial cell lines and in primary mammary epithelial cells. In addition, we have also found that it has a functionally important role in gene regulation. Osteopontin (OPN) is expressed in mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation and has been shown to have a role in mammary gland differentiation. Here we show that a Runx2 site in the OPN promoter is required for activation of the promoter in mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, dominant-negative Runx proteins can inhibit both activation of an OPN promoter reporter in transient transfections and expression of the endogenous OPN gene in mammary epithelial cells.

This appears to be the only other major site of Runx2 expression outside of the skeleton, suggesting that Runx2 has a role in gene regulation in the mammary gland. Runx2 expression has recently been reported in metastatic mammary epithelial cells and not in normal human mammary cells (4.Barnes G.L. Javed A. Waller S.M. Kamal M.H. Hebert K.E. Hassan M.Q. Bellahcene A. Van Wijnen A.J. Young M.F. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2631-2637PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that expression of Runx2 in metastatic breast cancer cells is ectopic, and that the expression of Runx2 in these cells may explain the osteoblastic phenotype of human breast cancer cells that metastasize to the bone (4.Barnes G.L. Javed A. Waller S.M. Kamal M.H. Hebert K.E. Hassan M.Q. Bellahcene A. Van Wijnen A.J. Young M.F. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2631-2637PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe two important findings that support a role for Runx2 in normal mammary epithelial cells. First, we show that Runx2 protein is expressed in mammary epithelial cell lines derived from normal mammary gland, non-metastatic mammary cancer cells and primary mammary epithelial cells. Second, Runx2 has a functionally important role in gene regulation in these cells.

OPN is a secreted integrin-binding extracellular matrix protein, which has several functions including stimulation of cell adhesion, cell signaling, cell migration, and protection against apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 9.Weber G.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1552: 61-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Since OPN is expressed in mammary epithelial cells we investigated the possibility that Runx2 might regulate OPN expression in these cells. We demonstrate that Runx2 from mammary epithelial cells binds a consensus recognition site in the OPN promoter and that this site is required for transcriptional activation in mammary epithelial cells. We also show that dominant-negative Runx proteins, and RNAi transcripts targeted against Runx2, can inhibit activation of the OPN promoter. Furthermore, expression of the endogenous OPN gene was inhibited by dominant-negative Runx proteins in mammary epithelial cells. osteopontin fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium electrophoretic mobility shift assay green fluorescent protein chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Our data demonstrate that Runx2 is expressed in primary, non-metastatic and non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, we have shown, for the first time, that the osteoblast transcription factor Runx2 has a role in the regulation of a gene that is expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the StrataPrep® Total RNA miniprep kit in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed by incubation with 1 μl of 5 μm oligo(dT) primer at 70 °C for 10 min, afterwhich 1 mm dNTPs, 40 units of rRNasin® (Promega), 5μl of reverse transcriptase buffer (HT Biotechnology), and 10.5 units of SUPER RT (HT Biotechnology) were added in a total volume of 25 μl. This was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h, 2 μl of the cDNA produced was used as a template for a PCR reaction. Amplification of Runx2 cDNA was achieved using primers Runx2P1 5′-ATTTAGGGCGCATTCCTCATC-3′ and Runx2P2 5′-TGTAATCTGACTCTGTCCTTGTGGAT-3′ (10.Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

For amplification of OPN cDNA primers OP5′ 5′-TGCACCCAGATCCTATAGCC-3′ and OP3′ 5′-GGAGTGAAAGTGTCTGCTTG-3′ were used (11.Miyazaki Y. Setoguchi M. Yoshida S. Higuchi Y. Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14432-14438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For amplification of GAPDH cDNA primers GAPDHP1 5′-CAGTATGACTCCACTCACGG-3′ and GAPDHP2 5′-TTGTCATGGATGACCTTGGC-3′ were used. PCR amplifications were achieved by 30 cycles of, 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 2 min, with a final extension step at 68 °C for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel, and relative amounts of DNA were quantified using Quantity One software (BioRad). Immunoblotting—Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (12.Shore P. Dietrich W. Corcoran L.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1767-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), equal amount of which were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a trans-blot S.D. cell (Bio-Rad). After blocking with TBS-0.05% Tween 20, 5% dried milk, the membrane was incubated with a polyclonal anti-Runx2 antibody raised against a Runx2-specific peptide, diluted 1:4000 (Oncogene research products). Following subsequent washes the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody, diluted 1:2000 (BD Pharmingen). Immune complexes were detected using Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) and visualized using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S multi-imager. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow fragment according to standard protocols (13.Sambrook J.E. F Fritsch T. Maniatis Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides, RunxTop 5′-CTAGAACTGACCGCAGCTGGCCGT-3′ and RunxBot 5′-CTAGACGGCCAGCTGCGGTCAGTT-3′ contain a Runx-binding site (Runx) and were used in EMSAs (14.Bae S.C. Ogawa E.

EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts and anti-Runx antibodies raised against specific peptides in accordance with manufacturer's instructions (Geneka Biotechnology). Samples were run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, which was then fixed and dried. Bands were detected by autoradiography. Plasmid Constructs—The OPN promoter was amplified by nested PCR from genomic DNA derived from HC11 cells using the following oligonucleotides. First round amplification primers were OPN5′P1 5′-GTTTAGATAGCATCAGAACC-3′ and OPN3′P2 5′-TGGACTCACCCTCAGAATTC-3′, second round amplification primers were OPN5′P3 5′-GATCGAGCTCGGTTCACGTCTCTAAAGGTC-3′ and OPN3′P4 5′-GATCAAGCTTTCCGAGAATGCCTGCCGCAG-3′ (11.Miyazaki Y.

The resulting 880-bp fragment was ligated into the SacI and HindIII sites of the pGL3-Basic firefly luciferase reporter vector (Promega). The Runx site in the OPN promoter was specifically mutated using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol with the oligonucleotides OPRunxmutP1 5′-TTTTTTTTAAAGGAGAAAACCAGAGG-3′ and OPRunxmutP2 5′-CCTCTGGTTTTCTCCTTTAAAAAAAA-3′. The RNAi expressing vector was constructed by ligation of the following annealed oligonucleotide pairs into the BamH1 and HindIII sites of the plasmid pSUPER (15.Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R.

The pGADD153i vector was kindly provided by Dr. Alan Dickson. 2A. Dickson, unpublished data. The RHD plasmid was constructed by insertion of the Runx1 Runt-domain into pCMV5. Runx2 and AML-1/ETO were expressed using pCMV-OSF2 and pCMVAML-1/ETO respectively (10.Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G.

Cell Culture—HC11 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 5μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma) and 10 ng/ml murine epidermal growth factor (Sigma). UMR-106 cells were cultured in DMEM with 4.5g/liter glucose 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. MDA-MB231, MCF-7, and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS, and 2 mml-glutamine (17.Prevost G. Foehrle E. Thomas F. Pihan I. Veber N. Starzec A. Israel L. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18.Takahashi K. Suzuki K. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MTSV1–7 cells were cultured in DMEM, 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (19.Baeckstrom D. Lu P.J. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4592-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MC-3T3 cells were cultured in αMEM with ascorbic acid, 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (20.Xiao Z.S. Hinson T.K. Quarles L.D. J. Cell Biochem. 1999; 74: 596-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Primary mammary epithelial cells were isolated from day 17 pregnant mice as previously described (21.Pullan S. Wilson J. Metcalfe A. Edwards G.M. Goberdhan N. Tilly J. Hickman J.A. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 631-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections—All cell lines were transfected in 24-well plates using LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 800 ng of DNA was used in each transfection. Each transfection contained 360 ng of the indicated reporter construct and 40 ng of pRLSV40 (Promega), which was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Five hours post-transfection the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with normal cell media. Twenty-four hours post-transfection the cells were lysed and the luciferase activity determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All transfections were performed in triplicate, and data is presented as mean values with standard deviation. All values are relative to the activity of the pGL3-Basic reporter. For analysis of the endogenous OPN expression 1 × 106 HC11 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pGFP and 1 μg of the stated expression construct, using LipofectAMINE2000 in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours post-transfection the cells were harvested and FACS sorted and the viable transfected cells were collected. Total RNA was harvested from 3.6 × 105 of these cells, and was analyzed by RT-PCR. For RNAi-expressing plasmids HC11 cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of pSUPER, pRunx2i, or pGADD153i. Forty-eight hours post-transfection the cells were further transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA. Each transfection contained 360 ng of either pGL3-Basic or pGL3BasicOPNwt, 40 ng of pRLSV40, which was used to normalize for transfection efficiency, and 600 ng of either pSUPER, pRunx2i, or pGADD153i as indicated. The cells were lysed 48 h after the second transfection and luciferase activity was determined. Runx2 Protein Is Expressed in Mammary Epithelial Cells— HC11 cells are mammary epithelial cells derived from mice in mid-pregnancy, they maintain the ability to express milk proteins in response to lactogenic hormones and are an established model for studying gene expression in non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (22.Ball R.K. Friis R.R. Schoenenberger C.A. Doppler W. Groner B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2089-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 23.Doppler W. Groner B. Ball R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 24.Schmitt-Ney M. Doppler W. Ball R.K. Groner B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Stoecklin E. Wissler M. Moriggl R. Groner B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6708-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 26.Kampfer S. Hellbert K. Villunger A. Doppler W. Baier G. Grunicke H.H. Uberall F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4046-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). HC11 cells were therefore used to investigate the expression of Runx2. RT-PCR was performed on total RNA derived from HC11 cells and the pre-osteoblast cell line MC-3T3, which is known to express Runx2 (Fig. 1A; Ref. 20.Xiao Z.S. Hinson T.K. Quarles L.D. J. Cell Biochem. 1999; 74: 596-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Runx2 transcripts were detected in HC11 and MC-3T3 cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4) but not in HeLa cells, which do not express Runx2 (data not shown; Ref. 16.Linggi B. Muller-Tidow C. van de Locht L. Hu M. Nip J. Serve H. Berdel W.E. van der Reijden B. Quelle D.E. Rowley J.D. Cleveland J. Jansen J.H. Pandolfi P.P. Hiebert S.W. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A further control for specific Runx2 transcript expression was performed by treatment of HC11 cells with the vitamin D3 hormone, 1,25(OH)2D3. Stimulation of osteoblasts with 1,25(OH)2D3 has been shown to abolish Runx2 expression (10.Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3684) Google Scholar). Since HC11 cells are known to express functional vitamin D3 receptors we tested whether 1,25(OH)2D3 also down-regulates Runx2 expression in HC11 cells (Fig. 1B; Ref. 27.Escaleira M.T. Brentani M.M. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 54: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Treatment of HC11 cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 almost completely abolished Runx2 transcripts in HC11 cells but had no effect on GAPDH expression (Fig. 1B), indicating that Runx2 expression is regulated in a similar manner by 1,25(OH)2D3 in mammary epithelial cells and osteoblasts. To establish if functional Runx2 protein is present in HC11 cells, nuclear extracts were incubated with the Runx2-binding site from the OPN promoter and the formation of specific complexes was determined by EMSA. Specific binding activity was first determined by a competition assay. A double-stranded radiolabeled oligonucleotide encompassing the Runx site at position –128 to –123 bp in the OPN promoter (RunxOPN, Fig. 1C) was used in the competition assays with a known Runx-binding site (Runx, Fig. 1C) and a mutant form of the OPN Runx site (MRunxOPN, Fig. 1C). When the RunxOPN site was incubated with nuclear extracts from HC11 cells a specific retarded complex was observed (Fig. 1D, lane 1). This complex was abolished in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of either the wild-type RunxOPN site or an alternative Runx-binding site (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, the mutated OPN Runx site did not abrogate binding (Fig. 1D, lane 4). These data demonstrate that the Runx site in the OPN promoter can be specifically bound by a factor in mammary epithelial cells. To establish if the Runx protein present in HC11 cells was Runx2 the RunxOPN probe was incubated with nuclear extracts in the presence of a Runx2-specific antibody (Fig. 1E). The entire specific complex was supershifted by the anti-Runx2 antibody (Fig. 1E, lane 3). In contrast no supershifted complex was observed when the Runx1 antibody was used as a control (Fig. 1E, lane 2). Nuclear extracts from Jurkat T cells, which are known to express Runx1, were used to confirm that the anti-Runx1 antibody was functional (Fig. 1E, lanes 4–6). These results clearly show that Runx2 is expressed in HC11 cells and that it specifically binds to the Runx site in the OPN promoter. Runx2 Is Expressed in Mammary Cancer Cell Lines and Primary Mammary Cells—To determine if Runx2 is expressed in other mammary epithelial cells, immunoblotting was performed on nuclear extracts from several cell lines (Fig. 2A). UMR-106 cells are an osteosarcoma cell line known to express Runx2 and were used as a positive control (Fig. 2A, lane 5; Ref. 28.Banerjee C. McCabe L.R. Choi J.Y. Hiebert S.W. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 66: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The 64kDa Runx2 isoform was detected in nuclear extracts derived from all the mammary epithelial cell lines tested (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4). A slightly larger protein was also detected in MCF-7 and HC11 cells, which may correspond to a phosphorylated version of Runx2 as previously observed in human bone marrow cells (29.Sun L. Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar). We next sought to establish whether Runx2 DNA binding activity was present in the mammary epithelial cells. An EMSA was performed using nuclear extract from each of the mammary cell lines and a radiolabeled consensus Runx site (Fig. 2B). Several complexes were formed with each of the mammary epithelial cell nuclear extracts and with nuclear extract from UMR-106 cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 11). Upon addition of the anti-Runx2 antibody a larger supershifted complex was observed in nuclear extracts derived from mammary epithelial and UMR-106 cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12). In contrast, the anti-Runx2 antibody did not form a complex when incubated with nuclear extract derived from HeLa cells, which are known not to express Runx2 (Fig. 2B, lane 10; Ref. 16.Linggi B. Muller-Tidow C. van de Locht L. Hu M. Nip J. Serve H. Berdel W.E. van der Reijden B. Quelle D.E. Rowley J.D. Cleveland J. Jansen J.H. Pandolfi P.P. Hiebert S.W. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To determine whether Runx2 is expressed in primary mammary epithelial cells an EMSA was performed using nuclear extract from primary cells that were obtained from mouse mammary gland. When the nuclear extract was incubated with a radiolabeled Runx site two major complexes were observed (Fig. 2B, lane 13). Upon incubation with the anti-Runx2 antibody a supershifted complex was observed and the lower complex was diminished, indicating that the lower complex contains Runx2 (Fig. 2B, lane 14). Taken together these data clearly demonstrate that Runx2 is expressed in mammary epithelial cells of varying origin. Of particular importance is the finding that Runx2 expression is not restricted to metastatic breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231) but is also clearly expressed in non-metastatic breast cancer cells (MCF-7), nontumorigenic (HC11) and primary mammary epithelial cells. Runx2 Contributes to Transcriptional Activation of the OPN Promoter in Mammary Epithelial Cells—Having shown that Runx2 is expressed in mammary epithelial cells we next sought to establish whether it has a functionally important role in gene regulation. OPN is expressed in mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation and has been shown to have a role in mammary gland differentiation (6.Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Papadopoulos A. Tenen D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 996: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 7.Brown L.F. Berse B. Van de Water L. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Perruzzi C.A. Manseau E.J. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 969-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Runx site in the OPN promoter was required for transcriptional activation in mammary epithelial cells three different cell lines, HC11, HeLa, and UMR-106, were transfected with an OPN promoter reporter plasmid, containing either the wild-type promoter (pGL3B-OPNwt, Fig. 3A) or one in which the Runx site was mutated (pGL3B-OPNmut; Fig. 3A). Comparison of the activity of the wild-type OPN promoter in the three cell types revealed that the basal level of activity was similar in the HC11 and UMR-106 cells but significantly less in HeLa cells (Fig. 3B). When the Runx site was mutated the activity of the promoter in HC11 and UMR-106 cells was reduced by ∼50%; this activity is equal to that observed with the wild-type promoter in HeLa cells. In contrast, the activity of the mutated promoter in HeLa cells was not significantly affected (Fig. 3B). These data clearly demonstrate that the Runx site is essential for full transcriptional activity of the OPN promoter in HC11 cells. To test whether Runx2 is able to activate the OPN promoter in mammary epithelial cells, HC11 cells were co-transfected with the OPN reporter plasmids and increasing amounts of a Runx2 expression plasmid (Fig. 3C). Heterologous expression of Runx2 increased the transcriptional activity of the wild-type OPN reporter at all levels tested. In contrast, mutation of the Runx site in the OPN promoter rendered the promoter unresponsive to Runx2. These observations demonstrate that Runx2 can act as a transcriptional activator of the OPN gene in HC11 cells. Dominant-negative Runx Proteins Inhibit OPN Promoter Activity—To determine whether dominant-negative Runx proteins can repress the activity of the OPN promoter via the Runx site in mammary epithelial cells we co-transfected HC11 cells with the OPN promoter reporters and a plasmid encoding AML-1/ETO. AML-1/ETO is a repressive form of Runx1 arising from the (8.Nemir M. Bhattacharyya D. Li X. Singh K. Mukherjee A.B. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 969-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar; 21.Pullan S. Wilson J. Metcalfe A. Edwards G.M. Goberdhan N. Tilly J. Hickman J.A. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 31.Uchida H. Zhang J. Nimer S.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2251-2258PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Lutterbach B. Hiebert S.W.

Med. 2002; 8: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). When the wild-type OPN promoter was co-transfected with the AML-1/ETO-expressing construct, transcriptional activity of the promoter was inhibited with a maximum 6.2-fold inhibition observed with 400 ng of AML-1/ETO expression plasmid (Fig. 4A, OPNwt). When AML-1/ETO was co-expressed with the OPN promoter containing the mutated Runx site, we observed maximum inhibition of only 2-fold (Fig. 4A, OPNmut). AML-1/ETO also repressed the OPN promoter in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-7, demonstrating that this effect is not restricted to HC11 cells (Fig. 4B). The inhibitory effect of AML-1/ETO was not particular to this oncogenic protein as we observed almost identical inhibition when an isolated Runt-domain (RHD), which is known to act as a dominant-negative, was used to compete for endogenous protein (Fig. 4C, Ref. 29.Sun L. Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant-negative proteins appear to mediate their effect largely via the Runx site at position –128 to –123 bp in the OPN promoter. However, we note that some level of inhibition occurred when the Runx site was mutated. This is possibly mediated via a second Runx site at position –695 to –690 bp. Although this second Runx site has previously been shown not to be required for OPN transcription in osteoblasts, it is possible that it has a minor role in mammary epithelial cells (5.Sato M. Morii E. Komori T. Kawahata H. Sugimoto M. Terai K. Shimizu H. Yasui T. Ogihara H. Yasui N. et al.Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1517-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To establish whether endogenous Runx2 contributes to the transcriptional activity of the OPN promoter, HC11 cells were co-transfected with the OPN promoter reporters and a pSUPER plasmid expressing an RNAi transcript targeted against Runx2 (pRunx2i). When the OPN promoter was cotransfected with pRunx2i, transcriptional activity of the promoter was reduced by more than 50% (Fig. 4D). In contrast, co-transfection of the OPN promoter reporter with a control pSUPER plasmid, expressing RNAi transcripts targeted against GADD153 (pGADD153i), had no effect on the activity of the OPN promoter (Fig. 4D). Endogenous OPN Expression Can Be Inhibited by Dominant-negative Runx Proteins—We attempted to detect Runx2 bound to the endogenous OPN promoter by ChIP assay but were unable to do so in HC11 cells or in control osteoblasts, although we have previously shown Runx1 bound to an endogenous promoter (data not shown; Ref. 33.Bristow C.A. Shore P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this is that the antibody epitope is inaccessible when Runx2 is bound to the promoter, where it is likely to be part of a larger nucleoprotein complex. We therefore determined whether expression of the endogenous OPN gene could be inhibited by dominant-negative Runx proteins. HC11 cells were co-transfected with a GFP expression plasmid and either the AML-1/ETO or RHD expression plasmids (Fig. 5). Viable transfected cells were isolated by FACS. RNA was prepared from these cells and RT-PCR performed. The level of endogenous OPN mRNA expression was decreased by 3.4-fold in cells transfected with either the AML-1/ETO or the RHD expression plasmids, thus clearly demonstrating that dominant-negative Runx proteins can inhibit expression of the endogenous OPN gene in mammary epithelial cells (Fig. 5). Taken together with the EMSA and RNAi data this strongly suggests that Runx2 contributes to the transcriptional regulation of the endogenous OPN gene in mammary epithelial cells. The reported phenotypic defects observed in Runx2-deficient mice are largely limited to the skeleton, Runx2 has therefore been regarded as a transcriptional regulator specific to osteoblasts and chondrocytes (1.Otto F. Thornell A.P. Crompton T. Denzel A. Gilmour K.C. Rosewell I.R. Stamp G.W. Beddington R.S. Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. Selby P.B. Owen M.J.

Cell Biochem. 2002; 87: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this report we have clearly demonstrated that Runx2 is also expressed in mammary epithelial cells. We observed Runx2 expression in several different mammary epithelial cell lines and in primary mammary epithelial cells. We have also shown that Runx2 has functional significance in mammary epithelial cells, by demonstrating its role in OPN gene expression. These findings therefore indicate that, in addition to its role in skeletal development, Runx2 also has a role in regulating gene expression in the mammary gland. Our finding that Runx2 is expressed in primary mammary epithelial cells is consistent with the observation that mice containing a targeted replacement of Runx2 with LacZ showed β-galactosidase activity in the epithelium of the nascent mammary gland (1.Otto F. Thornell A.P. Crompton T. Denzel A. Gilmour K.C. Rosewell I.R. Stamp G.W. Beddington R.S. Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. Selby P.B. Owen M.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). However, this contrasts with a recent report that demonstrated expression of Runx2 in metastatic breast cancer cells which metastasise to the bone, and not in normal human mammary cells (4.Barnes G.L. Javed A. Waller S.M. Kamal M.H. Hebert K.E. Hassan M.Q. Bellahcene A. Van Wijnen A.J. Young M.F. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2631-2637PubMed Google Scholar). The authors proposed that expression of Runx2 in metastatic mammary epithelial cells is ectopic and that this may explain the osteoblastic phenotype of human breast cancer cells that metastasise to the bone. However, we have clearly shown that in addition to expression in metastatic cells, Runx2 is expressed in primary, non-metastatic and nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. The differences between Runx2 expression in normal mammary epithelial cells may reflect a species difference; we examined Runx2 expression in mice whereas the previous report analyzed human cells (4.Barnes G.L. Javed A. Waller S.M. Kamal M.H. Hebert K.E. Hassan M.Q. Bellahcene A. Van Wijnen A.J. Young M.F. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2631-2637PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, Runx2 expression may be regulated throughout mammary gland development; we obtained primary mammary epithelial cells from day 17 pregnant mice when we would expect OPN to be expressed. However, it is not clear at which stage of development the human breast cells were obtained (4.Barnes G.L. Javed A. Waller S.M. Kamal M.H. Hebert K.E. Hassan M.Q. Bellahcene A. Van Wijnen A.J. Young M.F. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2631-2637PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of any potential species differences in Runx2 expression we have shown that non-metastatic human mammary epithelial cells (MCF-7) also express Runx2. If Runx2 does contribute to the bone metastatic potential of mammary epithelial cells then it is possible that Runx2 activity is aberrantly regulated in these cells. The mammary gland is an estrogen responsive tissue and estrogen has been shown to enhance Runx2 activity in osteoblasts via the direct interaction of the estrogen receptor with Runx2, independently of changes in Runx2 expression (34.McCarthy T.L. Chang W.Z. Liu Y. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43121-43129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have found that Runx2 DNA-binding activity was unaltered when HC11 cells were treated with estradiol in phenol red-free media. 3C. K. Inman and P. Shore, unpublished observation. In addition we did not observe an increase in OPN promoter reporter activity when HC11 cells were treated with estradiol in phenol red free media, suggesting that estradiol does not activate OPN expression via Runx2. 3C. K. Inman and P. Shore, unpublished observation. However, it is possible that alternative Runx2 target genes are regulated by estrogen via recruitment of the estrogen receptor by Runx2 in mammary epithelial cells. Since Runx2–/– mice die shortly after birth the role of Runx2 in the mammary gland in vivo has not been established. The mammary epithelium normally expresses high levels of OPN during pregnancy and lactation, and targeted inhibition of OPN in the mammary gland caused abnormal differentiation and development (8.Nemir M. Bhattacharyya D. Li X. Singh K. Mukherjee A.B. Mukherjee B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 969-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our finding that Runx2 can regulate expression of OPN in mammary epithelial cells is therefore the first evidence that Runx2 has a role in regulating expression of a gene that is normally expressed in the mammary gland. In summary, the data presented clearly demonstrate that Runx2 is expressed in several mammary epithelial cell lines and is not restricted to metastatic cells. Indeed, Runx2 is also expressed in mouse primary mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, we have shown that Runx2 has a functional role in the regulation of gene expression in mammary epithelial cells.

The present study showed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 causes cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition through p53-independent induction of GADD45 in ovarian cancer cells. Detailed analyses have established GADD45 as a primary target gene for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. A DR3-type vitamin D response element was identified in the fourth exon of GADD45 that forms a complex with the vitamin D receptor·retinoid X receptor heterodimer in electrophoresis mobility shift assays and mediates the dose-dependent induction of luciferase activity by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in reporter assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have shown that the vitamin D receptor is recruited in a ligand-dependent manner to the exonic enhancer but not to the GADD45 promoter regions. In ovarian cancer cells expressing GADD45 antisense cDNA or GADD45-null mouse embryo fibroblasts, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 failed to induce G2/M arrest. Taken together, these results identify GADD45 as an important mediator for the tumor-suppressing activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in human ovarian cancer cells. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 suppresses the growth of multiple human cancer cell lines by inhibiting cell cycle progression and inducing cell death.

This superfamily includes receptors for steroids such as progesterone, androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids; receptors for non-steroid hormones like vitamin D, thyroid hormones, all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid; and orphan receptors for which the ligand is unknown. VDR and other non-steroid receptor members of the superfamily form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), the receptor for 9-cis-retinoic acid. In most cases, the VDR·RXR heterodimer binds VD response elements (VDREs) to mediate the biological activities of VD through transcriptional activation or repression of target genes containing VDREs in their regulatory sequence. In response to VD activation, the VDR recruits multiple coactivators, including members of the p160 steroid receptor coactivator family (6Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J.

In addition to its well defined role in calcium homeostasis and bone cell metabolism, the active metabolite of VD, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25VD), modulates cellular proliferation and differentiation of both normal and malignant cells (8Feldman D.

Similar to breast and prostate cancers, ovarian cancer (OCa) mortality and incident rates are lower in countries within 20° of the equator (19Waterhouse J. Muir C. Correa P. Powell J. Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. Vol. 3. IARC, Lyon, France1976Google Scholar) where there is a high amount of sunlight. In the United States, women between the ages of 45 and 54 living in the north have 5 times the OCa mortality rate than women living in southern states (20Devasa D.J. Grauman W.J. Blot G.A.

Waterhouse J. Mack T. Powell J. Whelan S. Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. Vol. 5. IARC, Lyon, France1987Google Scholar). In the epidermis, sunlight controls the first step of 1,25VD synthesis, namely the photoconversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to pre-vitamin D3. Exposure to sunlight, rather than food consumption, is the primary source of 1,25VD (22Lefkowitz E.S. Garland C.F. Int. J. Epidemiol. 1994; 23: 1133-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The inverse correlation between sunlight exposure and OCa mortality indicates that decreased synthesis of 1,25VD may contribute to OCa initiation and/or progression. VDR has been found in rat ovaries by immunohistochemistry (23Johnson J.A. Grande J.P. Roche P.C. Kumar R. Histochem.

GADD45α (GADD45) is a DNA damage-induced and p53-regulated gene that plays an essential role in cell cycle and DNA repair (27Smith M.L. Kontny H.U. Zhan Q. Sreenath A. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J.

Regulation of GADD45 expression by 1,25VD was p53-independent and mediated through a VDRE localized to the 3′ untranslated region in the fourth exon. Studies with cells in which GADD45 expression is compromised have shown that GADD45 is required for 1,25VD-induced arrest at G2/M.

The forward primer contains an MluI and the reverse primer contains a BglII site. The amplified PCR fragment was cloned into the MluI and BglII sites of pGL3-promoter vector. Luc1 was generated by digesting the GADDLuc with KpnI and religation. Luc2 was generated by digesting GADDLuc with MluI and EcoRI, filling with Klenow fragments, and religation.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (CHIP) Assays—For CHIP assays, OVCAR3 cells were treated with EtOH or 10–7m 1,25VD for 60 min and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. Then the cells were lysed in buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm PIPES, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture. Cell nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH. 8.1), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture.

Immunoblotting Analysis and in Vitro Immunocomplex Kinase Assays—Immunoblotting analysis of GADD45 protein was performed as described previously (38Zhang X. Ma L. Enkemann S.A. Pledger W.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis of Cdc2, cyclin B1, VDR, and β-actin was performed similar to that for GADD45 except that the cell extracts were prepared in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture. In vitro immunocomplex kinase assays were performed as described previously (42Bai W.L. Singh B. Karshin W.L. Shonk R.A. Arlinghaus R.B. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1715-1723PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, cellular extracts were prepared in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture and immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin B1 antibody. Kinase assays were performed at 30 °C in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 3 μg of histone H1, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated by adding 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated histone H1 was visualized by autoradiography. Establishment of Stable Clones from OVCAR3 Cells—OVCAR3 cells were transfected with 10 μg of pCMVAS45 plasmid and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3 for the establishment of GADD45 antisense stable clones or with pcDNA3 alone for the Vector-OVCAR3 controls. For the establishment of stable clones with GADDLuc reporter, OVCAR3 cells were transfected with 10 μg of GADDLuc plasmid and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3. All stable clones were obtained through selection with 100 μg/ml G418 for a period of about 4 weeks and clonal isolation with glass cylinders. 1,25VD Suppresses OCa Cell Growth and Induces Cell Cycle Arrest at G1/S and G2/M—To better understand the molecular mechanism of VD action in OCa cells, we tested the response of OCa cells to 1,25VD in proliferation assays. The cells were treated with vehicle or 10–7m 1,25VD for 6 or 9 days, and cell growth was analyzed by MTT assays. As shown in Fig. 1A, OVCAR3 cell growth decreased in the presence of 10–7m 1,25VD in a time-dependent manner, confirming the sensitivity of OVCAR3 to 1,25VD (26Saunders D.E. Christensen C. Lawrence W.D. Malviya V.K. Malone J.M. Williams J.R. Deppe G. Gynecol. Oncol. 1992; 44: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Since the cell growth was not significantly affected by 1,25VD at concentrations of 10–8m or lower (data not shown), it appears that there is a threshold to the action of 1,25VD. To determine the mechanism underlying the 1,25VD-induced growth suppression, OVCAR3 cells were treated with vehicle or 10–7m 1,25VD for 9 days and analyzed by flow cytometry. Fig. 1B shows that 1,25VD decreased the percentage of cells in the S phase, which was accompanied by an accumulation of cells in G0/G1 and G2/M. This suggests that 1,25VD causes cell cycle arrest at both G1/S and G2/M checkpoints. The increase in G0/G1 was estimated as 13%, while the percentage of cells at G2/M increased by 8% (Fig. 1C), suggesting that cell cycle arrest at both checkpoints contributed roughly equally to the growth-suppressing activity of 1,25VD. At variance with drugs used in conventional cancer chemotherapy, inhibition of cancer cell growth by 1,25VD is a chronic process, explaining why the effect on the cell cycle is modest and requires treatment for a longer time. GADD45 Is a Primary and Immediate Early Response Gene for 1,25VD in OCa Cells—To identify the genes that mediate the inhibitory effects of 1,25VD on cell cycle progression, a preliminary microarray analysis was performed to screen for genes that are differentially expressed in OCa cells treated with vehicle versus 10–7m 1,25VD. Among the many differentially expressed genes, GADD45 was one of the genes that were potentially up-regulated by 1,25VD (data not shown). Since GADD45 has a well established role in cell cycle control (28Wang X.W. Zhan Q. Coursen J.D. Khan M.A. Kontny H.U. Yu L. Hollander M.C. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2892-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and a suggested role in ovarian tumorigenesis (43Hollander M.C. Kovalsky O. Salvador J.M. Kim K.E. Patterson A.D. Haines D.C. Fornace Jr., A.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2487-2491PubMed Google Scholar), we carried out Northern blotting to confirm the GADD45 regulation by 1,25VD. Compared with cells treated with vehicle, 10–7m 1,25VD significantly increased GADD45 mRNA levels, whereas 10–8m 1,25VD caused a barely detectable increase (Fig. 2A), showing that the induction of GADD45 mRNA by 1,25VD is dose-dependent. The induction was detectable as early as 2 h following 1,25VD treatment with maximum induction detected at 8 h (Fig. 2B), suggesting that GADD45 is an immediate early response gene for 1,25VD. Treatment for times longer than 8 h maintained the induction but did not further enhance it. The levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were not affected by 1,25VD, showing the specificity of the effect of 1,25VD on GADD45. The stability of GADD45 mRNA, as measured in the presence of an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, actinomycin D, was not different between cells treated with vehicle and 1,25VD (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the regulation of GADD45 by 1,25VD is transcriptional. Although the induction of GADD45 decreased (Fig. 2D), it persisted in the presence of an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide. This shows that GADD45 induction by 1,25VD does not require new protein synthesis, thus identifying GADD45 as a primary target gene for 1,25VD in OCa cells. This is consistent with similar data in squamous cell carcinoma (44Prudencio J. Akutsu N. Benlimame N. Wang T. Bastien Y. Lin R. Black M.J. Alaoui-Jamali M.A. White J.H. J. Natl.

A Novel VDRE in the 3′ Untranslated Region of GADD45 mRNA Mediates the Transcriptional Up-regulation of GADD45 by 1,25VD—To define the specific DNA elements that mediate the induction of GADD45 by 1,25VD, the genomic sequence of GADD45 was examined for the presence of putative VDREs. Based on similarity to the consensus VDRE sequence (46Toell A. Polly P. Carlberg C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the VDRE sequence of known VD target genes, such as osteopontin (47Noda M. Vogel R.L. Craig A.M. Prahl J. DeLuca H.F. Denhardt D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9995-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and osteocalcin (OC) (48Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.C. Verkest V. McMenemy M.L. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), five putative DR3-type VDREs were identified (Fig. 3A). Four were in introns, one was in exon 4, but none were in the 5′ promoter region. To test which of the five putative VDREs binds the receptors, EMSAs were performed with recombinant VDR and RXR proteins. As shown in Fig. 3B, our conditions allowed the detection of a specific VDR·RXR complex with the OC VDRE. The complex is up-shifted by an RXR antibody and decreased by excess cold OC probe (upper panel). Under the same conditions, all putative VDREs except VDRE-C bound RXR·VDR with an affinity comparable to OC VDRE (Fig. 3B, lower panel). The binding is specific for the VDR·RXR heterodimer since neither VDR nor RXR alone formed a detectable complex with the VDRE probes. The VDREs were displaced from the complexes with an excess amount of cold OC VDRE but were not affected by the putative VDRE-C that did not bind VDR·RXR (Fig. 3C). These data show that VDR·RXR binding is specific. The RXR antibody up-shifted the complex, while a non-related antibody did not, confirming the presence of RXR in the complex. To determine whether VDREs binding the receptors in vitro mediate the induction of GADD45 by 1,25VD in OVCAR3 cells, a reporter gene was constructed with a 2.6-kb genomic DNA fragment of GADD45 containing all the putative VDREs located upstream of SV40 promoter and the cDNA of firefly luciferase gene (Fig. 4A). In OVCAR3 cells transiently transfected with this reporter, 1,25VD induced the luciferase activity in a dose- (Fig. 4B) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). This induction was also detected in OVCAR3 cells in which the reporter was stably integrated into the genome (Fig. 4D), showing that it is not an artifact of the transient transfection. Expression of additional VDR, RXR, or both did not further increase the reporter activity in OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 4E), suggesting that endogenous VDR and RXR in OVCAR3 cells are sufficient for such induction. To test whether 1,25VD regulates the GADD45 reporter through VDR, the activation of the reporter was tested in HeLa cells that lack functional VDR. As shown in Fig. 5A, 1,25VD did not induce the activity of a known VDR reporter, p23, that was constructed with the promoter of 24-hydroxylase (35Arbour N.C. Ross T.K. Zierold C. Prahl J.M. DeLuca H.F. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The induction of p23 reporter was restored by the ectopic expression of VDR in HeLa cells. Similar to the p23 reporter, 1,25VD did not cause measurable induction of luciferase activity from the GADD45 reporter in HeLa cells (Fig. 5B). Co-transfection with VDR restored the induction in a manner that depends on the dose of the transfected receptor (Fig. 5B). Transfection with RXR alone did not affect reporter activity, but its co-transfection with VDR enhanced the induction compared with cells transfected with VDR alone. Similar to the results with OVCAR3 cells, 1,25VD induced reporter activity in HeLa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner after receptor transfection (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that the reg"
https://openalex.org/W2024727395,"Rac1 is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, which control signaling pathways that regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics and gene transcription. Rac1 is activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and inactivated by GTPase-activating proteins. In addition, Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitors (Rho-GDIs) can inhibit Rac1 by sequestering it in the cytoplasm. We have found previously that colorectal tumors express an alternatively spliced variant, Rac1b, containing 19 additional amino acids following the switch II region. Here we characterized the regulation and downstream signaling of Rac1b. Although little Rac1b protein is expressed in cells, the amount of activated Rac1b protein often exceeds that of activated Rac1, suggesting that Rac1b contributes significantly to the downstream signaling of Rac in cells. The regulation of both Rac1 and Rac1b activities is dependent on guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins, but the difference in their activation is mainly determined by the inability of Rac1b to interact with Rho-GDI. As a consequence, most Rac1b remains bound to the plasma membrane and is not sequestered by Rho-GDI in the cytoplasm. Unlike Rac1, activated Rac1b is unable to induce lamellipodia formation and is unable to bind and activate p21-activated protein kinase nor activate the downstream protein kinase JNK. However, both Rac1 and Rac1b are able to activate NFκB to the same extent. These data suggest that alternative splicing of Rac1 leads to a highly active Rac variant that differs in regulation and downstream signaling.

Following its activation Rac1 can interact with several downstream effector molecules and trigger various cellular responses.

Furthermore, active Rac1 binds to IRSp53, which results in activation of WAVE2 and subsequent stimulation of actin polymerization and lamellipodia formation (6.Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S.

Commun. 2000; 277: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), these 19 amino acids were found encoded in an additional exon of Rac1. Rac1b is thus derived from the RAC1 gene by alternative splicing. Here we have characterized the Rac1b protein and found that alternative splicing generates a highly activated variant of Rac1 with altered GTPase regulation and selective downstream signaling. Cell Culture and Transfection—Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HT29, SW480, ZR75.1, HeLa) or 10% bovine serum (NIH 3T3) (Invitrogen) and regularly checked for mycoplasm infection. For transfections, cells at 50–75% confluence were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cells were analyzed after 16 or 22 h, respectively. Total amounts of transfected DNA for biochemical assays were 4 μg with SW480 or HT29 and 2 μg with NIH 3T3 cells (60-mm dishes). For immunofluorescence, 2 or 1 μg, respectively, was used in 35-mm dishes. When required the amount of DNA was adjusted with empty vector. Transfection efficiencies were 40–80% depending on the cell type used and as judged by co-transfection with pEGFP. To analyze Rho-GDI inhibition of endogenous Rac1b, 1.5 × 107 HT29 cells were divided into six 60-mm dishes and transfected individually (0.5 μg of GDI each dish), and the lysates were subsequently pooled. DNA Plasmids and Constructs—Rac1 and Rac1b cDNAs were amplified using a Δatg 5′ primer containing a BamHI restriction site and a 3′ primer containing an EcoRI restriction site (28.Matos P. Skaug J.

The PCR products were cloned in pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), sequenced (ABI Prism 3100 automated DNA sequencer), and then subcloned into the pcDNA3-Myc plasmid. The c-Myc and HA epitope sequences were inserted as annealed oligonucleotides between the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). pcDNA3.1-GFP-Rac1b was generated by exchange of a BstXI-EcoR1 fragment between pcDNA3-Myc-Rac1b and pcDNA3.1-GFP-Rac1 (29.Akhtar N. Hudson K.R. Hotchin N.A. Cell Adh. Commun. 2000; 7: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-HA-Rho-GDIα was generated exchanging the complete GDI cDNA sequence from pGEX-2T-Rho-GDIα into pcDNA3-HA plasmid, using the flanking BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The Bcr GAP variant 1 cDNA from pCMV5-Bcr-GAP and PAK1 cDNA from pCMV6-Myc-PAK1 were subcloned into pCMV2-FLAG (Sigma). IκB was cloned into pcDNA3-Myc following amplification from pcDNA3-IκB with primers containing a BamHI and EcoRI restrictions site. All constructs were verified by automatic DNA sequencing. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Samples were boiled for 10 min, centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 30 s, and resolved in 12–15% SDS-PAGE mini-gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) membranes using a Mini Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed using the indicated antibodies, and specific binding was detected via a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad) followed by chemiluminescence. Monoclonal anti-Myc 9E10 and anti-HA 12CA5 were from Roche Applied Science. Polyclonal anti-Myc was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polyclonal anti-HA and monoclonal anti-FLAG were from Sigma. Anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. Anti-β-catenin was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-active JNK was from Promega. Anti-phospho IκB was from Hypromatrix, and anti-phospho-PAK1 was from Cell Signaling. Anti-Rac1b serum was produced by Sigma-Genosys according to their standard immunization protocol by coupling the peptide VGETYGKDITSRGKDKPIAC to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The serum was affinity-purified on a peptide-Sepharose column. Rac Pull-down Experiments and Immunoprecipitation—1–1.5 × 107 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and used for endogenous Rac1/Rac1b pull-down assays. For transfection assays, 1–2.5 × 106 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes, transfected as indicated, and assayed 24 h later. In both cases, cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in 750 and 400 μl, respectively, of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Total lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min, and 0.1 volume was added to 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The remaining lysate was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PAK-CRIB domain (PAK-CD) pre-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), as described (15.Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Precipitated complexes were washed three times in an excess of lysis buffer. After the final wash, the supernatant was discarded, and 20 μlof2× Laemmli sample buffer was added to the beads. Total lysates and precipitates were then analyzed by Western blot. The immunoprecipitation procedure was identical except that the lysates were incubated with the monoclonal anti-c-Myc or anti-HA antibodies (2 μg ml–1) pre-coupled to protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science). Precipitates were analyzed on Western blots with rabbit anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies, respectively. All results were confirmed in at least three independent experiments. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on 10 × 10-mm glass coverslips, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), immediately fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and subsequently permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times for 5 min in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), incubated for 1 h in PBS-T containing the primary antibody (1:400 anti-β-catenin, Transduction Laboratories; 1:100 anti-HA, Roche Applied Science) or phalloidin-TRITC, and then washed 3× and incubated for 30 min with anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Texas Red (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Coverslips were washed 3 times, mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories), and sealed with nail polish. Images were recorded with a cooled CCD camera or a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. All results were confirmed by at least three independent experiments. Endogenous Rac1b Is a Highly Activated Variant—Rac1b is an endogenous splice variant of Rac1 (27.Jordan P. Brazão R. Boavida M.G. Gespach C. Chastre E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6835-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In order to study the physiological role of Rac1b, we raised antibodies against the 19-amino acid insert that distinguishes human Rac1b from Rac1. Western blot analysis showed that these antibodies specifically recognize Rac1b but not Rac1 in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing both cDNAs (Fig. 1A). With these antibodies several tumor cell lines as well as mouse fibroblasts were subsequently screened for the presence of endogenous Rac1b protein by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, expression of endogenous Rac1b by both reverse transcriptase-PCR and Western blotting was specifically found in HT29 (colon adenocarcinoma), ZR75.1 (breast carcinoma), and HeLa (cervix carcinoma) cells, whereas SW480 (colon adenocarcinoma) and 3T3 fibroblasts expressed Rac1 only. Commercially available anti-Rac1 antibodies recognized both Rac1 and Rac1b equally well (see Fig. 1A). This allowed us to optimize electrophoretic separation of both Rac1 and Ra1b and to compare the endogenous levels of both proteins. As shown in Fig. 1B, in all three Rac1b positive cell lines the level of Rac1b protein is low compared with that of Rac1. By densitometric analysis of Western blots, we estimated a 20-fold excess of Rac1 over Rac1b protein in HT29 cells. Because the expression level is not always indicative for the active, functional pool of a protein, we analyzed the activation state of Rac1 and Rac1b in these cells by GST-PAK-Crib domain (CD) pull-down assays as described (15.Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a significant amount of active Rac1b was pulled down from all Rac1b-expressing cell lines (see Fig. 1B). In order to confirm that the pull-down assay specifically isolated activated Rac1b, we transfected Myc-tagged wild type as well as active Q61L and inactive T17N mutants of Rac1b into cells and tested their activation state by pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 1C, wild type Rac1b and the active Q61L mutant of Rac1b were clearly pulled down in this assay, whereas the inactive mutant T17N had no affinity for the GST-PAK-CD probe. This indicates that Rac1b binds PAK-CRIB in the active GTP-bound state. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 1B, active Rac1b can exceed the amount of active Rac1 in cells. In HT29 colon cells, for example, we found three times more active Rac1b than Rac1, as estimated by Western blotting. Thus, although Rac1b protein is present in small amounts in cells, its contribution to the pool of active Rac in vivo can be very significant. Apparently, alternative splicing of Rac1 yields a highly activated variant of Rac1 that can lead to a significant increase in the total amount of activated Rac in cells. Activation of Rac1b in Vivo Requires GEFs—We next examined the mechanism underlying the high activation level of Rac1b. Previous in vitro studies have indicated that bacterially expressed Rac1b is predominantly in the active, GTP-bound form (24.Schnelzer A. Prechtel D. Knaus U. Dehne K. Gerhard M. Graeff H. Harbeck N. Schmitt M. Lengyel E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered whether the activation of Rac1b in vivo was independent of endogenous GEFs. To study this, HT29 cells that express endogenous Rac1 and Rac1b (see Fig. 1B) were incubated for 15 min with different concentrations of either wortmannin or LY294002 to inhibit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or genistein to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation. Both pathways have been reported previously to mediate activation of endogenous Rac-GEFs such as Tiam1 (15.Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 30.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) or Vav (31.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 32.Miranti C.K. Leng L. Maschberger P. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1289-1299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A, both inhibitors reduced the activation of Rac1 as well as of Rac1b in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that the activations of Rac1 and Rac1b are both dependent on GEFs. Indeed, we found that the Rac activator Tiam1 (33.Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) is able to activate both Rac1 and Rac1b (not shown) and is able to bind Rac1 and Rac1b to the same extent (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that Rac1b is able to associate with GEFs leading to its activation, similarly as found for Rac1. Bcr-GAP Down-regulates Rac1 as Well as Rac1b—Because GAPs contribute to the activation state of Rho-like GTPases, by the capacity to stimulate their intrinsic GTPase activity, we determined whether Rac1b differs from Rac1 with respect to the down-regulation by GAPs. Recombinant Rac1b has been found to possess a reduced intrinsic GTPase activity when compared with Rac1; however, the addition of GAP protein strongly accelerated the GTPase reaction of both variants. 3R. Ahmadian, personal communication. In order to confirm in vivo that GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis affects Rac1 as well as Rac1b, we determined the effect of the Bcr protein, an efficient GAP for Rac in vivo (34.Ridley A.J. Self A.J. Kasmi F. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Marshall C.J. Ellis C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5151-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Full-length Bcr GAP was co-transfected into SW480 cells together with tagged Myc-Rac1 and Myc-Rac1b. With increasing amounts of Bcr, we found a corresponding decrease in the activities of endogenous Rac1 as well as of exogenous Myc-Rac1 and Myc-Rac1b proteins (Fig. 3). Thus, both Rac1 and Rac1b are able to associate with Bcr and as a consequence are down-regulated because of the acceleration of the intrinsic GTPase activity of both proteins. Rac1b Is Resistant to Down-regulation by Rho-GDI—Subsequently we analyzed the effect of Rho-GDI on the activation state of Rac1 and Rac1b. Rho-GDI binds and masks the hydrophobic C-terminal region of Rac, the same region that is responsible for targeting Rac to the plasma membrane (35.Scheffzek K. Stephan I. Jensen O.N. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, Rho-GDI maintains Rac in the cytoplasm and must dissociate to allow Rac to translocate to the membrane and interact with membrane-associated activators (36.Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). When SW480 cells were co-transfected with increasing amounts of Rho-GDI, activation of both Myc-Rac1 and endogenous Rac1 was completely prevented. In contrast, the activation state of Myc-Rac1b remained unaffected (Fig. 4A). Apparently, Rho-GDI is unable to down-regulate the activation of Rac1b. To support this observation, Rho-GDI was overexpressed in HT29 cells or HeLa cells, which contain endogenous levels of both Rac1 and Rac1b (see Fig. 1B). Upon introduction of Rho-GDI, endogenous active Rac1b could still be isolated from these cells, whereas endogenous active Rac1 was no longer detectable (Fig. 4B, shown for HT29). These data suggest that Rho-GDI somehow is unable to down-regulate the activation state of Rac1b. We therefore determined whether the extra 19 amino acids in Rac1b could physically interfere with binding of Rho-GDI. From the available crystal structures of Rho-GDI complexed with Rac or Cdc42 (36.Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 37.Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), it appears that 19 additional amino acids following the switch II region might disturb the binding to the C-terminal sandwich domain of Rho-GDI. To address this question, we transfected HA-Rho-GDI together with either Myc-Rac1 or Myc-Rac1b into SW480 cells and immunoprecipitated with either anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies. Indeed, Rho-GDI could only be co-immunoprecipitated with Rac1 but not with Rac1b (Fig. 5A), and vice versa the immunoprecipitation of HA-Rho-GDI contained Myc-Rac1 but not Myc-Rac1b (data not shown). From these studies we concluded that Rho-GDI is unable to interact with Rac1b, which explains its inability to down-regulate Rac1b activity. The impaired binding of Rac1b to Rho-GDI might thus contribute to the high activation status of Rac1b found in cells. Besides inhibition of nucleotide exchange, Rho-GDI can also retain Rho GTPases in an inactive cytosolic complex. We therefore analyzed the intracellular localization of Rac1 and Rac1b in HT29 cells following overexpression of Rho-GDI. As shown in Fig. 5, Rac1 localized to the plasma membrane at sites of cell-cell contact but became cytoplasmic following co-expression of Rho-GDI, consistent with studies reported previously (38.Michaelson D. Siletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Phillips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 39.Ehrlich J.S. Hansen M.D.H. Nelson W.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rac1b localized at the plasma membrane but remained at the plasma membrane, even in the presence of high amounts of Rho-GDI (Fig. 5B). These data are consistent with the inability of Rho-GDI to associate with Rac1b and illustrate in vivo that Rho-GDI is unable to bind Rac1b. The impaired Rho-GDI binding will favor a more permanent localization of Rac1b at the plasma membrane, where it can be continuously activated by membrane-localized GEFs. Rac1b Differs in Downstream Signaling—We next asked whether the high activation status that was found for endogenous Rac1b in vivo could lead to increased Rac-mediated downstream signaling. Hallmark features of activated Rac1 are the induction of lamellipodia formation, as well as the activation of the protein kinases PAK and JNK (1.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (5215) Google Scholar). As described for fibroblasts, overexpression of Rac1-Q61L in SW480 colon carcinoma cells induced lamellipodia symmetrically along the entire cell surface (Fig. 6A). Surprisingly, expression of wild type Rac1b or Rac1b-Q61L did not lead to significant induction of lamellipodia in SW480 cells, although the protein was localized at the plasma membrane, preferentially at sites in contact to neighboring cells (Fig. 6A). Apparently, Rac1b is unable to induce cytoskeletal changes similar to those found with activated Rac1. In order to further investigate Rac-mediated activation of downstream protein kinases, the active Q61L and inactive T17N mutants of both Rac1 and Rac1b were co-expressed in SW480 cells with either PAK1 or JNK. Subsequently, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for the activated, phosphorylated kinases. Activated Rac1 stimulated PAK (Fig. 6B) and JNK (Fig. 6C) activation, whereas the dominant negative mutant Rac1-N17 did not, consistent with previous observations with these Rac mutants (7.Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 8.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither of the Rac1b mutants was able to induce any meaningful activation of these kinases (Fig. 6, B and C). Thus in contrast to Rac1, Rac1b is unable to activate PAK and to stimulate the JNK pathway. The inability of active Rac1b to activate PAK reflects impaired interaction because only active Rac1 was able to co-immunoprecipitate full-length PAK (Fig. 6D) Interestingly, analysis of other Rac-mediated signaling pathways revealed that both activated Rac1 and Rac1b are able to stimulate the NFκB pathway. The transcription factor NFκB becomes active following phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its cytosolic inhibitor IκB (40.DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7A, expression of both Rac1-Q61L as well as Rac1b-Q61L induced IκB phosphorylation, whereas the inactive N17 mutants of both Rac variants did not. In addition, expression of both Rac1-Q61L as well as Rac1b-Q61L induced translocation of the DNA-binding subunit NFκB-p65 (RelA) from the cytosol into the cell nucleus (Fig. 7B). These data suggest that Rac1b is able to stimulate only a restricted subset of downstream signaling pathways that are mediated by Rac1. The data described in this paper demonstrate that alternative splicing of the small GTPase Rac1 profoundly alters its regulation and downstream signaling properties. This difference is due an extra domain of 19 amino acids resulting from inclusion of exon 3b into the Rac1 mRNA. It is interesting to note that this alternative splicing event is specific for the human RAC1 gene because we did not find any homologous, additional exons in the human RAC2, RAC3, or CDC42 gene structures. We found that alternative splicing affects the regulation of Rac1b activity. The inclusion of the extra domain prevents the binding to Rho-GDI, one of the regulators of Rac activity. As a consequence, Rac1b is unable to cycle between the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm. It has been shown that Rho-GDI binds Rac1 and masks the hydrophobic C-terminal region that is responsible for targeting Rac to the plasma membrane (36.Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Thus, Rho-GDI maintains Rac in the cytoplasm and must dissociate to allow Rac to translocate to the membrane and to interact with membrane-associated activators (36.Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). By in vitro studies, it has been demonstrated that release of Rho-GDI is required for translocation of Rac1 to plasma membranes and for the subsequent interaction with exchange factors, such as Tiam1 (41.Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, integrins induce spatially controlled Rac-effector coupling in vivo by directing Rac1 to membranes and dissociating it from Rho-GDI (42.Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Because Rac1b is unable to interact with Rho-GDI, it is more persistently localized at the plasma membrane. This leaves the Rac1b variant in a preferred spatial position to become activated. The lack of binding to Rho-GDI, and the increased GTP-GDP cycling rate of recombinant Rac1b as demonstrated in vitro (24.Schnelzer A. Prechtel D. Knaus U. Dehne K. Gerhard M. Graeff H. Harbeck N. Schmitt M. Lengyel E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) most likely explain the high activation state found for endogenous Rac1b in cells. Even at low amounts of endogenous Rac1b protein in cells, a considerable portion is present in an activated state and may contribute to specific Rac-mediated downstream signaling. Our in vivo data also demonstrate that Rac1b retained the ability to cycle between the GDP- and GTP-bound form and rather exists in a high steady-state activation level. Recombinant Rac1b was shown previously in vitro to have intrinsic GTPase activity, which is accelerated upon addition of recombinant GAP protein (24.Schnelzer A. Prechtel D. Knaus U. Dehne K. Gerhard M. Graeff H. Harbeck N. Schmitt M. Lengyel E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).3 In addition, we found that Bcr down-regulates Rac1 and Rac1b in vivo equally well. Moreover, inhibition of the activity of cellular GEFs revealed that the activation of Rac1b depends on continuous action of GEFs. More specifically, the Rac activator Tiam1 associates with both Rac1 and Rac1b and is able to activate both proteins. All these data strongly suggest that the activity of Rac1b can be regulated by GEFs and GAPs and that Rac1b does not represent a constitutive activated splice variant of Rac1. Intriguingly, the extra 19 amino acids in Rac1b appear to confer selectivity in downstream Rac signaling properties. In cultured cells, we found that activated Rac1b could neither stimulate formation of lamellipodia or activation of the protein kinase PAK nor the JNK pathway. In this respect it should be noted that the PAK-CRIB domain used in the pull-down assays binds equally to Rac1 and Rac1b, whereas full-length PAK does not significantly associate with Rac1b (Fig. 6D). Previous work has indicated that CRIB domain-containing fragments of effectors such as WASP or PAK are necessary for specific binding to active Rac or Cdc42. However, a productive interaction with the corresponding full-length proteins requires additional binding to regions outside this motif (43.Rudolph M.G. Bayer P. Abo A. Kuhlmann J. Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18067-18076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activated Rac1b and Rac1 induced the phosphorylation of IκB and nuclear translocation of NFκB-p65 to the same extent, suggesting that the activation of Rac1b in cells promotes only specific downstream signaling pathways. Many downstream signaling pathways of Rac have been described that are independent of the ability of Rac1 to induce cytoskeletal changes or to activate PAK or the Jun kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (44.Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 45.Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol.

So far, the expression of Rac1b has been found in breast and colon tumors. This might indicate that this splice variant somehow facilitates the growth or survival of these epithelial tumors. Currently, we are studying which of the many Rac-specific downstream signaling pathways are activated by Rac1b and which of those pathways could play a role in the formation or progression of epithelial tumors.

The CaSR on nerve terminals may regulate neurotransmitter release (3.Ruat M. Molliver M.E. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Its physiological importance is further illustrated in several disorders linked to Ca2+ homeostasis resulting in gain- or loss-of-function mutations (10.Hendy G.N. D'Souza-Li L. Yang B. Canaff L. Cole D.E. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).The CaSR belongs to G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) class 3, which comprises eight metabotropic glutamate receptors and γ-aminobutyric acid type B, vomeronasal, pheromone, and taste receptors. These GPCRs possess an unusual long bilobed amino-terminal extracellular domain resembling bacterial periplasmic binding protein implicated in nutrient transport and postulated to contain the ligand-binding sites of these receptors (11.Pin J.P.

The CaSR is activated by Ca2+ and Mg2+ present in the extracellular fluids and by charged molecules, including spermine, spermidine, β-amyloid peptides, and several antibiotics (2.Brown E.M. Gamba G.

Recently, low molecular mass synthetic molecules activating the CaSR have been identified, and their pharmacological properties with respect to cloned CaSR have been reported (16.Ferry S. Chatel B.

It has been proposed that these molecules, named calcimimetics, interact allosterically within the seven transmembrane domains to potentiate the effect of Ca2+ (20.Hammerland L.G. Krapcho K.J.

On the other hand, compounds that inhibit the effect of Ca2+ on the CaSR are called calcilytics (23.Nemeth E.F. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Controlling transient parathyroid hormone release by blocking the parathyroid CaSR with such molecules has been hypothesized to produce anabolic effects in bone and represents a major therapeutic interest in the treatment of osteoporosis (23.Nemeth E.F. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, such compounds might be useful for studying the roles played by the CaSR in tissues under physiological and pathological states. NPS 2143 was the first negative allosteric modulator acting on the CaSR whose properties have been investigated both in vitro and in vivo (24.Gowen M. Stroup G.B. Dodds R.A. James I.E. Votta B.J. Smith B.R. Bhatnagar P.K. Lago A.M. Callahan J.F. DelMar E.G. Miller M.A. Nemeth E.F. Fox J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 25.Nemeth E.F.

We have recently synthesized and evaluated the in vitro pharmacological properties of a novel structurally different series of calcilytics acting on the cloned rat CaSR (26.Faure H. Ruat M. Kessler A. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. International Osteoporosis Foundation World Congress on Osteoporosis. 731. May 10-14, Lisbon, Portugal, Vol. , Springer-Verlag, London, Ltd., UK2002Google Scholar). We now report the calcilytic properties of (1S,2S,1′R)-N1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-N2-[1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl]-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (Calhex 231) (Fig. 1), which belongs to this family of molecules, and the characterization of its potency toward the human CaSR transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Calhex 231 shows in vitro potency comparable to NPS 2143 in inhibiting Ca2+-induced activation of the human CaSR (25.Nemeth E.F. DelMar E.G. Heaton W.L. Miller M.A. Lambert L.D. Conklin R.L. Gowen M. Gleason J.G. Bhatnagar P.K. Fox J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 323-331PubMed Google Scholar). We have developed a three-dimensional model of the transmembrane domains of the human CaSR based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (27.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4991) Google Scholar). This model has allowed us to dock Calhex 231 into a hydrophobic cavity centered on Glu-837 (position 7.39 according to the numbering of Ballesteros et al. (28.Ballesteros J.A. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar)) with two adjacent hydrophobic pockets. We used site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues likely involved in the recognition of Calhex 231 to demonstrate the validity of this model and to propose a possible binding mode of this negative allosteric CaSR modulator within the seven transmembrane domains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Calhex 231—Calhex 231 was prepared as its hydrochloride salt. Briefly, cyclohexene in acetonitrile was treated with [(N-p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)imino] phenyliodane in the presence of a catalytic quantity of copper(II) triflate to give the aziridine (±)-7-(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-7-azabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The latter was reacted in triethylamine-containing tetrahydrofuran with (R)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine to afford the aziridine ring-opened product N1-(4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-N2-[1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl]-1,2-diaminocyclohexane. Removal of the p-nitrobenzenesulfonyl group by the action of thiophenol/potassium carbonate in acetonitrile/Me2SO followed by acylation of the resulting free amine with 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride provided (1S,2S,1′R)-N1-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-N2-[1-(1-naphthyl)ethyl]-1,2-diaminocyclohexane, i.e. Calhex 231, as the slower moving of two components on silica gel. The absolute configuration of Calhex 231 was deduced by x-ray crystallography. Details of the synthesis and structural characterization of Calhex 231 will be published elsewhere.Site-directed Mutagenesis—To mutate amino acids possibly involved in the binding site of Calhex 231, the coding region of the human wild-type (WT) CaSR, kindly provided by Prof. M. Freichel (6.Freichel M. Zink-Lorenz A. Holloschi A. Hafner M. Flockerzi V. Raue F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3842-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), was first cloned in the HindIII-XbaI sites in a modified pUC18 plasmid in which SacI and SmaI restriction sites were removed (pUCmCaSR). A SacIBamHI insert encompassing the coding region corresponding to TM2-7 was then cloned into the pBluescript SK+ plasmid (Stratagene), and site-directed mutagenesis was performed. A SacI-SmaI fragment containing the mutation was then replaced in the pUCmCaSR plasmid to obtain the final mutant CaSR. Finally, WT and mutant CaSR coding regions were subcloned into HindIII-XbaI sites of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). All point mutants were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with specific oligonucleotides (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) to convert residues to alanine. 2Sequences of oligonucleotides are available upon request. Sequencing was performed on both strands in pBluescript SK+ containing the mutated fragment and in the final pcDNA3 vector (Eurogentec, Ivoz-Ramet, Belgium).Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells (Eurobio) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and were transiently transfected using a Gene-Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) by electroporation (270 V and 975 microfarads). Briefly, 4 μg of pcDNA3 plasmid containing human WT or mutant CaSR DNA were supplemented with 6 μg of pRK5 plasmid and used to transfect 106 cells in a total volume of 300 μl of electroporation buffer (50 mm K2HPO4, 20 mm CH3COOK, 20 mm KOH, and 26.6 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4). After electroporation, cells were resuspended in culture medium and distributed on a 24-well plate coated with 100 μg/ml rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences, Meylan, France) for [3H]inositol phosphate ([3H]IP) analysis or plated in a 75-cm2 tissue culture flask for Western blot analysis.[3H]IP Formation—Cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/well myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 h in growth medium, and measurement of [3H]IP accumulation was performed as described (13.Ruat M. Snowman A.M. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5972-5975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of triplicates from a typical experiment representative of 3-10 independent experiments. The activities of WT and mutant CaSRs were determined in response to increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentrations or to Calhex 231 in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+. EC50 values for Ca2+ and IC50 values for Calhex 231 were calculated using GraphPAD Prism Version 2.01, and significance was assayed by Excel 98 Student's t test (Microsoft, Seattle, WA).Generation of Polyclonal Antiserum to the Human CaSR—A DNA encoding part of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the human CaSR (residues 747-1077) (6.Freichel M. Zink-Lorenz A. Holloschi A. Hafner M. Flockerzi V. Raue F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3842-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR, inserted into a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), and sequenced (Eurogentec). The production of a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21 was then carried out (29.Traiffort E. Moya K.L. Faure H. Hassig R. Ruat M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 839-850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 100 μg were injected into a rabbit to generate 141Ab antiserum.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Proteins from whole cell lysate (30.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were diluted into lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 6% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 2.5% SDS, and 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol). 4 μg of proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were probed for 2 h at room temperature with 141Ab antiserum (1:3000). The immunoreactivity was revealed as described (16.Ferry S. Chatel B. Dodd R.H. Lair C. Gully D. Maffrand J.P. Ruat M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Alignment of Amino Acid Sequences—The amino acid sequences of four human GPCRs were retrieved from the Swiss Protein Database (Swiss-Prot accession numbers P41180 (CaSR), Q13255 (metabotropic glutamate receptor-1), Q9UBS5 (γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit 1), and P07550 (β2-adrenoreceptor)). Their transmembrane domains were extracted and aligned with those of bovine rhodopsin (accession number P02699) using the in-house developed GPCRmod program. 3D. Rognan, C. Bissantz, and A. Logean, submitted for publication. A ClustalW multiple alignment (32.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55190) Google Scholar) was then performed on extra- and intracellular loops while maintaining the relative alignment of the seven transmembrane domains fixed. A slow pairwise alignment using the BLOSUM matrix series (33.Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4266) Google Scholar) and a gap opening penalty of 15.0 were chosen for aligning the amino acid sequences with the sequence of bovine rhodopsin.Preparation of Starting Protein Coordinates—The three-dimensional model of the human CaSR was constructed using a previously described procedure (34.Bissantz C. Bernard P. Hibert M. Rognan D. Proteins. 2003; 50: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Briefly, starting from the x-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1f88), a first model of the seven transmembrane domains was obtained by mutating the side chains of the amino acids in rhodopsin. Standard geometries for the mutated side chains were given by the BIOPOLYMER module of SYBYL (Tripos Associates, Inc, St. Louis, MO). Whenever possible, the side chain torsional angles were kept to the values occurring in bovine rhodopsin. Otherwise, a short scanning of side chain angles was performed to remove steric clashes between the mutated side chain and the other amino acids. The third intracellular loop between TM5 and TM6, which shows a high degree of variability, was not included in any of the models. This loop is believed for most GPCRs to be far away from the TM-binding cavity (35.Strader C.D. Dixon R.A. Cheung A.H. Candelore M.R. Blake A.D. Sigal I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16439-16443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore assume that omitting this loop should not influence our docking results. The observed insertions/deletions in the loops of the CaSR were achieved through a simple knowledge-based loop search procedure as previously reported (34.Bissantz C. Bernard P. Hibert M. Rognan D. Proteins. 2003; 50: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Special caution had to be given to extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), which has been described in bovine rhodopsin to fold back over the heptahelical bundle (27.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4991) Google Scholar) and therefore limits the size of the active site. Two models of this loop were proposed. The first one assumes a rhodopsin-dependent folding and was obtained by direct threading to the rhodopsin template. In this model, one residue was inserted eight positions before Cys-765, and nine amino acids were deleted after His-766. The second model assumes a rhodopsin-independent fold and was obtained by searching for two loops of 12 and 11 residues linking Ser-750 to Thr-764 and His-766 to Ser-769, respectively. After the heavy atoms were modeled, all hydrogen atoms were added, and the protein coordinates were then minimized with AMBER6 using the AMBER95 force field as previously described (34.Bissantz C. Bernard P. Hibert M. Rognan D. Proteins. 2003; 50: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).Modeling the Calhex 231-bound CaSR—To obtain a ligand-bound model of the CaSR, the above-described coordinates were refined as previously described (34.Bissantz C. Bernard P. Hibert M. Rognan D. Proteins. 2003; 50: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) to enlarge the binding cavity. Briefly, Calhex 231 was first manually docked into the TM cavity by anchoring its protonable nitrogen atom to the only negatively charged residue of the binding site (Glu-837) and fitting the shape of the two aromatic moieties into the two proximal hydrophobic pockets. The bulky naphthalene group was docked into the bigger of the two pockets (pocket A: Pro-682, Phe-688, Val-689, Tyr-744, Pro-748, Leu-776, Trp-818, Phe-821, and Ala-840), whereas the substituted phenyl moiety was located into the smaller of the two pockets (pocket B: Phe-612, Ala-615, Leu-616, Ser-665, Phe-668, Ile-669, Phe-684, Val-838, and Ile-841). After parameterization of Calhex 231 for the AMBER6 force field using a previously reported protocol (36.Rognan D. Mukhija S. Folkers G. Zerbe O. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the resulting protein-ligand complex was then refined by minimization using the above-described AMBER parameters. Removing the ligand atoms from the minimized complex finally yielded one set of coordinates for the Calhex 231-bound receptor model.Automated Docking of Calhex 231—To verify that the above-described coordinates were not biased by the manual docking procedure, the Surflex docking program (37.Jain A.N. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar) was used to automatically dock Calhex 231. An idealized active-site ligand or protomol (38.Ruppert J. Welch W. Jain A.N. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) was first generated from 33 consensus positions (34.Bissantz C. Bernard P. Hibert M. Rognan D. Proteins. 2003; 50: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) supposed to map the TM cavity of most GPCRs. This protomol consists of the preferred locations of various molecular probes (CH4, C=O, N-H), which are then used by the docking engine to search for the best three-dimensional morphological similarity between the protomol and the ligand to dock. A proto_ thresh value of 0.5 and a proto_bloat value of 0 were used to generate a compact protomol. A Tripos mol2file of Calhex 231, obtained from a two-dimensional sketch as previously reported (34.Bissantz C. Bernard P. Hibert M. Rognan D. Proteins. 2003; 50: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), was docked into the TM cavity using standard parameters of Surflex used in the “whole” docking approach (37.Jain A.N. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). The best 30 solutions were finally stored in mol2 format.RESULTSPotency of Calhex 231—In a recent preliminary report, we described the synthesis and characterization of a novel series of molecules displaying calcilytic properties toward the rat CaSR (26.Faure H. Ruat M. Kessler A. Dauban P. Dodd R.H. International Osteoporosis Foundation World Congress on Osteoporosis. 731. May 10-14, Lisbon, Portugal, Vol. , Springer-Verlag, London, Ltd., UK2002Google Scholar). We have now synthesized Calhex 231, which belongs to this family of molecules, and we have investigated its potency toward the human CaSR by measuring its effects on Ca2+-induced accumulation of [3H]IP, a well characterized response linked to CaSR activation (2.Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2344) Google Scholar, 13.Ruat M. Snowman A.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Increasing the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ from 0.3 to 10 mm caused a 10-fold increase in [3H]IP accumulation in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the human WT CaSR, whereas we did not detect a significant increase in [3H]IP accumulation in cells transiently transfected with an empty control plasmid (Fig. 2A) (data not shown). Analysis of the dose-response curve led to an EC50 for Ca2+ of 3.4 ± 0.1 mm (mean ± S.E., n = 10). These data fit well with the affinity for Ca2+-mediated increases in IP accumulation previously determined for the human CaSR (39.Ray K. Fan G.F. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31355-31361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Preincubation of HEK293 cells expressing the human WT CaSR with Calhex 231 caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the IP response to 10 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the dose-response curve led to an IC50 for Calhex 231 of 0.39 ± 0.08 μm (mean ± S.E., n = 7). These data indicate that Calhex 231 is a potent calcilytic of the human CaSR transiently expressed in HEK293 cells.Fig. 2Potency of Calhex 231 in inhibiting Ca2+-induced accumulation of [3H]IP by the human CaSR.A, concentration-response curve of Ca2+-induced IP stimulation (expressed as cpm/well × 1000) in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the human WT CaSR. Cells were prelabeled overnight with 0.5 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol, washed twice with basal Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10 mm LiCl, and incubated with increasing concentrations of CaCl2 for 30 min. B, concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca2+-stimulated (10 mm) increases in the IP response by Calhex 231 in HEK293 cells expressing the human WT CaSR. After the prelabeling and washing procedures, cells were incubated with 10 mm Ca2+ alone or in the presence of increasing concentrations of Calhex 231 for 30 min. Results are expressed as % of maximal response observed with 10 mm Ca2+. IP levels in A and B were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and data are means ± S.E. of triplicates from a typical experiment representative of 7-10 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Molecular Modeling of the Seven Transmembrane Domains of the Human CaSR—To elucidate the binding mode of Calhex 231, we postulated that the ligand-binding pocket could be localized within the seven transmembrane domains of the CaSR. First, we developed a model of the human CaSR based on the x-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin (27.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4991) Google Scholar), which was used as a template to model the seven transmembrane domains of the CaSR. Using the in-house developed GPCRmod program,3 we could unambiguously assign the positions of the seven helices using GPCR-dependent TM-specific amino acid fingerprints (Fig. 3A) and thread CaSR three-dimensional coordinates onto those of bovine rhodopsin. Two models were generated differing only in the fold of ECL2 (Fig. 3, B and C). The first one assumes a conserved folding of ECL2 over the seven-TM bundle as in bovine rhodopsin. The rationale for this first choice was the presence of two conserved cysteine residues at position 677 in TM3"

Disabling mutations in CYP17 cause combined 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency, but rare missense mutations cause isolated loss of 17,20-lyase activity by disrupting interactions of redox partner proteins with CYP17. We studied an adolescent male with clinical and biochemical features of isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency, including micropenis, hypospadias, and gynecomastia, who is homozygous for CYP17 mutation E305G, which lies in the active site. When expressed in HEK-293 cells or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutation E305G retains 17α-hydroxylase activities, converting pregnenolone and progesterone to 17α-hydroxysteroids. However, mutation E305G lacks 17,20-lyase activity for the conversion of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to DHEA, which is the dominant pathway to C19 steroids catalyzed by human CYP17 (the Δ5-steroid pathway). In contrast, mutation E305G exhibits 11-fold greater catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for the cleavage of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione compared with wild-type CYP17. We conclude that mutation E305G selectively impairs 17,20-lyase activity for DHEA synthesis despite an increased capacity to form androstenedione. Mutation E305G provides genetic evidence that androstenedione formation from 17α-hydroxyprogesterone via the minor Δ4-steroid pathway alone is not sufficient for complete formation of the male phenotype in humans.

Cytochrome P450c17 (CYP17, 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) largely controls sex steroid production by catalyzing the conversion of C21 steroids to C19 androgen precursors (1.Nakajin S. Shively J.E.

Human CYP17 17α-hydroxylates pregnenolone and progesterone at comparable rates, but the catalytic efficiency of the 17,20-lyase reaction is much greater with 17α-hydroxypregnenolone (the Δ5-steroid pathway) than with 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (the Δ4-steroid pathway) (3.Auchus R.J.

The 17,20-lyase activity is particularly dependent on proper abundance of the electron transfer proteins cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) (6.Yanagibashi K. Hall P.F. J. Biol.

Optimal molar ratios of CYP17 to cytochrome b5 stimulate 17,20-lyase activity 10-fold, with little influence on 17α-hydroxylase activity (3.Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol.

In contrast, the rat (10.Fevold H.R. Lorence M.C. McCarthy J.L. Trant J.M. Kagimoto M. Waterman M.R. Mason J.I. Mol.

Without adrenal 17α-hydroxylase activity, glucocorticoid precursors with mineralocorticoid activity accumulate, causing hypertension and hypokalemia, whereas absent gonadal 17,20-lyase activity results in sexual infantilism regardless of genetic sex. Partial deficiencies in CYP17 can cause milder or intermediate phenotypes (16.Yanase T. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 91-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 17.Miura K. Yasuda K. Yanase T. Yamakita N. Sasano H. Nawata H. Inoue M. Fukaya T. Shizuta Y. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

In rare instances, only 17,20-lyase activity is significantly impaired, causing isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency (ILD) (18.Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Mendonça B.B. Miller W.L. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), which also causes male pseudohermaphroditism. Genetic and biochemical studies confirm that R347H (18.Geller D.H. Auchus R.J.

Miller W.L. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) are responsible for the clinical phenotype. In these subjects, 17-hydroxysteroid production is relatively normal, but the ratio of 17-hydroxysteroid precursors to C19 steroid products is elevated, indicating a deficiency in 17,20-lyase activity. Enzyme assays in transfected COS-1 cells and in yeast microsomes (20.Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) demonstrate that these mutations retain most 17α-hydroxylase activity, but DHEA and androstenedione formation via 17,20-lyase reactions is barely detectable, even in the presence of cytochrome b5. Consistent with the known dependence of the 17,20-lyase reaction on CPR and cytochrome b5, mutations R347H, R347C, and R358Q neutralize positive charges in the redox partner-binding site of CYP17 (18.Geller D.H.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1169-1182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and these mutations disrupt interactions of CYP17 with CPR and cytochrome b5 (20.Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Other mutations suspected of causing ILD that do not map to the redox partner-binding site have been found to be deficient in all activities rather than selectively deficient in 17,20-lyase activity (22.Yanase T.

Herein, we describe a subject with ILD whose CYP17 mutation maps to the active site and causes ILD by a novel mechanism. Genomic PCR and Sequencing—After obtaining informed consent, blood was obtained for isolation of lymphocyte DNA using the High Pure DNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). The 6.4-kb CYP17 gene (24.Chung B.C. Picado-Leonard J. Haniu M. Bienkowski M. Hall P.F. Shively J.E. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using primer pairs c17geneS1a + I4AS1 and I3S1 + c17geneAS1 (see Table I) to amplify the 5′- and 3′-halves, respectively (25.Costa-Santos M. Auchus R.J. Kater C.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). Each PCR contained 1 μg of DNA, 50 pmol of each primer, 200 μm dNTPs, 1.5 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2 units of ExTaq polymerase (PanVera, Madison, WI) in a total volume of 50 μl of the manufacturer's buffer. The following PCR conditions were employed: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 41 cycles at 65 °C for 1 min, 70 °C for 3 min, and 95 °C for 30 s and a final annealing/extension cycle at 65 °C for 1 min and 70 °C for 5 min. The resulting PCR products were precipitated with ethanol and 0.3 m sodium acetate, purified on a 1% agarose gel, and isolated using the QIAEX-II gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). The exons and flanking intronic segments of the amplicons were directly sequenced as described (25.Costa-Santos M. Auchus R.J. Kater C.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). For the other kindred members analyzed, PCR amplification of only exons 4 and 5 of the CYP17 gene was performed as described above using primers I3S1 and I5AS, except that extension parameters were 2 min at 70 °C. Exon 5 of the CYP17 amplicons was sequenced using primer I4S.Table IOligonucleotide primersPrimerSequenceaRestriction sites and mutagenic codons are underlined.c17geneS1aCTCCACCGCTGTCTATCTTGCCTGCCI4AS1CCTACTATGTGCCAGGTTCTCTGCTTGI3S1GCTGGAGAAGCAAAATGGAAGAAGGGTGGc17geneAS1CTCTAAATCTGTGTTGTGGGGCCACI5ASAGAGATTGGGCTGGCTGGGGTCTAGI4SGAGTGTCACAGATGGGGCTCCTTCCT7GTAATACGACTCACTATAc17E305GS1CTGGCGTGGGGACCACCACCTCTGTTGc17E305GAS1GTGGTGGTCCCCACGCCAGCCCCAAAGpLWAS1TCAGCAAAAAACCCCTCAAGACCCGYred5′/5′CGCGGCCGCATCTACAGTCCACCTGYred5′/3′CGGATCCGTGTTGTCTATTCCAAACGGYred3′/5′CCAAGCTTCCAAGAAGATGTCTGGTAATCAGYred3′/3′CCAGATCTTAAAGGCCGGCAAAGCAATGGGYRED 5′U4TTGCTACTGTGCTTTCGAGCGCCGACpPGKAS2GGATGGGGAGGGATCAATTGTGACGa Restriction sites and mutagenic codons are underlined. Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutation E305G was introduced into the CYP17 cDNA by sequential PCR using overlapping mutagenic oligonucleotides (23.Gupta M.K. Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4416-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Two separate PCRs utilized primer pair T7 + c17E305GAS1 or c17E305GS1 + pLWAS1 in addition to plasmid pLW01-c17 as a template, 1.25 units of ExTaq polymerase, and 200 μm dNTPs in a total volume of 50 μl of the manufacturer's buffer. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 26 cycles at 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1.5 min, and 94 °C for 1 min and a final annealing/extension cycle at 50 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 4 min. Aliquots of these reactions were diluted 1:10, and 1 μl of each dilution was combined and used as a template in a third reaction to construct a full-length mutated cDNA using primers T7 and pLWAS1 and the same conditions used for the first two PCRs. The resulting amplicon was gel-purified, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, gel-purified again, and ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The inserts from several positive colonies were sequenced in their entirety to ensure that only the desired nucleotide substitution was incorporated, 2A silent change of one base (GTT for GTG) was inadvertently introduced by oligonucleotide c17E305GS1 at Leu310. affording plasmid pcDNA3-c17E305G. A subsequent BamHI/EcoRI digestion released the E305G cDNA insert, which was gel-purified and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the yeast expression vector V60 (26.Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yielding V60-c17E305G. Wild-type vectors pcDNA3-c17 (23.Gupta M.K. Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Biophys. 2003; 409: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were described previously. Transformation and Steroid Metabolism in HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293 cells were grown in T-75 flasks with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.584 g/liter glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Cellgro, Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) and transfected with the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) as previously described for COS-7 cells (23.Gupta M.K. Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4416-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded to 60–80% confluency in 6-well plates and transfected with 1 μg/well plasmid pcDNA3 or 2 μg of plasmid for incubations with 17α-hydroxyprogesterone. The next day, all but 0.5 ml of medium was removed from each well and replaced with 3 ml of fresh medium containing the indicated steroid (60,000 cpm/ml) plus unlabeled steroid to give a final concentration of 0.1 μm. Aliquots (1 ml) were removed at 2, 4, or 8 h; extracted; separated by thin-layer chromatography; and visualized as described (7.Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2498-2506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of Yeast Strain YiV(B)—Genomic DNA was isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303B by disruption with glass beads (28.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). DNA fragments homologous to segments in the 5′- and 3′-ends of the yeast NCP1 gene (homolog of the human CPR gene) were generated by PCR using oligonucleotides Yred5′/5′ + Yred5′/3′ (Not-Bam-5′) and Yred3′/5′ + Yred3′/3′ (Hind-Bgl-3′). PCRs contained 1 μg of DNA, 100 pmol of each primer, 200 μm dNTPs, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.5 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) in a 50-μl total reaction volume. Thermocycling conditions were at follows: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles at 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and 94 °C for 1 min and a final annealing/extension cycle at 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 3 min. These amplicons of 560 and 390 bp, respectively, were gel-purified, cloned into vector pGEM-T (Promega) using the A-overhang method, and sequenced. The Hind-Bgl-3′ fragment was excised by digestion with HindIII and BglII and ligated into the HindIII and BglII sites of vector pLW01, yielding vector pLW01–3′. The Not-Bam-5′ fragment was excised with NotI and BamHI and ligated into the corresponding sites in vector pcDNA3 to acquire the convenient adjacent restriction sites HindIII (3′) and XhoI (5′) from the vector (pcDNA3–5′). An extended Not-Bam-5′ fragment was excised from vector pcDNA3–5′ with XhoI and HindIII and ligated into LW01–3′ digested with XhoI and HindIII, yielding vector pLW01–5′3′. A cassette containing the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase promoter, the human CPR cDNA with modified early codons to improve expression, and the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase terminator was excised from vector V10-OR (3.Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into vector pLW01–5′3′ digested with BamHI and HindIII, yielding vector pLW01–5′-CPR-3′. Finally, the yeast ura3 gene, flanked by hisG repeats (which enhance homologous recombination), was excised from vector pYNK51 (29.Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) as a BamHI/BglII fragment and ligated into the BamHI site, located between the yeast Not-Bam-5′ fragment and the CPR cassette, of vector pLW01–5′-CPR-3′, yielding the final targeting vector pLW01-YiV. Vector pLW01-YiV (2 μg) was linearized with XhoI and used to transform 108 cells of strain W303B, and clones were selected and restreaked on uracil-deficient minimal medium (1.7 g/liter Difco yeast nitrogen base (BD Biosciences), 5 g/liter ammonium sulfate, 20 g/liter glucose, 2% agar supplemented with 40 mg/liter l-tryptophan, 40 mg/liter adenine hemisulfate, 60 mg/liter l-leucine, and 20 mg/liter l-histidine). Several colonies were restreaked on YPD medium (10 g/liter yeast extract, 10 g/liter peptone, 20 g/liter dextrose, and 2% agar) then finally streaked onto minimal medium plates containing the above nutrients plus 50 mg/liter uracil and 750 mg/liter 5-fluoroorotic acid, yielding a small number of clones with the ura3 gene deleted. Genomic DNA was isolated from several clones to confirm that homologous recombination had occurred, as shown by a 1.9-kb PCR fragment from the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter to sequences farther 5′ of the targeting construct on yeast chromosome 8 (primers YRED 5′U4 and pPGKAS2) (Table I). One positive clone, named YiV(B), was propagated on YPD medium and used for transformation and expression. Strain engineering is schematized in Fig. 2. Yeast Transformation, Microsome Preparation, and Enzyme Assays—S. cerevisiae strains YiV(B) and W303B were transformed with 1 μg of plasmid V60 (26.Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 51-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the cDNA for either wild-type CYP17 or mutation E305G as described (23.Gupta M.K. Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4416-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on minimal medium plates as described above. For microsome preparation, 2-ml precultures of liquid minimal medium with supplements were inoculated with YiV(B) yeast transformed with either V60-c17 or V60-c17E305G and shaken at 30 °C overnight. The following morning, the 2-ml preculture was added to 10 ml of the same medium and grown for 10 h, at which time a flask containing 500 ml of 10 g/liter yeast extract, 10 g/liter peptone, 5 g/liter glucose, and 3% ethanol was inoculated with the 10-h culture. This culture was grown for 24 h at 30 °C, induced by addition of 60 ml of 200 g/liter galactose, and allowed to grow overnight. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min; resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m KCl; and centrifuged again. The cell pellet was resuspended in TES buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.6 m sorbitol) to a total volume of 20 ml and added to 20 g of glass beads (425–600 μm) in the small chamber of a BeadBeater (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) with 100 μl of protease inhibitor mixture for fungal/yeast cultures (Sigma). The chamber was thoroughly chilled, and cells were disrupted by pulsing three times for 1 min with several minutes of icing between pulses. The homogenate was transferred to a 50-ml centrifuge bottle. The beads were then washed with 10 ml of TES buffer, which was then added to the initial homogenate. The combined suspension was centrifuged twice at 10,000 × g, and the final supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Microsomes were prepared by resuspending the pellet in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol and shearing through a 27-gauge needle. Quantitation of microsomal cytochrome P450 and protein content, incubations with radiolabeled steroids, steroid extraction, and chromatography were performed as described (3.Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). For incubations with purified recombinant human cytochrome b5 (PanVera), microsomes were preincubated for 2 min at 37 °C with 30 molar eq of cytochrome b5 and 0.6 μm steroid prior to addition of NADPH to start the reaction. The kinetic constants Km(app) and Vmax were calculated from iterative hyperbolic fits of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (v = Vmax·[S]/(Km + [S])) using Origin Version 6.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Because kinetic data from experiments in the presence of competitive inhibitors encompass only the linear portions of the v versus [S] plots, hyperbolic curves cannot be fit to the data; consequently, KI(app) values were obtained from constants derived from least-squares fits to Lineweaver-Burk plots as described (27.Auchus R.J. Kumar A.S. Boswell C.A. Gupta M.K. Bruce K. Rath N.P. Covey D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Turnover experiments with hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide (Sigma) were performed with 1 pmol of cytochrome P450, 2 pmol of [3H]progesterone, and 10 μm oxidant in 200 μl as described (21.Auchus R.J. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1169-1182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spectral binding constants (KS) were obtained from titration curves in intact W303B cells expressing wild-type CYP17 or the E305G mutation (27.Auchus R.J. Kumar A.S. Boswell C.A. Gupta M.K. Bruce K. Rath N.P. Covey D.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 134-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Miscellaneous—Reagents and chemicals were purchased from either Fisher or Sigma except as noted, and restriction enzymes and DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). 3H-Labeled pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, and progesterone (45–65 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and 3H-labeled 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (50 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). DNA sequencing employed the dye termination method with PE Applied Biosystems instruments at the University of Texas Southwestern McDermott Center Sequencing Center. Autoradiography was performed by exposing X-Omat Blue film (Eastman Kodak Co.) to TLC plates saturated with EN3HANCE spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Clinical Presentation of the Index Case and Genetic Analysis—The subject presented at age 15 for evaluation of gynecomastia. The pregnancy was uncomplicated, and the parents were first cousins. Hypospadias and micropenis were noted at birth, and the hypospadias was surgically repaired at age 4. Physical examination showed Tanner stage 4 breasts and pubic hair, normal (15–20 ml) testes, and a small (3 cm) phallus. Electrolytes and plasma renin activity were normal. Basal and stimulated hormone values are listed in Table II. The combination of elevated gonadotropins, low testosterone, and extremely low DHEA sulfate suggested a defect in CYP17, which is required for the conversion of C21 steroids to C19 steroids in both the adrenal glands and gonads (24.Chung B.C. Picado-Leonard J. Haniu M. Bienkowski M. Hall P.F. Shively J.E. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Unlike classical 17-hydroxylase deficiency, however, circulating concentrations of most 17-hydroxysteroids were elevated, suggesting selective impairment of 17,20-lyase activity (ILD). Amplification and direct sequencing of all the exons of the CYP17 gene from this subject showed a homozygous GAG-to-GGG missense mutation at codon 305 in exon 5 (data not shown). This mutation substitutes a glycine for the highly conserved glutamate at this position, which resides within the active-site pocket.Table IIHormone values for index caseHormoneBasal value (normal)aAll values are expressed in nmol/liter, except luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones, which are expressed in iu/liter.Post-ACTH1-24 (normal)bACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone.Luteinizing hormone19.5 (2-10)Follicle-stimulating hormone12.9 (1-6)Cortisol128 (150-500)305 (>500)11-Deoxycortisol8.4 (0.4-5)9.1 (>5)17α-Hydroxyprogesterone6.2 (1-6)6.4 (>6)DHEA sulfate220 (2700-10,000)Testosterone1.4-2.6 (7-21)Estradiol0.15 (0.04-0.13)Aldosterone0.2 (0.1-1)a All values are expressed in nmol/liter, except luteinizing and follicle-stimulating hormones, which are expressed in iu/liter.b ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone. Open table in a new tab Enzyme Activity in Transfected HEK-293 Cells—To confirm that the CYP17 mutation alone explains the clinical and laboratory data, E305G was introduced into the CYP17 cDNA, and the mutation was expressed in HEK-293 cells. Cells expressing mutation E305G metabolized progesterone approximately the same as those expressing wild-type CYP17, except that the mutation appeared to produce more androstenedione compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3A, left). Androstenedione synthesis by E305G also moderately exceeded that by wild-type CYP17 when 17α-[3H]hydroxyprogesterone was added to the medium (Fig. 3A, right). Thus, when expressed in HEK-293 cells with endogenous redox partners, steroid metabolism by mutation E305G in the Δ4-steroid pathway was equivalent (if not superior) to metabolism by wild-type CYP17. In contrast, pregnenolone metabolism experiments qualitatively revealed the enzymatic defect in mutation E305G. Cells expressing wild-type CYP17 converted pregnenolone to 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, and a substantial amount of the 17α-hydroxypregnenolone intermediate was further metabolized to DHEA, which is the 17,20-lyase product in the preferred Δ5-steroid pathway for human CYP17 (Fig. 3B, left). Cells expressing mutation E305G converted pregnenolone to 17α-hydroxypregnenolone about as well as cells expressing wild-type CYP17, but no DHEA was formed during prolonged incubations (Fig. 3B, left). When [3H]17α-hydroxypregnenolone was added to the medium, cells expressing wild-type CYP17 converted half of this substrate to DHEA after 8 h, but cells expressing mutation E305G produced no detectable DHEA (Fig. 3B, right). These data suggest that mutation E305G has selectively lost the capacity to cleave 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to DHEA, whereas all other assayed activities are normal, if not enhanced. However, these experiments do not reveal the mechanisms responsible for this unique change in activity profile. Steroid Metabolism in Yeast Microsomes Containing CYP17 and Mutation E305G—To measure kinetic constants for the individual reactions, we expressed wild-type CYP17 and mutation E305G in S. cerevisiae. Microsomes from transformed yeast are a versatile and consistent source of native CYP17 for enzyme assays (3.Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The 17,20-lyase activity of CYP17 is very dependent on the abundance of redox partners, and previous studies of human CYP17 in yeast incorporated cotransformation with a second plasmid for the expression of human CPR (3.Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 30.Arlt W. Martens J.W. Song M. Wang J.T. Auchus R.J. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4665-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, this approach precludes the use of inducible expression vectors for CYP17 and leaves some uncertainty that CPR plasmid amplification and thus CPR expression may vary among yeast clones and cultures, potentially complicating comparisons of 17,20-lyase activity. To increase the expression of CYP17 and to afford more consistent coexpression of human CPR, we engineered yeast str"
https://openalex.org/W1992899322,"In vitro studies have suggested that proteoglycans facilitate signaling by mammalian growth factors, but genetic evidence supporting this role has been lacking. Here, we characterize the ENU-induced mutation lazy mesoderm (lzme), which disrupts the single mouse gene encoding UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (Ugdh), an enzyme required for the synthesis of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains of proteoglycans. lzme mutants arrest during gastrulation with defects in migration of mesoderm and endoderm, a phenotype similar to that of mutants in the fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) pathway. Analysis of the expression of molecular markers indicates that Fgf signaling is blocked in lzme mutant embryos. In contrast, signaling by the growth factors Nodal and Wnt3, which are also essential during mouse gastrulation, appears to be normal in lzme embryos. The results demonstrate that proteoglycans are required during mouse gastrulation specifically to promote Fgf signaling."

In this study, to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of acrolein modification of protein, we characterized the acrolein modification of a model peptide (the oxidized B chain of insulin) by electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry method and established a novel acrolein-lysine condensation reaction. In addition, we found that this condensation adduct represented the major antigenic adduct generated in acrolein-modified protein. To identify the modification site and structures of adducts generated in the acrolein-modified insulin B chain, both the acrolein-pretreated and untreated peptides were digested with V8 protease and the resulting peptides were subjected to electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. This technique identified nine peptides, which contained the acrolein adducts at Lys-29 and the N terminus, and revealed that the reaction of the insulin B chain with acrolein gave multiple adducts, including an unknown adduct containing two molecules of acrolein per lysine. To identify this adduct, we incubated Nα-acetyllysine with acrolein and isolated a product having the same molecular mass as the unknown acrolein-lysine adduct. On the basis of the chemical and spectroscopic evidence, the adduct was determined to be a novel pyridinium-type lysine adduct, Nϵ-(3-methylpyridinium)lysine (MP-lysine). The formation of MP-lysine was confirmed by amino acid analysis of proteins treated with acrolein. More notably, this condensation adduct appeared to be an intrinsic epitope of a monoclonal antibody 5F6 that had been raised against acrolein-modified protein.

Several lines of evidence indicate that the oxidative modification of protein and the subsequent accumulation of the modified proteins have been found in cells during aging and oxidative stress and in various pathological states including premature diseases, muscular dystrophy, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis (1.Stadtman E.R.

The important agents that give rise to the modification of a protein may be represented by reactive aldehydic intermediates such as ketoaldehydes, 2-alkenals and 4-hydroxy-2-alkenals (3.Stadtman E.R. Science. 1992; 257: 1220-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar, 5.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol.

These reactive aldehydes are considered important mediators of cell damage because of their ability to covalently modify biomolecules, which can disrupt important cellular functions and can cause mutations (5.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the adduction of aldehydes to apolipoprotein B in low density lipoproteins has been strongly implicated in the mechanism by which low density lipoproteins is converted to an atherogenic form that is taken up by macrophages, leading to the formation of foam cells (7.Steinberg D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 369: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 8.Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Acrolein, an unpleasant and troublesome byproduct of overheated organic matter, occurs as a ubiquitous pollutant in the environment, e.g. the incomplete combustion of plastic materials, cigarette smoking, and overheating frying oils (9.International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans: Dry Cleaning, Some Chlorinated Solvents and other Industrial Chemicals. Vol. 63. International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France1995: 337-372Google Scholar). Acrolein is also formed endogenously through oxidation reactions such as lipid peroxidation, polyamine oxidation by amine oxidase, and myeloperoxidase-catalyzed amino acid oxidation (5.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar, 10.Uchida K. Trends Cardiovasc.

Battista S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1963; 269: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and the pulmonary wall (12.Izard C. Liberman C. Mutat. Res. 1978; 47: 115-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that acrolein causes chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges, and point mutations and reduces the colony-forming efficiency of mammalian cells (13.Ghilarducci D.P. Tjeerdemal R.S. Rev. Environ. Contamination Toxicol. 1995; 144: 95-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Moreover, acrolein has been suggested to initiate bladder cancer in rats under certain conditions (14.Cohen S.M. Garland E.M. St. John M. Okamura T. Smith R.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3577-3581PubMed Google Scholar). Among all of the α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, acrolein is by far the strongest electrophile and therefore shows the highest reactivity with nucleophiles such as proteins (5.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). Acrolein can display different reactivities toward nucleophilic groups present in a peptide sequence by either reacting with the electrophilic double bond or giving rise to nucleophilic addition on the carbonyl group to form a Schiff base. The former reaction leads to the formation of a simple propanal derivative of amino acids or acrolein-amino acid condensation adduct with a 3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino moiety (15.Uchida K.

Immunohistochemical analysis of atherosclerotic lesions from a human aorta revealed that an acrolein-derived epitope recognized by the antibody indeed constitutes the lesions in which intense positivity is associated primarily with macrophage-derived foam cells (16.Uchida K.

Furthermore, utilizing an immunoassay system (18.Satoh K. Yamada S. Koike Y. Toyokuni S. Kumano T. Takahata T. Hayakari M. Tuchida S. Uchida K. Anal.

In this study, to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of the acrolein modification of protein, we extensively analyzed the acrolein-treated insulin B chain by electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (ESI-LC/MS) and ESI-LC/MS/MS. In addition, during the course of this study, we identified a novel pyridinium-type lysine adduct, Nϵ-(3-methylpyridinium)lysine (MP-lysine), and found that this condensation adduct represented a major epitope of a monoclonal antibody 5F6 that had been raised against the acrolein-modified protein. Materials—The oxidized B chain of insulin, Nα-acetyl-l-lysine, acrolein, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma. Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (endoproteinase Glu-C) was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). General Procedures—NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker AMX400 (400 MHz) instrument. Ultraviolet absorption spectra were measured with a Hitachi U-Best-50 spectrophotometer. Reaction of Nα-Acetyllysine with Acrolein—The reaction mixture contained 100 mmNα-acetyllysine and 100 mm acrolein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were analyzed with a reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-MG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Nomura Chemicals, Aichi, Japan) equilibrated in a solution of 5% methanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 200–400 nm. The reaction provided one major product (P-1) and one minor product (P-2). P-1 was identical to the Nα-acetyl derivative of FDP-lysine (15.Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Morimitsu Y. Osawa T. Noguchi N. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16058-16066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). P-2 was isolated (yield, 10 mg), and its chemical structure was characterized by LC/MS with a Jasco Platform II-LC instrument and 1H and 13C NMR spectrometries (1H NMR (D2O): δH 1.34 (2H, m), δH 1.61 (2H, m), δH 1.79 (1H, m), δH 1.95 (1H, m), δH 2.10 (3H, s), δH 2.90 (2H, t, J = 8.00 Hz), δH 4.23 (1H, m), δH 7.28 (1H, t, J = 7.04 Hz), δH 8.26 (1H, d, J = 8.08 Hz), δH 8.52 (1H, d, J = 6.02 Hz), δH 8.57 (1H, s); δC 18.52, 22.48, 22.96, 30.67, 30.71, 53.27, 62.16, 128.39, 140.96, 142.19, 144.56, 147.04, 175.13, and 176.53), where m = multiplet, t = triplet, d = doublet, and s = singlet. Reaction of Insulin B Chain with Acrolein—Oxidized insulin B chain (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 1 mm acrolein in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction was terminated by centrifugal filtration (Microcon 3, molecular weight cut-off of 3000, Millipore) to remove the low molecular weight reactants. Peptide Mapping—Native and acrolein-modified insulin B chains (0.5 mg/ml) were digested with V8 protease in 0.1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C for 24 h using an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w) and then analyzed by a reverse-phase HPLC. Separation of the products was carried out on a nanospace SI-1 HPLC system (SHISEIDO Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) using a Capcell Pak C18 UG120 column (SHISEIDO Co., Ltd.). These samples were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1% acetic acid in water (solvent A)-acetonitrile (solvent B) (time = 0, 10% solvent B; 0–5 min, 10% solvent B; 5–10, 15% solvent B; 10–45 min, 60% solvent B). The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, and the column temperature was controlled at 40 °C. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 215 nm. ESI-LC/MS and ESI-LC/MS/MS Analyses—The ESI-LC/MS and ESI-LC/MS/MS analyses were performed on an LCQ ion trap mass system (Thermo Electron Co.) equipped with an electrospray ion source. The electrospray system employed a 5-kV spray voltage and a capillary temperature at 260 °C. Spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode with a scan range from m/z 200 to 2000. Collision-induced dissociation experiments in the positive ion mode were performed by setting the relative collision energy at 31% using helium as the collision gas. Amino Acid Analysis—Changes in the amino acid composition and the formation of acrolein-lysine adducts were assessed by amino acid analysis. An aliquot (0.1 ml) of the protein samples incubated in the absence or presence of acrolein was treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 3 min, the proteins were hydrolyzed in vacuo with 6 n HCl for 24 h at 105 °C. The hydrolysates were then concentrated and dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The amino acid analysis was performed using a JEOL JLC-500 amino acid analyzer equipped with a JEOL LC30-DK20 dataanalyzing system. SDS-PAGE Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Anti-acrolein-modified protein mAb5F6 was generated as previously described by Uchida et al. (16.Uchida K. Kanematsu M. Sakai K. Matsuda M. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Suzuki D. Miyata T. Noguchi N. Niki E. Osawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4882-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—A coating antigen was prepared by incubating 1 mg of BSA with 2 mm acrolein in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h at 37 °C. A 100-μl aliquot of the antigen solution was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 20 h at 4 °C. The antigen solution was then removed, and the plate was washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 10% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween). Each well was incubated with 200 μl of 1% BSA in TBS/Tween for 30 min at 37 °C in a moist chamber to block the unsaturated plastic surface. The plate was then washed once with TBS/Tween. A 100-μl aliquot of competitor/antibody mixtures containing antibody at 25 ng/ml and variable concentrations of the competitor was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After discarding the supernatants and washing three times with TBS/Tween, 100 μl of a 5 × 104 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in TBS/Tween was added. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the supernatant was discarded and the plates were washed three times with TBS/Tween. Enzyme-linked antibody bound to the well was revealed by adding 100 μl/well 1,2-phenylenediamine in 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.003% hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2 m sulfuric acid, and absorbance at 492 nm was read on a micro-ELISA plate reader. Results were expressed as the ratio B/Bo, where B = [absorbance in the presence of competitor – background absorbance (no antibody)] and Bo = [absorbance in the absence of competitor – background absorbance]. ESI-LC/MS Analysis of Acrolein-modified Insulin B Chain—To gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of the acrolein modification of protein, oxidized insulin B chain containing four possible target amino acid residues (His-5, His-10, Lys-29, and N-terminal phenylalanine) was chosen as the model peptide. The native and acrolein-treated insulin B chain were digested with V8 protease and then analyzed by ESI-LC/MS. V8 protease digestion of insulin B chain theoretically generates three fragments, namely FVNQHLC*GSHLVE (C*, Cys-SO3H) (B1), ALYLVC*GE (B2), and RGFFYTPKA (B3). As shown in Fig. 1 (chromatogram A), limited proteolysis of native insulin B chain with V8 protease indeed gave three fragments, a, b, and c. These unmodified fragments showed the [M + H]+ at m/z 1086.7 (fragment a), 1530.7 (fragment b), and 915.3 (fragment c) (Fig. 2) that were consistent with their calculated molecular mass of [M + H]+ 1086.6 (B3), 1530.7 (B1), and 915.4 (B2), respectively. On the other hand, reaction of the peptide with acrolein (1–10 mm) followed by V8 protease digestion resulted in the formation of a complex mixture of different species (fragments d, e, f, g, h, and i) whose relative abundance slightly changed with the concentrations of acrolein (Fig. 1, chromatograms B–E). On the basis of their mass value, it was presumed that the fragments d, e, f, and g were originated from the modification of the sequence B1 and the fragments h and i were originated from the modification of the sequence B3 (Fig. 2). Acrolein was anticipated to form three different types of adducts, namely the aldimine-, propanal-, and FDP-type adducts (Fig. 3), resulting in the increments of 38, 56, and 94 Da, respectively, in the mass value of the peptide. Relative to the calculated masses of the unmodified fragments, two fragments (d and e) were shown to have a mass increase of 38 Da corresponding to a Schiff base adduct (Fig. 2). We also detected two fragments f and h, which showed an increased mass of 94 Da, and two fragments g and i, which had an increased mass of 76 Da (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Mass spectra of peptides from native and acrolein-modified insulin B chains digested with V8 protease.

However, such acrolein modification of lysine, corresponding to the mass increment of 76 Da, is unknown. In addition, it is also unclear whether fragments f and g, which had the increased mass of 76 and 94 Da, represent singly or doubly modified peptides with two acrolein molecules. Hence, to further characterize the acrolein modification of the insulin B chain, both unmodified fragments (a, b, and c) and acrolein-modified fragments (d, e, f, g, h, and i) were analyzed by ESI-LC/MS/MS without additional chromatography. The MS/MS analysis of the [M + H]+ at m/z 1086.7 from fragment a, the [M + H]+ at m/z 1530.7 from fragment b, and the [M + H]+ at m/z 915.3 from fragment c confirmed the identity of the sequences and their lack of modifications (Supplemental Fig. S1, panels a–c). Table I summarizes the MS/MS analysis of the V8 protease-digested acrolein-modified insulin B chain. The presence of an adduct containing the mass addition of 38 Da on Phe (N terminus) was confirmed in fragments d and e (Supplemental Fig. S1, panels d and e). The MS/MS analysis of fragments f and h confirmed the identity of these peptides and the presence of an FDP-type adduct containing the mass addition of 94 Da on Phe (N terminus) and Lys-29, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S1, panels f and h). The MS/MS analysis of fragments g and i revealed the occurrence of a single modifying group with a mass addition of 76 Da and identified the acrolein modification sites to be Phe (N terminus) and Lys-29, respectively (Supplemental Fig. S1, panels g and i). The appearance of such mass increment suggested the presence of some unknown dimeric acrolein species in the peptides. In addition, no shift of the molecular mass of the peptides was observed after treatment with NaCNBH3 (data not shown). This observation suggests that the unknown adduct may not have aldehyde and aldimine bonds.Table ISummary of peptides from V8 protease-digested acrolein-modified insulin B chainPeak[M + H]+ΔmaΔm represents mass increment in the mass value of unmodified peptide.Modification siteDaa1086.7b1530.7c915.3d1568.838N terminus (Phe)e1568.738N terminus (Phe)f1624.794N terminus (Phe)g1606.776N terminus (Phe)h1180.794Lysi1162.776Lysa Δm represents mass increment in the mass value of unmodified peptide. Open table in a new tab Identification of a Novel Acrolein-Lysine Adduct—To characterize the putative acrolein adduction to primary amine corresponding to the mass increment of 76 Da, Nα-acetyllysine was incubated with an equimolar concentration of acrolein in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h and the products were analyzed by LC/MS. As shown in Fig. 4, the LC/MS analysis with selected ion monitoring detected one product (product 2), which showed a 76-Da increase in the mass value of the unmodified lysine derivative and gave the [M + H]+ peak at m/z 264.9. To characterize the chemical structure of the product, isolation by HPLC on the reverse-phase column was carried out. After purification, the structure of the product was characterized by NMR analysis. Compared with the 13C NMR spectra between Nα-acetyllysine and the product, eight signals (δC 14.8, 20.0, 26.0, 130.7, 143.8, 144.5, 145.9, and 153.3) remained in the 13C NMR spectrum of the product, which seemed to originate from two molecules of acrolein in the reaction with Nϵ-amine of Nα-acetyllysine (Supplemental Fig. S2). The five signals (δC 130.7, 143.8, 144.5, 145.9, and 153.3) suggested the presence of an aromatic ring. The remaining three signals corresponded to two methyls (δH 1.13/δC 14.8; δH 2.63/δC 20.0) and one methylene (δH 2.65/δC 26.0). In addition, the UV spectrum of product 2 exhibited a λmax(ϵ) of 276 nm. These data suggested that the product was composed of one pyridinium ring and one methyl group. An 1H-detected multiple-bond heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMBC) experiment showed the correlations of the ϵ-CH2 protons and methyl protons (δH 2.63) to δC 153.3 (C-2), but a correlation of the ethyl protons to C-2 was not observed, indicating the presence of the methyl group at the C-2 position. In addition, the HMBC experiment also showed the correlations of the ϵ-CH2 protons to C-6; H-6 showed correlations to CH2 (δC 26.0), C-2, and C-4 (1.29 ppm); and CH3 (δH 1.13) showed correlations to CH2 (δC 26.0) and C-5 (Fig. 5). Based on these characteristics, it was determined that product 2 was a novel acrolein-lysine adduct, Nα-acetyl-Nϵ-(3-methylpyridinium)lysine (Nα-acetyl-MPlysine).Fig. 5The proposed structure and HMBC spectrum of P-2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Formation of MP-Lysine in Acrolein-modified Protein—The reactivity of acrolein to the protein was briefly evaluated by the SDS-PAGE analysis in which the expanse and mobility shift of the protein bands were observed (Fig. 6A). To assess the formation of MP-lysine in the acrolein-modified proteins, we first attempted to detect the adduct in the hydrolyzed samples of authentic Nα-acetyl-MP-lysine. Upon acid hydrolysis followed by amino acid analysis of Nα-acetyl-MP-lysine, a new peak that was distinguishable from other amino acids was detected (Fig. 6B). In addition, the same peak was detected in the hydrolysate of BSA treated with acrolein. Hence, we characterized the stoichiometry of the loss of lysine residues and the concomitant formation of the acrolein-lysine adducts, FDP-lysine, and MP-lysine in the protein exposed to acrolein. As shown in Fig. 6C, a significant loss of lysine residues was observed when BSA (1 mg/ml) was exposed to 0–10 mm acrolein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 24 h at 37 °C. In addition, the loss of lysine residues was accompanied by the formation of both acrolein-lysine adducts. There was a marked tendency for the FDP-lysine to be more preferentially formed than the MP-lysine at lower concentrations of acrolein. However, even after the formation of the FDP-lysine reached a plateau when the protein was treated with 2∼4 mm acrolein, the formation of the MP-lysine continued to increase with further increases in the concentration of acrolein. Upon incubation of BSA with the highest level of acrolein (10 mm) for 24 h at 37 °C, ∼43 mol of lysine residues/mol protein was lost (the total number of lysine residues per mol protein obtained by amino acid analysis was 60 molecules). These losses were accompanied by the formation of FDP-lysine (21 mol/mol) and MP-lysine (10 mol/mol), accounting for ∼49 and 23% of the lysine residues that had disappeared, respectively (Fig. 6C). Identification of MP-Lysine as the Major Epitope of a Monoclonal Antibody against Acrolein-modified Protein—To investigate whether acrolein is produced in vivo, we previously raised mAb5F6 against acrolein-modified protein and demonstrated that acrolein was accumulated in the form covalently bound to proteins in vivo (10.Uchida K.

During development, the activation of these receptors leads to membrane depolarization. Ligands for the two receptors have important implications both in disease therapy and as pharmacological tools. Terpene trilactones (ginkgolides and bilobalide) are unique constituents of Ginkgo biloba extracts that have various effects on the central nervous system. We have investigated the relative potency of these compounds on glycine and GABAA receptors. We find that most of the ginkgolides are selective and potent antagonists of the glycine receptor.

Both ginkgolides and bilobalide inhibit GABAA receptors, with bilobalide demonstrating a more potent effect. Additionally, we provide evidence that open channels are required for glycine receptor inhibition by ginkgolides. Finally, we employ molecular modeling to elucidate the similarities and differences in the structure of the terpene trilactones to account for the pharmacological properties of these compounds and demonstrate a striking similarity between ginkgolides and picrotoxinin, a GABAA and recombinant glycine α-homomeric receptor antagonist.

These receptors share several structural similarities, i.e. a pentameric arrangement of subunits, each composed of four transmembrane domains (M1-M4) and an extracellular 15-residue Cys-loop motif-bearing N terminus (1.Ortells M.O. Lunt G.G. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 2.Leite J.F. Cascio M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 777-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the adult, GlyRs consisting of α1-α4 and β subunits are found primarily in spinal cord and brain stem but are also present in higher brain regions such as hippocampus. During embryonic development, functional GlyRs are also expressed in the neocortex (3.Flint A.C. Liu X. Kriegstein A.R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) with α2 as the predominant subunit (4.Betz H. Kuhse J. Schmieden V. Laube B. Kirsch J. Harvey R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Few antagonists for GlyRs are known; the classical example is strychnine, which is a competitive antagonist. Also, the plant alkaloids picrotin and picrotoxinin (components of picrotoxin) are non-use-dependent antagonists that are equally efficacious in blocking recombinant homo-oligomeric GlyRs containing α subunits (5.Betz H. Harvey R.J. Schloss P. Mohler, H. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 150Google Scholar) but not the native α/β heteromers. GABAARs are functionally expressed very early in cortical development by proliferating precursor cells (6.LoTurco J.J. Owens D.F. Heath M.J. Davis M.B. Kriegstein A.R. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1287-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar), now known to be radial glial cells (7.Noctor S.C. Flint A.C. Weissman T.A. Dammerman R.S. Kriegstein A.R.

Development. 2000; 127: 5253-5263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and by immature cortical neurons. The subunit composition of GABAARs changes significantly during development, and this is reflected in the pharmacological properties of the GABA-induced responses (9.Owens D.F. Liu X. Kriegstein A.R. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). GABAARs have been implicated not only in synaptic signaling but also in a number of developmental events including proliferation and migration (10.Owens D.F. Kriegstein A.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). It is also likely that GlyRs and GABAARs have overlapping pathways during development because both receptors activate chloride channels and indirectly induce an increase in intracellular calcium in embryonic cortical neurons, thereby mediating a variety of cellular processes. glycine receptor γ-aminobutyric acid GABA type A GABAA receptor ginkgolide A ginkgolide B ginkgolide C ginkgolide M ginkgolide J bilobalide picrotoxinin artificial cerebrospinal fluid. glycine receptor γ-aminobutyric acid GABA type A GABAA receptor ginkgolide A ginkgolide B ginkgolide C ginkgolide M ginkgolide J bilobalide picrotoxinin artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Plant and animal products traditionally provide a rich source of drug candidates and pharmacological tools. The tree Ginkgo biloba has long been believed to have medicinal properties, and its extracts are among the most widely sold herbal supplements in the world. G. biloba extracts are standardized according to their content of flavonoids (22-24%) and terpene trilactones (6-8%), which are believed to be the active components. Although the bioavailability of flavonoids is limited, terpene trilactones, in particular ginkgolides A and B (GA and GB), and bilobalide (BB) are highly bioavailable (11.DeFeudis F.V. Drieu K. Curr. Drug Targets. 2000; 1: 25-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Extracts of G. biloba have been shown to be effective in symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate dementia of Alzheimer disease type as well as dementia of cerebrovascular origin (11.DeFeudis F.V. Drieu K. Curr. Drug Targets. 2000; 1: 25-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and have been reported to improve memory, although the latter claim remains controversial (12.Solomon P.R. Adams F. Silver A. Zimmer J. DeVeaux R. JAMA. 2002; 288: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although a number of studies have shown various effects of G. biloba extract, very little is known about the direct effect of the individual components on the central nervous system. Recent work has indicated that ginkgolides and BB might interact with inhibitory signaling in the brain. A recent report suggested that GB inhibits glycine receptors in the hippocampus (13.Kondratskaya E.L. Lishko P.V. Chatterjee S.S. Krishtal O.A. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and several reports have shown that BB interferes with the GABAergic system, although both enhancement and inhibition have been reported (14.Sasaki K. Hatta S. Haga M. Ohshika H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 367: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15.Sasaki K. Hatta S. Wada K. Ohshika H. Haga M.

Endocrinol. 1999; 124: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For these reasons we have addressed exactly how the unique components of G. biloba, ginkgolides and bilobalide, may exert their effect in the central nervous system. We show that the ginkgolides and bilobalide are selective antagonists of glycine and GABAA receptors, we demonstrate that GC inhibition of embryonic cortical GlyRs requires open channels, and that GB has several structural similarities to the GABAA receptor antagonist, picrotoxinin. All experiments followed National Institutes of Health guidelines and were done in full compliance with the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Brain Slice Preparation—Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic, New York) at embryonic day E20 were used for all experiments. Rats were anesthetized (ketamine, 90 mg/kg, and xylazine, 10 mg/kg), and embryos were removed for further dissection. Following rapid decapitation, the brain was removed in chilled artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 25 mm glucose, pH 7.4, 310 mosmol/liter). The dissected brain was placed in 4% low melting agarose (Fisher Scientific) in ACSF. Agarose was cooled on ice and allowed to solidify, and the embedded brain was sliced into coronal sections (400 μm) in ice-cold ACSF using a Leica VT100S vibrating blade microtome (Nussloch, Germany). Slices were allowed to recover at room temperature in oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) ACSF. They were subsequently used for electrophysiological recording or loaded for calcium imaging. Calcium Imaging—Brain slices were bath-loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester form of the calcium indicator dye fluo-3 (fluo-3 AM, 10-15 μm, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Loading was performed in the dark, at room temperature for 1-3 h. Loaded slices were placed in an imaging chamber on the stage of an upright compound microscope (Olympus BX50-WI, Tokyo, Japan) and continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF. Epifluorescence imaging of fluo-3 was performed using a 100-watt mercury light source and a low light charge-coupled device camera (Dage-MTI 300-T, Michigan City, IN). For fluo-3 imaging, we used following fluorescence filters (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT): excitation filter, 480 ± 20 nm; dichroic mirror, 505-nm long-pass; and emission filter, 535 ± 25 nm. Cells were imaged using 10× water immersion objective, and the photobleaching was minimized by controlling a shutter positioned in the excitation light path (Uniblitz S25, Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). Time-lapse images were acquired every 2 s using the Scion Image program on a Macintosh G3 computer equipped with video frame grabber (Scion LG-3, Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Fluorescence changes were measured in selected cells using Scion Image. Pharmacological Agents—Ginkgolides A, B, C, and J (GA, GB, GC, and GJ) and bilobalide were obtained by extraction of leaves from G. biloba, purification by column chromatography, and recrystallization, as previously described (17.Lichtblau D. Berger J.M. Nakanishi K. J. Nat. Prod. 2002; 65: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18.van Beek T.A. Lelyved G.P. J. Nat. Prod. 1997; 60: 735-738Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ginkgolide M (GM) was from previous studies (19.Nakanishi K. Pure Appl. Chem. 1967; 14: 89-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The purity of these compounds was >99%, as determined by 1H NMR. Stock solutions of ginkgolides, bilobalide, and picrotoxin (RBI, Natick, MA) were prepared by dissolving in Me2SO to 10 mm and were stored at -20 °C until use. Glycine, taurine (Sigma), and γ-aminobutyric acid (RBI, Natick, MA) were prepared as stock solutions in distilled deionized H2O and diluted in ACSF to final concentration. All drugs were applied focally by DAD-12 Superfusion System (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). Electrophysiology—Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed with an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Electronic, Lambrecht, Germany). Data were acquired with HEKA Pulse v. 8.0 software (HEKA Electronic, Lambrecht, Germany). Borosilicate glass (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) electrode pipettes (5-8 megohms) were filled with 130 mm CsCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 11 mm EGTA (pH 7.4 at 25 °C, 265-275 mosmol/liter). Unless otherwise indicated, neurons were voltage-clamped at -60 mV. Data Analysis—All calcium imaging data were presented as a change in fluorescence over base-line fluorescence, ΔF/F0 = (F - F0)/F0, and plotted over time. Analysis was done by averaging 10-15 cells for each condition, and data were plotted as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between two groups was evaluated with a Student's t test. Probability (p) values of less than 0.01 were considered to be statistically significant. Molecular Modeling—Molecular mechanics calculations with MM2* force field and Monte Carlo conformational searches were executed with MacroModel 6.0 (Schrödinger, Inc., Portland, OR). Non-empirical molecular modeling calculations were executed with Jaguar 4.1 (Schrödinger, Inc., Portland, OR) at the B3LYP level with 6-31 G basis set (20.Hariharan P.C. Pople J.A. Mol. Phys. 1974; 27: 209-214Crossref Scopus (2078) Google Scholar) including the geometry optimization. GB and picrotoxinin (PTX) were overlaid using a rigid body fit between C-11, C-15, O-6, and O-10 of GB and C-15, C-14, O-5, and O-3 of PTX as seen in Fig. 5a. Monte Carlo simulations revealed nine conformers for GA within 10 kcal/mol of the global minimum, whereas GB had 32 unique conformations in the 10 kcal/mol range. X-ray crystallographic structures were obtained from Cambridge structural data base using ConQuest 1.1 (CCDC, Cambridge, UK) and compared with the minimized conformations. The comparison showed that root mean square values were 0.4 Å for GB and 0.6 Å for PTX. Ginkgolides and bilobalide, compounds classified as terpene trilactones, share several structural similarities, in particular three lactones and a tert-butyl group. The five ginkgolides differ only by the number and placement of hydroxyl groups (Fig. 1a) (19.Nakanishi K. Pure Appl. Chem. 1967; 14: 89-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). GA, GB, and GC are found in both leaves and root bark of G. biloba, whereas GJ and GM are found only in the leaves and root bark, respectively. BB is chemically related to the ginkgolides, having three lactones but only one carbocycle, and is found in the leaves (Fig. 1a) (21.Nakanishi K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 3544-3546Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Ginkgolides Antagonize Glycine Receptors—GlyR activation opens a chloride ion channel and induces a membrane depolarization in embryonic cortical neurons because of a high intracellular chloride concentration in immature neurons (3.Flint A.C. Liu X. Kriegstein A.R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The resulting depolarization leads to the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels and a subsequent influx of calcium ions. We took advantage of this mechanism and used calcium imaging to compare the potency of various ginkgolides on glycine-induced responses in embryonic cortical neurons. Application of glycine (200 μm) resulted in an increase in intracellular calcium, which was reduced by co-application with GB (10 μm) (Fig. 1b). The effect was highly use-dependent as repeated applications of glycine and GB gradually decreased the glycine response, which by the third application was reduced to 30% (Fig. 1b). The effect was reversible, as seen by the recovery of glycine responses after a 20-min wash with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (Fig. 1c). The glycine responses were reduced to 67, 48, and 30%, respectively, by three consecutive co-applications of glycine and GB (Fig. 1c). These findings are in agreement with an initial report on the effect of GB on glycine receptors in hippocampal pyramidal neurons isolated from adult rats (13.Kondratskaya E.L. Lishko P.V. Chatterjee S.S. Krishtal O.A. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the other ginkgolides and bilobalide also antagonized glycine responses because they share a similar chemical structure, and their affect has not yet been reported. We tested GA, GB, GC, GJ, and GM, together with BB and picrotoxin at the same low concentration (10 μm), to determine the relative inhibiting potency of these compounds. GB, GC, and GM were the most potent antagonists and by the third application decreased glycine responses to 30-40% of control, whereas GA and GJ reduced the response to a lesser extent (70-80% of control, Fig. 1d). The sesquiterpenoid BB had no effect on glycine-induced calcium increases in this assay at the concentration tested. Picrotoxin had no effect on glycine responses (Fig. 1d). Changes in intracellular calcium only indirectly reflect activation of GlyRs and depend on the kinetics of the voltage-gated calcium channels. In addition, restoration of base-line calcium levels depends both on the GlyR gating and on the recovery of the resting intracellular calcium concentration. To directly observe the effect of BB and the most potent ginkgolides, GB and GC, on glycine-induced currents, we used whole-cell patchclamp recordings. A short (1-min) preincubation in GB (10 μm), followed by its co-application with glycine (500 μm) resulted in potent inhibition of the glycine response in cortical neurons (Fig. 2a). Because taurine has been suggested as an endogenous ligand for GlyR (3.Flint A.C. Liu X. Kriegstein A.R. Neuron. 1998; 20: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 22.Mori M. Gahwiler B.H. Gerber U. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 191-200Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we also tested the effect of GB on taurine (5 mm)-induced responses (Fig. 2b). The effect was consistent with GlyR inhibition and was use-dependent and reversible. Because BB represents about 50% of the terpene trilactones, being the major single component in G. biloba extracts, we wondered if it would reduce glycine-induced currents. BB (10 μm) was much less potent than GB (10 μm), but it still induced a significant decrease of glycine (200 μm) responses (Fig. 2c). Contrary to the pattern of GB inhibition, BB antagonism did not change significantly with repeated application. Interestingly, both BB and GB showed a more pronounced effect on glycine-induced currents, measured in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, compared with their effect on intracellular calcium increases (compare Figs. 1d and 2c). Therefore, the fact that we did not observe a significant decrease in the glycine-induced calcium response in the presence of BB most likely results from an incomplete block of glycine-induced currents by BB that was not sufficient to alter the intracellular calcium change. Ginkgolide C Requires an Open Channel for the Inhibition of Embryonic Glycine Receptors—GC is one of the three most potent glycine receptor antagonists present in G. biloba extracts. To get a better understanding of the use-dependent effect characteristic of ginkgolides, we used a whole-cell patchclamp recording and applied glycine (500 μm) every 60 s in the presence of 10 μm GC (Fig. 3a) following two initial control glycine applications. Even after a short 1-min GC preincubation, the glycine response was dramatically reduced (to 32.7 ± 4.5%) and quickly (after 3-4 applications) reached a plateau. The effect was partially reversible as demonstrated by a slow recovery of the glycine response after a washout period. Control glycine applications were done every minute in the absence of GC. The glycine responses showed a slight desensitization with repeated application. To determine whether open channels are necessary for the use-dependent effect, we examined the effect of prolonged preincubation on the degree of inhibition. We used a double application protocol, wherein the first glycine application was a control, and during the second, glycine and GC were co-applied following a 1- or 10-min-long GC preincubation (Fig. 3b). In control experiments, glycine was applied twice without GC. Results are presented as the ratio between the second and the first glycine responses recorded from the same cell. Our data show that the degree of inhibition did not depend on the length of preincubation. Moreover, when glycine and GC were co-applied without any preincubation, responses were not only reduced, but the response kinetics were dramatically changed reflecting an abrupt blockade of glycine channels even before the end of drug application (Fig. 3c). These data, taken together, suggest a requirement for open channels in glycine receptor inhibition. Bilobalide and Ginkgolide B Antagonize GABAAReceptors—The GABAA receptor subtype is the only functional ionotropic GABA receptor type expressed in embryonic pyramidal neurons as demonstrated by a complete block of GABA-induced current with 50 μm bicuculine (9.Owens D.F. Liu X. Kriegstein A.R. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Whole-cell recordings performed on cortical neurons demonstrated attenuation of GABAA responses by both GB and BB, with BB proving the more potent of the two compounds. A short (1-min) incubation in the drug was followed by co-application of the drug with GABA (30 μm). Fig. 4 illustrates the typical responses to 30 μm GABA that were reduced by co-application with 50 μm GB (Fig. 4a) or BB (Fig. 4b). At this concentration, GB and BB reduced GABA responses to 63.2 ± 0.3% (n = 5) and 46.8 ± 0.3% (n = 5), respectively. Interestingly, the effect of GB on GABA responses was not use-dependent, as tested by three successive applications in which the response was reduced no further (not shown). The dose-response relationships for the inhibitory action of GB and BB on GABA-induced (30 μm) responses are illustrated in Fig. 4c. Calculated values for the IC50 (GB, IC50 = 73 μm; BB, IC50 = 46 μm) demonstrated that BB is about 1.6 times as potent as GB. The IC50 value for BB was significantly smaller than the one obtained on recombinant α1β2γ2L GABAAR expressed in Xenopus oocytes (23.Huang S.H. Duke R.K. Chebib M. Sasaki K. Wada K. Johnston G.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 464: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) most likely reflecting a different effect of BB on receptors with different subunit composition. Ginkgolide B and Picrotoxinin Show Structural Similarity—These findings led us to investigate a structural rationalization for the effects of ginkgolides, particularly of GB, and to compare them with PTX. We analyzed their molecular properties through modeling (24.Mohamadi F. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 440-467Crossref Scopus (3924) Google Scholar) and validated our approach by comparison with the x-ray crystallographic structures of GB (25.Dupont L. Dideberg O. Germain G. Braquet P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. C Cryst. Struct. Commun. 1986; 42: 1759-1762Crossref Google Scholar) and PTX (26.Andrews P.R. Aust. J. Chem. 1983; 36: 2219-2225Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The minimized structures were found to be similar to those determined by x-ray (root mean square deviations: GB = 0.4 Å and PTX = 0.6 Å), although there were some differences in the extent of intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The minimized structures of GB and PTX showed remarkable similarity in several respects. Each molecule forms a cave structure, where the bottom is composed of a five- or sixmembered carbocycle, and the walls are a pair of lactones (Fig. 5). The caves are of similar size, the distance between the lactone carbonyl oxygen molecules being 5.8 and 5.2 Å for GB and PTX, respectively, with a root mean square deviation of 0.4 Å for the rigid body fit of the two lactone rings in both molecules (Fig. 5). Moreover, the orientation of the lactone pairs is of a similar magnitude, their projection angles being -26° in GB and -24° in PTX. In addition to this similarity in core structure, the two compounds have important moieties located in analogous positions. The tert-butyl group of GB is located in the same region as the isoprenyl group of PTX, although the tert-butyl group is bulkier, and the 1-OH of GB overlays very well with the 6-OH of PTX (Fig. 5). Structural Investigation of the Relative Activities of Ginkgolides—We also investigated differences in activity among the ginkgolides from a structural perspective. GB, GC, and GM, the more potent glycine antagonists, share a 1-OH, whereas the less potent GA and GJ do not (Fig. 1a). The importance of the 1-OH for the core structure was investigated via a Monte Carlo conformational search performed on GA and GB as representative compounds. All conformers of GA were found to have larger distance-spanning lactone rings C and F compared with GB. Moreover, very little flexibility in either lactone ring of GB was seen, suggesting that the larger lactone distance in GA is significant. The 1-OH in GB may form a hydrogen bond with the 10-OH to hold the two lactones together. Comparison of Bilobalide with Ginkgolide B and Picrotoxinin—BB is structurally related to GB and PTX in that it contains three lactone groups but unlike GB has only one carbocycle. BB was overlaid with GB and PTX, respectively (data not shown). A comparison of BB with GB showed that the proposed important functional groups of GB and BB can be overlaid individually but not at the same time, underlining important differences in GB and BB. Comparing the minimized structures of BB and PTX showed much less similarity. In neither of those cases is there a striking overlap of lactones, tert-butyl/isoprenyl groups, or hydroxyl functionalities as was observed for GB and PTX (Fig. 5). We have shown that the terpene trilactone constituents of G. biloba have antagonistic activity at the two major types of ionotropic receptors mediating fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the adult mammalian central nervous system, both of which have also been shown to be active during development. The ginkgolides, in particular GB and GC, antagonize glycine responses in the embryonic rat cortex in a use-dependent manner as was suggested previously for GB in hippocampal neurons isolated from adult rats (13.Kondratskaya E.L. Lishko P.V. Chatterjee S.S. Krishtal O.A. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, GB affects GABAARs, only at much higher concentrations, thus suggesting that GB is the first selective non-competitive antagonist of GlyRs. We have also investigated the relative potency of the ginkgolides at GlyRs, showing that GB, GC, and GM are significantly more potent than GA and GJ. These differences can be explained structurally as GB, GC, and GM possess a 1-OH group, whereas GA and GJ do not, thus suggesting that the 1-OH group is important for activity. However, when performing Monte Carlo simulations of GA and GB we have shown that the relative position of the lactone groups is different in GA and GB. Thus, the difference in activity of GA and GB could be because of a direct interaction of 1-OH with the receptor, or it could be that 1-OH, by hydrogen-bonding, keeps the lactone groups in GB in a position that is more favorable for receptor interaction. Additionally, we studied BB, the major single component in G. biloba extract constituting 3-4%. BB is structurally related to ginkgolides and shares several functional groups, in particular three lactone groups and a tert-butyl group, and has been postulated to have anxiolytic properties and possibly to be useful as a neuroprotective agent (27.DeFeudis F.V. Ginkgo Biloba Extract (EGb 761). Ullstein Medical, Wiesbaden1998Google Scholar). Recent studies indicated that BB might modulate GABAergic neurotransmission, as BB has been reported to elevate the GABA levels, probably by enhancing glutamic acid decarboxylase activity (14.Sasaki K. Hatta S. Haga M. Ohshika H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 367: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15.Sasaki K. Hatta S. Wada K. Ohshika H. Haga M. Life Sci. 2000; 67: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), reduce muscimol responses (16.Sasaki K. Oota I. Wada K. Inomata K. Ohshika H. Haga M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Part C Pharmacol. Toxicol. Endocrinol. 1999; 124: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and decrease the frequency of GABA uptake inhibitor-induced depolarizations (28.Jones F.A. Chatterjee S.S. Davies J.A. Amino Acids (Vienna). 2002; 22: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). BB has also been reported to antagonize recombinant α1β2γ2L GABAAR (23.Huang S.H. Duke R.K. Chebib M. Sasaki K. Wada K. Johnston G.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 464: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, the effect of BB on glycine-induced responses has not been demonstrated. Here we show that BB antagonizes GABAAR activation and also reduces glycine responses, although at higher concentrations than GB. Interestingly, antagonism of both GABAA and Gly receptors by BB was not use-dependent, whereas the blockade of GlyRs by GB and GC was. This suggests that BB has a different mode of action than the ginkgolides at glycine receptors, perhaps also relating to its lower potency. Several terpenoid natural products containing lactones, such as anisatin and the picrodendrins, and the γ-butyrolactones have been suggested to bind to and antagonize GABAARs at the same site (29.Kuriyama T. Schmidt T.J. Okuyama E. Ozoe Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 1873-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30.Klunk W.E. Kalman B.L. Ferrendelli J.A. Covey D.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 23: 511-518PubMed Google Scholar). The terpene trilactones may also interact with this site, although this remains to be investigated. Using molecular modeling we have shown structural similarities between GB and PTX. Both molecules form a cave structure of similar size. The absolute and relative positions of the two lactone groups are very similar. This is likely to be functionally relevant, as structure-activity relationship studies of PTX have revealed that the lactone fused between C-3 and C-5 is essential for activity (31.Schmidt T.J. Okuyama E. Fronczek F.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2857-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, the projected position of the tert-butyl group of GB is similar to the isoprenyl group of PTX, although the former is much more bulky. Hence, it is possible that the tert-butyl of GB fits into a lipophilic pocket in GlyRs, as does the isoprenyl group of PTX in GABAARs. The importance of this isoprenyl group for activity at GABAARs is well established, as the presence of an isopropyl alcohol moiety in picrotin, the other component of picrotoxin, leads to a 30-50-fold decrease in activity at GABAAR (31.Schmidt T.J. Okuyama E. Fronczek F.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2857-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Finally, the 1-OH of GB overlaid very well with the 6-OH of PTX. The 6-OH of PTX is very important for antagonism of GABAAR, as masking of the 6-OH of PTX by acetylation leads to loss of activity (31.Schmidt T.J. Okuyama E. Fronczek F.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2857-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because docking studies have suggested that 6-OH forms hydrogen bonds with threonine residues in the M2 pore segment (32.Zhorov B.S. Bregestovski P.D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1786-1803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), it is possible that 1-OH of GB has a similar function, particularly in light of evidence that open channels are necessary for inhibition. Previously it was suggested that GB caused an open-channel block of adult GlyRs (13.Kondratskaya E.L. Lishko P.V. Chatterjee S.S. Krishtal O.A. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our experiments demonstrate that GC inhibition of embryonic GlyRs is use-dependent but that the degree of inhibition does not depend on the length of the preincubation. These results are a consistent requirement for open channels in GC inhibition. We show here that GB and PTX share several structural features that may be important for their antagonistic effects. However, there are also distinct differences in their pharmacological action, i.e. PTX does not antagonize GlyRs containing β subunits, whereas GB does antagonize GlyRs containing both α and β subunits, as shown in adult rat hippocampal neurons (13.Kondratskaya E.L. Lishko P.V. Chatterjee S.S. Krishtal O.A. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Whether ginkgolides are equally potent in inhibition of homomeric GlyRs remains to be investigated. Antagonists of inhibitory receptors in general, and GABAARs in particular, are known convulsive agents; hence the antagonizing effect of BB and GB on GABAARs might have wide ranging implications for individuals taking G. biloba extract, especially those with a lower threshold for seizures, such as epileptic patients. This risk is suggested by a recent report of two patients with well controlled epilepsy who had recurrent seizures within 2 weeks of commencing G. biloba extract that ceased after discontinuation of the supplement (33.Granger A.S. Age Ageing. 2001; 30: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In considering the role of GABAA and Gly receptors in cortical development it is also important to evaluate the potential teratogenic effects of G. biloba extract. Further studies are necessary to establish not only the effect of terpene trilactones on the developing and adult nervous system but also the combinatorial effect of all extract constituents. In conclusion, we have shown that the ginkgolides and bilobalide are antagonists of both Gly and GABAA receptors. In particular, GB and GC are selective and potent antagonists of the GlyRs thus being highly promising pharmacological tools for the study of this receptor. Molecular modeling reveals several structural similarities between GB and PTX, suggesting a similar mode of interaction with the GlyR and GABAAR, respectively. Finally, the inhibitory activity of these components of G. biloba extract, especially the action of the major constituent, BB, on the GABAAR may have important implications for people taking this supplement.

We investigated a possible redox role for the enzyme-bound cofactor 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) in the second reaction of NO synthesis, which is conversion of N-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA) to NO plus citrulline. We used stopped-flow spectroscopy and rapid-freeze EPR spectroscopy to follow heme and biopterin transformations during single-turnover NOHA oxidation reactions catalyzed by the oxygenase domain of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOSoxy). Significant biopterin radical (>0.5 per heme) formed during reactions catalyzed by iNOSoxy that contained either H4B or 5-methyl-H4B. Biopterin radical formation was kinetically linked to conversion of a heme-dioxy intermediate to a heme-NO product complex. The biopterin radical then decayed within a 200–300-ms time period just prior to dissociation of NO from a ferric heme-NO product complex. Measures of final biopterin redox status showed that biopterin radical decay occurred via an enzymatic one-electron reduction process that regenerated H4B (or 5MeH4B). These results provide evidence of a dual redox function for biopterin during the NOHA oxidation reaction. The data suggest that H4B first provides an electron to a heme-dioxy intermediate, and then the H4B radical receives an electron from a downstream reaction intermediate to regenerate H4B. The first one-electron transition enables formation of the heme-based oxidant that reacts with NOHA, while the second one-electron transition is linked to formation of a ferric heme-NO product complex that can release NO from the enzyme.

The reaction consumes 1.5 mol of NADPH and 2 mol of O2 for each NO formed from Arg and is catalyzed in two steps (Scheme 1). Arg is first hydroxy-lated to form water and Nω-hydroxyl-l-arginine (NOHA) as an enzyme-bound intermediate. NOHA is then further oxidized to generate water, NO, and citrulline. Both reactions take place in the oxygenase domain of NOS, which contains iron protoporphyrin IX (heme), the essential cofactor (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin (H4B) and the Arg binding sites (4Crane B.R.

Electrons derived from NADPH are provided to the NOS oxygenase domain by an attached reductase domain that binds FMN, FAD, and NADPH.

The NOS heme iron is ligated by a cysteine thiolate and is responsible for binding O2 and catalyzing its reductive activation during NO synthesis (9Couture M. Stuehr D.J. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10375-10381Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). How H4B facilitates this process is a topic of current interest. Investigations have typically employed single catalytic turnover reactions with recombinantly expressed NOS oxygenase domains (NOSoxy). During Arg hydroxylation there is a buildup of a H4B radical in all three NOS isozymes (11Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12Bec N. Gorren A.F.C. Mayer B. Schmidt P.P. Andersson K.K. Lange R. J. Inorg.

Chem. 2001; 6: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that H4B performs a reductive role in the reaction. Our previous work established that formation of the H4B radical is kinetically coupled to reduction of a heme ferric-superoxy intermediate (FeIIIO2-) that forms in NOS after O2 binds to its ferrous heme (14Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Electron transfer from H4B to the FeIIIO2- intermediate enables formation of a heme-oxy species that hydroxylates Arg. Moreover, the tempo of FeIIIO2- reduction by H4B is important and must be maintained for efficient Arg hydroxylation. The tempo is regulated by the protein residues that interact with H4B (for example Trp457 in mouse iNOS) (15Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Ghosh S. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12819-12825Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and by the structure of H4B itself (16Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Arvai A.S. Hemann C. Hille R. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the redox role for H4B during Arg hydroxylation seems established (17Wei C.C. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2365-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), it is still unclear if H4B is redox active during the NOHA oxidation reaction. Theoretically, it is not essential that H4B provides an electron to the FeIIIO2- intermediate in this step (18Wei C. Wang Z. Meade A. McDonald J. Stuehr D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, a model study suggested that NOHA could provide an electron directly to the FeIIIO2- species in place of H4B (19Huang H. Hah J.M. Silverman R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2674-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Only a small amount of H4B radical (∼0.03 per heme) was observed during a NOHA single turnover reaction catalyzed by iNOSoxy (11Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, we and others (20Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12830-12837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Hurshman A.R.

Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have speculated that this is still consistent with the H4B radical forming and then becoming reduced back to H4B during the time frame of the reaction. Indeed, we have argued that this behavior may be essential for NOS to generate NO instead of nitroxyl (23Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Other experimental evidence indirectly supports a redox role for H4B during NOHA oxidation. For example, NO synthesis from NOHA does not occur when enzyme-bound H4B is replaced with 6,7-dihydrobiopterin (H2B) or with the redox-inactive analog 5-deaza-tetrahydrobiopterin (20Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12830-12837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Gorren A.C. Mayer B. Curr. Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, mutational substitution of a NOS Trp residue that interacts with H4B caused similar changes in the reaction kinetics and product yields for both the Arg and NOHA single turnover reactions (20Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12830-12837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Such common influences are consistent with H4B performing a common redox role in both reactions of NO synthesis. To further investigate this possibility, we utilized stopped-flow spectroscopy and rapid-freeze EPR to follow in a time-resolved way the heme and H4B transitions that occur during NOHA oxidation as catalyzed by iNOSoxy. We found that a H4B radical does form in conjunction with FeIIIO2- disappearance, followed by a rapid reduction of the radical, all within the time frame of the single catalytic turnover. Thus, our work suggests that H4B reduces the FeIIIO2- intermediate in the NOHA reaction and then performs a distinct electron acceptor function at a later point in the reaction. The mechanistic implications of our findings are discussed. Chemicals—H4B, H2B, and 5MeH4B were obtained from Schirck's Laboratory (Jona, Switzerland). All other chemicals were either from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Protein Expression and Purification—Pterin-free mouse iNOSoxy (amino acids 1–498) containing a six-histidine tag at its C-terminal was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using the PCWori vector and purified in the absence of H4B and Arg as reported previously (14Wei C.C.

EPR spectra were recorded in a Bruker ER 300 electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer equipped with an ER 035 NMR gauss meter and a Hewlett-Packard 5352B microwave frequency counter. Temperature control was achieved using Oxford Instruments ESR 900 continuous-flow liquid helium cryostat and ITC4 temperature controller. All spectra were obtained at 150 and 4 K using a microwave power of 2 milliwatts, a frequency of 9.5 GHz, modulation amplitude of 10 G, and modulation frequency of 100 kHz. The FeIINO complex of iNOSoxy was prepared and the EPR measured as indicated previously (24Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations and reaction conditions are described in the text below. All experiments were performed in 10 °C and repeated at least three times. Redox State of Bound Biopterin—We determined the final oxidation state of bound biopterin that remained in the iNOSoxy enzyme following single catalytic turnover reactions, using an established method (25Fukushima T. Nixon J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) with modifications. A buffered solution (0.1 ml total) that contained 0.1 mm iNOSoxy, 1 mm H4B, and 10 mm Arg (or NOHA) was incubated at room temperature for 20 min to allow for binding. The solution was then passed through two consecutive Micro-spin P-30 columns (BioRad) to remove free H4B and substrate. Arg (or NOHA) was then re-added to the solution at a final concentration of 10 mm and the sample was made anaerobic by consecutive cycles of vacuum and purging with N2. The iNOSoxy was then reduced to ferrous form by addition of a near stoichiometric amount of dithionite solution. To initiate the single turnover reaction, 0.1 ml of the ferrous iNOSoxy solution was transferred using a gas tight syringe into an open eppendorf tube that contained 20 μl of O2-saturated buffer (40 mm EPPS, pH 7.5) and 4 μl of an iodine solution (0.9% (w/v) iodine in H2O). This iodine solution was needed to oxidize any excess dithionite, which if present was found to reduce oxidized biopterin in the reaction samples and thus confound the results. After vigorous mixing for ∼20 s to allow for completion of the single turnover reaction, 50-μl aliquots were transferred either into a vial containing 50 μl 0.2 n NaOH and 5 μl alkaline iodine solution (0.9% (w/v) iodine and 1.8% (w/v) KI in 0.1 n NaOH) or into a vial containing 50 μl 0.2 n HCl and 5 μl of acidic iodine solution (0.9% (w/v) iodine and 1.8% (w/v) KI in 0.1 n HCl). Samples then were incubated at room temperature in the dark for at least 1.5 h. The sample in alkaline solution was then neutralized by adding 10 μl of 1.0 n HCl, and all remaining iodine in all of the samples was quenched by adding 5 μl of freshly prepared 4% (w/v) ascorbic acid solution. The precipitated protein was removed from each sample by centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 10 min. A 5-μl aliquot from each sample was then injected into a 10 × 250-mm Microsorb C18 column (Ranin Instrument Inc.) that was equilibrated with 50 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.0. A fluorescence detector (Waters 710) was used to detect biopterin products with excitation wavelength set at 360 nm and emission wavelength set at 460 nm. Total biopterin (oxidized + reduced) was determined from the area of the peak eluting at 21.5 min that had undergone acidic workup, while oxidized biopterin was determined from the area of this same peak from the sample that had undergone basic workup (25Fukushima T. Nixon J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 176-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The amount of pterin remaining as H4B after the reaction was calculated by subtracting the amount of biopterin present in the alkaline solution from the amount of biopterin present in the acidic solution. Any dilution difference between the acidic and basic condition during the work-up was corrected for in the calculation. H4B Radical Formation during NOHA Oxidation—We looked for H4B radical formation during iNOSoxy-catalyzed oxidation of NOHA at 10 °C under single turnover conditions. Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing an anaerobic solution containing ∼300 μm ferrous iNOSoxy, 10 mm NOHA, and 2 mm H4B with O2-saturated buffer (O2 concentration is ∼2.2 mm at 0 °C (11Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)) in our rapid-freeze instrument. As shown in Fig. 1, a radical species did form during the NOHA reaction that displayed spectroscopic features that were very similar to the H4B radical formed in the Arg hydroxylation reaction (14Wei C.C.

Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12819-12825Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The radical signal in the NOHA reaction had a g = 2.0, a peak-to-trough width of ∼40 G, and a powder hyperfine structure. In replica reactions run with iNOSoxy that contained 5MeH4B in place of H4B, we detected a distinct radical signal during the NOHA reaction with properties that were similar to those of the 5MeH4B radical formed during the Arg hydroxylation reaction (Fig. 1) (16Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Arvai A.S. Hemann C. Hille R. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1969-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). No radical signal was observed in control reactions that contained H2B in place of H4B (data not shown). The data reveal that biopterin radicals do build up during the NOHA oxidation reaction. Fig. 2 shows the time course of H4B or 5MeH4B radical buildup and disappearance in the Arg and NOHA oxidation reactions catalyzed by iNOSoxy. Clearly, the biopterin radical was more transient in the NOHA reaction compared with the Arg reaction. Both the H4B and 5MeH4B radicals reached maximum abundance about 100 ms after initiating the NOHA reaction, and both signals were practically gone within 300 ms (Fig. 2). Fitting the radical signal intensities to a reaction model A → B → C (14Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) gave calculated rates of H4B radical formation and decay in the NOHA reaction of 31 and 8 s–1, respectively, with a calculated yield of 0.55 H4B radical formed per enzyme heme (Table I). Similarly, rates of 5MeH4B radical formation and decay were calculated to be 35 and 15 s–1, respectively, with 0.65 5MeH4B radical formed per enzyme heme. Thus, in the NOHA reaction, 5MeH4B radical formation was only slightly faster than that of H4B, and the 5MeH4B radical disappeared about twice as fast (Table I).Table IObserved rate constants for transformations in the single turnover reactionTransformationNOHAArgaData are from Ref. 16.H4B5MeH4BH4B5MeH4BFeIIO2- formation (s-1)47.3 ± 3.7 (4)71.9 ± 5.5 (4)52.7 ± 2.2 (4)52.7 ± 6.0 (4)FeIIO2- disappearance (s-1) or FeIIINO formation (s-1)bSpecies are not applicable to Arg hydroxylation.36.7 ± 1.1 (4)40.9 ± 1.2 (4)FeIIO2- disappearance (s-1) or FeIII formation (s-1)12.5 ± 0.2 (4)34.7 ± 2.2 (4)FeIIINO disappearance (s-1)bSpecies are not applicable to Arg hydroxylation. or FeIII formation (s-1)2.3 ± 0.1 (4)3.23 ± 0.04 (4)Biopterin radical formation (s-1)31 ± 3.2 (4)35 ± 3.3 (4)11.1 (2)40 (2)Biopterin radical decay (s-1)8.3 ± 2.7 (4)15 ± 1.2 (4)0.71 (2)0.2 (2)Theoretical yield of biopterin radical (%)55 ± 3.8 (4)65 ± 4.5 (4)∼100∼100a Data are from Ref. 16Wei C.C.

Open table in a new tab Because a H4B radical also forms in substrate-free iNOSoxy during single turnover reactions (11Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), 2C.-C. Wei, unpublished data. we checked whether the radical signals that we observed during our NOHA reaction might arise from the presence of some substrate-free enzyme. Increasing the NOHA concentration 2-fold did not reduce the radical intensity in our reactions (data not shown), consistent with iNOSoxy being saturated with substrate. In addition, the kinetics of biopterin radical formation and decay seen here in the NOHA reaction are quite distinct from the kinetics observed in reactions with substrate-free iNOSoxy. For example, in a representative substrate-free control reaction, the rates of biopterin radical formation and decay were 9.0 and 1.2 s–1, respectively. Together, this argues that the transient biopterin radicals that we observed in the NOHA reaction had formed in iNOSoxy enzyme molecules that were actively catalyzing NOHA oxidation. Fate of the H4B Radical—We next determined whether the H4B radical that formed during the NOHA or Arg reactions disappeared via an oxidative or reductive process. iNOSoxy samples were preincubated with H4B and substrate (NOHA or Arg) and then passed through a gel filtration column to remove unbound H4B just prior to setting up the single turnover reactions. The reactions were initiated by manually mixing at room temperature the filtered, anaerobic ferrous enzyme solutions that contained substrate with an O2-saturated solution, and these were then left to react for ∼20 s. We then determined the reduction state of the biopterin in each enzyme reaction sample. Fig. 3 contains representative HPLC fluorescent traces that were used to determine the amount of oxidized biopterin present in the NOHA or Arg reaction samples. Results from three experiments are listed in Table II. Almost all of the biopterin was in a fully reduced state (91 ± 2% H4B) at the end of the NOHA reaction, while at the end of the Arg reaction the biopterin was predominantly in an oxidized state (37 ± 8% H4B). 3Up to 50% of the bound H4B may have dissociated from the H4B-saturated iNOSoxy during the time it took to prepare it for the single turnover reaction in the H4B-free buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because free H4B would not have been oxidized in the single turnover Arg reaction, this helps explain why some H4B remained unoxidized at the end of the reaction. As controls, we ran reactions with iNOSoxy that contained H2B plus Arg but otherwise underwent identical procedures and with iNOSoxy that contained H4B plus Arg that did not undergo the dithionite reduction step. In both cases, the original oxidation state of the biopterin was maintained at the end of the reaction period, indicating that non-enzymatic reduction or oxidation of the biopterin did not occur (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that H4B radical disappearance in the NOHA reaction was due to an enzyme-mediated reductive process, while in the Arg reaction radical disappearance was due to an oxidative process.Table IIH4B redox status after single catalytic turnoverExperimentaThe experiments were performed using the same batch of iNOSoxy.Percentage of H4B after Arg hydroxylationbThe H4B content was determined as described in the experimental section.Percentage of H4B after NOHA oxidationbThe H4B content was determined as described in the experimental section.Exp. 12891Exp. 24089Exp. 34493a The experiments were performed using the same batch of iNOSoxy.b The H4B content was determined as described in the experimental section. Open table in a new tab Heme Transitions during NOHA Oxidation—We utilized rapid-scanning stopped-flow spectroscopy to monitor heme transitions that occurred during the NOHA single-turnover reactions catalyzed by iNOSoxy. As in our previous report (20Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12830-12837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the current data fit best to three consecutive transitions of heme species,<INLINE-FIG><LINKLOCATOR=""466684R1""></INLINE-FIG>Reaction 1 where k1, k2, and k3 are the rates of the observed transitions. In general, spectral properties of these heme species and their consecutive appearances were similar in reactions that contained H4B or 5MeH4B. The calculated Soret absorbance peaks for the FeII, FeIIIO2-, FeIIINO, and FeIII heme species were 412, 428, 438, and 395 nm, respectively, in the H4B reaction versus 412, 423, 436, and 394 nm, respectively, in the 5MeH4B reaction (spectral data not shown). The differences suggest that the pterin structure may influence the electronic properties of the heme complexes. The calculated rates for each transition are reported in Table I. Fig. 4 tracks the formation and disappearance of the various heme species during NOHA single turnover reactions catalyzed by both H4B- and 5MeH4B-saturated iNOSoxy enzymes. The spectra and time courses shown in A and C were derived from the collected spectral data using global analysis software. There was initial O2 binding which resulted in maximal buildup of an FeIIIO2- intermediate at ∼20–25 ms. Subsequent disappearance of the FeIIIO2- intermediate was also rapid and was kinetically associated with the appearance of a heme-NO product complex whose buildup was maximal at 50–100 ms. B illustrates the formation and disappearance kinetics of the heme-NO product complex as judged by a plot of absorbance at 438 nm versus time. The formation and decay rates estimated in this manner were 30.5 and 2.0 s–1, respectively, and thus were similar to the rates derived by the global analysis. NO then subsequently dissociated from the heme-NO product complex to generate ferric enzyme. We undertook single turnover studies to investigate redox functions of H4B in the second reaction of NO synthesis. We found that H4B is first oxidized to its radical and then is reduced back to H4B during enzymatic conversion of NOHA to NO. The same process occurred in an iNOSoxy reaction that contained 5MeH4B in place of H4B. Our measures of the amount of pterin radical formed per heme argue that these pterin redox transitions are significant and take place in a majority of enzyme molecules during the NOHA single turnover reactions. Thus, H4B appears to undergo two redox transitions during the second step of NO synthesis. The pterin radicals formed in the NOHA reaction displayed unique kinetic properties. For example, 5MeH4B and H4B radicals formed at similar rates in the NOHA reactions, whereas in the Arg reactions the rate of radical formation by H4B is 4 times slower than 5MeH4B (see Table I). Both pterin radicals also disappeared at least 10 times faster in the NOHA reactions compared with the Arg reactions. This is consistent with the pterin radicals being actively reduced during enzyme catalysis in the NOHA reaction, whereas the radicals are left to oxidize following completion of the Arg reaction. Together, these differences establish that the pterin operates under unique circumstances in each reaction of NO synthesis. Mechanistic Implications—To understand the potential significance and roles of H4B redox transitions during NOHA oxidation, it helps to view their timing in relation to the heme transitions that occur during the same reaction. Our stopped-flow study detected a minimum of three consecutive heme transitions that involve four heme species; the initial ferrous iNOSoxy species binds O to generate an FeIIIO2- intermediate, which then appears to convert to an FeIIINO product complex, which subsequently dissociates into ferric iNOSoxy and free NO (Fig. 5). Our stopped-flow analysis showed that the majority of oxygen binding to ferrous heme occurs within 30 ms after initiating the NOHA reactions. The FeIIIO2- intermediate then disappears by 100 ms, and this transition occurs coincident with buildup of the pterin radical. Their tight kinetic relationship is consistent with H4B radical formation representing transfer of one electron from H4B to the FeIIIO2- intermediate, as also occurs in the Arg reaction (14Wei C.C. Wang Z.Q. Wang Q. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 315-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Ghosh S. Meade A.L. Hemann C. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12819-12825Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Disappearance of the FeIIIO2- species is also coincident with buildup of a heme-NO product complex that we have identified as ferric based on its spectral signature. Thus, H4B electron transfer appeared to form a heme-based oxidant that quickly reacts with NOHA and leads to buildup of an immediate heme-NO product complex. Next there occurred a reduction of the H4B radical, beginning at around 100 ms and becoming essentially complete by 300 ms. This reductive transition is unique to the NOHA reaction. Unfortunately, reduction of the H4B radical was not associated with discernable buildup of a distinct heme spectral species. Our attempts to fit the spectral data so as to incorporate a new intermediate within this time range were not successful. The final transition (from about 300 ms onward) represents dissociation of NO from the ferric heme-NO complex and regenerates the ferric enzyme. Together, our analysis suggests that the NOHA reaction may actually contain at least four consecutive heme transitions, although only three of these transitions are distinguishable by our stopped flow analysis (Fig. 5). Importantly, two of the transitions involve separate one-electron redox transformations by H4B. Our current work reveals that H4B may perform a common function in both reactions of NO synthesis, namely, to provide an electron to the FeIIIO2- intermediate. However, in the NOHA reaction there also occurs a subsequent reductive transition whereby the H4B radical receives an electron. We believe that this function may be essential for NO synthesis. As discussed previously (23Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), if the H4B radical does not take back an electron from the system, then NOHA would undergo a two-electron oxidation instead of a three-electron oxidation and generate nitroxyl, the one-electron reduced form of NO. This process actually appears to take place in H4B-free NOS enzymes that are catalyzing NADPH-driven NOHA oxidation, as judged by buildup of a ferrous heme-NO complex during catalysis (23Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 26Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus, NOS would generate nitroxyl instead of NO if the electron transfer back to the H4B radical were blocked. What enzyme intermediate might donate an electron back to the H4B radical? This remains an open question. Our current data indicate that the electron transfer needs to occur between 100 and 300 ms (in a reaction run at 10 °C) to be associated with the observed reduction of the H4B radical. As has been discussed previously in detail (12Bec N. Gorren A.F.C. Mayer B. Schmidt P.P. Andersson K.K. Lange R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), there are at least three putative intermediates that could serve as the electron donor. Both we (23Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33554-33561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and others (12Bec N. Gorren A.F.C. Mayer B. Schmidt P.P. Andersson K.K. Lange R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Hurshman A.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3439-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have considered a putative ferrous heme-NO intermediate as one of the possible donors. Because the light spectra of NOS ferrous and ferric heme-NO complexes are similar, it is conceivable that oxidation of a putative ferrous heme-NO complex to generate the observed ferric heme-NO complex might occur during the reaction without our detecting it by stopped-flow spectral analysis. Although the NOS ferrous heme-NO complex exhibits a unique EPR signal (24Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we did not observe buildup of this particular signal in our stopped-freeze EPR samples that were collected within the appropriate time range (50–200 ms, data not shown). Thus, at present we have no data to discern which enzyme species reduces the H4B radical during the NOHA reaction. This interesting problem requires further study. Relationship to Other Reports—Our findings differ from two earlier studies that reported little or no H4B radical buildup during a NOHA single turnover reaction (11Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 12Bec N. Gorren A.F.C. Mayer B. Schmidt P.P. Andersson K.K. Lange R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We suspect that this discrepancy may reflect the inherent difficulty in detecting the transient H4B radical during the NOHA reaction. In any case, it is useful to consider the details. In one study buildup of 0.03 H4B radical per heme was observed (11Hurshman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and its rate of formation and decay were 15 and 0.2 s–1, respectively. These results differ from ours both in magnitude of the radical and its kinetic signature. In our experiments we rapidly mixed ferrous iNOSoxy containing H4B and NOHA with oxygenated buffer to initiate the reaction. In contrast, they rapidly mixed an H4B-saturated ferrous iNOSoxy with an oxygenated buffer that contained NOHA. This procedure necessitates that substrate bind during the mixing step and so may increase sample heterogeneity. However, when we repeated their experimental method in our laboratory we observed H4B radical formation and disappearance rates that matched what we have reported here, despite a somewhat lower yield of H4B radical per heme. Thus, the basis for the discrepancy is unclear. Another study reported no H4B radical buildup during NOHA oxidation (12Bec N. Gorren A.F.C. Mayer B. Schmidt P.P. Andersson K.K. Lange R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, in this case the reactions were run in 50% polyethylene glycol at cryogenic temperatures, initiated by manual mixing of an oxygenated solution, and followed by manual sample collection and freezing. Thus, our different results could be due to the use of a cryosolvent and to the poor time resolution inherent in the mixing and sample collection. Related studies show that this particular cryogenic system bestows unique properties to NOS enzymes, as manifested by differences in spectral properties of the heme-dioxy intermediate, relative stabilities of other heme-oxy species, yields of Arg hydroxylation in single turnover reactions, and yields of H4B radical in reactions run with substrate-free enzymes (27Gorren A.C.

Summary—We provide evidence of a new redox function for H4B in biology. H4B (or 5MeH4B) underwent two consecutive one-electron transitions during NOHA oxidation catalyzed by iNOSoxy. The initial transition generated the pterin radical. This was kinetically linked to formation of a heme-based oxidant that quickly reacted with NOHA and so likely represents reduction of the enzyme FeIIIO2- intermediate. A subsequent one-electron transfer reformed H4B within the enzyme. This step was kinetically linked to appearance of a ferric heme-NO product complex, which upon dissociation released NO. Thus, both redox transitions of H4B occurred within the timeframe of the single turnover catalysis and could be ascribed to different steps in the NOHA oxidation reaction mechanism. The apparent dual redox function of H4B establishes its common role in O2 activation by NOS and may also explain how the enzyme generates its free radical product (NO) via a three-electron oxidation of NOHA.

Although numerous functions for the heparan sulfate moiety of proteoglycans have been shown in vivo and in vitro, the roles of the core proteins remain largely elusive (2.Baeg G.H. Perrimon N. Curr.

The syndecan family of HSPG, as opposed to the GPI-anchored glypicans or matrix-associated HSPG, contains a transmembrane and cytosolic domain that is highly conserved across homologues and species, suggesting an important role for this part of the protein (4.Yoneda A. Couchman J.R. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Indeed, a role in FGF signaling, neurite outgrowth, dendritic spine morphogenesis, and left-right axis formation has been demonstrated (5.Kramer K.L. Barnette J.E. Yost H.J.

The cytosolic domain can be subdivided into a membrane-proximal C1 and a C-terminal C2 conserved region that is nearly identical in all syndecans and has a more variable V region in the middle. The most conserved residues are serines and tyrosines that at least partially undergo phosphorylation, a basic motif that binds nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and cytoskeletal proteins, and the C terminus that is required for interaction with PDZ proteins such as syntenin, CASK, synectin, or synbindin (for review see Ref. 4.Yoneda A.

We surmised that the remaining CTF is subject to further proteolytic degradation, ectodomain-shedding being a first step in an intracellular signaling cascade.

All cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 with 10% fetal calf serum. For serum starvation, cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 overnight. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3, complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C and spun for 15 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants containing equal amounts of protein were incubated for 90 min with mAb 2E9-Sepharose beads (26.Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1116-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Beads were washed, and bound antigen was eluted in boiling sample buffer. For glycosaminoglycan digestions, antigen coupled to the beads was incubated with 10 milliunits/ml of heparitinase and 200 milliunits/ml of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku) overnight at 37 °C in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor tablet. E30 was immunoprecipitated from the medium with anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (12CA5, Roche Applied Science) coupled to protein A. Western Blot—Samples were boiled in reducing SDS sample buffer, electrophoretically separated in an MES-buffered 12% BisTris gel (Nupage, Invitrogen), transferred to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose, probed with biotinylated anti-syndecan1/3 antibody 2E9 (26.Lories V.

Cell-free γ-Secretase Assay—In a modification of the assay of Sastre (28.Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), cells were lysed with a cell cracker (clearance of 10 μm) in 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). Brains from E17 littermates were homogenized in the same buffer with 10 strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The postnuclear supernatant (800 × g for 10 min) was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Pelleted membranes were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing complete protease inhibitor tablet. After incubation at 37 °C, membranes were spun again at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatants or resuspended pellets were boiled in sample buffer. For sequencing, cells were labeled overnight in methionine-free medium containing 200 μCi of [35S]Met, and intracellular domain (ICD) fragment was generated as described above, except that cells were lysed by 20 passages through a 26-gauge needle. Constructs—Human syndecan 3 was cloned from a human fetal brain library (Marathon cDNA, Clontech) by RACE with nested PCR. The sequences of the RACE products matched the human genome sequence, except for a V → I difference at position 208. 3′ and 5′ RACE clones were ligated in pDisplay (Invitrogen), thus generating an Igκ signal peptide, an N-terminal HA-tag, a GAQPARSPPGRS linker, and the sequence of syndecan 3 starting with Gln48. The E30 (ectodomain of 30 residues) and NE (No Ectodomain) constructs were generated by PCR, with GAQPARSP as a linker sequence between the HA-tag and E30 syndecan 3 starting with Pro356, and with GAQPARS as a linker sequence between the HA-tag and NE syndecan 3 starting with Leu386. PS1 and syndecan constructs were further cloned into retroviral expression vector pMSCV (Clontech) for generation of retrovirus. To create an enterokinase cleavage site, Asn363 to Leu386 of syndecan 3 was replaced by DDDK followed by the human CD4 sequence Ile384 to Ala398 (9.Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 29.Kramer K.L. Yost H.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Syndecan 3 mutations were introduced with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The pcDNA expression vector encoding full-length human CASK (amino acids 1–921) was generously provided by J. B. Wilson, University of Glasgow. CASK deletion mutants were derived from this construct by removal of the sequences encoding amino acids: Asp3-Phe331 (dCamK), Phe331-Ser475 (dL27), Ala476-Asp603 (dPDZ), Glu579-Lys728 (dSH3/Hook), Lys728-Glu903 (dGK), and Asp3-Glu903 (dAll). The Gal4BD-VP16 reporter was introduced between Val429 and Tyr431 in syndecan 3 or fused to the C terminus of human CASK. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Immunofluorescence—Cells were trypsinized for 15 min at 4 °C, washed, and incubated for the indicated period at 37 °C. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, cells were permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline-bovine serum albumin and goat serum, and probed with mAb 2E9 and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG. Stably Transduced Cell Lines—Retroviral supernatants were produced from transformed human embryonic kidney 293 cells by transient cotransfection of pMSCV constructs and an ecotropic packaging plasmid pIK (generously provided by Dr. D. G. Gilliland, Harvard University, Boston, MA) using FuGENE 6. MEFs were transduced with the retroviral supernatant in the presence of 8 μg/ml of polybrene (Sigma) and selected for antibiotic resistance after 24 h. Luciferase Assay—Cells were plated in a 24-well plate and transiently transfected by FuGENE 6 with pFRLuc (Promega), p-simian virus 40-β-galactosidase, and different combinations of pDisplay-human syndecan 3 or pcDNA-human CASK containing a Gal4BD-VP16 reporter. Total amount of DNA per well was kept constant at 250 ng. 12 h after transfection, cells were treated with inhibitors, enterokinase, or growth factors. 8 h after treatment started, cells were lysed, luciferase activity was determined and normalized to β-galactosidase expression. All data points except those in Fig. 4C were from duplicates and at least three independent experiments. Data represent mean ± S.D. Presenilin-dependent Turnover of Syndecan CTF—First, we probed for endogenous syndecan CTF in PS1+/+, PS1+/–, and PS1–/– primary fibroblasts derived from littermate embryos, using the syndecan1/3 C terminus-specific monoclonal antibody 2E9 (26.Lories V. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1116-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the amount of full-length syndecan core protein was unchanged (SDS-stable dimers of syndecan 1 (S1) and 3 (S3) running at 80 and 120 kDa, respectively), CTFs of 10 and 12 kDa accumulated in large amounts in all PS1–/– fibroblast lines (Fig. 1A). The appearance of CTFs with different mobility might be due to posttranslational modification or to alternative ectodomain cleavage sites (see also Ref. 10.Reiland J. Ott V.L. Lebakken C.S. Yeaman C. McCarthy J. Rapraeger A.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because both PS1 and -2 have been shown to be involved in intramembrane proteolysis, we investigated the relative contribution of each to syndecan processing. Syndecan CTF accumulated strongly in PS1–/– and PS1–/–PS2–/– MEF cell lines, whereas PS2–/– cells showed only minor differences compared with wild type (WT) cells (Fig. 1B). This finding is in accordance with data on PS-dependent processing of Notch and amyloid precursor protein (APP), where the absence of PS1 also has a much more pronounced effect than that of PS2 (25.Herreman A. Hartmann D. Annaert W. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Serneels L. Umans L. Schrijvers V. Checler F. Vanderstichele H. Baekelandt V. Dressel R. Cupers P. Huylebroeck D. Zwijsen A. van Leuven F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28669-28673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To differentiate between increased generation and decreased turnover of syndecan CTF in PS-deficient cells, we trypsinized WT and PS1–/– MEF at 4 °C to cleave cell surface syndecans, generating a pool of “trypsin-CTF” that can be differentiated from endogenous CTF by the difference in mobility (see also Ref. 10.Reiland J. Ott V.L. Lebakken C.S. Yeaman C. McCarthy J. Rapraeger A.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After trypsin washout and within 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, the pool of trypsin-CTF was completely turned over in WT cells, while there was basically no turnover in PS1–/– cells (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, endogenous CTF levels are stable during the chase in WT but accumulate further in PS1–/– cells (Fig. 1C). Under the same conditions, frizzled, a seven-pass plasma membrane protein involved in Wnt signaling, did not accumulate in PS1–/– cells (not shown). The results with the trypsin-CTF indicate that syndecan CTF accumulate in PS1-deficient cells as a consequence of decreased processing and not increased generation. Consistently, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed rapid clearance of endogenous syndecan from the cell surface in trypsinized WT but not PS1–/– cells (Fig. 1D). To prove further that the failure to cleave syndecan CTF in PS-deficient cells was the consequence of the loss of PS, we reintroduced human PS1 into PS1–/– MEF. The newly expressed human PS1 protein was detected with both C- and N-terminal antibody specific for human PS1 (Fig. 1E). Confirming the role of PS, accumulation of the syndecan CTF was completely reversed in PS1-rescued but not in mock-transduced cells. Independent evidence that syndecan is processed by the PS/γ-secretase complex was obtained with the γ-secretase inhibitor l-685,458 that binds to PS and inhibits γ-processing of APP and Notch in the nanomolar range (24.Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Syndecan CTF processing was inhibited at similarly low concentrations of inhibitor (Fig. 1F). Generation of Further Syndecan Fragments—If syndecan CTFs undergo restricted intramembrane cleavage (as opposed to random degradation), two fragments of lower Mr than the CTF should be detectable in cells or media: one fragment ranging from the extracellular to the transmembrane cleavage site and a second fragment representing the released syndecan intracellular domain (SICD) (Fig. 2A). We were not able to detect SICD in cell extracts from MEF, even when these cells over-expressed syndecan 3 (S3-MEF). This was not entirely unexpected, because, as for other substrates γ-secretase, it is extremely difficult to detect ICD, probably because of rapid intracellular turnover (31.Cupers P. Orlans I. Craessaerts K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1168-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 32.Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Yet, several groups have developed cell-free assays, allowing them to demonstrate ICD generation from APP by γ-secretase (28.Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 33.Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

Sambamurti K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 481-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Using a similar assay for syndecan, we detected a 7-kDa fragment that was continuously released over a period of at least 4 h into the supernatant of S3-MEF membranes (Fig. 2B). Based on its apparent size, this fragment would be the dimeric form of the SICD. The γ-secretase inhibitor l-685,458 but not the metalloprotease inhibitor o-phenanthroline or the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin inhibited the release of this putative SICD (Fig. 2C), confirming that SICD generation depends upon PS/γ-secretase cleavage of syndecan 3. Furthermore, the SICD was drastically reduced in PS1–/– S3-MEF and not detectable in PS1–/–PS2–/– S3-MEF (Fig. 2D). We also tested whether SICD is generated under physiologically relevant conditions. Endogenous putative SICD was detected in the supernatant of brain membranes isolated from WT but not PS1–/– littermate embryos (Fig. 2E), suggesting that intramembrane cleavage of syndecan 3 occurs in vivo. PS-mediated APP processing is involved in the generation of the amyloid peptide that is believed to be central in the pathological cascade causing Alzheimer's disease (37.Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). To analyze whether syndecan processing yields a comparable extracellular/transmembrane fragment, we transduced MEF with an ectodomain-truncated syndecan 3 construct (30 ectodomain amino acids) containing an N-terminal HA-tag (E30-CTF). The expressed construct was detected on Western blot with an HA-antibody as a major 19-kDa band. A minor 23-kDa band might still contain the signal peptide or represent a posttranslationally modified form. We found a 6.5-kDa fragment reactive with an HA-antibody in the medium of WT but not PS1–/– MEF (Fig. 2F, E30-TMD). Although this fragment is generated by PS/γ-secretase, its apparent size is larger than expected. We surmise abnormal migration could be a consequence of the hydrophobicity of the fragment or of dimerization. Structural Requirements for Intramembrane Cleavage—To demonstrate that the PS-dependent cleavage site of syndecan 3 is within the transmembrane region, we labeled S3-MEF with [35S]methionine and determined the position of the single methionine within the putative SICD relative to the N terminus of this fragment. N-terminal Edman degradation of the immunopurified 7-kDa fragment released several peaks of radioactivity, encompassing cycles 6–8. This result indicates that cleavage of syndecan 3 occurs between the transmembrane amino acids Leu403, Val404, Thr405, and Leu406 (Fig. 3A). The largest peak eluted after eight cycles, indicating a major cleavage between Leu403 and Val404. To investigate the importance of Val404 for syndecan 3 processing, we introduced a V404G mutation. A V1744G mutation at P1′ has been shown to strongly interfere with γ-secretase processing of Notch (38.Huppert S.S. Le A. Schroeter E.H. Mumm J.S. Saxena M.T. Milner L.A. Kopan R. Nature. 2000; 405: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), whereas a V646G mutation at P1′ of APP is without effect (28.Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 33.Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43756-43760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the syndecan V404G mutation caused a marked increase in γ-secretase cleavage, as judged by an increased ratio of SICD to CTF (Fig. 3B, lane 2). It is unlikely that this effect is due to an increased SICD stability, because the experiment was performed in cell-free conditions in the presence of protease inhibitors (28.Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether transmembrane residues remote from the predicted cleavage site influence intramembrane processing of syndecan, we mutated the highly conserved Gly396 that is part of a GXXXG motif located in the center of the transmembrane region. The GXXXG motif is involved in high affinity dimeric association of transmembrane helices by permitting helix proximity (39.Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and is also present in the γ-secretase substrates APP, erbB4, nectin 1α, and E-cadherin (Fig. 3C). Introducing a G396L mutation to disrupt the syndecan GXXXG motif was not sufficient to monomerize CTF (Fig. 3B, lane 3; see also Ref. 40.Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but γ-secretase processing became less efficient (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Additional substitutions of the two other transmembrane glycine residues did not change processing or dimerization of syndecan 3 CTF any further (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–5). Interestingly, a G → L point mutation within the GXXXG motif of a glycophorin A chimeric construct favors γ-cleavage and disrupts dimerization (41.Struhl G. Adachi A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced SICD Generation—To assess SICD release in living cells, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with syndecan containing a Gal4BD-VP16 sequence within the cytosolic domain and a reporter vector expressing luciferase under the control of a Gal4 upstream activating sequence. Pretreatment of the cells with PS inhibitor dose-dependently reduced luciferase activity by 80% (Fig. 4A); treatment with the second messenger activators phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or forskolin caused an 18- or 28-fold increase, respectively (Fig. 4B). To test whether extracellular ligands can induce SICD generation, we used a panel of different agents. Carbachol, pleiotrophin, insulin-like growth factor II, thrombin receptor agonist peptide, and platelet-derived growth factor had no effect, epidermal growth factor caused a small but consistent 1.5-fold increase, whereas bFGF caused a 10-fold increase. To show that syndecan ectodomain release is sufficient to initiate SICD release, we introduced an enterokinase cleavage site in the ectodomain of syndecan (29.Kramer K.L. Yost H.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A dose-dependent effect of enterokinase in the medium on SICD generation was observed for syndecan containing an enterokinase cleavage site (Fig. 4C), but there was no effect at all for WT syndecan (not shown). Syndecan-processing and Subcellular Distribution of CASK—The cytosolic multidomain protein CASK is alternatively targeted to the plasma membrane via binding to the C terminus of syndecan or to the nucleus via binding to the transcription factor tbr-1 (42.Hsueh Y.P.

In mammals, there are four isoforms of the 100-kDa V-ATPase “a” subunit. Mutations in the a3 isoform result in deficient bone resorption and osteopetrosis, suggesting that a3 has a unique function in osteoclasts. It is thus surprising that several studies show a basal level of a3 expression in most tissues. To address this issue, we have compared a3 expression in bone with expression in other tissues. RNA blots revealed that the a3 isoform was expressed highest in bone and confirmed its expression (in decreasing order) in liver, kidney, brain, lung, spleen, and muscle. In situ hybridization on bone tissue sections revealed that the a3 isoform was highly expressed in multinucleated osteoclasts but not in mononuclear stromal cells, whereas the a1 isoform was expressed in both cell types at about the same level. We also found that a3 expression was greater in osteoclasts with 10 or more nuclei as compared with osteoclasts with five or fewer nuclei. We hypothesize that these differences in a3 expression may be associated with previously demonstrated differences between large and small osteoclasts with reference to their resorptive activity.

Large osteoclasts predominate in diseases associated with accelerated bone loss. Bone is a dynamic tissue. To maintain its structural integrity, bone is continually remodeled, first being resorbed by osteoclasts and then remade by osteoblasts. An increase in osteoclastic activity relative to osteoblastic activity results in bone loss. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells of hemopoietic origin. On average, osteoclasts in healthy bone contain between 3 and 10 nuclei. However, an increase in osteoclast size has been noted in Paget's disease, end stage renal disease, periodontal disease, and rheumatoid arthritis (1.Singer F.R. Roodman G.D. Bilezikian J.P.

Interestingly, in vitro assays have shown that large osteoclasts (i.e. ≥10 nuclei) are more likely to be in a resorptive state than small osteoclasts (i.e. ≤5 nuclei) (4.Lees R.L. Sabharwal V.K. Heersche J.N.

V-ATPases are essential to osteoclastic bone resorption. Osteoclasts demineralize the bone matrix through acidification of an extracellular resorption zone by actively pumping protons across the plasma membrane (reviewed in Ref. 6.Manolson M.F. Heersche J.N.M. Henderson J.E. Goltzman D.G. The Osteoporosis Primer. Cambridge University Press, 2000: 36-45Google Scholar). Translocation of protons across the osteoclast plasma membrane is mediated by V-ATPases. V-ATPase-specific inhibitors reduce bone resorption in vitro (7.Sundquist K.T. Marks S.J. J. Bone Miner.

Unfortunately, V-ATPases are not just present on the osteoclast plasma membrane but are also on endomembrane organelles such as Golgi, lysosomes, endosomes, clathrin-coated vesicles, chromaffin granules, and synaptic vesicles (reviewed in Ref. 12.Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). As V-ATPase activity is essential for basic housekeeping functions in almost all cell types, any therapeutic strategy to limit bone resorption through V-ATPase inhibition must be designed to specifically target the osteoclast plasma membrane V-ATPase. Isoforms of the V-ATPase “a” subunit may target or regulate other V-ATPase subunits to distinct cellular locations. V-ATPases are composed of at least 11 subunits; seven are part of the hydrophilic catalytic core (V1), and the remaining four compose a hydrophobic domain (Vo) spanning the membrane bilayer. The hydrophobic domain contains one or two copies of the 100-kDa “a” subunit, the focus of this study. The mammalian “a” subunit has a hydrophilic ∼48-kDa N terminus and a hydrophobic ∼49-kDa C terminus containing up to nine putative transmembrane domains (13.Leng X.H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In yeast, it has been shown that the “a” subunit is essential for V-ATPase assembly (14.Manolson M.F.

Recent studies have shown that V-ATPases containing different “a” isoforms differ in their coupling efficiency and in vivo dissociation between the V1 and Vo complexes (19.Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T.

We hypothesize that isoforms of the “a” subunit may target or regulate other V-ATPase subunits to distinct cellular locations. The “a3” V-ATPase subunit may be essential for but not unique to the osteoclast plasma membrane V-ATPase. Higher eukaryotes have four isoforms of the “a” subunit, all of which appear to have differential expression patterns (20.Pujol N. Bonnerot C. Ewbank J.J. Kohara Y. Thierry-Mieg D. J. Biol.

Evidence suggesting that a3 is essential to osteoclastic function first came from its initial identification as “OC-116Kda.” The OC-116Kda gene was cloned by a differential screening of a human osteoclastoma cDNA library, and its mRNA was reported to be uniquely expressed in multinucleated giant cells within osteoclastoma tumors (29.Li Y.P. Chen W. Stashenko P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In mice, a3 was induced during osteoclast differentiation, and the gene product was localized in the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic filamentous structures within osteoclasts (24.Toyomura T. Oka T.

Despite this compelling genetic evidence suggesting that a3 function is essential for and specific to osteoclastic bone resorption, expression studies suggest that a3 is ubiquitously expressed and probably also has roles unrelated to osteoclastic function. RT-PCR revealed that a3 was expressed in all tissues examined (36.Scott B.B. Chapman C.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 346: R3-R4Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), whereas Northern blotting suggested that the highest a3 expression was in the liver (24.Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y.

One alternatively spliced transcript of a3, lacking the first 217 amino acids off the hydrophilic N terminus of a3, was identified as the T cell membrane protein TIRC7 and was suggested to have a central role in T cell activation in vitro and in vivo (37.Utku N.

To address the disparate conclusions drawn from the genetic evidence and the expression patterns of a3, we decided to directly compare a3 expression levels between bone and other tissues and the expression of a3 within the different bone cells. Finally, considering the differences between large and small osteoclasts in resorptive activity and dependence on V-ATPase activity for intracellular pH regulation, we also explored whether there is a correlation between a3 expression and osteoclast size. Materials—The murine macrophage cell line RAW267.4 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC catalog no. TIB-71). Medium 199, α-minimum essential medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, antibiotics (penicillin G, gentamicin, and fungizone) were obtained from Invitrogen; sterile fetal bovine serum was obtained from MEDICORP Inc. Kits for mRNA purification and RT-PCR were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Polyclonal antibodies to the V-ATPase a1 and a3 subunits were a kind gift from Dr. Beth Lee (Washington University School of Medicine), and monoclonal antibodies to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were obtained from Abcam. Most other reagents were from either Sigma or Fisher. Rabbit Osteoclast Isolation—Osteoclasts were obtained from 10-day-old New Zealand White rabbits as described in Ref. 39.Kanehisa J. Heersche J.N. Bone. 1988; 9: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar. Briefly, the long bones (femurs, tibiae, humeri, and radii) were dissected out, adherent soft tissues were removed, and the cleaned shafts were cut longitudinally. The interior surfaces were then curetted to release the bone cells, followed by repeated pipetting to release additional cells attached to the bone fragments. Cells were resuspended in α-minimum essential medium (pH 7.4) with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 μg/ml penicillin G, 0.5 μg/ml gentamicin, and 0.3 μg/ml fungizone) and allowed to attach overnight to culture dishes in humidified air (37 °C and 5% CO2). If further purification was required, cultures were incubated the following day with 0.001% protease E, 0.01% EDTA at room temperature for 10 min. Detached cells were washed away with culture medium, resulting in a 95% pure preparation of osteoclasts still attached to the culture dishes. Differentiation and Isolation of Large and Small Osteoclasts from the RAW267.4 Cell Line—Approximately 5 × 106 third passage RAW267.4 cells were cultured in a 100-cm2 dish with 15 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 units/ml penicillin, 20 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone, and 200 ng/ml recombinant glutathione S-transferase-soluble receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (GST-sRANKL) in humidified air (37 °C and 5% CO2) with medium changes at days 3, 5, and 7. For protein isolation, 10 × 100-cm2 dishes were plated as described above and visually inspected until at least 78% of the total nuclei were contained within small (≤5 nuclei) osteoclasts (generally day 5) or within large (≥10 nuclei) osteoclasts (generally day 8). Prior to protein isolation, osteoclasts were further selected by gently washing the dishes with 3 × 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline using a 10-ml pipette. To extract protein, 8 ml of TRIzol (Stratagene) was added per dish, and the isolation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR—95% pure preparations of osteoclasts (prepared as described) were immediately suspended in lysis buffer (mRNA Capture Kit; Roche Applied Science) and stored at -80 °C until further use. Once mRNA was extracted using the mRNA capture kit, RT-PCR was immediately performed using the RT-PCR Titan One Tube system (Roche Applied Science). The reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 30 min followed by 35 cycles of PCR (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 68 °C for 1 min). Oligonucleotides for RT-PCR—To clone potential isoforms of the “a” subunit from rabbit osteoclasts, oligonucleotides were designed to encode four evolutionarily conserved regions contained within the C terminus of the 100-kDa V-ATPase subunit nucleic acid sequences obtained from rats, mice, cows, and humans. Oligonucleotides were made 2-8-fold redundant to account for base pair differences found between species. Restriction sites for XbaI and SalI were encoded into the 5′ ends of the sense and antisense primers, respectively, to facilitate subcloning into pBluescript pBS-SK (Stratagene). Sequences (with base pairs in parentheses indicating regions of redundancy) of the four primers are as follows: M061 (sense strand), 5′-agatctagaccttccc(c/g)tt(t/c)ctgtttgctgtgatg-3′; MO62 (antisense strand), 5′-gacgtcgacttcatctt(g/a)aaggagttgaggaa-3′; M063 (sense strand), 5′-agatctagattcctcaactcctt(c/t)aagatgaa-3′; MO64 (antisense strand), gacgtcgacggtagga(c/g)gc(a/g)gtgttggaga(t/c)gcagcc-3′. Plasmids, DNA Sequencing, and Sequence Analysis—For a house-keeping gene, a 292-bp fragment (from position 289 to 581 according to the GenBank™ accession number L23961) encoding rabbit GAPDH was used. The following plasmids were all obtained by performing RT-PCR with the indicated oligonucleotides on mRNA isolated from a 95% pure preparation of osteoclasts obtained from the long bones of New Zealand White rabbits. RT-PCR products were cut with XbaI and SalI (restriction sites added to the 5′ end of the oligonucleotides) and cloned into XbaI and SalI of pBluescript pBS-SK. The inserts in the plasmids described below were all commercially sequenced (York University Core Molecular Biology and DNA Sequencing Facility, Toronto, Ontario) to completion on both strands using the T3, T7, or custom synthesized oligonucleotides. Sequences deposited in GenBank™ are the result of sequencing at least two independently obtained RT-PCR products. Sequence analysis was performed using the Wisconsin Package, version 10.0 (Genetics Computer Group (GCG), Madison, WI). The following plasmids were obtained. pRab-a1-1 (MM642; GenBank™ accession number AF393370) contains a 470-bp RT-PCR product resulting from oligonucleotides MO61 and MO62 (described above). It encodes part of the C terminus of the rabbit a1 isoform of the 100-kDa V-ATPase subunit. pRab-a1-2 (MM644; GenBank™ accession number AF393370) contains a 650-bp RT-PCR product resulting from oligonucleotides MO63 and MO64 (described above). It encodes the C terminus of the rabbit a1 isoform of the 100-kDa V-ATPase subunit, and its sequence is continuous with the 3′ end of pRab-a1-1. pRab-a2 (MM656; GenBank™ accession number AF393371) contains a 1060-bp RT-PCR product resulting from oligonucleotides MO61 and MO64 (described above).

RNA Blot Hybridization—RNA was extracted from rabbit brain, bone, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, and spleen tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 15 μg of RNA from each tissue was subjected to Northern blot analysis performed essentially as described in Ref. 40.Sambrook J. Russell D.W.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar with the following exceptions. cDNA encoding a3 (pRab-a3) and β-actin were labeled using random hexamers and [32P]dCTP, with unincorporated nucleotides removed using an Amersham Biosciences NICK column. Prehybridization (68 °C for 2 h) and hybridization (68 °C for 3 h) were performed using Expresshyb hybridization solution (Clontech). After hybridization, the blots were washed three times for 15 min each in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 20 °C followed by two times for 20 min each in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS at 61 °C. The resulting autoradiograms were scanned using a transparency adapter, and band intensities were quantified using AlphaEase Image Analysis Software (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Quantification of Immunoblots—Immunoblots were performed exactly as described in Ref. 16.Landolt-Marticorena C. Kahr W.H. Zawarinski P. Correa J. Manolson M.F. J. Biol.

To ensure that the chemiluminescent signals from the immunoblots were within the linear range, each protein sample was run on SDS-PAGE as a series of four serial dilutions. Multiple exposure times were recorded by the CCD camera, and an exposure time was used for quantification only if the obtained signal internally reflected the serial dilution of the sample. For each separate gel, the absolute value obtained for a1 and a3 at each of the four protein concentrations was divided by the absolute value obtained for GAPDH. GAPDH was used to normalize the signal between different samples, since in situ hybridization revealed no difference in GAPDH gene expression between large and small osteoclasts (see Fig. 4E). The a1/GAPDH and a3/GAPDH ratios were then plotted against μg of protein loaded per lane, and a linear regression line was fitted using the method of least squares. The slope of this linear regression line was then used to compare relative expression of a1 and a3 between different experiments. In Situ Hybridization—Femurs from 10-day-old rabbits were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, decalcified using HCl (0.2 n HCl for 24 h), and embedded in paraffin using standard methods. Six-μm sections were cut, placed onto silicon-treated glass slides and dried for 16 h at 40 °C. Sections were dewaxed with two 10-min incubations in xylene and then rehydrated as follows: 1 × 5 min in 100% EtOH, 1 × 5 min in 95% EtOH, 1 × 5 min in 70% EtOH, followed by two rinses in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated double-distilled H2O.

To address these conflicting data, we set out to directly compare the expression level of a3 in osteoclasts with that in several other tissues. This study was initiated by first determining which of the four known isoforms of the 100-kDa “a” subunit are expressed in rabbit osteoclasts. Bone Cells Express the a1, a2, and a3 Isoforms of the 100-kDa V-ATPase Subunit—To identify all V-ATPase a isoforms expressed in osteoclasts, we employed an RT-PCR strategy and designed two sense and two antisense oligonucleotides, each encoding evolutionarily conserved regions found in all four of the a isoforms in several different species. These primers were used to perform several RT-PCRs on mRNA extracted from a 95% pure preparation of osteoclasts isolated from the long bones of 10-day-old rabbits as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RT-PCR products were pooled and cloned into sequencing vectors.

It interacts with the ER resident protein Tip20p and with δ-COP, a subunit of coatomer, the coat complex of COPI vesicles. To test the significance of these interactions, we mapped the different binding sites and created mutant versions of Dsl1p and δ-COP, which are unable to bind directly to each other. Three domains were identified in Dsl1p: a Tip20p binding region within the N-terminal 200 residues, a highly acidic region in the center of Dsl1p containing crucial tryptophan residues that is required for binding to δ-COP and essential for viability, and an evolutionarily well conserved domain at the C terminus. Most importantly, Dsl1p uses the same central acidic domain to interact not only with δ-COP but also with α-COP. Strong interaction with α-COP requires the presence of comparable amounts of ϵ-COP or β′ -COP. Thus, the binding characteristics of Dsl1p resemble those of many accessory factors of the clathrin coat. They interact with different layers of the vesicle coat by using tandemly arranged sequence motifs, some of which have dual specificity.

After the uncoating, vesicles are ready to fuse with their specific target membrane (11Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). Fusion events rely on specific attachment reactions to guarantee that only appropriate membranes can mix. The membrane attachment itself comprises two steps, tethering and docking (12Cao X.C. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Both steps involve different sets of proteins. Tethering factors are peripherally membrane-associated protein complexes consisting of up to 10 different subunits, which share little sequence similarity. So far, seven different tethering complexes required for at least five different transport steps were characterized in yeast (13Nakajima H. Hirata A. Ogawa Y. Yonehara T. Yoda K. Yamasaki M. J.

In some cases, mammalian counterparts of yeast tethering factors were identified (reviewed in Ref. 21Whyte J.R. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent docking stage involves specific sets of membrane-anchored proteins, the so-called SNARE proteins (22Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 23Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.

In contrast to the tethering factors, all known SNARE proteins are members of either of three protein families: the syntaxins, the synaptobrevins or VAMPs and the SNAP-25 family members. To induce membrane fusion, SNARE proteins from apposed membranes must interact in trans. The SNARE or SNARE-like proteins involved in fusion at the ER are Ufe1p, Sec22p, Sec20p, and Use1p (24Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B.

Yeast. 1998; 14: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). So far no evidence for an involvement of a Ypt/Rab-like GTPase or specific tethering factors has been provided. Recently, we and others identified a new coatomer-interacting factor, Dsl1p, which is essential for retrieval of proteins from Golgi to ER (31VanRheenen S.M. Reilly B.A. Chamberlain S.J. Waters M.G. Traffic. 2001; 2: 212-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Andag U. Neumann T. Schmitt H.D. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3783-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Dsl1p also interacts with Tip20p (33Reilly B.A. Kraynack B.A. VanRheenen S.M. Waters M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3783-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). This suggests that Dsl1p may play an important role in targeting COPI vesicles to the ER membrane. In this work we show that Dsl1p and δ-COP bind each other directly. We mapped the binding sites in both molecules, and mutants were created to investigate the significance of the Dsl1p/δ-COP interaction in vivo. Although mutations in Dsl1p that block the binding to δ-COP in vitro were lethal, δ-COP (ret2) mutants carrying deletions in the putative Dsl1p binding domain remain viable. The fact that these mutant proteins retained some Dsl1p binding activity prompted us to reinvestigate the Dsl1p/coatomer interaction. We found that Dsl1p can also make contacts with the putative outer layer of the coatomer complex. Dsl1p uses overlapping sequence motifs to interact with δ-COP and α-COP. In this respect Dsl1p resembles many accessory factors or cargo-specific adaptors known to be involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. Bacterial and Yeast Strains—Cloning experiments were performed using the Escherichia coli strain DH5α. Expression of either His6-tagged or GST fusion proteins was performed using protease-deficient strains BL21DE3 or C41DE3 as described previously (32Andag U. Neumann T. Schmitt H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39150-39160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used are listed in Table I. Cells were grown in yeast extract-peptone-or synthetic minimal medium both containing glucose (2%) and supplemented as necessary with 20 mg/liter tryptophan, histidine, adenine, uracil, or 30 mg/liter leucine or lysine. 5-Fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) plates were prepared as synthetic minimal medium containing 0.1% 5-FOA. Yeast transformations were performed as described previously (35Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Standard techniques were used for complementation analysis, sporulation, and the analysis of tetrads (36Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Recombinant wild type and mutant DSL1 as well as fragments derived from it were expressed as GST fusions. The DSL1 sequences were inserted into vector pGEX-TT (pGEX-2T with modified polylinker region; Amersham Biosciences). The fragments inserted into this vector were created by PCR. pUA73 (pRS315-DSL1) served as template and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used to amplify the fragments. The primers we used contained XmaI (5′) and XbaI (3′) sites allowing in frame insertion of the coding segments into pGEX-TT. Alanine substitutions were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). DSL1 fragments L1–L6 were generated by annealing of oligonucleotides with flanking BamHI (5′) and HindIII sites (3′) and integrated into the pGEX-TT, which had been digested with the BamHI and HindIII. Full-length Ret2p/δ-COP and its truncations were expressed as N-terminal His6 fusions using pQE30 (Qiagen). The primers used for the PCR introduced BamHI (5′) and HindIII (3′) sites flanking the PCR product. Yep24-SEC21 and pRS426-RET3 were tested for complementation as well as multicopy suppression (YEp24-SEC21) of the corresponding mutations to prove that they are functional.Table IIPlasmidsPlasmid nameDescriptionSourcepBR2Gal4p-DNA binding domain-Dsl1p, URA3M.

His6-tagged proteins were immobilized on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, washed five times with 10 volumes of phosphate buffer, and eluted using 250 mm imidazole. E. coli strains expressing GST fusion proteins were lysed, and proteins were solubilized in buffer B88 (20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 250 mm sorbitol, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.5% Triton X-100, containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix). GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B and washed five times with 10 volumes of lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the Sepharose beads with 10 mm glutathione and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For pull-down experiments, equal amounts of fusion proteins were loaded on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads again and incubated either with His6-tagged proteins or with the 8,000 × g supernatant of yeast cell lysates at 4 °C for 2–4 h. For the experiments shown in Fig. 6 and the lower panel in Fig. 7A, incubation was done 1.5 h at room temperature. The beads were washed five times with buffer B88, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis or Coomassie staining (Figs. 1, 2B, 4, B and C, and 7). To obtain extracts yeast cells were broken with glass beads using buffer B88 (see above). The LumiImager software (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to quantify chemiluminescence signals of immunoblots.Fig. 7Mapping of the binding site for Tip20p, δ-COP, and α-COP in Dsl1p.A, GST fusions of either full-length Dsl1p or truncated versions of Dsl1p purified from E. coli were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B. After incubation with extract from detergent-lysed yeast cells at 4 °C, beads were washed thoroughly and the proteins retained were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. A, upper panel, extracts of wild type cells overexpressing Tip20-myc (28Sweet D.J. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2831-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were applied to GST fusion proteins, which had been immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose; lower panel, extracts from sec28Δ grown at 37 °C for 4 h and ret2–1 cells grown at room temperature were applied to the same GST fusion constructs as above. Proteins bound to beads were analyzed using polyclonal antibodies against the c-myc epitope (Santa Cruz) to visualize Tip20p-myc (upper panel) or anti-coatomer antibodies (lower panel). The bands shown in the lower panel were all from the same experiment and arranged in a way that they can be compared directly to the Tip20-myc pull-down. B, comparison of α-COP and δ-COP binding to GST-Dsl1p and GST-Dsl1p carrying two tryptophan-alanine substitutions in the central acidic domain. The fusion proteins GST-Dsl1p and GST-Dsl1pW413A/W455A were immobilized on glutathione Sepharose and used to pull down proteins from wild type extracts or extracts from δ-COP- or α/ϵ-COP-overproducing cells as described above. Anti-coatomer antibodies were used to visualize the coatomer subunits, which had bound to the beads. The asterisks mark GST-Dsl1p and a fragment derived from it, which cross-reacted with anti-coatomer antibodies. These antibodies were removed from the serum used for the other experiments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Here they may serve as an internal control. C, a Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gel showing proteins, which bound to Dsl1p-derived peptides from the central acidic domain fused to GST. Most of the fusion constructs were listed in Fig. 2. GST-L6 carries an additional tryptophan-alanine replacement at the position that corresponds to Trp-425 in the full-length protein. The strong bands between δ-COP and α-COP represent subunits of the phosphofructokinase as shown by mass spectroscopy, whereas p55 visible in Fig. 2 is the aldehyde dehydrogenase. The varying binding efficiencies depended on whether the δ-COP- and α/ϵ-COP-overproducing cells had grown exponentially or were at stationary phase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 1δ-COP (= Ret2p) binds to GST-Dsl1p.

Samples were washed thoroughly (for details see “Experimental Procedures”) and analyzed for bound δ-COP and δ-COP fragments by immunoblot analysis. B and C, the δ-COP-derived peptide R242-A-G-H-S-A-T-G-G-M-K-L-G254 was immobilized on agarose and incubated with purified GST-Dsl1p, GST-Sec22p (B), or crude extract of GST-L4-expressing E. coli cells (C; see Fig. 2A) at room temperature. After washing thoroughly, bound proteins were eluted. Fractions of washing (W) and elution (E) steps were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.

Removal of protecting groups and cleavage of peptides from the resin were achieved by treatment with a solution of 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% water, 2.5% phenol, and 2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol (all from Sigma). Peptides were immobilized on agarose gel using the SulfoLink kit (Pierce) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Immobilized peptides were incubated at room temperature with indicated GST fusion proteins or E. coli lysate in 1 ml of B88 (see above) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 2 h. After washing thoroughly, bound proteins were eluted by 100 mm glycine, pH 2.4. 1-ml fractions of both washing and elution steps were collected; elution fractions were neutralized with 50 μl of 1.5 m Tris (pH 8.8) solution and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Antibodies—Polyclonal anti-Dsl1p antibodies were a gift from M. Gerard Waters (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ), the anti δ-COP antibodies were obtained from Stephan Schröder-Köhne (BioMedTec, Wuerzburg, Germany), and the polyclonal anti-coatomer and the monoclonal anti-HDEL antibodies were gifts from Rainer Duden and Mike Lewis (Cambridge University, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Anticoatomer antibody (38Duden R. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Winey M. Byers B. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24486-24495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cross-reacted with GST-Dsl1p. Therefore, 10 μl of anti-coatomer serum were incubated with 80 μg of GST-Dsl1p coupled to GSH-Sepharose to remove unspecific antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Analysis of BiP/Kar2p Secretion—Early log phase dsl1 deletion strains expressing either wild type DSL1 or dsl1 mutants from single copy plasmids were spotted onto YPD plates. Plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose and after 12-h incubation at 33 °C filter were removed and analyzed for Kar2p secretion by immunoblotting using a Kar2p-specific antibody and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Dsl1p Binds to δ-COP via Its Central Acidic Domain—In our previous work we detected binding of coatomer to Dsl1p by using a GST-Dsl1p fusion construct expressed in E. coli. Consistent with this, Reilly et al. (33Reilly B.A. Kraynack B.A. VanRheenen S.M. Waters M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3783-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) identified the coatomer subunit δ-COP, as a Dsl1p-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. To test whether this interaction can be reproduced in vitro, we repeated the GST-Dsl1p pull-down experiment (32Andag U. Neumann T. Schmitt H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39150-39160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using extracts from yeast cells overproducing either δ-COP or α-COP and β′-COP as control (4Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 38Duden R. Hosobuchi M. Hamamoto S. Winey M. Byers B. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24486-24495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, only the overexpression of the δ-COP-encoding RET2 gene increased the amount of protein retained on GST-Dsl1p beads significantly. The protein was detectable by Coomassie staining. Immunoblot analysis was performed to confirm that this band in fact represents δ-COP (data not shown). A closer look at the Dsl1p primary structure revealed the presence of a δ-COP binding motif (δl) that has been characterized before by Cosson et al. (7Cosson P. Lefkir Y. Démollière C. Letourneur F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6863-6870Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The spacing of two tryptophans and the composition of surrounding residues resemble that of the δl motif. The di-aromatic motif in Dsl1p is part of a glutamate-rich domain in the center of the protein (-E-E-E-E-N-A-W-E-D-A-W-A= WXXXW motif). The original δl motif is at the C terminus of the hypothetical protein YOR112w (-D-D-D-G-D-S-D-S-W-D-T-N-W>) (Ref. 7Cosson P. Lefkir Y. Démollière C. Letourneur F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6863-6870Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows that residues 444–459 of Dsl1p containing the δl-like WXXXW motif from Dsl1p was able to retain of δ-COP from yeast extracts when fused to GST and immobilized on glutathione Sepharose beads. As in case of the δl-like motif (7Cosson P. Lefkir Y. Démollière C. Letourneur F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6863-6870Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), alanine substitution of either of the two tryptophan residues (W455A or W459A = AXXXWorWXXXA; Fig. 2) resulted in loss of binding to δ-COP. To assess the relevance of these residues, we introduced these mutations into full-length Dsl1p fused to GST and repeated the binding experiments. Surprisingly, even the mutant protein bearing alanine substitutions at both positions (GST-Dsl1W455A/W459A = AXXXA) was able to bind coatomer from yeast extract at wild type levels (see also below). This prompted us to examine Dsl1p for additional δ-COP binding motifs. A series of fragments derived from Dsl1p were fused to GST and analyzed for their ability to bind δ-COP. The C-terminal part of Dsl1p (aa 461–754) was not able to bind significant amounts of δ-COP. In contrast, the N-terminal portion (aa 1–445) upstream of δl-like WXXXW motif bound δ-COP very e"
https://openalex.org/W2028211096,"We demonstrate that POSH, a scaffold for the JNK signaling pathway, binds to Akt2. A POSH mutant that is unable to bind Akt2 (POSH W489A) exhibits enhanced-binding to MLK3, and this increase in binding is accompanied by increased activation of the JNK signaling pathway. In addition, we show that the association of MLK3 with POSH is increased upon inhibition of the endogenous phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Thus, the assembly of an active JNK signaling complex by POSH is negatively regulated by Akt2. Further, the level of Akt-phosphorylated MLK3 is reduced in cells expressing the Akt2 binding domain of POSH, which acts as a dominant interfering protein. Taken together, our results support a model in which Akt2 binds to a POSH-MLK-MKK-JNK complex and phosphorylates MLK3; phosphorylation of MLK3 by Akt2 results in the disassembly of the JNK complex bound to POSH and down-regulation of the JNK signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2023152559,"The gene encoding methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), the initial enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway, is deleted in a variety of human tumors and acts as a tumor suppressor gene in cell culture (Christopher, S. A., Diegelman, P., Porter, C. W., and Kruger, W. D. (2002) Cancer Res. 62, 6639–6644). Overexpression of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is frequently observed in tumors and has been shown to be tumorigenic in vitro and in vivo. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel regulatory pathway in which the methionine salvage pathway products inhibit ODC activity. We show that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the MEU1 gene encodes MTAP and that Meu1Δ cells have an 8-fold increase in ODC activity, resulting in large elevations in polyamine pools. Mutations in putative salvage pathway genes downstream of MTAP also cause elevated ODC activity and elevated polyamines. The addition of the penultimate salvage pathway compound 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoic acid represses ODC levels in both MTAP-deleted yeast and human tumor cell lines, indicating that 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoic acid acts as a negative regulator of polyamine biosynthesis. Expression of MTAP in MTAP-deleted MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells results in a significant reduction of ODC activity and reduction in polyamine levels. Taken together, our results show that products of the methionine salvage pathway regulate polyamine biosynthesis and suggest that MTAP deletion may lead to ODC activation in human tumors.

A quarter century ago, Toohey (10.Toohey J.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

MTAP is a key enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway (see Fig. 1). This pathway functions to salvage methylthioadenosine (MTA), which is formed as a by-product of polyamine metabolism. Phosphorolysis of MTA by MTAP results in the conversion of MTA into adenine and methylthioribose 1-phosphate. A series of reactions then salvages the methyl-thio group from methylthioribose 1-phosphate to form methionine. This pathway has been most extensively studied in Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.Trackman P.C. Abeles R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Recently, we found that expression of MTAP in an MTAP-deleted breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7) resulted in a dramatic inhibition of tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo, showing that MTAP can function as a tumor suppressor gene (1.Christopher S.A. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. Kruger W.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6639-6644PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that MTAP expression causes a significant decrease in intracellular polyamine levels and alters the ratio of putrescine to total polyamines. Consistent with this observation, the polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine inhibits the ability of MTAP-deficient MCF-7 cells to form colonies in soft agar, whereas the addition of the polyamine putrescine stimulates colony formation in MTAP-expressing MCF-7 cells. These results indicate that the tumor suppressor activity of MTAP may be mediated by its effect on the intracellular polyamine pools. Polyamines are small, aliphatic amines involved in a variety of cellular processes including transcription and apoptosis (8.Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). The rate-limiting enzyme in the production of polyamines is ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Elevated ODC activity has been observed in a wide variety of human and animal tumors, and overexpression of ODC in NIH/3T3 cells is sufficient to cause transformation in vitro (7.Auvinen M. Paasinen A. Andersson L.C. Holtta E. Nature. 1992; 360: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 23.Cohen S.S. A Guide to the Polyamines. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 296-319Google Scholar). Transgenic mice overexpressing ODC in skin develop skin tumors at a high frequency (9.O'Brien T.G. Megosh L.C. Gilliard G. Soler A.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2630-2637PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Megosh L. Gilmour S.K. Rosson D. Soler A.P. Blessing M. Sawicki J.A. O'Brien T.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4205-4209PubMed Google Scholar). These observations show that overexpression of ODC is tumorigenic. Examination of the S. cerevisiae genome for MTAP homologues suggests that the MEU1 gene, with 35% identity and 53% similarity over 275 amino acids, may encode the yeast MTAP homologue. Furthermore, recent studies show that cells lacking MEU1, in combination with a mutation that allows yeast to take up methylthioadenosine, are unable to grow on medium containing MTA as the sole sulfur source (25.Thomas D. Becker A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40718-40724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MEU1 was initially identified in a screen for genes that regulate expression of the yeast ADH2 gene (26.Donoviel M.S. Young E.T. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of MEU1 increased ADH2 expression, whereas deletion of MEU1 resulted in reduced ADH2 expression. At the time these experiments were published, the MTAP gene had not yet been identified, so the relationship between MEU1 and MTAP was unknown. These experiments demonstrate that MEU1 regulates ADH2 expression and indicate a link between MEU1 and gene regulation. In this paper, we show that MEU1 encodes yeast MTAP, and we characterize the effect of loss of MTAP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human tumor cells. Our findings show that there is a regulatory link between the methionine salvage pathway and the polyamine pathway. Specifically, the penultimate metabolite, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutanoic acid (MTOB), acts to repress ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis. These results explain why MTAP deletion causes altered polyamine profiles, and suggest that the tumor suppressor activity of MTAP may be due to its effect on ODC activity. Plasmid pMEU1 Construction—The yeast MEU1 ORF was PCRamplified from total yeast DNA using primers MEU1–1F (5′-TCT GTG AAA CAT GTC) and MEU1–1R (5′-CAG TCC CCA AGG GGG). The resulting 1.3-kb product was then cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and designated pCR2.1::MEU1. PCR2.1::MEU1 was digested with BamHI and NotI, and the resulting 1.3-kb insert was cloned into pRS316 (27.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

Diegelman P. Porter C.W. Kruger W.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6639-6644PubMed Google Scholar). MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown as previously described (31.Chen Z.H. Olopade O.I. Savarese T.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Yeast Growth Studies—Yeast cells were grown to stationary phase and then diluted to an OD = 0.5–1.0 at 600 nm, in the indicated medium. Cells were then grown in liquid medium with shaking at 30 °C for 48 h, at which time OD was determined. Extract Preparation—Yeast cultures (45 ml) were grown aerobically to an OD = 0.5–1.0 at 600 nm, pelleted, washed with 0.9 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and resuspended in 750 μl of lysis buffer. Glass beads (0.5 mm; one-half weight of the cell pellet) were then added to make up ∼50–70% of total volume. Cells were lysed by using a BeadBeater at 4 °C with maximum speed (4500 rpm) for 1 min three times and kept on ice between pulses (Biospec Products). After lysis, the tubes were centrifuged for 4 min, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15%. The protein concentration of yeast extracts was determined by the Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum. Mammalian cell lysates were prepared by three cycles of freezethawing at –80 °C in 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 1 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma). Western Blot Analysis—Forty μg of extract were run on premade 7% NuPage Tris-acetate SDS gels (Invitrogen) and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using a standard protocol (32.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Samples were probed with a 1:10,000 dilution of yeast antiornithine decarboxylase antiserum raised in rabbits (a generous gift from Martin Hoyt and Phil Cofino; University of California, San Francisco). Secondary antibody anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody was obtained from Amersham Biosciences and used at a 1:3,000 dilution. The antibody-antigen complex was visualized on photographic film after treatment with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Measurement of Ornithine Decarboxylase, MTAP, and S-Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase Activity—Ornithine decarboxylase activity was assayed by measuring the 14CO2 formed by decarboxylation of 1-14C-labeled ornithine as previously described (33.Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). l-Carboxyl 14C-labeled ornithine (5 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Moravek Biochemical (Brea, CA). 20 μg of yeast or mammalian extract was used per reaction. Reactions were performed between three and seven times per sample, and results are presented as the average with the S.E. S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity was assayed by measuring the amount of 14CO2 released by decarboxylation of 1-14C-labeled S-adenosylmethionine as described (34.Cohn M.S. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). MTAP activity in yeast extracts was determined using a spectrophotometric assay as described previously (1.Christopher S.A. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. Kruger W.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6639-6644PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of MTAP activity is defined as the amount that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of adenine/min. Measurement of Intracellular Polyamine Levels by Using HPLC— Yeast cells grown in synthetic complete medium were collected, protein extracts were prepared, and then 100 μl of supernatant was added to 100 μl 0.6 n perchloric acid and allowed to sit on ice for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. 100 μl of supernatant was dansylated and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as described (35.Vujcic S. Halmekyto M. Diegelman P.

MEU1 Encodes MTAP in S. cerevisiae—Early studies showed that yeast extracts contain MTAP activity but did not identify the gene encoding the activity (18.Cone M.C. Marchitto K. Zehfus B. Ferro A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 510-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Marchitto K.S. Ferro A.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 2153-2164PubMed Google Scholar). A BLAST search of the S. cerevisiae genome with human MTAP (NP_002442) reveals two open reading frames, YLR209C and YLR017W, with significant sequence similarity. Of the two, YLR017W (also known as MEU1) has the most similarity, with 35% identity over 275 amino acids to human MTAP. To test the possibility that MEU1 encoded MTAP, we constructed isogenic MEU1 and meu1Δ strains and measured MTAP activity in whole cell extracts (see “Experimental Procedures”). We found that MEU1 yeast extracts contained 0.38 units of MTAP activity, whereas extracts from meu1Δ strain had no detectable activity (<0.01 units). A second experiment to confirm our hypothesis involved examining the growth of isogenic meu1Δ and MEU1 strains with auxotrophic markers for adenine and methionine in media in which MTA had been substituted for methionine and adenine. We found that wild-type but not meu1Δ yeast can grow using MTA as a substitute for methionine and adenine (Fig. 2). Taken together, these observations show that MEU1 encodes yeast MTAP. Effect of meu1Δ on Polyamine Pools and ODC Activity— Since MTA is a by-product of polyamine production, we suspected that cells lacking MTAP might have altered polyamine pools due to end product inhibition. Therefore, we measured the intracellular level of polyamines (putrescine, spermine, and spermidine) in an isogenic wild-type strain and in a meu1Δ strains using HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). We found that in synthetic complete media, MEU1 cells had undetectable levels of putrescine, whereas meu1Δ cells contained at least a 20-fold increase in putrescine (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, we also found that spermidine levels were significantly increased and that the total polyamine content of meu1Δ cells was more than twice that of isogenic wild-type yeast (62 versus 28 nmol/mg). To explain the overall elevation in polyamine levels, we examined ODC activity in wild type and meu1Δ yeast. ODC is the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine production and is regulated at the post-transcriptional level (36.Gupta R. Hamasaki-Katagiri N. White Tabor C. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10620-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We found that cell extracts from meu1Δ yeast had an 8-fold increase in ODC activity compared with isogenic wild-type yeast (Fig. 3B). This difference appeared to be due to elevated levels of ODC protein. We were unable to detect ODC protein by immunoblot in extracts derived from MEU1 cells as has been previously observed (37.Toth C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25921-25926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and from ODC-deficient cells (spe1Δ), but we saw substantial expression in meu1Δ extracts (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–3). The increase in protein levels appeared to be even greater than the measured activity, suggesting that not all of the protein was active (lanes 1 and 2). We also noticed that meu1Δ yeast formed significantly larger colonies compared with isogenic MEU1 yeast on polyamine free-medium, suggesting that the elevated ODC is important for growth under these conditions (Fig. 4B). These results show that MEU1 represses ODC expression and activity. We also examined the effect of MEU1 on S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity. We found that extracts from meu1Δ cells had twice the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase activity of isogenic MEU1 (7.7 ± 0.3 versus 14.6 ± 0.8 nmol/mg/h). This result is consistent with the idea that MEU1 acts to repress polyamine synthesis. SPE2 and MEU1 Regulate ODC through Different Mechanisms—Previous work has shown that mutations in SPE2, encoding S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, also cause a dramatic increase in ODC protein levels (36.Gupta R. Hamasaki-Katagiri N. White Tabor C. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10620-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 3A, lane 4). It was also shown that the ODC overexpression observed in a spe2 mutant could be suppressed by the addition of spermidine to the medium. We compared ODC expression in spe2Δ and meu1Δ strains in the presence and absence of spermidine. meu1Δ, spe2Δ, and meu1Δ/spe2Δ double mutants were grown in polyamine-free medium with or without the addition of exogenous spermidine. When we measured ODC enzyme activity, we found that the addition of 0.1 mm spermidine to the medium caused a 416% decrease in ODC activity in spe2Δ cells but only a 15% decrease in meu1Δ cells (Fig. 5A). The double mutant strain had an intermediate phenotype, with a 52% decrease. Differential response to spermidine was also observed at the protein level as shown by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5B). In the spe2Δ strain, the addition of spermidine resulted in undetectable levels of ODC, whereas it had no detectable effect on meu1Δ strain. These results show that elevation of ODC levels in meu1Δ strains and in spe2Δ strains are due to different regulatory systems. MTA Has No Effect on ODC Protein Levels—MTA, the substrate of MTAP, is known to be a strong competitive inhibitor of spermine synthase, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, and other methyltransferases (38.Williams-Ashman H.G. Seidenfeld J. Galletti P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 39.Pegg A.E. Borchardt R.T. Coward J.K. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40.Ferro A.J. Vandenbark A.A. MacDonald M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We tested the possibility that elevated MTA levels could cause the elevation of ODC levels we observed in meu1Δ yeast. We grew cultures of MEU1, meu1Δ, and spe2Δ yeast with and without added 5 mm MTA to medium, and examined ODC protein by immunoblot (Fig. 5C). We saw no significant increase in ODC levels of any of the three strains by the addition of exogenous MTA. This result indicates that build-up of MTA is not responsible for the elevated ODC levels observed in meu1Δ yeast. Mutations in E1 and E2 Homologues Affect ODC and Polyamine Levels—Given the result above, we reasoned that a salvage pathway metabolite downstream of MTA might play a key role in repressing ODC levels. To test this hypothesis, we examined ODC levels in yeast strains deleted for genes similar to two known salvage pathway enzymes from Klebsiella oxytoca. The E1 protein from Klebsiella catalyzes the conversion of 2,3-diketo-5-methylthio-1-phosphopentene to 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene, whereas the E2 protein catalyzes the subsequent formation of 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate (see Fig. 1) (6.Wray J.W. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3147-3153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 41.Myers R.W. Wray J.W. Fish S. Abeles R.H. J. Biol.

We searched the S. cerevisiae genome for open reading frames similar to these proteins and found one for each gene. Yeast YEL038W encodes a protein that is 37% identical to Klebsiella E1, whereas yeast YMR009W encodes a protein with 26% identity to E2. We obtained deletions of each of these genes from the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (28.Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L. Veronneau S. Dow S. Lucau-Danila A. Anderson K. Andre B.

Deletion strains for each of these proteins were viable, and whole cell extracts were prepared and examined for polyamine levels, ODC activity, and protein levels. E1 and E2 deletion strains had elevated ODC activity and protein levels compared with the MEU1 control strain (see Figs. 3B and 4A). However, neither strain had quite the same level of induction as observed in the meu1Δ strain. The polyamine profiles also showed an intermediate effect (Fig. 3A). Spermidine levels were clearly elevated in the E1 and E2 mutants, but putrescine was still below the limit of our detection. These results show that mutations in enzymes downstream of MTAP cause elevated ODC levels and elevated levels of spermidine. MTOB Repression of ODC in meu1Δ—Based on the findings above and our knowledge of the biochemical pathway, we reasoned that perhaps MTOB was a negative regulator of ODC. We tested this hypothesis by growing the various mutants in medium in which 1 mm MTOB was substituted for methionine. Yeast grown in MTOB had identical doubling times as yeast grown in methionine (data not shown). However, immunoblot analysis of ODC clearly shows that the addition of MTOB dramatically abolishes the elevated ODC levels observed in meu1, E1, and E2 mutants (Fig. 6). This finding shows that MTOB represses ODC protein levels. MTAP and MTOB Repress ODC in Human Tumor Cells— Previously, we have described the creation of isogenic MTAP-positive and MTAP-negative MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cell lines and showed that MTAP caused a 3-fold decrease in total polyamine levels (see Table III in Ref. 1.Christopher S.A. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. Kruger W.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6639-6644PubMed Google Scholar). To see if this repression might be related to ODC repression, we measured ODC activity in two MTAP-expressing and two MTAP-nonexpressing clones (Fig. 7A). Depending on the clones compared, there is a 3–9-fold drop in ODC activity in the MTAP-expressing compared with the nonexpressing cells. These results show that MTAP represses ODC in mammalian cells as well as yeast. We also examined whether exposure to MTOB could repress ODC activity in mammalian cells. For these experiments, we used MCF-7 cells and MIAPaca-2 cells, a pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line deleted for MTAP (31.Chen Z.H. Olopade O.I. Savarese T.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in regular methionine-containing medium and then placed in either medium with methionine or lacking methionine and supplemented with either 0.2 or 2 mm MTOB. Previously, we have shown that MCF-7 cells can utilize MTOB as a source of fixed sulfur and have identical doubling times on either methionine or MTOB (44.Tang B. Li Y.N. Kruger W.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5543-5547PubMed Google Scholar). We found similar growth results with MIAPaca-2 cells (data not shown). After 24 h, cells were harvested, and ODC activity was determined (Fig. 7B). Cells from both lines treated with either concentration of MTOB had significant decreases in ODC activity compared with cells growing in 100 μm methionine. These results indicate that MTOB acts as a negative regulator of ODC activity in mammalian cells. In this report, we demonstrate that the deletion of MTAP causes activation of ODC, resulting in elevated polyamine pools. Our data indicate that a specific downstream salvage pathway metabolite, MTOB, may be a key player in this process. In yeast, mutations in putative salvage pathway genes located between MTAP and MTOB caused elevated ODC protein and activity levels. In both MTAP-deleted yeast and human cells, the addition of MTOB to the medium causes a substantial reduction in ODC activity. Our studies cannot determine whether MTOB is a direct regulator of ODC or whether some metabolite of MTOB is involved. Studies using BAF3 murine lymphoid cells have demonstrated that MTOB can be converted to malondialdehyde and methional in cell extracts (45.Quash G. Roch A.M. Chantepie J. Michal Y. Fournet G. Dumontet C. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MTOB and methional at high concentrations can induce apoptosis in BAF3 cells. It has been shown that drugs that cause depletion of polyamines can sometimes also cause apoptosis in tumor-derived cell lines (46.Schipper R.G. Penning L.C. Verhofstad A.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that in BAF3 cells, MTOB may cause apoptosis by depletion of polyamine pools. We found in S. cerevisiae that mutations in the homologues from Klebsiella E1 and E2 had more modest effects on ODC activation than MTAP deletion. If MTOB were the only inhibitor of ODC, one would expect levels to be identical. There are two possible explanations. First, it may be that there are alternate enzymatic pathways in yeast that can convert methylthioribose-1-phosphate to MTOB, and thus the E1 and E2 mutants may have some low level of MTOB present. Consistent with this idea, Dibner et al. (47.Dibner J.J. Durley R.C. Kostelc J.G. Ivey F.J. J. Nutr. 1990; 120: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported that methylthioribose-1-phosphate could be converted to 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid, which could then be converted to MTOB. Alternatively, other metabolites in the pathway may also inhibit ODC levels. For example, MTOB and methylthioribose 1-phosphate may both be repressors of ODC. In this paper, we show several lines of evidence that the yeast MEU1 gene encodes MTAP, including amino acid similarity, requirement of MEU1 for enzyme activity, and growth on MTA-containing medium. The MEU1 gene was initially identified in a genetic screen designed to isolate mutations affecting transcriptional regulation of ADH2 (26.Donoviel M.S. Young E.T. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Why did MTAP come up in such a screen? Our finding that MTAP deletion alters polyamine homeostasis by overexpression of ODC suggests a possible explanation. Recent evidence indicates that there is a significant link between polyamines, enzymes involved in chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional regulation. In yeast, it has been found that mutations that reduce polyamine levels are able to bypass the need for the core histone deacetylase, GCN5, for the expression of certain genes (48.Pollard K.J. Samuels M.L. Crowley K.A. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5622-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In ODC overexpressing transgenic mice, both intrinsic histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities are elevated (49.Hobbs C.A. Gilmour S.K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 50.Hobbs C.A. Paul B.A. Gilmour S.K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 67-74PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase activities would be expected to have effects on a large number of genes (51.Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, microarray analysis of 15,000 expressed sequence tags in isogenic MTAP+ and MTAP– MCF-7 cells indicates that over 200 genes are either 2-fold induced or repressed by MTAP expression. 2B. Tang and W. D. Kruger, unpublished data. ODC levels in yeast and mammalian cells are regulated post-transcriptionally. In higher cells, the antizyme protein targets ODC for degradation by the proteosome (52.Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Antizyme production requires a frame-shifting event that is greatly stimulated when polyamines are absent. S. cerevisiae lacks a canonical antizyme but appears to have a similar post-transcriptional mechanism for ODC regulation in response to polyamine depletion (36.Gupta R. Hamasaki-Katagiri N. White Tabor C. Tabor H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10620-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our work here shows that the salvage pathway products also negatively regulate ODC. Thus, ODC is feedback-regulated by both of its downstream pathways. We did not observe a “hyper” increase in the ODC levels in the double mutant, suggesting that both feedback processes may be affecting the same underlying mechanism (i.e. disruption of either feedback loop results in elevated ODC). Our findings also support our earlier hypothesis that MTAP acts as a tumor suppressor by altering polyamine pools. Previously, our laboratory has shown that expression of MTAP in MTAP-deleted MCF-7 cells suppresses anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in SCID mice and causes significant reduction in polyamine levels (1.Christopher S.A. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. Kruger W.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6639-6644PubMed Google Scholar). This reduction in polyamines is easily explained by inhibition of ODC by MTAP. We also demonstrated in our previous work that the addition of putrescine could partially restore anchorage-independent growth to MTAP-expressing cells, indicating that at least part of the ability of MTAP to suppress tumorigenicity is due to its affect on polyamine production. However, it is possible that MTAP deletion in tumor cells may be affecting other pathways in addition to polyamine biosynthesis that contribute to tumorigenicity. Future experiments will focus on answering this question. We thank Martin Hoyt and Phil Cofino for the use of the yeast ODC antiserum.

https://openalex.org/W1983593213,"Previous studies demonstrated that ICAM-1 ligation on human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) sequentially induces activation of xanthine oxidase and p38 MAPK. Inhibition of these signaling events reduces neutrophil migration to the EC borders. This study examined the role of SRC tyrosine kinases in ICAM-1-initiated signaling within these ECs. Cross-linking ICAM-1 on tumor necrosis factor-α-pretreated ECs induced an increase in the activity of SRC tyrosine kinases. This increase was inhibited by allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor), Me2SO (a hydroxyl radical scavenger), or deferoxamine (an iron chelator). Phenylarsine oxide, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, reduced the base-line activity of SRC as well as the increase in SRC activity induced by ICAM-1 cross-linking. Specific inhibition of the protein expression of the SRC homology 2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) by an antisense oligonucleotide prevented the induced SRC activation but had no effect on the basal SRC activity. Activation of SRC tyrosine kinases was accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin at Tyr-146, which was inhibited by PP2, an SRC tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Moreover, PP2 completely inhibited p38 activation, suggesting a role for SRC tyrosine kinases in p38 activation. These data demonstrate that ICAM-1 ligation activates SRC tyrosine kinases and that this activation requires SHP-2 as well as production of reactive oxygen species generated from xanthine oxidase. Activation of SRC tyrosine kinases in turn leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin, as well as activation of p38, a kinase previously identified to be required for cytoskeletal changes induced by ICAM-1 ligation and for neutrophil migration along the EC surface.

ICAM-1-initiated signaling events into ECs play important roles in modulating neutrophil migration along and/or across endothelium during inflammatory responses. Sans et al. (3Sans E. Delachanal E. Duperray A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) demonstrated that deletion of the ICAM-1 cytoplasmic domain completely inhibits neutrophil transmigration, but not adhesion, in a reconstituted cell line, suggesting a role for ICAM-1-dependent outside-in signaling in mediating neutrophil migration. In addition, inhibition of ICAM-1-inititated signaling events in pulmonary microvascular ECs reduces neutrophil migration along the EC surface to reach EC borders (4Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J.

Within the signaling pathways induced through ligation of ICAM-1, activation of SRC tyrosine kinases has been demonstrated in human umbilical vein ECs and rat brain microvascular ECs (5Durieu-Trautmann O.

In addition, ligation of ICAM-1 induces activation of LYN, a member of the SRC family tyrosine kinases, in a B cell lymphoma line (8Holland J. Owens T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9108-9112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each member of the human SRC tyrosine kinase family is composed of a unique region, an SRC homology 2 and 3 domain, a catalytic domain containing residue Tyr-419 (Tyr-416 in chicken SRC), and a C-terminal regulatory region containing residue Tyr-530 (Tyr-527 in chicken SRC) (9DeMali K.A.

An important mechanism for regulating SRC activity is through modulation of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at Tyr-419 and Tyr-530, although the activity of SRC tyrosine kinases can also be regulated through interaction with binding proteins such as focal adhesion kinase and p130cas (10Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 12Eide B.L. Turck C.W. Escobedo J.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5865-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Tyr-530, when phosphorylated, interacts with the SRC homology 2 domain and results in inhibition of kinase activity. Dephosphorylation of this residue disrupts this intramolecular interaction and results in SRC activation (10Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of Tyr-419 increases SRC kinase activity, whereas dephosphorylation decreases SRC kinase activity. The mechanisms underlying SRC activation in response to ICAM-1 cross-linking have been examined in rat brain microvascular ECs, where activation of SRC requires activation of phospholipase C (6Etienne-Manneville S. Manneville J.B. Adamson P. Wilbourn B. Greenwood J. Couraud P.O. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3375-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In these ECs and human umbilical vein ECs, activation of SRC in turn results in tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin (5Durieu-Trautmann O. Chaverot N. Cazaubon S. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12536-12540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Etienne-Manneville S. Manneville J.B. Adamson P. Wilbourn B. Greenwood J. Couraud P.O. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Activation of SRC tyrosine kinases in response to ICAM-1 ligation likely has other downstream targets besides cortactin, and modulation of these downstream targets may play important roles in mediating EC responses induced by ICAM-1 ligation. We have demonstrated recently (4Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6487-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that neutrophil adhesion to TNF-α-pretreated human pulmonary microvascular ECs induces cytoskeletal changes that require ICAM-1-initiated signaling pathways and can be mimicked by cross-linking ICAM-1 with antibodies. Signaling pathways initiated by ICAM-1 ligation with neutrophils or cross-linking antibodies include ICAM-1 redistribution on EC surface, activation of xanthine oxidase, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activation of p38 MAPK (4Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6487-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 MAPK results in phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27, an actin-binding protein that may induce actin polymerization when phosphorylated, and p38 activation is required for the cytoskeletal rearrangement induced by ICAM-1 ligation, as well as for neutrophil migration toward EC borders (4Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J.

Blood. 2001; 97: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways induced by ROS production that lead to p38 MAPK activation are not understood. This present study examined the role of SRC tyrosine kinases in ICAM-1-initiated signaling pathways in these human pulmonary microvascular ECs and focused on understanding the upstream signaling pathways leading to SRC activation, as well as identifying potential downstream targets of SRC tyrosine kinases in response to ICAM-1 ligation. Our studies demonstrate the following: 1) cross-linking ICAM-1 induces activation of SRC tyrosine kinases; 2) activation of SRC tyrosine kinases requires production of reactive oxygen species generated from xanthine oxidase and the SRC homology 2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2); 3) activation of SRC tyrosine kinases is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin as well as activation of p38 MAPK. Recombinant human TNF-α was obtained from R & D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Murine anti-human ICAM-1 antibody (clone 6.5B5) and rabbit anti-murine IgG were obtained from Dako (Carpinteria, CA). Goat F(ab)2 fragment of IgG raised against murine IgG F(c) fragment was obtained from Organon Teknika (Durham, NC). Rabbit anti-threonine-phosphorylated ezrin (Thr-567)/radixin (Thr-564)/moesin (Thr-558) antibody and p38 MAPK activity assay kit were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Goat anti-tyrosine-phosphorylated ezrin at residue Tyr-146 (pY146), SRC-associated during mitosis, 68-kDa Sam-(68–331-443) fusion protein, rabbit anti-human SHP-1 and SHP-2 antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-human ezrin antibody and anti-SRC antibody-conjugated agarose beads were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY).

(South San Francisco, CA). PP2 and the phospho-SRC peptide (524–536 for human SRC) phosphorylated on Tyr-530 were obtained from Calbiochem. Cultivation of Human Pulmonary Microvascular ECs—Human pulmonary microvascular ECs were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and plated onto fibronectin-coated culture dishes, as described previously (17Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6487-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Wang Q. Chiang E.T. Lim M. Lai J. Rogers R. Janmey P.A. Shepro D. Doerschuk C.M. Blood. 2001; 97: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). ECs were used between passage 7 and 15. ECs were grown to confluence and used 2–3 days post-confluence. These cells can be induced to up-regulate ICAM-1 expression upon TNF-α stimulation (17Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6487-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Wang Q. Chiang E.T. Lim M. Lai J. Rogers R. Janmey P.A. Shepro D. Doerschuk C.M. Blood. 2001; 97: 660-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). ICAM-1 Cross-linking—ICAM-1 was cross-linked as described previously (4Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6487-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, ECs pretreated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 24 h were incubated with 10 μg/ml murine anti-human ICAM-1 antibody for 30 min. The cells were washed with culture medium before they were either left untreated in medium or treated with 50 μg/ml goat F(ab)2 against murine IgG F(c) fragment for 15 s to 15 min as specified. Our previous studies (4Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6487-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) demonstrate that incubation of ECs with murine IgG or murine anti-human HLA-A, -B, and -C antibody instead of murine anti-human ICAM-1 antibody followed by addition of a cross-linking secondary antibody does not induce signaling into ECs or actin cytoskeletal changes. Measurement of SRC Tyrosine Kinase Activity—The activity of SRC tyrosine kinase was evaluated by an in vitro kinase assay using Sam68-(331–443) as a substrate after immunoprecipitating SRC. Sam68-(331–443) is expressed in Escherichia coli as a 51-kDa fusion protein and is a very efficient substrate for SRC tyrosine kinases. After the indicated treatment, ECs were washed twice with PBS containing 2 mm Na3VO4. The cells were incubated on ice for 5 min in Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with occasional agitation. The samples were collected and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein content in the supernatant was determined by BCA assay. Aliquots of supernatant containing equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were incubated with 20 μl of agarose beads conjugated with mouse anti-human SRC tyrosine kinase antibody for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were pelleted and washed twice with Triton X lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2. The beads were then incubated with kinase assay buffer including 200 μm ATP and 0.5 μg of Sam68-(331–443) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling the samples in SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (4Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Sam68-(331–443) and the immunoprecipitated SRC were examined by immunoblot using an anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-SRC antibody, respectively. The integrated density of tyrosine-phosphorylated Sam68-(331–443) and SRC was quantified by densitometry as described previously (4Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Synthesis of Oligonucleotides—The antisense oligonucleotide targeting human SHP-2 and a chemistry control oligonucleotide were synthesized as uniform phosphorothioate chimeric oligonucleotides, with 2′-O-methoxyethyl groups on bases 1–5 and 16–20. The oligonucleotides were synthesized by using an Applied Biosystems 380B automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and purified as described previously (19Baker B.F. Lot S.S. Condon T.P. Cheng-Flournoy S. Lesnik E.A. Sasmor H.M. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11994-12000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in these studies are as follows: SHP-2 antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CGCGATGTCATGTTCCTCCC-3′; control oligonucleotide 5′-GAGGTCTCGACTTACCCGCT-3′. Treatment of ECs with SHP-2 Antisense or Control Oligonucleotide— ECs were allowed to grow to about 80% confluence. The cells were washed with Opti-MEM twice and treated for 4 h with Opti-MEM containing 10 nm oligonucleotide premixed with 10 μg/ml Lipofectin. The cells were then washed and incubated with normal culture medium containing 10 nm oligonucleotides premixed with 2 μg/ml Lipofectin for 72 h before protein extraction was performed as described above. The effect of control or SHP-2 antisense oligonucleotide on the protein expression of SHP-2 or SHP-1 as a control protein was evaluated by immunoblot using an anti-human SHP-2 or SHP-1 antibody as described above. The effect of these two oligonucleotides on the activity of SRC tyrosine kinases was examined as described above. Examination of Dephosphorylation of the Phospho-SRC Peptide by Immunoprecipitated SHP-2—TNF-α-pretreated ECs were lysed under the same condition as described above for measuring SRC activity. Each sample was split into 2 aliquots of 40 μg of proteins. These 2 aliquots were pre-cleared with 20 μl of protein A/G plus beads for 30 min and incubated with or without 1 μg of rabbit anti-SHP-2 antibody for 2 h, followed by incubation with 20 μl of protein A/G plus beads for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with the cell lysis buffer and twice with the phosphatase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The beads were incubated with 25 μl of phosphatase assay buffer containing 3 μg of the phospho-SRC peptide (524–536, phosphorylated on Tyr-530) for 30 min at 30 °C. To examine the tyrosine phosphorylation of the phospho-SRC peptide after the reaction, 5 μl of the samples was dot-blotted onto the nitrocellulose membrane, and phosphotyrosine was detected using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as described above. In addition, the quantity of immunoprecipitated SHP-2 was examined by immunoblot. Evaluation of Protein Distribution in the Triton X-soluble and -insoluble Fractions—After the indicated treatment, ECs were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The cells were incubated on ice for 5 min in Triton X-100 lysis buffer with occasional agitation as described above. The cells were scraped off the dish, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were collected. The pellets were dissolved in equal volumes of SDS sample buffer and centrifuged again at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated ezrin, threonine-phosphorylated ezrin/radixin/moesin, or ezrin in each fraction was detected by immunoblot. Measurement of p38 MAPK Activity—The activity of p38 MAPK was evaluated using a p38 MAPK assay kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as described previously (4Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). ECs were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell lysis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated using agarose beads conjugated with anti-phosphorylated p38 antibody. The activity of immunoprecipitated p38 MAPK was evaluated by an in vitro kinase assay using ATF-2 as a substrate according to the manufacturer's protocols. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 was evaluated by immunoblot by using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated ATF-2 at residue Thr-71 as described above. As a loading control, the amount of ezrin in each sample used for immunoprecipitation was examined by immunoblot as described above. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using the Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. The data are expressed as the mean value ± S.E. ICAM-1 Cross-linking Induced Activation of SRC Tyrosine Kinases—To examine whether ICAM-1 cross-linking induced activation of SRC tyrosine kinases in TNF-α-pretreated human pulmonary microvascular ECs, SRC tyrosine kinases were immunoprecipitated by using agarose beads conjugated with anti-SRC tyrosine kinase antibody. The activity of immunoprecipitated SRC tyrosine kinases was evaluated by an in vitro kinase assay using Sam68-(331–443) as a substrate. SRC activity was readily detectable in TNF-α-pretreated ECs (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Cross-linking ICAM-1 with a secondary antibody resulted in a time-dependent increase in the activity of SRC (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–5). By 6 min, a 1.9 ± 0.2-fold increase was detected (Fig. 1B, p < 0.05). In the absence of cell lysates, incubation of anti-SRC agarose beads with the kinase assay buffer did not result in tyrosine phosphorylation of Sam68-(331–443) (data not shown). Activation of SRC Was Inhibited by Allopurinol (a Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitor), Me2SO (a Hydroxyl Radical Scavenger), or Deferoxamine (an Iron Chelator)—Production of xanthine oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species is implicated in the signaling events induced by ICAM-1 cross-linking in pulmonary microvascular ECs (4Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of SRC tyrosine kinases requires activation of xanthine oxidase, the effect of allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, on the activity of SRC tyrosine kinases was examined. Pretreatment of ECs with allopurinol did not alter the base-line activity of SRC tyrosine kinase. Following cross-linking, allopurinol significantly inhibited activation of SRC tyrosine kinases (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that xanthine oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species may be required for activation of SRC tyrosine kinases. To examine further the role of reactive oxygen species, the effect of Me2SO (a hydroxyl radical scavenger) or deferoxamine (an iron chelator) was examined. Both reagents inhibited activation of SRC tyrosine kinases induced by ICAM-1 cross-linking (Fig. 2B). Together, these data suggest that reactive oxygen species are required for activation of SRC tyrosine kinases. Regulation of SRC Activity by SHP-2—Because phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Tyr-419 and Tyr-530 represent an important mechanism for regulating SRC activity (10Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), the following experiments were performed to determine whether the activity of SRC in these ECs was regulated by tyrosine phosphatases. PAO, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, was used to pretreat ECs. Pretreatment with PAO markedly reduced the base-line activity of SRC, suggesting that basal SRC activity depends upon the basal activity of tyrosine phosphatases (Fig. 3). Moreover, ICAM-1 cross-linking did not increase SRC activity in PAO-pretreated samples, suggesting that the induced SRC activity may also require tyrosine phosphatases (Fig. 3). SHP-2, an SRC homology 2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, has been implicated in the regulation of SRC tyrosine kinases (10Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 20Walter A.O. Peng Z.-Y. Cartwright C.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1911-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These studies, along with our observation that tyrosine phosphatases modulate SRC activity in ECs, led us to examine the role of SHP-2. An antisense oligonucleotide was used to specifically inhibit the protein expression of SHP-2. Treatment with 10 nm SHP-2 antisense oligonucleotide, but not control oligonucleotide, completely inhibited the protein expression of SHP-2 (Fig. 4A). The effect of SHP-2 antisense appeared specific, because it did not inhibit the protein expression of SHP-1, a closely related tyrosine phosphatase that shares about 55% overall sequence identity with SHP-2 (21Stein-Gerlach M. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of SHP-2 expression had no effect on the basal activity of SRC tyrosine kinases but completely inhibited the induced SRC activity in response to ICAM-1 cross-linking (Fig. 4B). Examination of ICAM-1 expression in response to TNF-α treatment by immunoblot indicated that treatment with SHP-2 antisense had no effect on ICAM-1 expression (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that SHP-2 is required for the induced SRC activation in response to ICAM-1 ligation and that tyrosine phosphatases other than SHP-2 regulate the basal SRC activity. The results of these studies, along with published work (22Peng Z.Y. Cartwright C.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1955-1962PubMed Google Scholar) showing that SHP-2 is capable of selectively dephosphorylating SRC at residue Tyr-530 when examined by using purified proteins, led us to examine whether SHP-2 immunoprecipitated from TNF-α-treated human pulmonary microvascular ECs can indeed dephosphorylate SRC at residue Tyr-530. Immunoprecipitated SHP-2 was incubated with purified SRC peptide phosphorylated at residue Tyr-530. When compared with the controls, where no SHP-2 was immunoprecipitated, incubation with immunoprecipitated SHP-2 resulted in a significant decrease in the phosphorylation levels of the phospho-peptide from 1 ± 0.03 to 0.50 ± 0.07 (p < 0.05, Fig. 5). These data indicate that immunoprecipitated SHP-2 is capable of dephosphorylating SRC at Tyr-530, suggesting that SHP-2 may regulate SRC activity by dephosphorylating SRC at this residue. Activation of p38 MAPK Was Inhibited by PP2, a Specific Inhibitor of SRC Tyrosine Kinases—Cross-linking ICAM-1 in TNF-α-pretreated human pulmonary microvascular ECs induces activation of p38 MAPK that is required for the subsequent cytoskeletal rearrangement, as well as neutrophil migration toward EC borders (4Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6877-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of SRC tyrosine kinases is required for activation of p38 MAPK, the activity of p38 MAPK was compared in ECs pretreated with vehicle or PP2, a specific inhibitor of SRC tyrosine kinases (23Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). In cells pretreated with the control vehicle, ICAM-1 cross-linking for 6 min induced a significant increase in p38 activity (Fig. 6). Pretreatment with PP2, however, completely inhibited p38 activation, suggesting that activation of SRC tyrosine kinases is required for p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 6). Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Ezrin Induced by ICAM-1 Cross-linking Was Inhibited by PP2—ICAM-1 cross-linking also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of protein(s) that could be detected in total cell lysates by immunoblots using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 7). Tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by 6 min of ICAM-1 cross-linking and persisted for at least 15 min (Fig. 7). The molecular masses of these tyrosine-phosphorylated protein(s) were about 80 kDa when separated under denatured and reducing conditions. This increase in tyrosine phosphorylation required the addition of cross-linking secondary antibody, because the addition of anti-ICAM-1 antibody alone did not induce any change in tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown), consistent with our previous observations that a cross-linking secondary antibody is required to induce ICAM-1-initiated signaling events (17Wang Q. Doerschuk C.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6487-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of ECs with 20 μm PP2 completely inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of the 80-kDa protein(s) induced by ICAM-1 cross-linking, suggesting that activation of SRC tyrosine kinases is required (Fig. 7). The molecular weight of these tyro"
https://openalex.org/W2119688105,"Cells must regulate both biosynthesis and degradation to ensure proper homeostasis of cellular organelles and proteins. This balance is demonstrated in a unique way in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which possesses two distinct, yet mechanistically related trafficking routes mediating the delivery of proteins from the cytoplasm to the vacuole: the biosynthetic cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) and the degradative autophagy pathways. Several components employed by these two transport routes have been identified, but their mechanistic interactions remain largely unknown. Here we report a novel gene involved in these pathways, which we have named ATG23. Atg23 localizes to the pre-auto-phagosomal structure but also to other cytosolic punctate compartments. Our characterization of the Atg23 protein indicates that it is required for the Cvt pathway and efficient autophagy but not pexophagy. In the absence of Atg23, cargo molecules such as prApe1 are correctly recruited to a pre-autophagosomal structure that is unable to give rise to Cvt vesicles. We also demonstrate that Atg23 is a peripheral membrane protein that requires the presence of Atg9/Apg9 to be specifically targeted to lipid bilayers. Atg9 transiently interacts with Atg23 suggesting that it participates in the recruitment of this protein. Cells must regulate both biosynthesis and degradation to ensure proper homeostasis of cellular organelles and proteins. This balance is demonstrated in a unique way in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which possesses two distinct, yet mechanistically related trafficking routes mediating the delivery of proteins from the cytoplasm to the vacuole: the biosynthetic cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) and the degradative autophagy pathways. Several components employed by these two transport routes have been identified, but their mechanistic interactions remain largely unknown. Here we report a novel gene involved in these pathways, which we have named ATG23. Atg23 localizes to the pre-auto-phagosomal structure but also to other cytosolic punctate compartments. Our characterization of the Atg23 protein indicates that it is required for the Cvt pathway and efficient autophagy but not pexophagy.

Atg9 transiently interacts with Atg23 suggesting that it participates in the recruitment of this protein. Cells must carefully maintain homeostasis by balancing biosynthetic and catabolic pathways as well as by being able to sense changes in their environments and respond accordingly. This balance can be seen quite dramatically when considering the delivery of proteins and substrates to the lysosome-like vacuole of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The vacuole is the primary degradative organelle within the yeast cell. In accordance with its catabolic role, the vacuole contains a large number of resident hydrolases that must be targeted to this compartment. Multiple pathways are used for the proper localization of these vacuolar hydrolases (reviewed in Ref. 1Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, substrates destined for degradation, including both proteins and entire organelles, must be delivered to the vacuole where they become accessible to the lumenal hydrolases. S. cerevisiae possesses two distinct, yet mechanistically overlapping trafficking pathways to allow for the delivery of proteins directly from the cytoplasm to the vacuole, termed cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) 1The abbreviations used are: Cvtcytoplasm to vacuole targetingPASpre-autophagosomal structureORFopen reading frameHAhemagglutininPAprotein AGFPgreen fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. and autophagy (Atg). Under rich growth conditions, these mechanistic components are almost exclusively dedicated to the biosynthetic trafficking of specific resident vacuolar proteins via the Cvt pathway. However, during periods of starvation, these components switch to mediate autophagy, in which bulk cellular material is transported non-specifically to the vacuole for degradation (reviewed in Refs. 2Khalfan W.A.

In this study we report the characterization of ATG23, a gene identified in a screen of a systematic ORF deletion library to isolate genes that, when deleted, render cells incompetent for Cvt trafficking during nitrogen-rich growth conditions. We demonstrate that atg23Δ mutants are defective for Cvt trafficking as well as exhibiting decreased levels of autophagy upon challenge by nitrogen starvation. The Atg23 protein is a peripheral membrane protein distributed in subcellular punctate organelles. One of the multiple Atg23-positive structures co-localizes with the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS), the potential site of organization for Cvt vesicle/autophagosome formation (19Kim J.

Atg23 interacts with Atg9, a transmembrane protein essential for Cvt vesicle and autophagosome formation with an identical localization pattern (21Noda T. Kim J. Huang W.-P. Baba M. Tokunaga C.

For ATG23 gene disruptions, the entire coding region was replaced with either the Escherichia coli kanr or the S. cerevisiae TRP1 gene using PCR primers containing ∼40 bases of identity to the regions flanking the open reading frame. PCR-based integrations of the triple HA tag, the 13xMyc tag, protein A (PA), GFP, and YFP at the 3′ end of ATG23 and ATG9 were used to generate strains expressing fusion proteins under the control of their native promoters.

Cells were grown in rich (YPD: 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or synthetic minimal media (SMD: 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, amino acids and vitamins as needed). Starvation experiments were conducted in synthetic media lacking nitrogen (SD-N: 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose). Cell Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown to A600 = 1.0 in SMD. Cells (10 ml) were collected and labeled in 100 μl of SMD with 20 μCi of Tran-35S-label (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 10 min and then subjected to a nonradioactive chase in 1 ml of SMD supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract, 2 mm methionine, and 2 mm cysteine. Samples were removed at the time points indicated, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and washed with acetone. Extracts were generated using glass bead lysis and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described elsewhere (17Harding T.M. Morano K.A. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Filtration Lysis and Membrane Flotation—Indicated cells were grown in SMD + casamino acids to early log phase (A600 = 0.5) and converted to spheroplasts by treatment with 5 μg/A600 oxalyticase (Enzogenetics, Eugene, OR). Spheroplasts were resuspended in PS600 lysis buffer (20 mm K-PIPES, pH 6.8, 600 mm sorbitol) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and filtered through 3.0-μm nucleopore track-etch membranes (Whatman) in a 13-mm syringe filter holder using a 3-cc syringe. The filtrate was pre-cleared with a low speed spin at 800 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cleared filtrate was subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, resulting in low speed supernatant (S13) and pellet (P13) fractions. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were subjected to filtration lysis as described above, and S13/P13 fractions were collected. The S13 fraction was subjected to further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min in a TLA100.4 fixed angle rotor to generate high speed supernatant (S100) and pellet (P100) fractions. All fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and analyzed by immunoblot using anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-Pgk1 antiserum (a generous gift from Dr. Jeremy Thorner, University of California, Berkeley).

We recently performed a systematic screen of the yeast ORF deletion library by Western blot looking for the accumulation of prApe1 in nitrogen-rich conditions to identify novel genes required for the Cvt pathway. One such gene identified was CVT23 (ORF YLR431c). This gene was subsequently renamed ATG23 in accordance with a new, unified genetic nomenclature for AuTophaGy-related genes in yeast (15Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn Jr., W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y. Sandoval I.V. Sibirny A. Subramani S. Thumm M. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). To verify that Atg23 is required for the Cvt pathway, we performed a pulsechase analysis to determine the kinetics of prApe1 import in atg23Δ cells. Yeast cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and subjected to a non-radioactive chase. In wild type cells, the 61-kDa prApe1 was processed to the 50-kDa mature form with a half-time of ∼30 min (Fig. 1). In contrast, the atg23Δ mutant specifically accumulated prApe1 in rich medium (Fig. 1), demonstrating that atg23Δ cells are indeed defective for the Cvt pathway. To determine whether this block was specific to the Cvt pathway, we examined the delivery of proteins to the vacuole through the carboxypeptidase Y pathway. Many resident vacuolar hydrolases, including Prc1 (carboxypeptidase Y), are delivered to the vacuole through a portion of the secretory pathway (1Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 230-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the processing of Prc1 was unaffected in atg23Δ cells (data not shown). This result indicates that the atg23Δ mutant did not display a general block in vacuolar protein delivery, implying a specific function for Atg23 in the Cvt pathway. We wished to determine whether Atg23 had a function in autophagic trafficking to the vacuole, because many of the proteins utilized by the Cvt pathway are also needed for autophagy. Although most currently characterized atg mutants are defective in delivery through both pathways, there is an increasing list of genes required primarily for the Cvt pathway, including VAC8, ATG11/CVT9, ATG20/CVT20, ATG24/CVT13, and the VFT tethering complex (28Kim J.

As prApe1 can be specifically transported to the vacuole through both the Cvt pathway and autophagy (34Scott S.V. Hefner-Gravink A. Morano K.A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

As shown in Fig. 2A, atg23Δ cells, like vac8Δ cells, accumulated prApe1 under growth conditions but rapidly processed prApe1 when deprived of nitrogen. As a control, we examined the atg9Δ mutant. Atg9 is a membrane protein essential for both the Cvt and autophagy pathways (21Noda T. Kim J. Huang W.-P. Baba M. Tokunaga C. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). As expected, atg9Δ cells accumulated prApe1 under both growth and starvation conditions. In contrast, wild type cells were able to mature this hydrolase under either growth or starvation conditions. Although the ability of atg23Δ cells to mature prApe1 during starvation conditions indicated that this mutant was at least partly competent for autophagy, it did not necessarily mean that the process functioned normally. For example, Atg17/Apg17 is required for autophagy; however, the corresponding deletion mutant is able to process prApe1 during starvation conditions, presumably through the Cvt pathway (25Kamada Y.

For a quantitative measure of autophagy, we utilized a truncated derivative of the vacuolar alkaline phosphatase (Pho8), Pho8Δ60, which lacks the transmembrane and vacuolar targeting domains. In the absence of these sequences, Pho8Δ60 accumulates in the cytosol and is only transported to the vacuole by inclusion into autophagosomes. Once delivered to the vacuole, it is processed to the mature, active form (39Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus, measuring Pho8Δ60 activity under starvation conditions provides a quantitative analysis of autophagy. The activity of Pho8Δ60 was measured in wild type, atg23Δ, and atg13Δ/apg13Δ cells expressing pho8Δ60 during starvation conditions (Fig. 2B). As expected, atg13Δ cells that are defective for autophagy exhibited no induction of Pho8Δ60 activity (40Funakoshi T. Matsuura A. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In contrast, atg23Δ cells induced ∼40% of the amount of Pho8Δ60 activity compared with wild type. To extend our analysis of autophagy in the atg23Δ mutant, we analyzed the ability of the mutant to survive extended periods of starvation (Fig. 2C). Wild type cells survived nitrogen deprivation for at least 2 weeks because of their capacity for autophagy. In contrast, autophagy-defective mutants, such as atg9Δ, began to die rapidly upon nitrogen removal, becoming inviable after 3-4 days. In contrast to either of these extremes, atg23Δ mutants remained viable during starvation conditions for several days and began dying after ∼6-8 days. The intermediate starvation-resistance phenotype and partial induction of Pho8Δ60 activity both indicate that autophagy occurred in atg23Δ cells, unlike the case with mutants such as atg9Δ. However, in the atg23Δ mutant, it did not occur as efficiently as in wild type cells. Autophagy allows for the nonspecific uptake of bulk cytoplasm into large vesicles called autophagosomes, which are delivered to the vacuole to generate an internal pool of nutrients that can be exploited for survival during prolonged periods of starvation (41Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 42Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Two possibilities exist for the phenotype of atg23Δ cells during starvation conditions, either a reduction in the size of the forming autophagosomes or reduced numbers of autophagosomes. To address these possibilities, we used electron microscopy to examine the ultrastructure of the autophagic bodies that accumulated in atg23Δ pep4Δ cells during starvation. Autophagic bodies are single membrane intravacuolar vesicles that result from the fusion of autophagosomes with the vacuole; once delivered to the lumen, they are degraded in a Pep4-dependent manner (42Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2D, pep4Δ atg23Δ mutants accumulated autophagic bodies of normal size within the vacuolar lumen under starvation conditions. Quantification of the numbers of autophagic bodies, however, revealed approximately a 70% reduction in the number of autophagic bodies accumulating in atg23Δ cells compared with wild type (10.5 ± 3.5 for pep4Δ cells compared with 3.18 ± 2.1 for pep4Δ atg23Δ cells, n = 50 vacuoles). This reduction correlated very well with the biochemical data (Fig. 2B) and indicated that atg23Δ mutants exhibit decreased efficiency of autophagy rather than a structural defect in autophagosome formation. Finally, we wished to determine a role, if any, for Atg23 in pexophagy. Excess peroxisomes in S. cerevisiae can be delivered to the vacuole for degradation by using machinery that largely overlaps with the Cvt pathway and autophagy; most currently characterized atg mutants, including those specific for the Cvt pathway, are defective in this process (27Hutchins M.U. Veenhuis M. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4079-4087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in oleic acid to induce peroxisome proliferation and then shifted to glucose-containing medium lacking nitrogen to induce maximum degradation of the superfluous organelles. We measured pexophagy in wild type, atg23Δ, and atg9Δ cells by following the degradation of the peroxisomal thiolase Fox3. As shown in Fig. 3, elimination of Fox3 in atg23Δ cells was comparable with wild type, whereas atg9Δ cells exhibited no such degradation. This indicates that Atg23 is not required for pexophagy. These results place the atg23Δ strain into a unique category of mutants that are defective in the Cvt and autophagy pathways but not in pexophagy. Atg23 Is Required for Cvt Vesicle Formation—To gain insight into Atg23 function, we decided to identify the step at which Atg23 acts in the Cvt pathway, utilizing the current model of Cvt cargo transport: Cargo selection, sequestration into intact Cvt vesicles, vesicle fusion with the limiting membrane of the vacuole, and maturation of the prApe1 cargo in the vacuolar lumen (reviewed in Ref. 43Reggiori F.

We demonstrated that interaction with RNA pol II is a conserved feature of BRCA1 proteins from several species.

A distinct, but not mutually exclusive, model would suggest that BRCA1 interacts with elements of the RNA pol II holoenzyme linked to postpromoter activities of the complex. Evidence for this model includes interactions of BRCA1 with the elongation factor NELF-B/COBRA1 (33Ye Q. Hu Y.F. Nye Zhong, A.C. Belmont A.S. Li R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 1556: 911-921Google Scholar) and the CstF-50 component of the polyadenylation complex (34Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L.

Following our observation that the CTD of bovine BRCA1 had less charge and less one-hybrid activity than the same region of human BRCA1 (39Krum S.A. Womack J.E. Lane T.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6032-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we decided to search for structural and functional features of the BRCA1-RNA pol II complex that are more broadly conserved in mammalian cells. In the present study, we compared full-length and truncated BRCA1 proteins from four species for their ability to activate transcription in one-hybrid transcription assays and then assessed their association with cellular RNA pol II complexes. Although BRCA1 proteins from all four species associated strongly with the hyperphosphorylated (IIO) form of RNA pol II, none of the full-length BRCA1 proteins displayed the ability to correctly initiate pol II-dependent transcription. Importantly, we observed that BRCA1 co-purified with a large percentage of hyperphosphorylated (IIO) RNA pol II found in cycling epithelial cells, but interacted minimally with hypophosphorylated (IIA) forms of the enzyme, which are more abundant. This distinction, based on fractionation of the endogenous proteins, suggested that a major role of BRCA1 in undamaged cells is directed toward postinitiation functions of RNA pol II. These results provide evidence that BRCA1 is not a transcriptional activator per se and suggest that roles in transcriptional regulation would probably involve postinitiation functions, or aspects of genomic surveillance, that are linked to RNA pol II transcriptional machinery. Cell Culture—MCF-7 and T47D (human mammary epithelial cell lines), MNuMg and C57MG (mouse mammary epithelial cell lines), bovine aortic endothelial cells and Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells (bovine epithelial cells), 293T (human fibroblasts), and NIH-3T3 (mouse fibroblasts) were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HBL100 (human epithelial cell line) were maintained in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. PCR—All PCRs were done with the following conditions: 0.5 μl of cDNA, 1× Dynazyme EXT (Finnzymes, Finland) buffer, 0.5 units of Dynazyme EXT (Finnzymes), 250 μm dNTPs, and 1 μm each oligonucleotide. PCR conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 50 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 2 min; and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. Plasmid Constructs—The human BRCA1 CTDs, representing amino acids 1380–1863, previously shown to have the highest activity in GAL4 transcriptional activation assays (16Hu Y.F. Miyake T. Ye Q. Li R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40910-40915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was generated by PCR using full-length human BRCA1 cDNA as the template (a gift of E. Solomon, Guy's Hospital, London, UK) and the primers 5′-CCAAGAATTCCTGAAGACTGCTCAGGGCTATCC-3′ and 5′-CTCATTCTTGGGGTCCTGTGG-3′. The canine BRCA1-CTD (codons 1380–1879) was generated from canine first strand cDNA with the following primers: 5′-AAACGAGCCTCTCTGAAGACTGTTCC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTTACACGCATGGCTGGCTGG-3′ (based on the sequence of accession number U50709). Full-length and Δ11 mouse BRCA1 were generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using first strand cDNA from a mouse mammary epithelial cell line (MNuMg). The murine BRCA1-CTD (codons 1334–1813) was then amplified with the primers 5′-CCAAGAATTCCCGGATACGAGAGTGAAACAA-3′ and 5′-AAGCACCAAAGACTGAGA-3′ (40Lane T.F. Deng C. Elson A. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2712-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Bovine BRCA1-CTD and full-length constructs were described previously (39Krum S.A. Womack J.E. Lane T.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6032-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). All PCR fragments were ligated into pCR-blunt II TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced in both directions to confirm identity with previously reported sequences. The pCR-CTD vectors were digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the CTDs were ligated into the GAL4 vector pFA-CMV (Stratagene). Full-length GAL4-human BRCA1 and a fusion of the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) to the transactivation domain of herpes virus VP16 were a gift of Alvaro Monteiro (Rockefeller University). CTDs from two human disease-associated BRCA1 mutations, BRCA1 1853term-CTD and BRCA1 5382insertC-CTD were generated by PCR. The 5382insertC mutation was the kind gift of Dr. Charlie Chan and Dr. Charles Sawyers (UCLA). All other constructs were generated by restriction digestion of the constructs described above. All fusions were verified by sequencing in both directions, and expression was verified by transfection into 293T cells and immunoblotting with appropriate antisera. To create constructs tagged with green fluorescence protein (GFPCTD constructs), the CTDs were cut out of pCR-blunt II TOPO with EcoRI and ligated in frame into pQBI25-fc2 (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). Nuclear localization signals were introduced by ligating oligonucleotides encoding the SV40 nuclear localization signal at the 5′ end of the CTD. To create constructs tagged with glutathione S-transferase (GST), the CTDs were cut out of pCR-blunt II TOPO with EcoRI and ligated in-frame into pGEX2TK (Amersham Biosciences). Expression Analysis of Fusion Vectors—3 μg of purified (Qiagen) plasmid DNA was transfected into 293T cells using calcium phosphate precipitation. After 24 h, the cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and extracts were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk, and incubated with a primary antibody generated against the GAL4 DNA binding domain (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), followed by a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). Blots were developed with a chemiluminescence detection substrate (SuperSignal™; Pierce). The GAL4 fusions encoded the GAL4 DBD plus 483 amino acids of the human, 499 amino acids for the dog, 485 amino acids for the cow, and 479 amino acids for the mouse CTD. The GST fusions used the same CTDs, except in the case of the GST-dog CTD, which included 60 additional amino acids of the canine BRCA1 protein, which had no affect on any of the assays. Immunofluorescence—A Leica DM IRBE fluorescent microscope equipped with a ×40 objective (Leica Microsystems) and a Hamamatsu C4742-95 digital camera was used for image acquisition. Images were stored and processed with an Openlab 3.1 software package (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Mammalian One-hybrid (Luciferase) Assays—25,000–50,000 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture dishes and transfected with 1 μg of the firefly luciferase reporter vector, pFR-luc (Stratagene) and the indicated pFA-GAL4-fusion vector (referred to as GAL4-BRCA1 or GAL4-BRCA1-CTD, etc.). A dosage-titration experiment was performed with all of the key plasmid constructs, and optimal activation was seen when 100 ng of the GAL4-BRCA1-CTD fusion plasmids were used (data not shown). All subsequent transfections were done with identical quantities. Firefly luciferase transfections also included 100 ng of a Renilla luciferase construct (pRL-SV40; Promega, Madison, WI), which served as an internal control for analysis using the Dual-Reporter™ assay kit (Promega). Each transfection was done in triplicate, and each construct was retested in at least three separate assays. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer, and luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The parental GAL4 vector (pFA-CMV), without additional fusion sequence, served as a control value used to calculate induction. To obtain the values reported as “-fold induction,” all luciferase results were normalized as follows: the raw firefly luciferase value was divided by the internal Renilla luciferase value (pRL-SV40). Subsequently, all results were divided by the value obtained for the pFA-CMV vector control (averaged over triplicate samples), which expressed the GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone. The choice of pFR-luc as the reporter vector followed examination of a series of additional GAL4-responsive vectors with variant promoters and TATA boxes, including pWHGG (41Tansey W.P. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2756-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), M1, and M2 (42Keaveney M. Berkenstam A. Feigenbutz M. Vriend G. Stunnenberg H.G. Nature. 1993; 365: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These were the kind gift of Arnie J. Berk (UCLA). pFR-luc was selected, since it gave the highest GAL4 response to the human BRCA1-CTD in all cells tested (see Supplemental Fig. 1). MCF7 cells gave the highest values for the human BRCA1-CTD and were thus used for the initial comparison of CTD activity. GST Pull-down Assay—GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione affinity chromatography following expression in BL21 bacteria using standard methods. To identify BRCA1 binding proteins, nuclear extracts were prepared from several distinct mammalian cell lines. Cells were initially lysed in low salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 100 mm NaCl) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™ without EDTA; Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. The nuclei were then pelleted at 5000 rpm for 5 min and extracted in a high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 m NaCl) for 30 min, prior to dilution to a final NaCl concentration of 150 mm. 5 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with nuclear extract from 5 × 106 cells. Bound complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer before elution with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For some experiments, the bound proteins were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) prior to elution with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antisera to the 220-kDa subunit of RNA pol II: 8WG16 (QED Biosciences, San Diego, CA) or N-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Additional antisera to p220 included an antibody to phosphorylated heptad serine 5 (S5) (clone CTD4H8, Upstate Biotechnology) and an antibody to phosphorylated heptad serine 2 (S2) (H5; Covance, Inc., Princeton, NJ). BRCA1 from human cell extracts were identified with either Ab4 (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) or C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). BRCA1 from bovine cells was detected with C3F (39Krum S.A. Womack J.E. Lane T.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6032-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Antisera to FCP1 were generously provided by Dr. Michael E. Dahmus (University of California, Davis). GST fusions were detected with anti-GST (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitations—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. For some experiments, whole cell extracts were made using EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™ without EDTA; Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. Lysate was precleared with protein A or G beads, and proteins were incubated overnight with primary antibodies: RNA pol II p220 (N-20 or 8WG16), phospho-p220 (S5 or S2), or BRCA1 (either Ab4 or C-20). To remove phosphate from precipitated proteins, immunoprecipitated proteins were treated with CIP (New England Biolabs) prior to elution with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. To test for protein-DNA interactions, some immunoprecipitations were performed in the presence of 50 μm EtBr. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. DNA Damage—Randomly cycling HBL100 cells were treated with 4 μm adriamycin, 2 μm camptothecin, or 1 μm hydroxyurea. Alternatively, cells were exposed to the indicated dose of ionizing radiation (0.5–10 grays) using a137Cs source (Mark 1 irradiator; Shepherd and Associates, San Fernando, CA). Following treatments, cells were returned to a 5% CO2 incubator for 1 h, then lysed, and immune complexes were prepared as above. p220 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—To quantify the amount of p220 catalytic subunit present in various immunoprecipitates, immobilized substrate assays were developed. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal antisera to either p220 subunit of RNA pol II (N-20) or BRCA1 (C-20), and volumes were normalized to cell number. Equivalent volumes of normalized cell extract were then diluted in plating buffer (50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.5) and adsorbed to 96-well plates (EIA8 plates; Costar). Plates were washed, blocked (0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline), and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies to p220 catalytic subunit (8WG16). Bound monoclonal antibodies were detected by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce) followed by the addition of color-producing 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma). The reaction was stopped after 10 min with 10 mm (final) H2SO4, and the reaction product was read at 450 nm on a 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices). Values were used from dilutions that were within the linear range of the assay as established from a standard curve created with immunopurified p220. Run-off (C-tailed) Transcription Assays—The run-off transcription assay used was a modification of previously reported C-tail assay (43Kadesch T.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Tantin D. Kansal A. Carey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG (Highpoint, NC). The C-tailed oligonucleotide was a 65-mer (5′-ATTGGGTAAAGGAGAGTATTTGAGCGGAGGACAGTACTCCGGGTCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC-3′) that was annealed to a complementary 45-mer (5′-GACCCGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGCTCTTTTACTCTCCTTTACCCAAT-3′). The runoff template was created by annealing 50 pmol of each oligonucleotide in a 200-μl annealing mixture containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 m NaCl. Run-off transcription reactions contained 8.25 mm MgCl2, 250 μg of bovine serum albumin, 250 nm NTPs, 5 units of RNase inhibitor, 50 ng of poly(dI-dC), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 pmol of annealed oligonucleotides, and 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]CTP. Following the addition of test immunoprecipitations (containing nuclear extracts from equivalent numbers of cells), reactions (20 μl) were incubated for 40 min at 30 °C and then stopped with 50 μl of PK buffer (300 mm sodium acetate, 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 100 ng of tRNA, and 10 μg of proteinase K). Transcription reactions were then incubated at 55 °C for 20 min, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and ethanol-precipitated. Single-stranded RNA transcripts were resolved under denaturing conditions on 12% polyacrylamide/urea gels, electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 300 V, dried, and visualized by autoradiography on x-ray film, as described (43Kadesch T.R.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Dried gels were also exposed to PhosphorImager plates, and the signals were quantified on a Storm™ PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The CTD of Mouse BRCA1 Lacks One-hybrid Transcriptional Activation Activity, and the Limited Activity Associated with CTDs from Human, Dog, and Cow BRCA1 Correlate in Part with Their Respective Charge—To determine whether classic one-hybrid activation activity is a conserved feature of BRCA1, we created a panel of GAL4 fusion proteins with BRCA1-CTDs from humans, mice, cows, and dogs. This panel is informative, since mouse and human BRCA1 genes share only 60% amino acid identity (40Lane T.F. Deng C. Elson A. Lyu M.S. Kozak C.A. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2712-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), whereas cow and dog BRCA1 are ∼80% identical to each other and to both mouse and human proteins (39Krum S.A. Womack J.E. Lane T.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6032-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Initially, regions homologous to amino acids 1380–1863 of human BRCA1 were tested in the MCF7 one-hybrid assay (Figs. 1C and 2A), since this region had been shown to be the most active in previous reports (16Hu Y.F.

GAL4-UAS transcriptional activation activity of full-length BRCA1 proteins and various size fragments of BRCA1 proteins were compared in human 293T, T47D, and MCF-7 cells. The following constructs were analyzed: full-length human BRCA1 (amino acids 1–1863), human BRCA1 CTD (amino acids 1380–1863), two tumor-associated truncating mutations (BRCA1–1853term (amino acids 1380–1852) and BRCA1–5382insC (amino acids 1380–1755)), and three additional fragments of the human BRCA1 CTD (A); full-length mouse BRCA1 (amino acids 1–1813), the mouse CTD (amino acids 1334–1813), the naturally occurring Δ11 splice variant (amino acids Δ223–1328), and four additional fragments of mouse BRCA1 (B); full-length cow BRCA1 (amino acids 1–1849) and the cow CTD (amino acids 1364–1849) (C); the dog CTD (amino acids 1380–1879) (D).

https://openalex.org/W2106783969,"We describe a novel cytokine receptor named GP130 Like receptor, or GPL, that displays similarities with the interleukin-6 and interleukin-12 family of signaling receptors. Four different isoforms diverging in their carboxyl terminus were isolated, corresponding to proteins encompassing 560, 610, 626, and 745 amino acids. Sequences included a signal peptide of 32 amino acids, followed by a cytokine binding domain containing four conserved cysteines, a WSDWS motif, and a region consisting of three fibronectin type III domain repeats. No immunoglobulin-like module was identified in the GPL sequences. The intracellular part of longer isoforms contained a proline-rich region defining a box1 motif for interaction with the Janus kinases. The Gpl gene is organized in 15 exons and is located on 5q11.2 in tandem with the gp130 gene. Both genes were only separated by 24 kilobases, with opposite transcriptional orientations. The GPL receptor displayed a 28% identity with gp130. Specific GPL transcripts were observed in tissues involved in reproduction. Transcripts were also found in blood cells and in bone marrow, revealing expression of GPL in all of the myelomonocytic lineage, from hematopoietic stem cells to activated dendritic cells. In monocytes and dendritic cells, expression of GPL was strongly up-regulated by interferon-γ, indicating a possible involvement of GPL in Th1-type immune responses. The molecular basis of cell signaling mediated by GPL was studied using chimeric receptors where external portions of α or β interleukin-5 receptor subunits were fused to the internal portion of GPL or of related receptors. Results indicated that association of GPL to the intracellular portions of gp130, or LIF receptor, allowed the signaling cascade.

Cytokine receptors associate to define functional multimeric membrane receptor complexes, which are recognized and activated by their cognate ligand(s) (1.Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Usually two large size transmembrane subunits are required to allow dimerization and downstream signaling events in response to a cytokine (2.Grotzinger J. Biochim. Biophys.

Numerous receptor components are shared to elaborate different high-affinity receptor complexes. The shared use of receptor subunits was retained to classify and analyze the biological functions of cytokines. On the basis of this notion, IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 were gathered to define the cytokine family sharing the “γ chain” in the formation of their functional receptors (3.Boulay J.L.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Similarly, additional gatherings of cytokines were defined based on their common use of βc (IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor) (5.Miyajima A. Mui A.L. Ogorochi T. Sakamaki K. Blood. 1993; 82: 1960-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IL-4R (IL-4 and IL-13) (6.Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G.

The latest family of cytokines is known as the IL-6 family of cytokines and encompasses, besides IL-6, the viral IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 and cardiotrophin-like cytokine. All share the common gp130 signaling receptor in their multimeric receptors (11.Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Depending on the identity of the activating ligand, gp130 can either homodimerize in the presence of IL-6 or IL-11 (12.Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakagawa T. Yasukawa K. Yamanishi K. Taga T.

OSM can also activate a specific receptor implicating OSM receptor (OSMR) (20.Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol.

For some of these receptor complexes, a third additional α component leading to an increased specificity and affinity is required to generate fully functional receptors. This is the case for IL-6 receptor α, IL-11 receptor α, and CNTF receptor α (21.Hilton D.J. Hilton A.A. Raicevic A. Rakar S. Harrison-Smith M. Gough N.M. Begley C.G. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A.

In the present report, we describe a novel cytokine receptor displaying similarities with gp130 signaling receptor we previously presented in a meeting (23.Lelievre E. Diveu C. Perret D. Froger J. Wesa A. Preisser L. Chevalier S. Chabbert M. Galy A. Morel A. Gascan H. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22 (S-91): P-1-3Google Scholar). A related receptor was described recently, but the reported sequence was incomplete, thus preventing expression of the corresponding protein (24.Ghilardi N. Li J. Hongo J.A. Yi S. Gurney A. de Sauvage F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16831-16836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This receptor we named GPL, for GP130 Like receptor, which displayed some homologies with LIFR, OSMR, and the IL-12 receptor family members. Interestingly, analysis in the invertebrates of the cytokine receptor, Dome, indicates that GPL is the closest equivalent in the human genome. In addition, we show that GPL can associate to the intracellular parts of gp130 or of LIFR to generate a functional response. Cells and Reagents—The cell lines used in the study were from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were grown routinely in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and appropriate cytokine when required. Human T-cell clones were kindly provided by Dr. Jean-Claude Lecron from Poitiers University. Mononuclear cells and cell subsets were isolated from bone marrow using immunomagnetic cell sorting (AutoMacs cell sorter, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and flow cytometry cell sorting (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Reanalysis of the sorted populations indicated a purity >95%. Dendritic cell cultures were carried out as described previously in detail (25.Ferlazzo G. Wesa A. Wei W.Z. Galy A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3597-3604PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Wesa A.K. Galy A. Int.Immunol. 2001; 13: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, dendritic cells were generated from adherent monocytes and cultured with granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor and IL-4 before activation with IFN-γ (10 ng/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), IL-1β (10 ng/ml), CD40 ligand (CD40L) (1 μg/ml), or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (25 ng/ml). CD34+ cells were isolated from mobilized peripheral blood and cultured with a cytokine mix as described previously to generate dendritic cells. The anti-GPL polyclonal antibody was raised by immunizing rabbits with a 15-mer peptide (CSFFLPRITIPDNYT) chosen in the AB loop of the receptor. The immunoglobulin fraction was purified by caprilic acid precipitation. Gene Analysis—The amino acid sequence of human gp130 was used to screen the public High-Throughput Genome Sequence database using BLAST (27.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Overlapping fragments were ordered, and the resulting gene candidate was analyzed by GENSCAN (29.Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar). The signal peptide was identified by SignalP (30.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar), and the transmembrane domain was identified by TMHMM (31.Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar) by using the bioweb.pasteur.fr server. Determination of the N-glycosylation site occupation was carried out using NetNGlyc 1.0 Prediction site 2www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/. (32.Gupta R. Brunak S. Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 2002; : 310-322PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence alignment of the most similar receptors was made using ClustalW (33.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) and manually refined. The alignment of the cytokine binding domain (CBD) and the three fibronectin III (FnIII) domains of each sequence was used to draw a phylogenetic tree using the Phylip package (34.Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). A distance matrix was built with the program PROTDIST (35.Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used to build the tree using NEIGHBOR (36.Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) with the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean) algorithm (37.Michener C.D. Sokal R.R.

Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence and structure of Dome was analyzed using Motifscan 4www.hits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/PFSCAN. (39.Pagni M. Iseli C. Junier T. Falquet L. Jongeneel V. Bucher P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), T-coffee (40.Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol.

The identity and similarity rates were computed using GeneDoc (41.Nicholas K.B. Nicholas H.B.J. Deerfield D.W. EMBnet. News. 1997; 4: 1-4Google Scholar). Cloning and Expression of GPL—Total RNA was isolated from the U937 myelomonocytic and the GO-G-UVM glioblastoma cell lines with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 2 μgof RNA by random hexamer priming using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In accordance with the in silico screening and to exclude any genomic amplification, PCR primers located in two different exons were designed (forward primer gttttgggcatcaaacgaat and reverse primer ggctccagtcactccagaac). The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and independent clones were sequenced (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). The obtained sequence was used to design primers for both 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE. RACE was performed with SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both strands of 5′- and 3′-RACE amplification were cloned into pGEM-T vector and were then sequenced (Beckman Coulter Inc.). To obtain a GPL full-length cDNA, another pair of primers was designed, and amplification was made using a proofreading Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The full-length cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). COS-7 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method or by using the Exgen reagent (Euromedex, Mundolsheim, France). After a 72-h culture period, expression and function of recombinant proteins were studied. Detection of GPL mRNA by RT-PCR and Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the indicated sources using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNAs were synthesized from 2 μg of RNA by random hexamer priming using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was subsequently amplified by 35 cycles of PCR using the following primers: forward gttttgggcatcaaacgaat and reverse ggctccagtcactccagaac for GPL, forward gaaggtgaaggtcggagtc and reverse gaagatggtgatgggatttc for GAPDH. The primers for GPL were designed in exons 5 and 6 to prevent any genomic DNA amplification. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Quantitative PCR was performed and analyzed on a capillary real-time thermocycler (Light-Cycler, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Amplification was done in the presence of SYBR Green I as follows: in 10 μl of final volume, cDNA was mixed with LightCycler-Fastart DNA Master SYBR Green (Roche Diagnostics), 5 nm forward primer and 5 nm reverse primer, and 4 mm MgCl2. Glass capillaries were placed into the Light-Cycler rotor, and the following run protocol was used: a denaturing step at 95 °C for 10 min, then an amplification and quantification program repeated for 40 cycles: 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 11 s, and 72 °C for 22 s. At the end of elongation at each cycle, SYBR Green I fluorescence was measured. Data analysis was essentially performed as indicated by Roche using “Fit Point Method” in the LightCycler software 3.3 (Roche Diagnostics). Relative quantification was made against serial dilution of GAPDH cDNA used as a housekeeping gene. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blots were performed using a cDNA probe encoding for the extracellular portion of GPL or a GAPDH cDNA probe. Total RNAs were extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridizations were carried out in the presence of Quikhyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described by the supplier. Construction of IL-5 Receptor/GPL Chimera—pSVLhuIL-5Rα/hugp130 (α130), pSVLhuIL-5Rβ/hugp130 (β130), and pSVLhuIL-5Rβ/huLIFR (βLR) plasmids encoding the external portions of IL-5 α or β receptors fused to the internal parts of gp130 or LIFR were kindly provided by Dr. P. Heinrich (Aachen, Germany) (42.Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the gp130 transmembrane and cytoplasmic part was exchanged with the corresponding sequence of the GPL (pSVLhuIL-5Rα/huGPL (αGPL), pSVLhuIL-5Rβ/huGPL (βGPL)) using PCR with oligonucleotides CGGAATTCAAGACATTGTCATTCAG (sense) and CGGGATCCAAGCTTTGTTTAGACTTCTCC (antisense). Recombinant plasmids were sequenced (Beckman Coulter Inc.). Underlined letters indicate EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites used for ligation into the pSVL vectors encoding the extracellular domains of IL-5Rβ or of IL-5Rα. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, proteinase inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 1% DOC or Brij 96, depending on the experiments. After a centrifugation step to remove cell debris, samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto an Immobilon membrane. The membranes were subsequently incubated overnight with 0.2 μg/ml polyclonal anti-GPL antibody, an anti-phospho-STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or an anti-STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) before being incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody labeled with peroxidase for 60 min. The reaction was visualized on an x-ray film using the ECL reagent (Amersham, Les Ullis, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Endoglycosidase Treatment—5 × 104 transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, proteinase inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 1% Brij 96. Cell lysates were next treated with 25 units/ml of N-glycosidase-F (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 12 h at 37 °C before GPL Western blot analysis. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—COS-7 kidney cell transfections were carried out in 24-well culture plates using the Exgen transfection reagent. Cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA and 150 ng of SIEM-Luc reporter gene. This construct contains three consensus binding sites located upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter (43.Lelievre E. Plun-Favreau H. Chevalier S. Froger J. Guillet C. Elson G.C. Gauchat J.F. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22476-22484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Seventy-two h after transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight and then incubated with medium alone or with the indicated cytokine for the next 7 h. Cells were PBS washed, and 75 μl of lysis buffer was added to the wells (0.1 m KHPO4, pH 7.8, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 20 min at 4 °C. Extracts were then used to measure the luciferase activity using a Packard Topcount luminometer (Meriden, CT). Identification of GPL Receptor—Gp130 cDNA sequence was used to screen the human genomic National Center for Biotechnology Information database, and a novel cytokine receptor-encoding sequence was located on chromosome 5 in the vicinity of gp130 (23.Lelievre E. Diveu C. Perret D. Froger J. Wesa A. Preisser L. Chevalier S. Chabbert M. Galy A. Morel A. Gascan H. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22 (S-91): P-1-3Google Scholar). PCR primers located in two different putative exons were designed and used to identify cell lines expressing a corresponding mRNA. Encoding cDNAs were independently isolated from the U937 myelomonocytic and the GO-G-UVM glioblastoma cell lines by RACE PCR. According to its homology to gp130, this novel cytokine receptor was named GPL. Four cDNA clones diverging in their carboxyl terminus were isolated (Fig. 1). The sequences included a potential hydrophobic signal peptide of 33 amino acids, followed by a CBD containing four conserved cysteine residues in fixed positions, a WSDWS motif, and then a region consisting of three FnIII domain repeats (44.Bazan J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 788-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 45.Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). GPL receptor contained a stretch of 28 hydrophobic amino acids aligning with the transmembrane domain of neighboring cytokine receptors. In the four isolated sequences, the predicted carboxyl-terminal sequences were identical throughout the transmembrane domain until Asn560. Beyond this point, cDNAs predict proteins with differing cytoplasmic portions, leading to a shorter receptor containing 560 residues and corresponding to the first 13 exons of the gene (Fig. 2B). The three remaining forms displayed alternative 3′ ends in the fifteenth exon and led to 610, 626, and 745 amino acid proteins. A truncated sequence encoding for a soluble form of receptor containing 509 amino acids was also recorded before by another group as CRL3 (access number AF106913-1).Fig. 2Organization of the GPL745 gene on human chromosome 5.A, face-to-face arrangement of the gpl and gp130 human genes. B, exon and intron distribution of the gpl gene on human chromosome 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thirteen N-glycosylation sites were predicted as potentially occupied in GPL745 according to the NetNglyc 1.0 prediction. This was confirmed by an enzymatic treatment of the protein as presented below in the report (Fig. 9C). Examination of the cytoplasmic domain of GPL610, GPL626, and GPL745 isoforms shows an intracellular motif surrounding Pro568, Pro571, and Pro573 that defined a membrane-proximal box 1 motif, important for its association with the Janus protein kinase (Jak) (46.Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1993; 74: 587-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Gpl and gp130 genes were both localized on human 5q11.2 and were only distant from each other by 24 kilobases, with opposite transcriptional orientations (Fig. 2A). The computerpredicted exon organization using GENSCAN (29.Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar) revealed that the gpl gene contained 15 exons (Fig. 2B). The first 12 exons encode the extracellular region. The transmembrane region is encoded by exon 13. The last 2 exons contain the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor including the box 1 motif required to associate the Jaks. The general intron/exon organization of the gpl gene is very similar to that of gp130 (47.Kidd V.J. Nesbitt J.E. Fuller G.M. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting a gene duplication event. Computer analysis revealed that GPL protein displayed consistent homologies with IL-6 and IL-12 cytokine families of receptors as well as with the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (Figs. 3 and 4) (8.Chua A.O.

The nearest identified human protein was gp130, displaying a 28% identity rate with the GPL receptor (Figs. 3 and 4A). This was further sustained by building an evolutionary dendrogram, indicating that GPL and gp130 were the closest neighbors (Fig. 4B). Analysis of GPL module organization underlined some structural similarities between this receptor and the common β1 chain for IL-12/IL-23 as well as with the IL-27R (Fig. 4C). Similarly to that reported for the IL-12Rβ1 and IL-27R chains, no conventional STAT binding box could be identified in the GPL sequence (Figs. 1 and 4C) (8.Chua A.O. Chizzonite R. Desai B.B.

https://openalex.org/W2068401663,"By screening patients with severe early onset obesity for mutations within the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene, we have identified a missense mutation (C271R) that occurs homozygous in two siblings with obesity. In-depth functional characterization of C271R revealed a right-shifted concentration response curve due to lower affinity to natural and synthetic MC4R agonists and a reduced cell surface expression. Cys-271 is located in the third extracellular loop. Here, we provide evidence that Cys-271 forms an intra-loop disulfide bond with Cys-277. Unexpectedly, we found that loss of receptor function is not only caused by the disruption of this disulfide bridge. Our data strongly support a new mechanism in which the receptor malfunction in the C271R mutant is induced by formation of a functionally disastrous disulfide bridge between Cys-277 and a third Cys residue at position 279. Mutational and chemical disruption of this improper disulfide bond was able to restore normal receptor potency. By demonstrating that a loss of a disulfide bond-participating Cys residue can favor a functionally disastrous disulfide bond, we now add a new mechanism of how Cys residues can be involved in G-protein-coupled receptor malfunction.

Within the last few years, the knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of obesity is increasing rapidly. Mutations in genes mostly involved in the leptin-melanocortin pathway were identified in a rare case of extreme obesity (1.Montague C.T. Farooqi I.S. Whitehead J.P. Soos M.A. Rau H. Wareham N.J.

Mutations in GPCR genes are responsible for an increasing number of human diseases including an inherited form of obesity, which is caused by inactivating mutations in the melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R) (5.Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Gudermann T. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 143-227PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 3–5% of early onset obese children studied so far contain mutations in the MC4R (6.Vaisse C. Clement K. Durand E. Hercberg S. Guy-Grand B. Froguel P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 7.Farooqi I.S. Keogh J.M. Yeo G.S. Lank E.J. Cheetham T. O'Rahilly S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). In contrast to inactivating mutations in other obesity-related genes that are inherited recessively, mutations in MC4R are often diagnosed in the heterozygous state. To date, only two homozygous MC4R mutations were reported, resulting in a complete or a partial loss of receptor function (7.Farooqi I.S. Keogh J.M. Yeo G.S. Lank E.J. Cheetham T. O'Rahilly S. N.

The MC4R is activated by the pro-opiomelanocortin-derived peptides α-MSH and β-MSH. At the molecular level, MC4R stimulation increases intracellular cAMP via Gs/adenylyl cyclase activation (9.Gantz I. Miwa H. Konda Y. Shimoto Y. Tashiro T. Watson S.J. Del-Valle J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15174-15179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), finally resulting in a reduction of food intake and an increase in energy expenditure with the consequence of body weight reduction (10.Fisher S.L. Yagaloff K.A. Burn P. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord. 1999; 23: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Herein, we describe the identification of a homozygous mutation in the MC4R in siblings with severe early onset obesity. The mutation C271R was located in the third extracellular loop (EL3). Functional characterization revealed a partial loss-of-function. Cys residues in EL3 are highly conserved among melanocortin receptors. Extracellular Cys residues often participate in disulfide bond formation. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of this inactivating mutation, the functional relevance of Cys-271 was further characterized by systematic site-directed mutagenesis. By introduction of an additional Cys residue (e.g. P272C) into EL3, we were able to rescue the function of C271R. These data strongly support a participation of Cys-271 in a disulfide bond. In an attempt to identify the partner in disulfide bridge formation, the conserved Cys-40 (N terminus) and Cys-196 (EL2/transmembrane domain 5 junction) were excluded. Two other possible disulfide bond partners for Cys-271 (Cys-277 and Cys-279) are located in EL3. Mutagenesis studies and functional characterization of various mutants revealed that Cys-277 is most probably the disulfide partner of Cys-271. In case of C271R, an improper disulfide bond is formed between Cys-277 and Cys-279, which interferes with efficient cell surface expression and ligand binding. Our data clearly indicate that intramolecular disulfide bonds can occur within a single loop of a GPCR. Disruption of this intra-loop bridge gives rise to an alternative intra-loop disulfide bond, which induces a functionally disastrous receptor folding defect. This new findings extends our knowledge of mechanism of clinically relevant GPCR malfunction and may provide starting points for novel therapeutic approaches in curing such diseases. Mutation Detection and Construction of Wild-type and Mutant Receptors—Genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral white blood cells using a commercial kit (Blood amp kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The entire coding region of the MC4R gene was amplified in one fragment using the following primers: forward 5′-TGA GAC GAC TCC CTG ACC CAG G-3′ and reverse 5′-CCT ACA CGG AAG AGA AAG ATG-3′ and sequenced in three overlapping fragments using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and an automatic sequencer (ABI 373, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The wild-type MC4R was amplified from a healthy control and cloned in the pcDps expression vector. Genetic analyses were conducted in accordance with the guidelines proposed in the Declaration of Helsinki, and informed consent was obtained from all family members. Mutant MC4R were generated using standard mutagenesis techniques and the WT MC4R-pcDps as template. PCR fragments containing the various mutations were cloned into the EcoRI/Bsu36I or EcoRI/SpeI sites of the MC4R-pcDps vector. For receptor quantification in cell surface ELISA studies, an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tag was inserted. The correctness of all of the PCR-derived sequences were proven by automatic sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Functional Characterization—Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. COS-7 cells were seeded into 12-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) for investigation of agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation and transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA/well using the LipofectAMINE Plus method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Labeling with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine (31.7 Ci/mmol, Pharmacia) was performed after 48 h. One day later, cAMP accumulation assays were performed. Cells were washed once and incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) in the absence or in increasing amount of agonist NDP-α-MSH (Sigma), α-MSH, and β-MSH (kindly provided by Dr. P. Henklein) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by aspiration of medium, and intracellular cAMP was released by the incubation of 1 ml of 5% tricloric acid, which was measured by anion-exchange chromatography as described previously (11.Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3367) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP accumulation data were analyzed by the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Radioligand Binding Assay and ELISA for Measurement of the Cell Surface Expression—For cell surface binding studies, cells (2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA/dish and LipofectAMINE Plus. One day later, cells were trypsinized and seeded in 48-well plates. 48 h later, cells were incubated overnight in the presence of 125I-NDP-α-MSH (specific activity 2000 Ci/mmol, 120,000 cpm/well, Amersham Biosciences) with increasing amounts of agonist NDP-α-MSH. After washing, specifically bound NDP-α-MSH was measured. Bmax values were calculated from displacement curves by the method of Cheng and Prusoff (12.Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12131) Google Scholar). To investigate cell surface expression, WT and mutants receptors were N-terminally HA-tagged and cell surface ELISAs were performed. Cells (5 × 104/well) were seeded in 48-well plates and transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus. Three days later, cells were washed, paraformaldehyde-fixated, and probed with a biotin-labeled anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science). Bound anti-HA antibody was detected by peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and a substrate/chromogen reaction (13.Schulz A. Grosse R. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Schöneberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2381-2389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Identification of MC4R-C271R and Functional Characterization—By screening for MC4R mutations in early onset obese children, we identified a homozygous MC4R mutation, C271R, located in EL3 of the MC4R. The mutation was found in two extremely obese and hyperphagic siblings. All other family members investigated were heterozygous for C271R, presenting the phenotype of obese females and normal weight males (Fig. 1). For functional characterization, the C271R mutation was introduced in an eucaryotic expression vector containing the cDNA of the MC4R (MC4R-pcDps). WT and mutant receptors were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and characterized in cAMP accumulation assays, radioligand binding studies, and cell surface ELISA studies. As shown in Fig. 2A and Table I, stimulation of the WT MC4R with the superpotent and enzymatically resistant α-MSH analog NDP-α-MSH resulted in a robust increase in cAMP levels with an Emax value of 11.3-fold over basal and an EC50 value of 0.5 nm. In contrast, C271R displayed a reduced efficiency (Emax = 71.9% of the WT) and an ∼18-fold decreased potency (Table I). 125I-NDP-α-MSH binding experiments were performed. Ki values were determined by displacing increasing concentrations of non-labeled NDP-α-MSH, yielding a Ki value of 5.7 nm for the WT MC4R (Fig. 2B). Despite of the detection of some specific binding sites, all attempts failed to exactly determine the Ki value of C271R (even at the maximal possible concentrations of 125I-NDP-α-MSH), probably because of the combination of low receptor expression and a reduced 125I-NDP-α-MSH affinity. To circumvent this problem, we established an indirect cell surface ELISA for determination of cell surface expression independently from receptor binding abilities. In concert with the results of cAMP and radioligand binding studies, C271R showed significantly reduced cell surface expression levels (40.7 ± 2.9%) when compared with the WT-MC4R (data not shown).Table IFunctional characterization of WT and mutant MC4RsConstructcAMP accumulation[125I-NDP]-α-MSHbasalEmax/EmaxWTEC50BmaxKicpm/well%nm% WT-MC4RnmWT MC4R289 ± 931000.5 ± 0.21005.7 ± 0.9C271R195 ± 4971.5 ± 20.88.8 ± 2.17.6 ± 6.0*C40R325 ± 68118.6 ± 33.30.8 ± 0.387.6 ± 22.98.4 ± 0.7C40R/C271R168 ± 2751.6 ± 14.15.9 ± 2.85.3 ± 5.4*C196R160 ± 3342.2 ± 17.6200 ± 1301.9 ± 0.6*C196R/C271R212 ± 316.3 ± 8.5*1.0 ± 0.4*C277A236 ± 5165.9 ± 8.10.5 ± 0.32.9 ± 0.1*C271R/C277A300 ± 10679 ± 140.4 ± 0.229.0 ± 10.74.4 ± 1.9C279A252 ± 13694.0 ± 16.00.8 ± 0.5144.7 ± 9.812.4 ± 2.4C271R/C279A378 ± 14047 ± 90.3 ± 0.023.5 ± 0.9*C277A/C279A304 ± 6569.4 ± 15.00.3 ± 0.123.2 ± 12.92.4 ± 0.9S270C281 ± 17186.3 ± 25.20.7 ± 0.03116.2 ± 21.34.6 ± 3.0S270C/C271R219 ± 6236.6 ± 6.32.0 ± 0.51.6 ± 0.1*P272C185 ± 4396.2 ± 37.50.3 ± 0.232.2 ± 11.13.4 ± 1.5P272C/C271R234 ± 4770.0 ± 21.10.6 ± 0.488.8 ± 10.74.1 ± 3.5Q273C265 ± 133109.3 ± 13.40.2 ± 0.191.2 ± 2.44.3 ± 1.7Q273C/C271R207 ± 5081.17 ± 12.31.0 ± 0.33.8 ± 0.9*N274C307 ± 14184 ± 20.4 ± 0.333.1 ± 12.42.2 ± 1.1N274C/C271R254 ± 8187.4 ± 20.90.4 ± 0.210.8 ± 8.8*P275C439 ± 184127.7 ± 28.90.8 ± 0.566.9 ± 28.96.1 ± 0.4P275C/C271R201 ± 3648.65 ± 20.79.5 ± 6.71.9 ± 0.6* Open table in a new tab Search for a Putative Partner of Cys-271 for Disulfide Bridge Formation—Cys residue in extracellular loops often participates in intramolecular disulfide bond formation, and mutations of these Cys residues are often found in patients with diseases caused by inactivating mutations in GPCRs (5.Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Gudermann T. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 143-227PubMed Google Scholar). In melanocortin receptors, four extracellularly located Cys residues including Cys-271 are highly conserved among subtypes and species (Fig. 3). It should be noted that melanocortin receptors do not process the highly conserved Cys residue pair, connecting EL1 and EL2 in most GPCRs of family 1. Because all of the melanocortin receptors cloned so far contain a Cys residue in their N termini in close proximity to TM1, we addressed this putative interaction partner for Cys-271 by site-directed mutagenesis. Assuming a disulfide bond between Cys-40 and Cys-271, we speculated that the mutation of Cys-40 should present the same functional phenotype as observed for C271R. Therefore, we created C40R according to the patient's mutation. Substitution of Cys-40 to Arg affected neither the agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation nor binding properties (see Table I and Fig. 4A). To exclude the possibility that Cys-40 is somehow involved in the molecular mechanism of C271R dysfunction, the double mutant (C40R/C271R) was tested in functional assays. Our data clearly indicate that the substitution of Cys-40 did not significantly affect WT and C271R function (see Table I). As a next putative disulfide bridge-forming candidate, the Cys-196 residue at the EL2/TMD5 transition was targeted by site-directed mutagenesis. According to Cys-40, C196R and a double mutant C196R/C271R were generated and functionally investigated. Substitution of Cys-196 by Arg almost completely abolished receptor function as reflected by a ∼400-fold increase of EC50 value and an extreme reduced cell surface expression (see Table I). The double mutant C196R/C271R was completely inactive (see Table I). At this point, Cys-196 could be considered as a potential candidate for disulfide bond formation with Cys-271. To complete the systematic search for disulfide bond partners, we focused on two Cys residues located in the EL3. It was recently shown that in the MC1R Cys-265 (corresponding to Cys-271 in MC4R) and Cys-273 (corresponding to Cys-279 in MC4R) form a disulfide bridge within the EL3 (14.Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47662-47670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similarly, we mutated Cys-279 to Ala and tested C279A in COS-7 cells. In contrast to the MC1R, substitution of Cys-279 had no effect on MC4R function (Fig. 4A and Table I). C279A was introduced next into C271R, resulting in the double mutant C271R/C279A. Surprisingly, the introduction of C279A partially rescued the function of C271R but cell surface expression was reduced. For control purposes, we replaced the second Cys residue at position 277 with Ala. Cell surface expression was dramatically reduced, whereas EC50 value was unchanged compared with the WT MC4R (see Fig. 4A and Table I). Strikingly, the introduction of C277A into C271R (C271R/C277A) resulted in a partial reconstitution of receptor function similarly to C271R/C279A (see Table I). Functional Rescue of C271R Dysfunction by Introduction of an Additional Cys Residue—We next tested the functional consequence of additional Cys residues introduced into EL3 of the WT MC4R and C271R. Thus, residues in close proximity to position 271 were mutated, yielding the mutant MC4Rs S270C, P272C, Q273C, N274C, and P275C and the corresponding double mutants S270C/C271R, C271R/P272C, C271R/Q273C, C271R/N274C, and C271R/P275C. All of the mutants were tested in cAMP accumulation assays and ligand binding and ELISA studies. Introduction of an additional Cys residue at five different positions into EL3 had no significant impact on functional properties of the WT receptor (see Table I). However, an additional Cys residue at position 272 (P272C) can fully restore the signaling and binding abilities of C271R. Similarly, the double mutants S270C/C271R, C271R/Q273C, and C271R/N274C regained normal signal transduction abilities but displayed reduced cell surface expression level (Table I). EL3 Is Involved in Binding the Natural MC4R Agonists α-MSH and β-MSH—Most functional studies on MC4R are performed with NDP-α-MSH because of its higher potency and stability compared with the natural ligand α-MSH and β-MSH. To evaluate the impact of the C271R mutation on the functional properties of both natural agonists, the EC50 and Emax values of α-MSH and β-MSH were determined. As shown in Table II, α-MSH is more potent on the WT MC4R when compared with β-MSH. The introduction of C271R resulted in a more pronounced right-shifted concentration response for both agonists curve when compared with NDP-α-MSH (∼50- versus ∼18-fold, respectively). C277A and C279A were tested next for functional relevance and their ability to rescue the phenotype of C271R. In contrast to the NDP-α-MSH studies, the mutation of Cys-277 to Ala interfered significantly with the signal transduction abilities of both agonists, whereas the C279A had no influence on receptor function (Table II). However, both mutations were able to partially rescue the malfunction of C271R.Table IIPotency and efficacy of natural agonists on WT and mutant MC4RscAMP accumulationConstructα-MSHβ-MSHEmax/EmaxWTEC50Emax/EmaxWTEC50%nm%nmMC4R WT1003.9 ± 2.810026.1 ± 8.7C271R48 ± 3209 ± 522.5 ± 4.51174 ± 648C277A101 ± 2.514.8 ± 780 ± 1986 ± 7.5C271R/C277A95 ± 7.578 ± 4072 ± 3263 ± 86C279A97 ± 13.6 ± 2.398.5 ± 5.536.5 ± 3.5C271R/C279A45 ± 13145 ± 6339 ± 19390 ± 113C277A/C279A85.5 ± 2.521 ± 977 ± 3271 ± 25C271R/P272C84 ± 10232 ± 3753 ± 1200 ± 1.5 Open table in a new tab We have shown that introduction of an additional Cys (e.g. P272C) into C271R can fully restore NDP-α-MSH-induced receptor signaling (see above). To test whether this holds true also in case of the natural agonists, the double mutant C271R/P272C was characterized. Integration of additional cysteine residues did not (α-MSH) or only partially (β-MSH) partially rescued receptor function (Table II). Restoring the function of C271R by DTT—All of our previous experimental data suggested that C271R is somehow involved in disulfide bridge formation. The resulting malfunction can be rescued by either an introduction of an additional cysteine residue (P272C) or by destroying potential candidates for an improperly formed disulfide bond (C277A, C279A). We addressed the question of whether an improperly formed disulfide bond is involved in the molecular mechanism of C271R malfunction by application of a disulfide bond-reducing agent. Agonist stimulation of the WT receptor in the presence of 10 mm DTT resulted in a reduction of the Emax value without a severe alteration of the EC50 value. Incubation of C271R with 10 mm DTT restored the receptor function to the same level as observed for the WT receptor in the presence of 10 mm DTT (Fig. 4B). These findings further support a scenario in which the malfunction of C271R is caused by the formation of an improper disulfide bond rather than due to the loss of a disulfide bridge in the absence of Cys-271. Loss and Gain of Cys Residues Are Frequently Found as Molecular Basis of GPCR Inactivation—Mutational screening revealed a frequency of 3–5% mutations in the MC4R of severely early onset obese children (6.Vaisse C.

This position appears to be critical for MC4R function because C271Y and C271R have been found recently in two other obese families (7.Farooqi I.S. Keogh J.M. Yeo G.S. Lank E.J. Cheetham T. O'Rahilly S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Mutationally, the introduction as wells as the loss of Cys residues are often found in patients with GPCR-related diseases. It has been extensively shown that posttranslational formation of one or more extracellular disulfide bonds is essential for receptor trafficking and high affinity ligand binding (5.Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Gudermann T. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 144: 143-227PubMed Google Scholar). Disease-causing mutations of the highly conserved disulfide bonds connecting EL1 and EL2 have been identified in the AVPR2 (20.Bichet D.G. Birnbaumer M. Lonergan M. Arthus M.F. Rosenthal W.

Genet. 1994; 3: 1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In principle, mutational disruption of this disulfide bond results in a loss of high affinity binding, suggesting a pivotal role of EL1- and EL2-connecting disulfide bridges for proper receptor assembly. On the other hand, many of the mutations in the loops found in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and retinitis pigmentosa are characterized by substitutions of various amino acid residues to Cys residues (23.Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Biebermann H. Grüters A. Grimm T. Hübschmann K. Filler G. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 12: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of additional Cys residues within extracellular loops is more complex. The presence of an extra Cys residue caused by mutations may offer alternatives in disulfide bond formation between EL1 and EL2. A recent study by Schülein et al. (24.Schülein R. Zühlke K. Krause G. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8384-8392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) provided an additional explanation for the mechanism of AVPR2 dysfunction caused by Cys substitutions. It was shown that additional Cys mutations in EL2 of the AVPR2 (G185C, R202C) probably form a new disulfide bond with a free Cys (Cys-195) residue also located in EL2 residue interfering with high affinity binding. Mutation of this endogenous Cys residue (C195A) could rescue the function of G185C and R202C. Such a mechanism may also account for Cys mutations in rhodopsin, leading to an uneven number of Cys residues in the extracellular loops (24.Schülein R. Zühlke K. Krause G. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8384-8392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similarly, in MC1R, MC2R, and MC4R both types, the loss and introduction of Cys residues have been identified as the cause of the disease (7.Farooqi I.S. Keogh J.M. Yeo G.S. Lank E.J. Cheetham T. O'Rahilly S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 25.Naville D. Barjhoux L. Jaillard C. Faury D. Despert F. Esteva B. Durand P. Saez J.M. Begeot M. J.

Genet. 2001; 69: 774-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanism has not been determined yet. An Intra-loop Disulfide Bond Is Formed between Cys-271 and Cys-277—Understanding the molecular mechanisms of mutationally induced receptor dysfunction is a major task in the development of new receptor ligands and novel therapeutic strategies. Although the waste majority of over 40 mutations in the MC4R were functionally characterized and were shown to result in a loss of function, little knowledge exists regarding the detailed structure-function relationships of this receptor. To provide insights into the molecular mechanism of C271R, we first speculated that Cys-271 may participate in disulfide bridge formation and disruption of this disulfide bond is the cause of receptor malfunction. This assumption was supported by the fact that the mutation of Cys-271, independently from the nature of the substitution (Ala, Tyr, and Arg), resulted in a loss-of-function phenotype in MC4R and MC1R (see Table I) (6.Vaisse C. Clement K. Durand E. Hercberg S. Guy-Grand B. Froguel P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 14.Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47662-47670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Based on these data, it was reasonable to assume that mutation of the counterpart Cys residue may also result in a loss of receptor function. In an attempt to identify the disulfide bond partner for C271R by mutating putative candidates (Cys-40, Cys-196, Cys-277, Cys-279), only the C196R mutation at the EL2/TMD5 interface and the C277A in EL3 displayed an altered receptor function. Previous studies with the MC1R and the MC4R have already addressed the importance of Cys-196 (or Cys-189 in MC1R) and consistently found that mutation to Ala had only little effect on ligand binding and signal transduction (14.Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47662-47670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27.Yang Y.K. Fong T.M. Dickinson C.J. Mao C. Li J.Y. Tota M.R. Mosley R. van der Ploeg L.H. Gantz I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14900-14911Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Additionally, the MC2R contains a Thr residue at the corresponding position at the EL2/TMD5 transition (see Fig. 3B). These facts indicate that the loss of function found in C196R is more likely induced by a rather specific effect of the polar and bulky Arg substitution at position 196 and not by a general effect on disulfide bridge formation. However, in contrast to C196A, the signal transduction of C277A is strongly altered mainly in respect to their binding abilities and also to the potency of natural agonists (Table I and Table II). Our data favor Cys-277 as a potential interaction partner for Cys-271 (Fig. 5). This assumption is supported by the findings of the MC1R, which also suggest an intra-loop disulfide bond (14.Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47662-47670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It was speculated that this disulfide bond in the MC1R forms between Cys-265 and Cys-273 within EL3, which correspond with Cys-271 and Cys-279 in MC4R, respectively. These findings were based on the observation that the substitution of C265A and C273A in the MC1R resulted in a loss of α-MSH and Zn(II)-induced cAMP formation, whereas C271A resulted only in a loss of Zn(II) but not α-MSH-induced cAMP accumulation (14.Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47662-47670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast to findings in the MC1R, our mutagenesis experiments with the MC4R provide strong evidence for the existence of an intra-loop bond between Cys-271 and Cys-277 and exclude Cys-279 as a potential partner. Malfunction of C271R Is Caused by an Improperly Formed Disulfide Bond within the EL3—Because our data favor a scenario in which Cys-271 normally forms a disulfide bond with Cys-277, we asked the question whether the function of C271R can be restored by inserting an alternative Cys residue into C271R. Introduction of an extra Cys (P272C) in close proximity to position 271 almost completely rescued the function in C271R, indicating that an exact positioning of a Cys residue is not required for functional compensation of Cys-271. However, further N- or C-terminal movement of this Cys was not fully tolerated, reflecting a limited spatial freedom of such compensational Cys residue within EL3. These data strongly suggested at this point that the loss of a Cys residue in the C271R mutant, which contributes to an intra-loop disulfide bridge, mainly contributes to the loss of function found for the mutant MC4R. However, this mechanistic view changed, at least partially, at the point when doubled mutants C271R/C277A and C271R/C279A were tested. Strikingly, both double mutants regained potencies to NDP-α-MSH as found for the WT MC4R. Similarly, α-MSH and β-MSH potency increased after the introduction of C277A or C279A into C271R (see Tables I and II). Because there are no partners for disulfide bridge formation within EL3 in all of the double mutants, the relevance of an intro-loop disulfide bond for high affinity agonist binding of NDP-α-MSH is questionable. The functional relevance of an intra-loop disulfide bond is further challenged by the fact that a double mutant (C277A/C279A) in which both potential interaction partners for Cys-271 are mutated displays almost WT receptor signal transduction abilities. However, the intra-loop bond might be more important for proper receptor function for the natural agonists α- and β-MSH as shown by altered EC50 values (Tables I and II). Moreover, a proper EL3 structure based on an intra-loop bond might be crucial for MC4R trafficking because all of the double mutants (C271R/C277A, C271R/C279A, C277A/C279A) are partially retained in the cell interior. Since the loss of a disulfide bridge can not completely account for the loss-of function in C271R, what other mechanism may be the reason for this mutationally induced receptor inactivation? There are three Cys residues in the EL3 that are only able to form one disulfide bridge at the same time (Fig. 5A). In the WT MC4R, the bond forms probably between Cys-271 and Cys-277. In case of the C271R, there is still the chance of forming a disulfide bridge between Cys-277 and Cys-279 (see Fig. 5B). One may ask whether a disulfide bond can form between two Cys residues that are apart just by one residue in-between. There are several examples in which disulfide bridge forms naturally between two Cys in close proximity, e.g. disulfide bridge-forming Cys residues separated by two amino acid residues in DsbA (28.Martin J.L. Waksman G. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1097-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), tryparedoxin-I (29.Alphey M.S. Leonard G.A. Gourley D.G. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25613-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and Ccmg-reducing oxidoreductase (30.Fabianek R.A.

A disulfide bridge between Cys residues that are only one residue are apart is seldom but was found in the yeast oxidoreductase Erv2p (31.Gross E. Sevier C.S. Vala A. Kaiser C.A. Fass D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Clearly, bridging Cys-277 and Cys-279 is entropically not the preferred structure and may disturb the loop structure. We could demonstrate that Ala substitution of one of these Cys residues or chemical reduction of Cys bridges by DTT as well as introduction of an entropically preferred additional Cys residue (P272C) prevent the formation of this disastrous disulfide bond (see Fig. 5, C–E). Based on these data, we could demonstrate for the first time that a loss of a disulfide bond-participating Cys residue can favor a functionally disastrous disulfide bond, resulting in the loss of function of the receptor. These results add an additional mechanism of how Cys residues can be involved in GPCR malfunction. Taken together, our mutagenesis studies clearly provide evidence for a disulfide bond between Cys-271 and Cys-277. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that receptor malfunction in C271R is not the result of a mutational loss of this disulfide bond. A new disulfide bond within the EL3 probably leads to an improperly formed loop. These results may initiate the development of therapeutically relevant MC4R agonists, which can also activate mutant MC4R independently from the EL3 structure or specifically stabilizing EL3 in its natural conformation.

https://openalex.org/W2092153435,"The glycine-tyrosine-glycine (GYG) sequence in the p-loop of K+ channel subunits lines a narrow pore through which K+ ions pass in single file intercalated by water molecules. Mutation of the motif can give rise to non-selective channels, but it is clear that other structural features are also required for selectivity because, for instance, a recently identified class of cyclic nucleotidegated pacemaker channels has the GYG motif but are poorly K+ selective. We show that mutation of charged glutamate and arginine residues behind the selectivity filter in the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 K+ channel reduces or abolishes K+ selectivity, comparable with previously reported effects in the Kir2.1 K+ channel. It has been suggested that a salt bridge exists between the glutamate-arginine residue pair. Molecular modeling indicates that the salt bridge does exist, and that it acts as a “bowstring” to maintain the rigid bow-like structure of the selectivity filter and restrict selectivity to K+. The modeling shows that relaxation of the bowstring by mutation of the residue pair leads to enhanced flexibility of the p-loop, allowing permeation of other cations, including polyamines. In experiments, mutation of the residue pair can also abolish polyamine-induced inward rectification. The latter effect occurs because polyamines now permeate rather than block the channel, to the remarkable extent that large polyamine currents can be measured. The glycine-tyrosine-glycine (GYG) sequence in the p-loop of K+ channel subunits lines a narrow pore through which K+ ions pass in single file intercalated by water molecules. Mutation of the motif can give rise to non-selective channels, but it is clear that other structural features are also required for selectivity because, for instance, a recently identified class of cyclic nucleotidegated pacemaker channels has the GYG motif but are poorly K+ selective. We show that mutation of charged glutamate and arginine residues behind the selectivity filter in the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 K+ channel reduces or abolishes K+ selectivity, comparable with previously reported effects in the Kir2.1 K+ channel. It has been suggested that a salt bridge exists between the glutamate-arginine residue pair. Molecular modeling indicates that the salt bridge does exist, and that it acts as a “bowstring” to maintain the rigid bow-like structure of the selectivity filter and restrict selectivity to K+. The modeling shows that relaxation of the bowstring by mutation of the residue pair leads to enhanced flexibility of the p-loop, allowing permeation of other cations, including polyamines. In experiments, mutation of the residue pair can also abolish polyamine-induced inward rectification. The latter effect occurs because polyamines now permeate rather than block the channel, to the remarkable extent that large polyamine currents can be measured. How ion channels, particularly K+ channels, achieve high selectivity for one ion over a closely related one has been a mystery apparently solved with the crystallization of archetypal K+ channel pores (1.Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5646) Google Scholar, 2.Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). The sequence glycine-tyrosine-glycine (GYG) within the extracellular loop of each of four subunits presents backbone carbonyls that line the narrowest part of the pore in such an orientation as to be perfectly positioned to coordinate a column of dehydrated K+ ions as they move through the channel. Larger ions are effectively excluded from entering the column; smaller ions are not effectively coordinated and, hence, dehydration and entry are energetically unfavorable (3.Morais-Cabral J.H. Zhou Y. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 4.Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that the GYG motif is necessary for K+ selectivity, mutations or deletions of the motif can result in loss of K+ selectivity (5.Heginbotham L. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1992; 258: 1152-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and many structural relatives of K+ channels are non-selective channels that lack the GYG motif in the p-loop (6.Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1995; 50: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is also clear that some additional structural feature is necessary for the GYG motif to confer K+ selectivity (7.Korn S.J. Ikeda S.R. Science. 1995; 269: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For example, a recently identified class of cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 1The abbreviations used are: HCNcyclic nucleotide-gatedhD2human dopamine D2HEPES4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acidNMDGN-methyl-d-glucamineCx38connexin38ANOVAanalysis of variance.1The abbreviations used are: HCNcyclic nucleotide-gatedhD2human dopamine D2HEPES4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acidNMDGN-methyl-d-glucamineCx38connexin38ANOVAanalysis of variance. channels contains a GYG motif in the p-loop, but shows relatively poor selectivity for K+ over Na+ (8.Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). In addition, several voltage-gated K+ channels, all of which have the GYG motif, exhibit differential selectivities for K+ over Na+ (7.Korn S.J. Ikeda S.R. Science. 1995; 269: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and significant Na+ currents can be measured through some channels in the absence of K+ (7.Korn S.J. Ikeda S.R. Science. 1995; 269: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). cyclic nucleotide-gated human dopamine D2 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid N-methyl-d-glucamine connexin38 analysis of variance. cyclic nucleotide-gated human dopamine D2 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid N-methyl-d-glucamine connexin38 analysis of variance. The defining feature of Kir channels is inward rectification that results from the voltage-dependent block by intracellular polyamines and Mg2+ (9.Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In Kir2.1, a number of residues in the second transmembrane helix (M2) and the proximal C terminus have been shown to be important in inward rectification: Asp-172, Glu-224, and Glu-299. Mutation of these residues leads to a drastic reduction in inward rectification (10.Kubo Y. Murata Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11.Lu Z. MacKinnon R. Nature. 1994; 371: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12.Stanfield P.R. Davies N.W. Shelton P.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Khan I.A. Brammar W.J. Conley E.C. J. Physiol. 1994; 478: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 13.Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and, in the Kir2.1 channel, it is likely that they contribute to the stable binding of polyamines and Mg2+. As we show here, though, equivalent mutations (of Asp-172 and Glu-224 at least) in the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel have little effect on inward rectification, indicating that additional structural features are critical. There is a glutamate residue that is intracellular to the GYG motif in the p-loop of Kir channels and is absent in voltage-dependent K+ channels. Yang et al. (14.Yang J. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1568-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) showed that mutation of this residue (Glu-148) in Kir2.1 results in a non-functional channel. Because non-selective channel activity could be rescued by additional mutation of an arginine residue extracellular to the GYG motif, i.e. the double mutation E138R/R148E, Yang et al. (14.Yang J. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1568-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) proposed that a salt bridge exists between the glutamate and arginine residues. We now show that mutation of the equivalent glutamate and arginine residues in Kir3.4 causes dramatic loss of ion selectivity and inward rectification in the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel. Molecular modeling indicates that these residues do indeed form a salt bridge and, furthermore, the modeling shows that the salt bridge acts as a “bowstring” to maintain the rigid structure of the p-loop and thereby restrict ion selectivity. Relaxation of the bowstring by disruption of the salt bridge leads to enhanced flexibility of the p-loop and increased permeation of other cations, including polyamines, explaining the loss of selectivity (and inward rectification) observed experimentally. We suggest that this principle may be common to all K+-selective channels and that in other K+ channels, a similar torsion of the p-loop may involve strongly hydrogen-bonded pairs of residues (15.Berneche S. Roux B. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 772-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Channel Expression and Electrophysiology—Site-directed mutagenesis on Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 and preparation of cRNA was carried out as described previously (16.Lancaster M.K. Dibb K.M. Quinn C. Leach R. Lee J.-K. Findlay J.B.C. Boyett M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35831-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Double mutations in a single subunit were constructed in two steps with the same method (DNA was generated for a single mutation and this was then used as a template for the production of a second mutation). Concentrations of cRNA stock solutions were determined by ultraviolet light absorbance and diluted, as appropriate, in nuclease-free water. Oocytes were injected with cRNA encoding Kir3.1, Kir3.4 and the human dopamine D2 (hD2) receptor. Oocyte preparation and injection of cRNA was carried out as described previously (16.Lancaster M.K. Dibb K.M. Quinn C. Leach R. Lee J.-K. Findlay J.B.C. Boyett M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35831-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). cRNA encoding wild-type or mutant Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 was injected at a concentration of 30 ng/μl, whereas cRNA encoding the hD2 receptor was injected at a concentration of 3.8 ng/μl. cRNA involving mutations at Glu-139 and Arg-149 in Kir3.1 and mutations at Glu-145 and Arg-155 in Kir3.4 was injected at 10 times the standard concentration because of the difficulty in obtaining adequately sized currents with these mutants. In some experiments, 10 ng/oocyte of antisense oligonucleotide to connexin38 (5′-GCTTTAGTAATTCCCATCCTGCCATGTTTC-3′ (17.Barrio L.C. Suchyna T. Bargiello T. Xu L.X. Roginski R.S. Bennett M.V. Nicholson B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8410-8414Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar)) was injected at the same time as the cRNA to block expression of the connexin. In all cases, a total volume of 50 nl was injected into each oocyte. Electrophysiological recordings with a two-electrode voltage clamp were carried out 1-10 days after injection (for further details see Ref. 16.Lancaster M.K. Dibb K.M. Quinn C. Leach R. Lee J.-K. Findlay J.B.C. Boyett M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35831-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All oocytes were initially perfused with ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH). Experimental recordings were made in a 90 mm K+ solution (90 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with KOH). To activate the hD2 receptor, 10 μm dopamine was added to the recording solution along with 10 μm ascorbic acid to prevent dopamine oxidation. In some experiments, the CaCl2 was omitted from the solution (0 Ca2+ solution). In some experiments, CsCl, putrescine chloride, or spermine chloride was added to the 90 mm K+ recording solution at the concentrations shown. In other experiments, the 90 mm KCl of the recording solution was substituted by 90 mm of one of various chloride salts (putrescine, spermine, or N-methyl-d-glutamate (NMDG)). Junction potentials were measured with a flowing 3 m KCl electrode with reference to ND96 solution and were 11 (100 mm Cs+), 8 (90 mm Ba2+), 6 (30 mm putrescine), 7 (90 mm putrescine), 8 (30 mm spermine), 17 (90 mm spermine), and -5 (90 mm NMDG) mV; when important, data are corrected for junction potentials and this is stated. Oocytes were held at 0 mV and every 3 s, voltage pulses (750 ms in duration) were applied, normally from -130 to +40 mV in 10-mV increments. Analysis was carried out using Clampfit (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA) and SigmaPlot (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) software. The current-voltage relationships shown are from current at the end of the pulse. In some current-voltage relationships, current is normalized to the current under control conditions at the most negative potential. For dose-response curves, current remaining at the end of a pulse (as a fraction of that under control conditions) is plotted. Data are presented as means ± S.E. (n = number of oocytes). Measurement of Radio-labeled Spermidine Efflux—Defolliculated oocytes were injected with Kir3.1, Kir3.4, hD2 cRNA as described above, or Kv1.4 cRNA (50 nl at 50 ng/μl), or they were left uninjected and were incubated in Barth's medium at 19 °C for 12-36 h. Channel expression was confirmed by using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique: in the presence of 90 mm K+ and 10 μm dopamine, current at -130 mV was -11.0 ± 1.3 and -0.4 ± 0.1 μA (n = 4) in oocytes expressing the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel and uninjected oocytes, respectively; in the presence of 3 mm K+, current at +90 mV was 4.1 ± 0.4 μA (n = 3) in oocytes expressing the Kv1.4 channel. All oocytes were then injected with 50 nl of 10 mm tritiated-spermidine ([3H]spermidine; specific activity = 15 Ci/mmol) and incubated for a further 2 h, after which they were washed twice with ∼100 μl of experimental solution. Oocytes were incubated in experimental solution for 15-min collection periods. In the case of oocytes expressing the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel, all experimental solutions contained dopamine as described above. At the end of each collection period, the solution was removed and its radioactivity measured. Finally, oocytes were lysed using a pipette, and their radioactivity was then measured. Radioactivity was measured with a scintillation spectrometer (Packard BioScience Co., Meriden, CT). Optiphase Safe scintillant (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used in all experiments. [3H]spermidine efflux during each 15-min collection period was expressed as a percentage of the [3H]spermidine in the oocyte at the start of the collection period. Computational Procedures for Structural Modeling—Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 sequences were aligned with KcsA over the region defined in the KcsA crystal structure 1BL8 (KcsA fragment 23-119) (1.Doyle D.A.

Biol. 2001; 313: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Alignment of KcsA23-119, Kir3.190-189 and Kir3.496-195 fragments (with two short inserts in KcsA and one each in Kir3.1 and Kir3.4) shows 13 residues are conserved over the 97-residue KcsA fragment. Alignment of the Kir3.190-189 and Kir3.496-195 fragments alone shows 64 residues are conserved over the 100 residues aligned. The sequences Kir3.190-189/Kir3.496-195/Kir3.190-189/Kir3.496-195 were threaded over the four monomers of KcsA23-119 using Modeler (19.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10286) Google Scholar). This arrangement places identical subunits opposite (1414) rather than adjacent (1144) to each other. Although, both arrangements may exist, the 1414 arrangement (as used here) is the most likely (20.Silverman S.K. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30524-30528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). 200 three-dimensional-models were built and then sorted for stereochemistry by Procheck (21.Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4279) Google Scholar) and for sequence-fold compatibility with Verify3D (22.Eisenberg D. Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). Models were clustered when root-mean-square deviations of backbone model residue pairs were less than 2.5 Å. The best models of the two best clusters were selected, symmetrized (2-fold), minimized, and then used separately as co-templates to 1BL8 to generate 50 new models. The best-ranked model (for its stereochemistry) was minimized under constraints to reconstitute the coordination of two K+ ions and three water molecules in the selectivity filter: water at s0/K+ at s1/water at s2/K+ at s3/water at s4, where s0 is the K+ coordination site in the outer vestibule and s1-s4 are the K+ binding positions in the selectivity filter (after Ref. 4.Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). The best three-dimensional model presents 208 residues (4 × 52) involved in α-helices; the following ϕ-Ψ distribution in the most allowed, allowed, generous, and disallowed regions in the Ramachandran plot were 76.5, 22.1, 1.6, and 0%, respectively. The root-mean-square atomic deviations of the overall backbone of four subunits are 3.17 Å with 1BL8 (1.Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5646) Google Scholar) and 3.37 Å with KcsA crystal structure 1K4C (4.Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Mutations were performed with Insight II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Organic compounds were built with Biopolymer (Accelrys). Molecular dynamic simulations were performed with Discover (Accelrys). The value of three-term energy expression was calculated for the complex of channel-ligand and the free components (channel and ligand). Ligand-binding free energies were calculated from the difference of the value for the complex and the sum of the value for the free components. Potential energy, including the non-bound terms describing the van der Waals interactions (CFF91) and the electrostatic energy, was calculated from the finite difference Poisson-Boltzman method with the Debye-Huckel-type boundary conditions implemented in Delphi (23.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5310) Google Scholar) applied on a 1-Å grid using the Parse parameter set for the free and bound states. The entropy energy was derived from solvent accessibility surfaces in the free and bound states (24.Pickett S.D. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 825-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Parameters for the non-bound energy involving K+ and Na+ and weights for the three terms were calibrated based on Na+ and K+ experimental solvation free energy (-101 and -80 kcal/mol in water and in N-methyl acetamide) as suggested by Berneche and Roux (25.Berneche S. Roux B. Nature. 2001; 414: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Asp-173 of Kir3.1 and Glu-231 of Kir3.4 Do Not Play a Major Role in Inward Rectification—Fig. 1 illustrates currents around the reversal potential through the wild-type Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel and two mutant channels. Endogenous currents from uninjected oocytes over the same potential range are shown for comparison. Because of strong polyamine-dependent inward rectification (9.Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), only small outward currents were observed through the wild-type channel (Fig. 1). In Kir2.1, mutation of Asp-172 and Glu-224 leads to a drastic reduction in inward rectification (10.Kubo Y. Murata Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11.Lu Z. MacKinnon R. Nature. 1994; 371: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12.Stanfield P.R. Davies N.W.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). An equivalent aspartate residue is only present in Kir3.1 (Asp-173), whereas an equivalent glutamate residue is only present in Kir3.4 (Glu-231). Fig. 1 shows the Kir3.1(D173Q)/Kir3.4 mutant channel still exhibiting strong inward rectification. As a summary of inward rectification, Fig. 2 shows the ratio of conductance at +40 mV to that at -100 mV in various mutant channels. This potential range was chosen because within it, endogenous currents in the oocyte are small (Fig. 1), whereas outside it, endogenous depolarization-activated delayed rectifier current or endogenous hyperpolarization-activated Cl- current can be significant in some oocytes. Fig. 2 shows that, like the conductance ratio for the wild-type channel, the conductance ratio for Kir3.1(D173Q)/Kir3.4, Kir3.1/Kir3.4(E231Q) and Kir3.1(D173Q)/Kir3.4(E231Q) mutant channels was low (in Fig. 2, compare ii, iii, and iv with i), i.e. inward rectification was still strong in the case of these mutant channels. The role of these two residues in inward rectification is more important in the Kir2.1 channel. For comparison, Fig. 2 (xiii and xiv) shows the equivalent conductance ratio for the Kir2.1 channel from Kubo and Murata (10.Kubo Y. Murata Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 645-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Whereas the ratio is low in the wild-type channel, it is drastically increased (i.e. inward rectification is drastically reduced) in the Kir2.1(D172N,E224G) double mutant channel. It is concluded that, in the Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel at least, additional structural features are required for inward rectification.Fig. 2Loss of inward rectification in the Kir3.1/Kir3.4(E145Q) and other mutant channels.

Proposed interactions between charged residues (see modeling below) are indicated by the connecting lines in Fig. 3. As suggested for Kir2.1 (14.Yang J. Yu M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1568-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a salt bridge is proposed between Glu-139/Arg-149 and Glu-145/Arg-155 in Kir3.1 and Kir3.4, respectively. Mutation of Glu-145 in Kir3.4 resulted in a reduction of inward rectification (Fig. 1), and the ratio of conductances at +40 and -100 mV was significantly increased for the mutant channel (Fig. 2vi). Inward rectification was also significantly reduced, though to a smaller extent, in Kir3.1/Kir3.4(R155E) and Kir3.1/Kir3.4 (E145R,R155E) mutant channels (Fig. 2, x and xii). Neutralization of the proposed salt bridge glutamate residue in Kir3.1 (E139Q) did not affect inward rectification (Fig. 2v), although mutation of the proposed salt bridge arginine residue in Kir3.1 (R149E) resulted in a non-functional channel. Why the mutation Kir3.1(R149E) but not Kir3.4(R155E) should result in a non-functional channel is unclear. Prediction is not trivial, because these residues participate in a complex salt network (Fig. 3), and it is unlikely that any two residues or charge pair reversals will be exactly equivalent. However, the Kir3.1(R149E)/Kir3.4(E145R) double mutant channel was active (why the effect of the mutation Kir3.1(R149E) should be rescued by the mutation Kir3.4(E145R) is also unclear). In the case of the Kir3.1(R149E)/Kir3.4(E145R) double mutant channel, the proposed salt bridges of both subunits will be disrupted, and inward rectification was strikingly reduced (Fig. 2xi). Mutation of other neighboring glutamate residues (E141 in Kir3.1 and E147 in Kir3.4; see Fig. 3) had no effect on inward rectification (Fig. 2, viii and ix). Glu-145/Arg-155 Salt Bridge in Kir3.4 Controls Ion Selectivity—We have shown previously that the mutation E145Q in Kir3.4 results in the loss of block by extracellular Ba2+ (16.Lancaster M.K. Dibb K.M. Quinn C. Leach R. Lee J.-K. Findlay J.B.C. Boyett M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35831-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This mutation also causes a loss of high affinity block by extracellular Cs+: whereas Cs+ blocked the wild-type channel, it failed to block the Kir3.1/Kir3.4(E145Q) mutant channel at concentrations up to 100 mm (Fig. 4, A-C). Interestingly, the equivalent mutation (E139Q) in Kir3.1 once again had a dissimilar effect: it increased Cs+ sensitivity by a small amount (Fig. 4D). Mutation of the neighboring glutamate residues (Glu-141 in Kir3.1 and Glu-147 in Kir3.4; see Fig. 3) again had a minimal effect on Cs+ block (Fig. 4D). The loss of sensitivity to both extracellular (Cs+ and Ba2+) and intracellular (polyamine-induced inward rectification) pore blockers with the mutation of Glu-145 in Kir3.4 could reflect two separate effects on affinity at extracellular and intracellular blocking sites. Alternatively, it could reflect an alteration of the permeability of the selectivity filter itself, so that rather than blocking the pore, these ions now permeate. Fig. 5 shows typical currents, and Fig. 6 shows mean currents (at -130 mV) through wild-type and mutant channels when the bathing solution contained 90 mm K+ or when K+ was substituted by 90 mm Rb+, Na+,Cs+,Li+,orBa2+. The wild-type channel conducted K+ and smaller Rb+ currents, but there was essentially no current carried by other monovalent ions or Ba2+ (Figs. 5 and 6). Like inward rectification and Cs+ block, ion selectivity was unaffected in Kir3.1(E141Q)/Kir3.4 or Kir3.1/Kir3.4(E147Q) mutant channels (Figs. 5 and 6). However, increased Rb+ current was observed in the Kir3.1(E139Q)/Kir3.4 mutant channel, and an even more dramatic reduction of ion selectivity was observed in the Kir3.1/Kir3.4(E145Q) mutant channel: all ions tested with the exception of Ba2+ produced substantial currents (Figs. 5 and 6). The Kir3.1/Kir3.4(R155E) mutant channel was also non-selective, and in this case all ions tested, even Ba2+, produced substantial currents (Figs. 5 and 6). In general, a dramatic reduction of ion selectivity was observed in all channels in which Glu-145 or Arg-155 charges in Kir3.4 were neutralized or reversed: both Kir3.1(R149E)/Kir3.4(E145R) and Kir3.1/Kir3.4(E145R,R155E) double mutant channels exhibited a dramatic lack of discrimination between K+ and other monovalent or divalent Ba2+ ions (Figs. 5 and 6), demonstrating that the salt bridge in Kir3.4 controls ion selectivity.Fig. 6Summary of the selectivity of the wild-type channel and various mutant channels.

As with Cs+ block, putrescine and spermine blocked Kir3.1/Kir3.4(E145Q) and Kir3.1/Kir3.4(R155E) mutant channels much less effectively (Fig. 7, A and B). Putrescine block of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4(E145Q) mutant channel was voltage-independent (Fig. 7C), whereas spermine block of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4(E145Q) mutant channel and putrescine and spermine block of the Kir3.1/Kir3.4(R155E) mutant channel showed a curious biphasic response on increasing the polyamine concentration: the degree of block increased and then decreased as the concentration was raised (Fig. 7, A and B). This result may be explained by a balance of block and permeation of the selectivity filter by the polyamine. Fig. 7D shows current at -130 mV in the presence of 30 mm putrescine or spermine. Wherea"
https://openalex.org/W2133424019,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic fungus, distinguished by an elaborate polysaccharide capsule that is essential for its virulence. As part of an effort to understand the biosynthesis of this important structure, we initiated purification of an α-1,3-mannosyltransferase with appropriate specificity for a role in building the main capsule polysaccharide, glucuronoxylomannan. A pool of proteins that was 5,000-fold enriched in this activity included several polypeptides, which acted potentially as the catalytic protein. These were analyzed using sequence information and double-stranded RNA interference. Interference that targeted a sequence corresponding to part of a 46 kDa protein in the enriched fraction abolished the activity of interest and reduced the capsule on the affected cells. This gene was cloned and expressed in active form in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to confirm function, and was termed CMT1, for cryptococcal mannosyltransferase 1. CMT1 has no confirmed homologs in GenBank™ other than CAP59, a cryptococcal gene encoding a protein of unknown function that is required for capsule synthesis and virulence. The Cmt1p protein also co-purifies with a homolog of CAP64, a gene whose product has similarly been implicated in capsule synthesis and virulence. A strain disrupted in CMT1 was generated in C. neoformans; this had no effect on virulence in an animal model of cryptococcosis.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen responsible for serious disease and lethal meningitis, primarily in the setting of compromised immunity (1Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Cryptococcus neoformans. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998Crossref Google Scholar). Its major virulence factor is an extensive polysaccharide capsule (2Bose I. Reese A.J. Ory J.J. Janbon G. Doering T.L. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) that has been implicated in evasion of host immune defenses (3Buchanan K.L. Murphy J.W.

Immun. 2000; 68: 3642-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The capsule has two major components, termed glucuronoxylomannan (GXM, 1The abbreviations used are: GXMglucuronoxylomannanPBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyconAconcanavalin ACMT1cryptococcal mannosyltransferase 1. ∼90% of the capsule mass) and galactoxylomannan (GalXM, ∼7% of the capsule mass). The former, with an estimated molecular mass of over a million daltons, consists of a linear mannan in α-1,3-linkage. The mannose residues are decorated with glucuronic acid (linked β-1,2) and xylose (linked β-1,2 and β-1,4) in a mannose/glucuronic acid/xylose ratio of 3:1:1–4. The amount of xylose present, as well as the extent of 6-O-acetylation of the mannose backbone, varies with the serotype of the organism (5Cherniak R. Valafar H. Morris L.C. Valafar F. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 146-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The galactoxylomannan, with an estimated mass of ∼100,000 daltons, is a more complex structure, with an α-1,3-galactose backbone bearing side chains consisting of 3–6 residues of mannose and xylose (6Vaishnav V.V. Bacon B.E. O'Neill M.O. Cherniak R. Carb. Res. 1998; 306: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).

Because of the critical importance of the capsule to the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis, there has been substantial effort to understand how it is synthesized and assembled on the cell surface. One approach has been to screen mutagenized cells for those that either do not express capsule at all (7Fromtling R.A. Shadomy H.J. Jacobson E.S.

Biochemical approaches have conversely detected enzyme activities that must be involved in building capsule, but the corresponding protein sequences are not known (17White C.W. Jacobson E.S. Can J.

In only a few cases have molecular and biochemical techniques been used together to identify enzymes required for capsule synthesis and characterize their role in virulence (10Moyrand F. Klaproth B. Himmelreich U. Dromer F. Janbon G. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Wills E.A. Roberts I.S. del Poeta M. Rivera J. Casadevall A. Cox G.M. Perfect J.R.

A. 2001; 98: 12003-12008Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Many of the enzymes involved in capsule synthesis are sugar transferases that generate the unique structures of GXM and GalXM (17White C.W. Jacobson E.S. Can J. Microbiol. 1993; 39: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18White C.W. Cherniak R. Jacobson E.S. J. Med. Vet.

We are specifically interested in the mannosyltransferase, which generates the α-1,3-linked backbone of the more abundant capsule polymer, GXM. This activity is presumably required at the start of GXM synthesis; without it this critical polymer should not be made. Although the genome sequence of C. neoformans has recently been obtained (23Heitman J. Casadevall A. Lodge J.K. Perfect J.R. Mycopathologia. 1999; 148: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it is difficult to identify such an enzyme by homology to genes in other organisms (24Varki A. Cummings R. Esko J. Freeze H. Hart G. Marth J. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 258Google Scholar). For example, sequence analysis may suggest a mannosyltransferase, but it would be impossible to predict what linkage the putative protein might generate and what substrate it would prefer. Further, fungi typically encode numerous mannosyltransferases, as they generate abundant mannose linkages during formation of GPI anchors, glycoproteins, and glycolipids (25Dean N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gentzsch M. Tanner W. Biochim. Biophys.

Subcell Biochem. 1984; 10: 193-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To identify the α-1,3-mannosyltransferase, which generates the GXM backbone, we began with a biochemical approach. In previous studies we identified both α-1,2 and α-1,3 mannosyltransferase activities in crude preparations of cryptococcal membranes, monitoring activity by transfer of radioactive mannose from a tritiated GDP-mannose donor to a mannose-α-1,3-mannose acceptor (22Doering T.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5482-5488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our goal in the current work was to purify the α-1,3 mannosyltransferase in sufficient quantities to obtain sequence information, and to examine the effect of altering this activity on capsule formation and cryptococcal virulence. This should enable a better understanding of the fascinating biochemistry involved in capsule synthesis, and inform efforts to identify anti-fungal compounds. Materials—Generous gifts of non-commercial reagents included GXM-derived mannan from R. Cherniak, GDP-hexanolamine resin from G. Hart (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) and monoclonal anti-capsule antibodies 2H1 (30Mukherjee S. Lee S. Mukherjee J. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 3C2 (31Duro R.M. Netski D. Thorkildson P. Kozel T.R. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2003; 10: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) from A. Casadevall (Albert Einstein School of Medicine) and T. Kozel (University of Nevada at Reno), respectively. α-1,3-d-Mannobiose was from V-Labs, Inc. (Covington, LA), medium components were from BD Pharmingen or Bio101 (Carlsbad, CA), and other materials, including anti-His antibody, were from Sigma Chemical Co. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against bacterially expressed Cmt1p (see below) was generated at Covance Laboratories, (Denver, PA). Strains and Cell Growth—Wild type C. neoformans strains H99 (serotype A) and the acapsular mutant strain Cap67 (8Jacobson E.S. Ayers D.J. Harrell A.C. Nicholas C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 1292-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were from A. Casadevall (Albert Einstein College of Medicine); C. neoformans JEC43 (serotype D MATα ura) was provided by J. Heitman (Duke University Medical College); Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain TDY172 (RSY620; MATaade2–1 trp1–1 leu2–3,112 ura3–1 his3–11,15 pep4::TRP1) was from R. Schekman (University of California at Berkeley); and Tremella mesenterica Fries was from the American Type Culture Collection. Cell growth was as indicated in YPD (1% Bacto Yeast Extract, 2% Bacto Peptone, 2% dextrose), YM (0.3% Bacto Yeast Extract, 0.3% Bacto Malt Extract, 0.5% Bacto Peptone, 1.3% dextrose), minimal medium lacking uracil or minimal medium containing 1 g/liter of 5-fluoro-orotic acid (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003: 13.1.4Google Scholar). For small scale cultures growth was at 30 °C (or room temperature for T. mesenterica) with continuous shaking (200 rpm), and was monitored by turbidity at 600 nm. For large scale preparations a 50-ml overnight culture of C. neoformans strain Cap67 in YPD was used to inoculate a 1.5 liters of overnight culture in YPD. This was then used to inoculate a 30-liter fermenter containing YPD medium, in which cells were grown at 30 °C to an OD600 of ∼40. Cells (∼ 2 kg wet weight) were harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 4 °C, 2000 × g), washed once in cold distilled water, and resuspended in 0.3 volumes cold distilled water. The cell suspension was frozen by pouring a thin stream into liquid nitrogen with constant stirring, and stored at –70 °C until use. Mannosyltransferase Assays—Activity was assayed by monitoring the conversion of anthranilic acid derivatized α-1,3-mannobiose to the corresponding mannotriose. The derivatized mannobiose was prepared as in Ref. 33Anamula K.R. Dhume S.T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, and purified on a RP-18 column (HAISIL HL C18, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) by sequential runs in (a) 10% acetonitrile/90% 0.25% 1-butylamine, 0.5% phosphoric acid, 1% tetrahydrofuran in water and (b) 8% acetonitrile/92% water, with fluorescence detection at λex = 360 nm and λem = 425 nm. The standard assay mixture (25 μl) included 5 μl of protein sample, ∼1 mm derivatized mannobiose, 0.2 mg/ml GDP-mannose, 10 mm CoCl2 (or other cation as indicated), and 50 mm Tris, pH 8. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C, terminated by the addition of 4 volumes of 0.1% acetic acid in acetonitrile, and subjected to centrifugation to remove any particulate material. 100 μl of the supernatant fraction was analyzed on a TosoHaas TSK-Gel Amide 80 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) using solvents A (0.2% triethylamine, 0.2% acetic acid in water) and B (0.1% acetic acid in acetonitrile) in Program 1 (10 min 20% A, 80% B followed by a 15-min linear gradient to 70% A, 30% B and holding at that composition), Program 2 (5 min 20% A, 80% B followed by a 20-min linear gradient to 60% A, 40% B and holding at that composition), or Program 3 (isocratic at 19% A, 81% B). Fluorescent product oligosaccharides were detected at λex = 230 nm, λem = 425 nm. Standards for mannosyl transfer reactions were derived from authentic α-1,3-mannan of C. neoformans, a generous gift of R. Cherniak. This material was subjected to repeated partial hydrolysis (1 h; 95 °C; 0.1 m HCl) and then derivatized and purified as above. Mannosyltransferase Purification—All steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C, unless indicated otherwise. Buffers—All buffers were prepared at room temperature, then filtered and chilled before use. Buffer A, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100. Buffer B, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100. Buffer C was prepared as buffer B but with 400 mm NaCl. Buffer D, 50 mm Hepes, pH 8, 0.2% Triton X-100. Buffer E, as buffer D but with 500 mm NaCl. Buffer F, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Triton X-100. Buffer G, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm Triton X-100. Buffer H1, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 12.5 mm K-PO4, pH 6.8, 0.1% Triton X-100. Buffer H5, as Buffer H1 but with 200 mm K-PO4. Buffer I, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2. Buffer J, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 200 mm α-methyl-mannoside, 0.1% Triton X-100. Buffer K, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 500 mm α-methyl-mannoside, 0.1% Triton X-100. Membrane Preparation—300 g of frozen cells (Cap67, see Ref. 22Doering T.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5482-5488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for details of strain choice) were lysed by processing with liquid nitrogen in a Waring blender. The resulting powder was suspended in a final volume of 900 ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA. After a clearing spin to remove cell debris, the supernatant fraction was subjected to centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h). The resulting pellet was resuspended in ∼350 ml of the same buffer, and again subjected to centrifugation (125,000 × g, 1 h). This pellet, along with loose material that sedimented just above it, was resuspended in 20 ml of the same buffer and either frozen at –70 °C for future use or rotated end-over-end overnight for complete resuspension before detergent solubilization. For smaller scale membrane preparation, lysis was with glass beads, either in a Bead Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) or by vortex mixing as in Ref. 22Doering T.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5482-5488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Solubilization—20% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8 was added to the large-scale membrane preparation to yield a final detergent concentration of 2%. The resulting suspension was rotated end-over-end for 1 h, subjected to centrifugation (125,000 × g, 15 min), and the supernatant fraction (SolZ) recovered. Q Sepharose Chromatography—The SolZ fraction was applied to a Q Sepharose Fast Flow column (10 × 300 mm, flow rate 0.8 ml/min), and the column washed with buffers A and B. Activity was eluted with a 120-ml linear gradient from buffer B to buffer C. Source 15Q Chromatography—The most active fractions from Q Sepharose chromatography were pooled, diluted with an equal volume of distilled water, and applied at 2 ml/min to a 16 × 200 mm HPLC column that had been packed with Source 15Q resin (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with buffer D, and kept on ice. The column was washed with 90% buffer D, 10% buffer E, and the activity was eluted with an 80 ml linear gradient from the same mixture to 50% buffer D, 50% buffer E. Hydroxyapatite Chromatography—The most active fractions from Source15Q chromatography were pooled, and directly applied to a 2.5 ml (d = 7 mm) Hydroxyapatite Ultrogel column. The column was washed with buffers F, G, and H1 and activity was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from buffer H1 to buffer H5. Concanavalin A Chromatography—The most active hydroxyapatite fractions were pooled and incubated with 1 ml of concanavalin A-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) that had been prewashed with 2 m α-methyl mannoside and water, and pre-equilibrated with buffer I. After 1 h of rotation the resin was poured into a column and washed (gravity flow) with buffer I followed by 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100. Activity was eluted with 20 ml of buffer K. Second Source 15Q Chromatography—The eluates of the concanavalin A column were pooled, diluted with an equal volume of distilled water, and applied at 1 ml/min to a 1-ml column packed with Source 15Q resin pre-equilibrated with buffer D and kept on ice. After loading, the column was washed with 50% water, 40% buffer D/10% buffer E, and the activity was eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient from that mixture to 50% water, 50% buffer E. The fraction with highest specific activity was used for protein sequencing and characterization. Protein Sequencing—Edman degradation was performed by Midwest Scientific (St. Louis, MO), and mass spectrometry was performed by Oxford Glycosciences or by the Keck Facility at Yale University. RNA Interference Studies, Cloning—Based on the peptide sequences obtained from each band of interest (single and double asterisk in Fig. 2), and sequence analysis as described in the text, we obtained putative coding sequences for the corresponding proteins. To direct interference we chose regions of the sequence that were not predicted to contain introns, and therefore should correspond to mRNA of the genes. Constructs were based on plasmid pCAP59/ADE2i (34Liu H. Cottrell T.R. Pierini L.M. Goldman W.E. Doering T.L. Genetics. 2002; 160: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was modified to eliminate the NdeI site downstream of the promoter and the BglII site upstream of the terminator. To target CMT1, the first 282 bp of the predicted coding sequence were PCR-amplified from JEC43 cDNA, using primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTTCCGAAATACCC-3′ and 5′-CGCCTAGGTCTAAACGCTTCTGATGTCG-3′ to incorporate NdeI and AvrII sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the product (product A). Product A was digested with those enzymes and ligated into the similarly restricted plasmid pCAP59/ADE2i, replacing the CAP59 sequences with those from CMT1 to yield product B, which was then amplified in Escherichia coli. Product A was additionally amplified using primers designed to incorporate BglII and XhoI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, to form product C. Product C was digested with BglII and XhoI and ligated to similarly restricted product B. The resulting plasmid, pCMT1/ADE2i, contained inverted repeats of CMT1 separated by a portion of GFP as a spacer, and flanked by inverted repeats of a portion of ADE2 as well as the actin promoter and gal7 terminator. To target the CAP64 homolog a parallel strategy was used to generate pCAP64H/ADE2i, except using primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGTTTCCTGGCCAACGGCAAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCCTAGGCGTCCAATGTTGTAAGGC-3′ to amplify the first 335 bp of the putative coding region. Details of all cloning manipulations are available from the authors. Transformation and Analysis—Transformation into JEC43 cells was as described (34Liu H. Cottrell T.R. Pierini L.M. Goldman W.E. Doering T.L. Genetics. 2002; 160: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants that turned pink, indicative of functioning RNAi targeting ADE2, were chosen for further analysis. Several individual transformants were restreaked on both medium lacking uracil to maintain the interference plasmid and on medium containing uracil and 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) to select against plasmid maintenance. These pairs of strains, the latter of which reverted to white colony type, were then used for membrane preparations and activity assays. Control strains included transformants with pCAP59/ADE2i, which targets both the CAP59 and ADE2 genes, and strains containing pADE2i, which targets ADE2 alone (34Liu H. Cottrell T.R. Pierini L.M. Goldman W.E. Doering T.L. Genetics. 2002; 160: 463-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Obtaining Gene Sequence for CMT1—Based on alignment of peptide sequences (Table II) to predicted protein sequence from C. neoformans (see text), gene specific primers were designed to obtain the entire CMT1 coding sequence by RT-PCR. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from C. neoformans serotype D strain Cap67, reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer, and used as a template for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis using Clontech Marathon reagents as directed by the manufacturer. Gene specific primers for 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions were as-1 (5′-GTGCAGTCGCTGGAAGGTCCTTCC-3′) and s-1 (5′-GGACCTCTTCTTGGAAAGGGCGCT-3′), respectively. RACE reaction products were sequenced and assembled into a contiguous region, with initiation and stop codons bounding an ORF. The full length ORF (1401 bp) was then amplified using primers MT48-s3 (5′-GGAATTCCATATGTTCCGAAATACCC-3′) and MT48-as3 (5′-CTAGCTAGCTCATTCTAACCAGGGC-3′) to incorporate restriction sites for further cloning.

The resulting plasmid or the starting vector alone were transformed into TDY172 by electroporation using standard methods, and cells containing the URA3 marked plasmid were selected on medium lacking uracil for further analysis. Gene Disruption and Deletion—CMT1 was disrupted following the basic protocol described in (36Davidson R.C. Blankenship J.R. Kraus P.R. De Jesus Berrios M. Hull C.M. D'Souza C.A. Wang P. Heitman J.

For deletion the cassette consisted of nucleotides –1042 to –1 of CMT1, the same marker, and nucleotides +1 to +1018 of CMT1. Each cassette was constructed by PCR (primer sequences available from the authors), purified, and biolistically transformed (37Davidson R.C. Cruz M.C. Sia R.A.L. Allen B. Alspaugh J.A. Heitman J.

Colonies were screened as described in the text to identify those in which endogenous CMT1 was successfully replaced. Electron Microscopy—For ultrastructural analysis, yeast cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA) in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed in phosphate buffer and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Polysciences Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were then rinsed in buffer, followed by dehydration in a graded series of ethanol and propylene oxide prior to embedding in Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA). Samples were sectioned with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL). 70–90 nm sections were immunolabeled with mouse monoclonal antibody 2H1 (30Mukherjee S. Lee S. Mukherjee J. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by 18 nm colloidal gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed with on a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA). All labeling experiments were processed in parallel with controls omitting the primary antibody. These controls were consistently negative at the concentration of gold-conjugated secondary antibodies used in these studies. Mouse Studies—Groups of 8 4–6-week-old female C57Bl/6 mice (National Cancer Institute) were anesthetized and 2 × 104 PBS-washed cells in a volume of 50 μl PBS were inoculated intranasally (39Cox G.M.

At 3 h and 7 days after inoculation animals were sacrificed, and the lungs, livers, spleens, and brains were removed, homogenized in PBS, and plated as serial dilutions on appropriate media for assessment of colony forming units (CFUs). Initial inocula were also plated to confirm CFUs. To purify the cryptococcal α-1,3 mannosyltransferase we needed a rapid assay. A thin layer chromatography (TLC) based assay that was used initially (22Doering T.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5482-5488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is time consuming and difficult to scale up. To address these problems we modified the dimannoside assay substrate with anthranilic acid (33Anamula K.R. Dhume S.T.

We similarly derivatized a ladder of mannose polymers generated from cryptococcal GXM to use as standards (Fig. 1, diamonds).

In Escherichia coli the heat shock transcription factor, σ32, out-competes upon temperature up-shift the housekeeping σ-factor, σ70, for binding to core RNA polymerase and initiates heat shock gene transcription. To investigate possible heat-induced conformational changes in σ32 we performed amide hydrogen (H/D) exchange experiments under optimal growth and heat shock conditions combined with mass spectrometry. We found a rapid exchange of around 220 of the 294 amide hydrogens at 37 °C, indicating that σ32 adopts a highly flexible structure. At 42 °C we observed a slow correlated exchange of 30 additional amide hydrogens and localized it to a helix-loop-helix motif within domain σ2 that is responsible for the recognition of the -10 region in heat shock promoters. The correlated exchange is shown to constitute a reversible unfolding with a half-life of about 30 min due to a temperature-dependent decrease in stabilization energy. We propose that this gradual decrease in stabilization energy of domain σ2 with increasing temperatures facilitates the unfolding of σ32 by the AAA+ protease FtsH thereby decreasing its half-life. Taken together our data show that the σ2 domain of σ32 can act as a thermosensor, which might be important for the heat shock regulation.

Taken together our data show that the σ2 domain of σ32 can act as a thermosensor, which might be important for the heat shock regulation. The heat shock response is a ubiquitously conserved protective mechanism of cells to cope with stress-induced damage in proteins. In Escherichia coli heat shock to 42 °C induces a 10-20-fold transient increase in the expression of about 20 heat shock genes through the stress-dependent increase in the level and activity of the heat shock transcription factor σ32 (1Yura T. Nakahigashi K. Curr. Opinion Microbiol. 1999; 2: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In vivo σ32 is very unstable with a half-life of approximately 1 min at 30 °C (2Gross C.A. Straus D.B. Erickson J.W. Morimoto R. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1990: 167-190Google Scholar). Degradation of σ32in vivo requires the AAA+ protease FtsH and the DnaK chaperone system (3Tatsuta T. Joob D.M. Calendar R. Akiyama Y. Ogura T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Tomoyasu T. Ogura T. Tatsuta T. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 567-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Immediately after temperature up-shift the synthesis as well as the half-life of σ32 transiently increase by 10- and 8-fold, respectively. The transient stabilization of σ32 is believed to be caused by the competition of unfolded proteins with σ32 for binding to DnaK and FtsH (1Yura T. Nakahigashi K. Curr. Opinion Microbiol. 1999; 2: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 5Georgopoulos C. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Ang D. Morimoto R.I. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C.

J. Food Microbiol. 2000; 55: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Under steady state conditions at 42 °C the half-life of σ32 decreases to 10-15 s, probably due to an increase in the levels of available DnaK and FtsH. However, it remains an important open question whether σ32 itself can act as a thermosensor, similar to the heat shock transcription factor HSF1 of Drosophila (7Rabindran S.K. Haroun R.I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), by undergoing conformational alterations in response to heat shock. To investigate this question we determined the folding status of σ32 under temperatures of optimal growth (37 °C) and under heat-stress conditions (42 °C). In recent years amide hydrogen exchange combined with mass spectrometry has become an important method for studying the conformational properties of proteins (8Engen J.R. Smith D.L. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 256A-265ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Englander S.W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 213-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 10Li R. Woodward C.

In combination with pepsin digestion this method can resolve conformational changes down to the peptide level (8Engen J.R. Smith D.L. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 256A-265ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore built a high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC-MShigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometryaaamino acids. setup that allowed us to monitor the incorporation of deuterons into full-length σ32. Using an in-line column packed with immobilized pepsin for rapid reproducible digestion we were able to localize slow and fast exchanging regions within the entire sequence of σ32. The results indicate that σ32 has an unusually high degree of flexibility at 37 °C, and that heat treatment to 42 °C leads to unfolding of a stable subdomain. Our data support a role for σ32 as a thermosensor. high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry amino acids. Materials—σ32 was prepared as described previously (12Tomoyasu T. Arsene F. Ogura T. Bukau B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5911-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). D2O (99.9%) was from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA), poroszyme immobilized pepsin and Poros R1 from Applied Biosystems (Darmstadt, Gemany), and other chemicals from Sigma. Amide Hydrogen Exchange Measurements—Amide hydrogen exchange was initiated by a 50-fold dilution of 100 pmol σ32 into D2O containing 25 mm HEPES, pD 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol at 37 or 42 °C. After various times (0.2-90 min), the exchange reaction was quenched by decreasing the temperature to 0 °C and the pH to 2.2 with 500 mm KxHyPO4. In-line Peptic Digestion/Rapid Desalting HPLC Setup—The setup consisted of two HPLC pumps (Agilent 1100 series; Waldbronn, Germany), a Rheodyne injection valve (Model 7725i; Rheodyne, Rohnert Park, CA) with a 200-μl stainless steel sample loop, and a 2-position/10-port valve with microelectric actuator (Valco C2-1000EP6; Schenkon, Switzerland). A schematic drawing of the setup is shown in Fig. 1. Pump A delivered the solvent for desalting (200 μl/min, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) and pump B for elution (20 μl/min, 70% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Quenched samples were loaded via the injection valve and pushed through the pepsin column (1 × 20 mm) by pump A. The resulting peptic fragments were immediately trapped on a self-packed reversed-phase column (0.8 × 2 mm, Poros R1) for desalting and concentration. After 2 min the 10-port valve was switched to elute the peptides with organic solvent (pump B) directly into the electrospray ion source. At the same time the pepsin column was back-flushed by pump A. The digestion, desalting, and elution required less than 3 min. The whole setup was immersed in an ice bath to minimize back-exchange. For kinetic measurements of the full-length protein the pepsin column was omitted. Mass Spectrometry and Data Treatment—Electrospray ionization mass spectra were acquired on a quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (Q-TOF Ultima, Micromass, Manchester, UK, for full-length σ32, and QSTAR Pulsar, ABI SCIEX, Toronto, Canada, for peptic peptides). Protein mass spectra were deconvoluted with the MaxEnt software (Micromass). Peptic peptides of σ32 were identified on the basis of their MS/MS spectra. The deuterium content of the peptides was calculated by using the average mass difference between the isotopic envelopes of the deuterated and the undeuterated peptides. The average masses were determined with the MagTran software (13Zhang Z. Marshall A.G. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Measurement of the Kinetics of Amide Hydrogen Exchange— To determine the solvent-accessible sites, temperature stability, and conformational changes of σ32 we wanted to probe the overall kinetics of amide hydrogen exchange and then, under identical conditions, localize the fast and slow exchanging regions. Therefore, we needed to efficiently measure the masses of the full-length protein and of peptic peptides generated after the exchange reaction is quenched. To achieve this and to minimize back-exchange during digestion and desalting we built up an on-line “rapid desalting”-HPLC setup consisting of two HPLC pumps, a 2-position/10-port valve, and a 1 μl reversed-phase trap column. This system was coupled on-line to an electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Fig. 1). For the full-length protein, amide hydrogen exchange was initiated by diluting σ32 into D2O-buffer. The exchange reaction was stopped by pH shift to 2.2 and temperature shift to 0 °C. Under these conditions amide hydrogens exchange on average with half-lives of 60-90 min (14Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar), whereas deuterons incorporated into the side chains and amino/carboxyl termini rapidly exchange back to protium. Thus, the mass increase observed after deuteration and desalting reflect primarily deuterium incorporation at the backbone amide groups. For the localization of the fast and slow exchanging regions a 16-μl column packed with immobilized pepsin was used to generate fragments that were subsequently desalted on the trap column and analyzed by MS. The identity of the peptides was established separately by digestion of fully protiated σ32 under identical conditions with subsequent collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry. The very small volumes of the pepsin column (16 μl) and the trap column (1 μl) reduced the time for digestion and desalting to less than 3 min, thereby minimizing the time during which back-exchange could occur. Full-length σ32 Protein Amide Hydrogen Exchange Kinetics—At 37 °C σ32 exchanged about 190 of its 286 amide protons for deuterons within 1 min (Fig. 2a). The degree of deuterium incorporation increased over time leaving maximally 60-70 amide hydrogens (<25% not counting back-exchange) that did not exchange under the experimental conditions within 60 min. The overall kinetics could be fitted to a biexponential equation (Fig. 2b and Table I), indicating that there are two kinetic categories of amide hydrogens in σ32, 203 hydrogens exchanged with a time constant τ of ∼8 s, whereas 30 exchanged with τ = 26 min. The remaining about 50 (17% of total) very slowly exchanging hydrogens participate in a stable structure of specific hydrogen bonds, which is a surprisingly small number. For well folded globular proteins about 50% of the amide hydrogens are found to be protected against exchange after 60 min (examples in Ref. 15Hoofnagle A.N. Resing K.A. Goldsmith E.J. Ahn N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 2W. Rist and M. P. Mayer, unpublished data. These data can be interpreted in two ways. σ32 either is a loosely folded protein with a low secondary structure content, or its structure has a high degree of flexibility.Table IOverall amide hydrogen exchange kineticsA∞B∞k1 (10−3 s−1)C∞k2 (10−3 s−1)37 °C33779 ± 3203.7 ± 3.1118 ± 830.6 ± 2.90.63 ± 0.1742 °C species 1aThe centroids of the lower mass peak (see Fig. 2a) were fitted to the biexponential equation.33774 ± 1205.1 ± 2.0147 ± 922.7 ± 1.31.75 ± 0.3142 °C species 2bThe centroids of the higher mass peak were fitted to the biexponential equation.

Open table in a new tab At 42 °C the initial exchange kinetics was similar albeit slightly faster (205 hydrogens in the order of τ = 7 s, 22 hydrogens with τ = 9.5 min). However, after about 10 min the appearance of a second species was observed that had incorporated an additional 30 deuterons. The amount of this second species increased at the cost of the first species with a half-life of about 30 min (Fig. 2, a and c). In the second species less than 30 hydrogens (10% not counting back-exchange) were protected against exchange. This behavior could indicate a slow loss of secondary structure due to thermal denaturation. To test this possibility we pre-incubated σ32 at 42 °C for one hour before diluting the protein into D2O. The exchange kinetics under these conditions was, however, identical to the kinetics of the protein measured immediately after temperature shift (data not shown). These data indicate that the second species is not due to denaturation but to a reversible unfolding of a small structural motif. Because no intermediates between the first and the second species were observed, the exchange kinetics for the second species occurred in a correlated fashion, i.e. the refolding rate is much slower than the exchange rate (see “Discussion” for explanation). Localization of the Slow and Fast Exchanging Regions by Peptic Digestion—After deuteration, the σ32 protein was digested under quenched conditions using the in-line pepsin column. Fig. 3 shows representative segments of the mass spectra of a fully protiated sample (bottom) and samples deuterated for various periods at 37 and 42 °C. In the fully protiated state each peptide is represented by several peaks on the mass-to-charge (m/z) scale due to the isotopic natural abundance. After incubation in D2O the isotope envelope of most peptide peaks was shifted to higher m/z values due to incorporation of deuterons. For example, the peptides B, C, and D shown in Fig. 3 (m/z 867.695+, aa 121-155; m/z 877.465+, aa 257-294; m/z 880.452+, aa 2-18) exchanged all amide hydrogens within 12 s under the conditions used. In contrast, the peptides A and E (m/z 866.163+, aa 79-101; m/z 885.944+, aa 19-49) exchanged hydrogens much slower, leaving after 90 min 11 and 9 hydrogens unexchanged (Fig. 3 and data not shown). At 42 °C the exchange kinetics for peptide E was similar to that observed at 37 °C. In contrast, for peptide A the exchange kinetics is very different at 42 °C as compared with 37 °C. After 10 min deuteration at 42 °C a bimodal isotope distribution appears. As exchange proceeds, the abundance of the lower mass isotope distribution decreases while a corresponding increase is observed for the higher mass isotope distribution. Such a bimodal isotope distribution is the result of a local unfolding with a lifetime sufficiently long to allow complete exchange of several amide hydrogens within a single opening event. The lower mass isotope distribution represents a population of σ32 molecules that has not yet unfolded whereas the higher mass population has unfolded and undergone the correlated exchange. Close inspection of the data revealed that such a correlated exchange in the part of the protein represented by peptide A also occurs at 37 °C albeit with much slower kinetics (see 60 min trace, Fig. 2a, left panel: shoulder to the higher mass range; 45 and 60 min traces, Fig. 3: peaks between peptide A and B). Using our HPLC-MS setup we were able to map the kinetic exchange profile for peptic peptides of σ32 covering 99% of the sequence of the entire protein (Fig. 4a). Overlapping peptides that differed pairwise only by extensions at the C terminus were used to improve the resolution of the deuteron incorporation map (16Yang H. Smith D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14992-14999Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). For example, peptides 79-89 did not incorporate any deuterons at 37 °C within 10 s, whereas peptides 79-101 incorporated three deuterons under the same conditions. These deuterons can then be localized to the segment spanning residues 90-101. For all pairs of peptides the intrinsic chemical exchange rate for the C-terminal amide hydrogen in the short peptide at quench conditions was found to be comparable with that of the corresponding residue in the extended peptide. In this way it was ensured that the deuterium occupancy for the non-overlapping C-terminal sequence extension was correctly assigned. Fig. 4b shows a plot of the relative deuteron incorporation per amide after 10 s, 2 min, and 90 min at 37 °C and after 90 min at 42 °C against the primary sequence of σ32. The N terminus (residues 2-18) and the C-terminal half of the protein (residues 121-293) incorporate deuterons rapidly. The small decrease in relative exchange at the C terminus is due to the more rapid back-exchange of the amide hydrogens within the His6-tag as calculated according to Englander's algorithm (14Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). In contrast to the exchange behavior of the N terminus and the C-terminal half of the σ32 protein, two regions, residues 79-89 and 104-115, were relatively well protected at 37 °C and showed correlated exchange at 42 °C (Fig. 4b, arrowheads). Homology Modeling of the σ32 Structure—To visualize fast and slow exchanging regions of σ32 we wanted to obtain a suitable model of the σ32 structure. For this purpose we extracted the coordinates of the atomic structure of Thermus thermophilus σ70 out of the Protein Data Bank file of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme (Protein Data Bank code 1IW7; see Ref. 18Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) and used it as a template for homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL (19Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar, 20Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). This approach resulted in a structural model of σ32 residues 48-284, not covering the N terminus, although the homology between σ32 and σ70 extends over the entire sequence of σ32 including the N-terminal part. The reason for the inability to model the N-terminal part in this initial approach was found, by multiple sequence alignment, to be an insertion of 69 residues in T. thermophilus σ70 that does not exist in E. coli σ32. In the σ70 structure this insertion forms a separate part of the σ2 domain whereby the N and C termini of the insertion are close together in space. We therefore removed the coordinates of the intervening residues 111 to 179 from the Protein Data Bank file, connected the C and N termini of residues 110 and 180, and minimized the free energy of this structure using the Discover module of the Insight II program (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). The resulting Protein Data Bank file was used as a template for the modeling of σ32 via the SWISS-MODEL program and yielded a structure model including residues 9-284. The amino acids corresponding to residues 1-8 were not present in the σ70 structure. Based on the secondary structure prediction program PHD, these first amino acids were unstructured, and according to our amide hydrogen exchange data solvent exposed and not involved in any secondary structure stabilizing hydrogen bonds. We therefore added them manually in an extended conformation. Fig. 4c shows the structural model colored according to the degree of amide hydrogen exchange at different time points and temperatures with blue indicating 0-20%, green 20-45%, yellow 45-70%, and red 70-95% deuterium incorporation. 95% was the maximal amount of deuterium incorporation measured due to proton back-exchange during the desalting step. The N-terminal σ2 domain is well structured and shows little deuteron incorporation at 37 °C, whereas the C-terminal half of the model contains very little secondary structure and rapid deuteron incorporation is observed. Although this model of σ32 represents the RNA polymerase-bound form, our data are fully consistent with the model showing fast exchange in unstructured regions and slow exchange in the tightly folded α-helices of domain σ2 responsible for promoter recognition at the -10 region. The precision with which this model fits our amide hydrogen exchange data is demonstrated by a helix-loop-helix element in domain σ2 where deuteron incorporation into the loop region (Fig. 4, b and c, open arrow head) was significantly faster than into the α-helices (Fig. 4, b and c, closed arrow heads). The domain σ4, which recognizes the heat shock promoter at the -35 region, forms a three helix bundle in our model but does not seem to be very tightly packed. Our exchange data show that the helix stabilizing H-bonds in this domain break and reform rapidly allowing deuterium incorporation. After 90 min at 42 °C even in domain σ2 significant deuteron incorporation is observed, demonstrating an increased flexibility and loosening-up of this domain. Mass Spectrometry and Amide Hydrogen Exchange—In this study we developed an on-line rapid desalting-HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry setup that allows the rapid and efficient analysis of the kinetics of amide hydrogen exchange of full-length proteins and the on-line generation of peptic fragments for the localization of fast and slow exchanging regions. In recent years amide hydrogen exchange is being increasingly used for probing protein structure and stability (8Engen J.R. Smith D.L. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 256A-265ACrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Englander S.W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 213-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 10Li R. Woodward C. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1571-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) because it does not depend on the presence of proteolytic cleavage sites or fluorescent markers. Several methods are used to detect amide hydrogen exchange including NMR, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Our rapid desalting HPLC-MS setup has several advantages over other methods. First, low protein concentrations in the μm range can be used as compared with the mm range used in NMR. This was essential in the case of σ32 because the protein tended to aggregate at higher concentrations. Second, several coexisting conformations can be observed at the same time, which allowed the detection of the correlated exchange at 42 °C. In NMR an average exchange rate is determined. Third, sample handling under quenched conditions was fully automated, which guaranteed an exact timing of the digestion and desalting and therefore easily reproducible results. In the case of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-MS pipetting must be very accurate to obtain comparable results. Finally, the information covering close to 100% of the entire protein sequence can be acquired with just one spectrum. Our setup generated highly reproducible peptic digests of the σ32 protein as clearly visible in Fig. 3 and minimized back-exchange to generally less than 10%. Parallel to our work, Smith and co-workers (22Wang L. Pan H. Smith D.L. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 132-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) developed a similar setup. In our study, no adjustment was made for deuterium loss during quenched conditions as described previously (17Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), because we are mainly interested in the difference between the exchange kinetics of σ32 at 37 and 42 °C and not an exact determination of exchange rate constants of individual peptides. Overall Deuteron Incorporation into σ32—We analyzed the exchange kinetics of full-length σ32 and the propensity for deuterium incorporation within 99% of its primary sequence. Our data indicate that σ32 is a relatively loosely folded or highly flexible protein already at the regular growth temperature of E. coli (37 °C). The rapid incorporation of deuterons into the full-length protein as well as the localization of slow and fast exchanging regions showed that only domain σ2 is protected against exchange indicating a stable domain. Except for the part that exchanged in a correlated fashion, the stability of σ32 at 42 °C was similar to its stability at 37 °C as indicated by similar overall exchange kinetics. Heat shock conditions (42 °C) caused a correlated exchange of several amide hydrogens in domain σ2 with a mean half-life of about 30 min that is indicative for a local, reversible unfolding event. These data fit well to our model of the σ32 structure despite the fact that this model was derived by homology modeling to the RNA polymerase-bound form of σ70 (18Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) and not to the uncomplexed structure of this protein. Due to the high sequence coverage and to the precision with which deuteron incorporation could be determined (see helix-loop-helix element), our setup can be used to verify structural models of proteins where no crystal structure is available and to analyze the dynamics of protein structures. A surprising result was that domain σ4, which is responsible for recognition of the -35 region of heat shock promoters, is not better protected against deuteron incorporation and therefore not tightly folded. Maybe the structure of this domain is stabilized upon binding to RNA polymerase and/or DNA. Using circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy on σ32, Chattopadhyay and Roy (23Chattopadhyay R. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33641-33647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) recently observed that the molar elipticity between 200 and 230 nm decreases between 35 and 42 °C, whereas the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence stayed constant. They speculated that the region between residues 181 and 208 unfolds upon temperature up-shift. In contrast, we could now map precisely the unfolding region at the peptide level to residues 79-105 and demonstrate that the unfolding event occurs in a cooperative and reversible manner. This clearly shows the power of amide hydrogen exchange as compared with global structural methods as circular dichroism spectroscopy. In uncomplexed σ32 the domains σ2 and σ4 may pack against each other as suggested by the recent structure of σE in complex with a fragment of its anti-σ-factor RseA (24Campbell E.A. Tupy J.L. Gruber T.M. Wang S. Sharp M.M. Gross C.A. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1067-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, such a packing does not stabilize the domains σ3 and σ4 because our data clearly demonstrate that σ32 adopts loosely folded and highly flexible conformations allowing rapid exchange of the majority of its amide hydrogens. These data and our model show that only the N-terminal σ2 domain is tightly folded and the C-terminal half resembles an unfolded protein. This is consistent with the short in vivo half-life of σ32 at all temperatures and with the fact that σ32 is prone to aggregation at higher concentration. Furthermore, our data explain why σ32 constitutes a substrate for Hsp70 chaperones, which otherwise recognize unfolded proteins. Correlated Exchange (EX1)—To understand the physiological implications of the observed correlated exchange in the helix-loop-helix element of domain σ2 the exchange mechanisms must be considered. For amide hydrogen exchange to occur a structural-specific H-bond between an amide hydrogen and an H-bond acceptor has to open, thereby allowing the catalyst (hydroxide ion) to attack. Such an opening can be a global or local unfolding of a secondary structural element within the native structure of a protein according to Equation 1,F(H)k-1⇄k1U(H)D2O→k2U(D)k1⇄k-1F(D)(Eq. 1) with F and U representing the folded and unfolded conformation of the structural element and k1, k-1, and k2 being the unfolding, refolding, and intrinsic chemical exchange rate constants. There are two limiting cases for the observed exchange rates, called EX1 and EX2. In the EX1 case, the refolding is rate-limiting for the overall exchange kinetics (k-1 ≪ k2), and the amide hydrogens exchange in a correlated manner in each opening event. The observed exchange rate (kobs) is then equal to the unfolding rate (kobs = k1). The signature for EX1 kinetics is a bimodal isotope distribution in peptide mass spectra and the occurrence of two separate, interconverting mass peaks in protein mass spectra. Under native state conditions, however, EX2 is most commonly observed because the rates for unfolding/refolding are generally much greater than the intrinsic chemical exchange rate (k-1 ≫ k2; kobs = k2 × k1/k-1) (25Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York2002: 540-572Google Scholar). The occurrence of two distinct interconverting mass peaks observed in the σ32 protein mass spectra (Fig. 2, 42 °C, 30 min) as well as the bimodal isotope distributions in the mass spectra of some of its peptic peptides (peptide A in Fig. 3 and data not shown) clearly indicate a correlated exchange according to the EX1 mechanism. This correlated exchange observed here in σ32 is interesting from the following structural and physiological points of view. Usually EX1 kinetics are observed in the presence of chemical denaturants because they decrease the refolding rate k-1 without affecting the intrinsic chemical exchange rate k2. Refolding of a protein implicates the formation of H-bonds and a hydrophobic core, which usually occurs very fast in the absence of denaturants (ns to μs; see Ref. 26Eaton W.A. Munoz V. Hagen S.J. Jas G.S. Lapidus L.J. Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 327-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Because the intrinsic chemical exchange rates are in the ms time scale, EX1 is rarely observed under native state conditions (27Deng Y. Smith D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6256-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1282-1289PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, some property of the domain σ2 must impose a slow rate-limiting step on the refolding reaction. Despite extensive analysis of the existing structures of σ-factors and our structural model of σ32, it remained unclear which property of domain σ2 and in particular the highly conserved helix-loop-helix element is responsible for the correlated exchange behavior. The stability of this structural element, however, could be estimated. Because k-1 is at least five-times smaller than the intrinsic chemical exchange rate k2 (for 95% exchange to happen before refolding occurs), k1/k-1 ≤ k1/(k2/5) and the resulting|ΔG| ≤ |R × T × ln(k1/(k2/5))| with R being the universal gas constant and T the absolute temperature. With the values for k1 (3.6 × 10-4 s-1), as determined from the kinetics of the correlated exchange, and k2 (50 s-1), as calculated according to Englander's algorithm using the HXPep-program (Ref. 14Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, courtesy Z. Zhang), ΔG at 42 °C can be calculated to|ΔG| ≤| - 27 kJ/mol|. At 37 °C the unfolding rate k1 was much smaller than at 42 °C, and the helix-loop-helix element was therefore more stable. At intermediate temperatures the correlated exchange occurred with intermediate rates, and the stability of the helix-loop-helix element was between the stability at 37 °C and 42 °C. This structural element seems to be able to “measure” temperature by a gradual increase in unfolding rate, which is equivalent to a gradual decrease in activation energy necessary for its unfolding. Because refolding is comparatively slow, the helix-loop-helix element could act like a metastable switch that becomes more labile with increasing temperatures. What are the physiological implications of these observations? σ32 is a very unstable protein with a half-life of 1 min at 30 °C and 10-15 s at 42 °C in vivo. Recently, it was shown that the membrane AAA+ protease FtsH, which is mainly responsible for the degradation of σ32, does not have a robust unfolding activity and that the thermodynamic stability of the substrate protein is rate-limiting for degradation by FtsH (29Herman C. Prakash S. Lu C.Z. Matouschek A. Gross C.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 659-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In vitro, FtsH degrades σ32 with a half-life of >60 min at 35 °C and 40 min at 44 °C (30Kanemori M. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22002-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data are reflected very closely by our exchange kinetics, suggesting that in vitro the unfolding kinetics of the helix-loop-helix element may be rate-limiting for the degradation of σ32 by FtsH. Consistent with this view is the fact that FtsH degrades proteins processively from one terminus, whereby it needs 5-20 aa for an initial interaction (31Chiba S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4775-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Chiba S. Akiyama Y. Mori H. Matsuo E. Ito K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Herman C. Thévenet D. Boulox P. Walker G.C. D'Ari R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For σ32 it has been shown that the C terminus is not responsible for degradation by FtsH suggesting that degradation proceeds from the N terminus (12Tomoyasu T. Arsene F. Ogura T. Bukau B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5911-5917Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). According to our data and our model of σ32, the N terminus contains a short unfolded stretch, which could be sufficient for recognition by FtsH, followed by the only stable domain σ2. In contrast to in vitro degradation data, in vivo the half-life of σ32 is 10 to 15 s at 42 °C suggesting additional factors may aid degradation of σ32 by promoting the unfolding of the N-terminal domain. In fact, the lack of significant deuteron incorporation at 37 °C within 60 min and the slow in vitro unfolding half-life of 30 min at 42 °C indicate a relatively high stability of this structural element. Furthermore, high stability is very often interrelated to a high refolding rate. The fact that the helix-loop-helix element combines a low unfolding rate with a low refolding rate may facilitate regulation of the heat shock response because once unfolded, degradation of σ32 by FtsH is not hampered by rapid refolding. It has been shown that σ32 production after temperature up-shift is increased due to the melting of the secondary structure of its encoding mRNA and consequently increased translation rates (34Morita M.T. Tanaka Y. Kodama T.S. Kyogoku Y. Yanagi H. Yura T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 35Morita M. Kanemori M. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 401-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The σ32 encoding mRNA therefore has a built-in thermosensor. Our data now suggest that the σ32 protein also has a built-in thermosensor that counteracts the σ32 encoding mRNA. This mechanism of temperature-dependent synthesis and degradation rates may contribute to the stabilization of the σ32 steady-state levels at all temperatures. We thank Z.

Previous work showed that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-stimulated floating collagen matrix contraction is independent of Rho kinase, whereas platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated contraction is Rho kinase-dependent. The current studies were carried out to learn more about the molecular motors responsible for LPA- and PDGF-stimulated contraction. We found that neither PDGF nor LPA-dependent contractile mechanisms require myosin II regulatory light chain kinase or increased phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (measured as diphosphorylation). Low concentrations of the specific myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin blocked PDGF-stimulated matrix contraction and LPA-stimulated retraction of fibroblast dendritic extensions but not LPA-stimulated matrix contraction. These data suggest that PDGF- and LPA-stimulated floating matrix contraction utilize myosin II-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively.

Form and function of multicellular organisms depend on tissue-specific programs of cell motility. Fibroblasts synthesize, organize, and maintain connective tissues during development and in response to injury and fibrotic disease. The motile mechanisms that fibroblasts use to remodel the extracellular matrix during these morphogenetic processes have been studied by using cells cultured in three-dimensional collagen matrices (1Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Hinz B. Chaponnier C. Brown R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar, 2Grinnell F. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 264-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). As fibroblasts exert force on and move collagen fibrils of the matrix, collagen concentration around the cells increases, and the corresponding decrease in matrix volume (typically referred to as contraction) can be measured as a decrease in the diameter of free matrices or a decrease in height of restrained matrices. During contraction of restrained matrices, collagen fibrils become oriented in the same plane as restraint, and mechanical loading develops. In floating matrices, on the other hand, contraction occurs without collagen fibrils developing a particular orientation, and the matrix remains mechanically unloaded (1Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Hinz B. Chaponnier C. Brown R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar, 2Grinnell F.

The signaling mechanisms used by fibroblasts to regulate collagen matrix contraction depend on whether the cells are mechanically loaded or unloaded at the time that contraction is initiated as well as on the growth factor used to initiate contraction. For instance, stimulation of fibroblasts by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 1The abbreviations used are: LPAlysophosphatidic acidPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumMLCmyosin II regulatory light chainFBSfetal bovine serumFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateBSAbovine serum albuminPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidsiRNAsmall interfering RNA. but not by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) causes robust force generation in restrained matrices (6Kolodney M.S.

Floating matrix contraction has presented something of an enigma because LPA stimulation of fibroblasts in floating matrices causes activation of the small G protein Rho (GTP loading) (9Grinnell F. Ho C.H. Tamariz E. Lee D.J. Skuta G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but blocking Rho kinase with the pharmacological reagent Y27632 does not inhibit contraction (10Lee D.J. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Conversely, PDGF stimulation of cells in matrices causes activation of Rac not Rho (9Grinnell F. Ho C.H. Tamariz E. Lee D.J. Skuta G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but blocking Rho kinase inhibits PDGF-stimulated contraction (10Lee D.J. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For fibroblasts migrating on two-dimensional substrata, the ability of cells to exert tractional force on the substratum depends on activation of Rho and Rho kinase (11Beningo K.A. Wang Y.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 79-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 12Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), which is believed to increase cell contraction through increased phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) (13Fukata Y.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In addition to Rho kinase, the spatial and temporal pattern of MLC phosphorylation in fibroblasts is controlled by MLC kinase (15Katoh K. Kano Y. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Fujiwara K. Am. J.

The culture medium was changed every 3–4 days. Cells were harvested by 0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 3 min at 37 °C followed by DMEM, 10% FBS.

Briefly, cells were extracted in extraction buffer (150 mm NaCl, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate, pH 7.0) (100 μl per matrix and 150 μl per 35-mm tissue-culture dish) by homogenization using 100 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer (pestle B; Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ). Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (Beckman Microfuge II) for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were dissolved in 4× reducing sample buffer (250 mm Tris, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 20% mercaptoethanol, 0.04% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Equal amounts of extract (protein determined by lactate dehydrogenase assay) were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 12% acrylamide minislab gels. Transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was carried out at 100 V for 1 h. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TTBS (0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and then incubated with anti-actin antibody (1:1000), anti-MLC kinase antibody (1:1000), anti-MLC antibody (1:1000), or anti-diphospho-MLC (1:400) in blocking solution at 4 °C for 12 h. After washing with TTBS, membranes were incubated with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in 5% milk in TTBS (for anti-actin antibody) or in 3% BSA in TTBS (for anti-MLC kinase antibody and anti-MLC antibody) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in 3% BSA in TTBS (for anti-phospho-MLC) for 1 h. After washing with TTBS, membranes were visualized by the ECL system. Quantitative evaluation of the diphosphorylated and total MLC was performed by densitometric analysis using NIH Image. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells in matrices or on coverslips were fixed for 10 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature, blocked with 1% glycine, 2% BSA in DPBS (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2) for 30 min, and then permeabilized for 15 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in DPBS. Subsequently, the samples were washed with DPBS and treated for 10 min with 1% BSA in DPBS. Primary antibody against vinculin was diluted in 1% BSA in DPBS (1:200) and added to cells for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with DPBS, samples were treated for 10 min with 1% BSA in DPBS, and then FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in 1% BSA in DPBS (1:300) was added to the cells for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with DPBS, samples were treated for 10 min with 1% BSA in DPBS, and then samples were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (8 units/ml) in 1% BSA in DPBS for 30 min at 37 °C. After additional washes, samples were mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount G. Observations were made and images collected with a Nikon Elipse 400 Fluorescent microscope equipped with a Photometrics SenSys camera and MetaView work station. Samples for analysis of MLC kinase were rinsed with PHEM buffer (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9) at 37 °C, fixed for 10 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in PHEM at 37 °C, and then washed with PHEM at 37 °C. Subsequently, the samples were permeabilized for 15 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PHEM. Samples were blocked with 3% goat serum in DPBS for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated with mouse anti-MLC kinase in 3% goat serum in DPBS (1:200) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with DPBS, samples were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in 3% goat serum in DPBS (1:300) for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount G, and observations were made as above. Myosin Light Chain Kinase Gene Silencing—Myosin light chain kinase gene silencing was accomplished using siRNA. Oligonucleotide sequences 5′-CUAGCCACAUGCCGCAGCATT-3′ and 5′-UGCUGCGGCAUGUGGCUAGTT-3′ were obtained from the University of Texas Southwestern siRNA core facility. For annealing, 20 μm of each single-strand 21-nucleotide RNAs was incubated in annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate) for 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 2 h at 37 °C. To accomplish high efficiency transfection, fibroblast cultures (60–70% confluent) were first rinsed with antibiotic-free DMEM and then treated with trypsin-EDTA for 1 min to elicit cell rounding but not detachment. Subsequently, antibiotic-free 10% FBS/DMEM was added 4:1 to quench the trypsinization. After cells were rinsed with antibiotic-free DMEM, they were incubated with Opti-MEM I containing 3.5 μm siRNA annealed oligonucleotides and 3.5% OligofectAMINE diluted 1:5 with antibiotic-free DMEM. After 48 h, transfection medium was removed and replaced with 10% FBS/DMEM containing antibiotics for an additional 24 h at which time cells were subcultured. Rho Kinase and Collagen Matrix Contraction—Fig. 1 shows typical results of experiments measuring the dependence of collagen matrix contraction on Rho kinase activity. Consistent with previous studies (10Lee D.J. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), addition of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 had little effect on LPA-stimulated contraction of floating matrices although PDGF-stimulated contraction was reduced markedly. If, however, matrices were restrained and allowed to develop mechanical loading overnight, then LPA-stimulated contraction became Rho kinase-dependent (10Lee D.J. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Parizi M. Howard E.W. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Yanase M.

Commun. 2000; 277: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). MLC Kinase and Collagen Matrix Contraction—The foregoing results confirmed that LPA-stimulated floating matrix contraction was Rho kinase-independent. In addition to Rho kinase, MLC kinase has been reported to play a role in fibroblast-collagen matrix contraction (24Parizi M. Howard E.W. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 26Takayama Y. Mizumachi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Ehrlich H.P. Rockwell W.B. Cornwell T.L. Rajaratnam J.B.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To test whether MLC kinase was important for LPA-stimulated collagen matrix contraction, experiments were carried out using fibroblasts in which MLC kinase levels were knocked down using the siRNA method. Fig. 2A shows by immunoblotting with anti-MLC kinase antibodies that cell transfection with MLC kinase-specific oligonucleotides but not mock transfection markedly reduced the levels of the two MLC kinase isotypes in human fibroblasts. Actin was used as a loading control. In corresponding fashion, Fig. 2B shows by immunofluorescence that the cortical staining intensity of MLC kinase was reduced in MLC kinase-silenced cells, although background staining of the cell nucleus was similar in specific and mock transformants as well as controls. Fibroblasts in which MLC kinase was determined as above to be reduced were used to measure matrix contraction in the presence of LPA or PDGF with or without the Rho kinase inhibitor added. Fig. 3 shows results from a typical experiment. The extent of contraction of MLC kinase-silenced cells was not detectably different from control cells. Moreover, LPA-stimulated floating matrix contraction occurred in MLC kinase-silenced cells even if Rho kinase also was blocked. MLC Phosphorylation and Collagen Matrix Contraction— Other experiments were carried out to test the effects of LPA and PDGF on MLC phosphorylation with and without Rho kinase inhibitor. Previously, we showed by using the urea-glycerol method that LPA but not PDGF stimulated both mono- and diphosphorylation of fibroblasts on collagen-coated coverslips, but for technical reasons the urea-glycerol method could not be used for fibroblasts in collagen matrices (23Skuta G. Ho C.H. Grinnell F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30163-30168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, MLC phosphorylation in fibroblasts in collagen matrices was assessed using antibodies specific to (di)phosphorylated MLC with total MLC as a loading control. Diphosphorylated MLC as well as the monophosphorylated form has been implicated in cell contractility (28Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8750-8755Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows a representative blot and quantification of results from several experiments. After 15 min of growth factor stimulation, levels of diphosphorylated MLC were highest in cells in LPA-containing medium and lowest in PDGF-containing medium. Prior addition of Rho kinase inhibitor markedly reduced phosphorylation in every case. These observations suggested that stimulation of floating collagen matrix contraction did not require growth factor stimulation of MLC phosphorylation (measured as diphosphorylation). Myosin II and Collagen Matrix Contraction—The foregoing observations suggested that neither MLC kinase nor stimulation of MLC phosphorylation was necessary for collagen matrix contraction. We could not exclude, however, the possibility that residual MLC kinase or constitutive levels of MLC phosphorylation were sufficient for contraction to occur. Additional experiments were carried out to test more directly the role of myosin II in contraction using the specific myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin (30Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows a dose-response curve for the effect of blebbistatin on floating matrix contraction. Concentrations of the drug in the range 5–20 μm markedly inhibited PDGF-dependent contraction, which is the same concentration range that blocks myosin II ATPase activity (30Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, LPA-dependent contraction was only inhibited by blebbistatin at higher drug concentrations. We also tested the effect of blebbistatin on LPA-stimulated retraction of fibroblast dendritic extensions. As described previously, fibroblasts in collagen matrices project and retract a dendritic network of extensions. PDGF stimulates the size and complexity of this network, whereas LPA stimulates its retraction in a Rho kinase-dependent manner (9Grinnell F. Ho C.H. Tamariz E. Lee D.J. Skuta G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Retraction occurs independently of and is not required for matrix contraction (10Lee D.J. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the morphology of fibroblasts with retracted (LPA) and projected (PDGF) extensions. As described previously, addition of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 blocked retraction stimulated by LPA (Fig. 6, LPA+Y27632). Treatment with blebbistatin at 5 (LPA+Bbst5) or 20 μm (Fig. 6, LPA+Bbst20) also blocked LPA-stimulated retraction but had no effect on the extensions formed in the presence of PDGF (PDGF+Bbst20). These findings show that LPA-dependent retraction of fibroblast dendritic extensions requires myosin II. Taken together, the foregoing results indicated that PDGF and LPA stimulated floating collagen matrix contraction through different molecular motors and that LPA was able to exert force by a Rho kinase-independent, myosin II-independent mechanism. Rho Kinase and Cell Spreading on Collagen-coated Coverslips—Finally, experiments were carried out to learn if the LPA-stimulated, Rho kinase-independent mechanism of force generation also could be demonstrated during cell spreading on collagen-coated coverslips. Fig. 7 shows that in PDGF-containing medium, fibroblasts spread with prominent stress fibers (actin staining) and focal adhesions (vinculin). In the presence of the Rho kinase inhibitor (Fig. 7, PDGF+Y), focal adhesions and stress fibers were mostly lost. Instead of broad lamellae, cells had long dendritic extensions. Therefore, fibroblasts on collagen-coated surfaces in PDGF-containing medium required Rho kinase to generate tractional force for flattening and formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. Fibroblasts incubated on collagen-coated coverslips in LPA-containing medium also developed stress fibers and focal adhesions but tended to be much less polarized than cells in PDGF-containing medium. Fibroblasts in medium containing LPA and Rho kinase inhibitor became more polarized but, unlike cells in PDGF medium, often retained regions of broad lamellae as well as stress fibers and focal adhesions. These observations indicated that there was a Rho kinase-independent mechanism of force generation. Further evidence for this mechanism was obtained when LPA was added to fibroblasts previously incubated in medium with PDGF + Rho kinase inhibitor (Fig. 7, PDGF+Y/LPA), in which case the dendritic extensions became more lamellar and reformed stress fibers and focal adhesions even in the continuous presence of the Rho kinase inhibitor. Conversely, addition of LPA to cells previously stimulated with PDGF resulted in decreased polarization (not shown). Addition of 20 μm blebbistatin to the incubations in place of Rho kinase inhibitor also caused fibroblasts in PDGF-containing medium to display the dendritic morphology, whereas cells in LPA-containing medium retained regions of broad lamellae as well as stress fibers and focal adhesions (not shown). Finally, experiments were carried out to assess MLC diphosphorylation in cells on collagen-coated surfaces. Fig. 8 shows that MLC diphosphorylation was elevated in cells in LPA-containing medium but markedly reduced under all conditions in the presence of the Rho kinase inhibitor. The current studies were carried out to learn more about the molecular motors responsible for LPA- and PDGF-stimulated fibroblast-collagen matrix contraction. Our findings suggest that PDGF- and LPA-stimulated floating matrix contractions utilize myosin II-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively. Previous studies (10Lee D.J. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggested that LPA-stimulated force generation by fibroblasts in floating collagen matrices does not require Rho kinase activity. In the current work, we found that fibroblasts contracted the matrices even when MLC kinase was knocked down using siRNA, and Rho kinase was inhibited. Moreover, in the presence of Rho kinase inhibitor, MLC diphosphorylation was substantially reduced. Although these findings suggested that contraction was independent of MLC phosphorylation, we could not exclude the possibility that residual MLC kinase or constitutive levels of MLC phosphorylation were sufficient for contraction to occur. Monophosphorylated MLC might have been sufficient (28Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8750-8755Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 29Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Additional experiments were carried out, therefore, using the specific myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin. At concentrations sufficient to inhibit myosin II ATPase activity (30Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), blebbistatin blocked not only PDGF-dependent floating matrix contraction but also LPA-dependent retraction of the dendritic network of cellular extensions. LPA-stimulated retraction of fibroblast dendritic extensions is a Rho kinase-dependent activity independent from and not required for floating matrix contraction (10Lee D.J. Ho C.-H. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although blebbistatin also blocked LPA-dependent floating matrix contraction, inhibition only occurred at concentrations above those shown to be required to inhibit myosin II. Taken together, the foregoing results suggested that LPA can stimulate floating matrix contraction through a molecular motor other than myosin II. Myosin Ic recently was shown to play a role in retraction of the neuronal growth cone lamellipodium (31Diefenbach T.J. Latham V.M. Yimlamai D. Liu C.A. Herman I.M. Jay D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but preliminary studies using siRNA specific for myosin Ic demonstrated that myosin Ic knockdown did not affect LPA-dependent floating matrix contraction. 2M. Abe, C.-H. Ho, K. E. Kamm, and F. Grinnell, unpublished observations. Also, it has been hypothesized that microtubule dynamics might play a role in exerting force on the cell plasma membrane (32Inoue S. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because addition of the microtubule disrupting reagents nocodazole or vinblastine or the microtubule-stabilizing drug taxol at concentrations expected to interfere with microtubule dynamics but not structure had little effect on matrix contraction.2 Future studies will be required to discover the myosin II-independent mechanism of LPA-stimulated floating collagen matrix contraction. Because collagen in these matrices is highly compliant, sufficient force to move collagen fibrils bound to the cell surface might be provided by actin polymerization and retrograde flow which can occur independently of myosin II (31Diefenbach T.J.

Whatever the molecular mechanism of LPA-stimulated floating matrix contraction, it is clearly different from LPA-stimulated stressed matrix contraction. Just as cellular adhesions can undergo resistance-induced strengthening (36Pelham Jr., R.J. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PDGF-dependent floating matrix contraction required myosin II judging from its sensitivity to inhibition by blebbistatin and the Rho kinase inhibitor. MLC kinase did not appear to be required, however, and no stimulation of MLC-diphosphorylation was detected, consistent with previous observations of PDGF-treated cells on planar surfaces (21Ai S.

Because PDGF treatment of fibroblasts in collagen matrices activates Rac and not Rho (9Grinnell F. Ho C.H. Tamariz E. Lee D.J. Skuta G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), as has been shown for cells on planar surfaces (42Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J.

Critchley D.R. Ridley A.J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1997; 4: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). One of the implications of our findings was that human fibroblasts spreading on collagen-coated coverslips in the presence of LPA but not PDGF might have a Rho kinase-independent mechanism for exerting force. This was the case, because blocking Rho kinase in cells spreading the presence of PDGF caused loss of most stress fibers and focal adhesions, and the cells became highly dendritic similar to fibroblasts in collagen matrices in the presence of PDGF (9Grinnell F. Ho C.H. Tamariz E. Lee D.J. Skuta G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), whereas fibroblasts spreading in the presence of LPA and Rho kinase inhibitor retained broad lamellar regions with residual stress fibers and focal adhesions, even if the LPA was added to cells that already had first become dendritic in the presence of PDGF and Rho kinase inhibitor. Finally, our studies have important implications for understanding matrix remodeling during wound repair. Myofibroblasts, which utilize Rho/Rho kinase, myosin light chain phosphorylation, and α-smooth muscle actin for matrix remodeling and contraction (1Tomasek J.J. Gabbiani G. Hinz B. Chaponnier C.

The present research implicates PDGF/Rho kinase-dependent and LPA/Rho kinase-independent mechanisms as potential candidates to explain this phenomenon. We are indebted to Drs. David Lee, Gang Zhi, and HongMei Jiang for advice and assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2085920214,"Dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) catalyzes the production of norepinephrine, and its expression defines the noradrenergic phenotype. Transcription factors dHAND, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, and Arix/Phox2a, a homeoprotein, have been demonstrated to play a role in the differentiation and maintenance of catecholaminergic neurons. Three Arix regulatory sites have been identified in the DBH promoter proximal region, but there is no such evidence for dHAND. Cotransfection with a DBH promoter-luciferase reporter construct plus dHAND or dHAND-E12 expression plasmids did not alter luciferase activity, whereas transfection with Arix resulted in a 2.5-fold stimulation of luciferase activity. However, a 5.5-fold increase was observed when Arix and dHAND were combined, and an 8-fold level of expression was observed when Arix was transfected with a dHAND mutant lacking the basic DNA-binding domain. When the homeodomain sites in the DBH promoter proximal region were mutated, all activity was lost, demonstrating dependence upon Arix-DNA interaction for transcriptional activation. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the addition of dHAND decreased the amount of Arix needed to elicit a mobility shift with the DBH homeodomain sites, and the dHAND basic mutant potentiated Arix binding in a manner similar to wild-type dHAND. The dHAND-Arix complex was dissociated upon the addition of an unlabeled competitor containing a homeodomain, but not upon the addition of a competitor containing E-boxes. Arix coprecipitated with antisera directed against recombinant dHAND, demonstrating direct protein-protein interactions. These results indicate that the activation of the DBH promoter by Arix is potentiated by dHAND via a mechanism independent of a direct interaction of dHAND with DNA. Dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) catalyzes the production of norepinephrine, and its expression defines the noradrenergic phenotype. Transcription factors dHAND, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, and Arix/Phox2a, a homeoprotein, have been demonstrated to play a role in the differentiation and maintenance of catecholaminergic neurons. Three Arix regulatory sites have been identified in the DBH promoter proximal region, but there is no such evidence for dHAND. Cotransfection with a DBH promoter-luciferase reporter construct plus dHAND or dHAND-E12 expression plasmids did not alter luciferase activity, whereas transfection with Arix resulted in a 2.5-fold stimulation of luciferase activity. However, a 5.5-fold increase was observed when Arix and dHAND were combined, and an 8-fold level of expression was observed when Arix was transfected with a dHAND mutant lacking the basic DNA-binding domain. When the homeodomain sites in the DBH promoter proximal region were mutated, all activity was lost, demonstrating dependence upon Arix-DNA interaction for transcriptional activation. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the addition of dHAND decreased the amount of Arix needed to elicit a mobility shift with the DBH homeodomain sites, and the dHAND basic mutant potentiated Arix binding in a manner similar to wild-type dHAND. The dHAND-Arix complex was dissociated upon the addition of an unlabeled competitor containing a homeodomain, but not upon the addition of a competitor containing E-boxes. Arix coprecipitated with antisera directed against recombinant dHAND, demonstrating direct protein-protein interactions. These results indicate that the activation of the DBH promoter by Arix is potentiated by dHAND via a mechanism independent of a direct interaction of dHAND with DNA. Cell-specific transcription is accomplished by the precise and transient interactions of numerous and complex molecular factors. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLHbasic helix-loop-helixHDhomeodomainEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayDBHdopamine β-hydroxylaseRTreverse transcriptionHAhemagglutininGSTglutathione S-transferase. proteins are transcription factors that play an important role in the development and differentiation of specific cell types such as neurons (1.Goridis C.

These bHLH proteins have been shown to bind to defined consensus sites, E-boxes (CANNTG), through the basic domain and require dimerization partners (via helices) to activate transcription. These proteins have been divided into several classes based on structure, function, and tissue specificity. Class I bHLH proteins (E12 and E47) are expressed ubiquitously in all tissues and can function as homodimers, but prefer to form heterodimers with other bHLH proteins (5.Massari M.B. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Class II proteins (dHAND, NeuroD, and MyoD) are expressed in specific tissues and are believed to be functionally active when complexed with a class I protein (5.Massari M.B. Murre C. Mol. Cell.

Recent evidence has demonstrated that the expression of genes that lead to norepinephrine production can be elicited by ectopic dHAND expression in avian embryos (15.Howard M. Stanke M. Schneider C.

Several of the class II bHLH proteins have been shown to associate with other transcription factors. For example, NeuroD1-E47 interacts with Pitx1, a homeodomain (HD) protein, to regulate expression of the pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin gene (17.Poulin G. Lebel M. Chamberland M. Paradis F.W. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4826-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and this interaction is dependent on both transcription factors binding to the promoter. MyoD-E12 associates with myocyte enhancer factor-2A, a member of the MADS family, to activate myogenesis, but only one of these factors (either myocyte enhancer factor-2A or the MyoD-E12 complex) needs to interact with the DNA to activate transcription (3.Mokentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). dHAND has been shown to associate with the bHLH proteins E12 (6.Dai Y.-S. Cserjesi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12604-12612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and eHAND (18.Firulli B.A. Hadzic D.B. McDaid J.R. Firulli A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33567-33573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and GATA4 and p300 (19.Dai Y.-S. Cserjesi P. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24390-24398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); and the cardio-specific enhancer adenylosuccinate synthetase was the first target gene for dHAND (20.Lewis A.L. Yang X. Datta S.K. McMillin J. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14188-14197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, all of these studies demonstrated the dependence of dHAND binding to E-boxes within the promoter region to activate gene expression. Recently, it has been shown that ectopically expressed dHAND induces digit duplication in transgenic mice, and similar effects were observed with a dHAND mutant lacking the basic domain, but this mutant was not able to activate transcription in reporter assays when expressed with E12 or to bind to DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (21.McFadden D.G. McAnally J. Richardson J.A. Charité J. Olson E.N. Development. 2002; 129: 3077-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These latter results suggest that dHAND could activate transcription independent of direct DNA binding, but other proteins are required to recruit dHAND to the promoter region. Sympathetic neurons are derived from neural crest cells, and their development is controlled by the correct expression of several transcription factors that form a complex regulatory network rather than a linear cascade. During embryogenesis, bone morphogenic proteins induce the expression of the bHLH protein MASH, the HD proteins NBPhox/Phox2b and Arix/Phox2a, and dHAND (1.Goridis C. Rohrer H. Nat. Neurosci. Rev. 2002; 3: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Neural crest-derived cells treated with antisense transcript encoding HAND genes have an 80% decrease in neurogenesis and a 60% decrease in catecholaminergic differentiation (13.Howard M. Foster D.N. Cserjesi P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 62-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, when dHAND was overexpressed in avian neural crest cells, mRNAs encoding the noradrenergic biosynthetic enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) were detected, indicating a potential role of dHAND in catecholaminergic cell development. Arix regulates norepinephrine biosynthesis by directly binding to three HD sites (ATTA) in the 5′-upstream region of the DBH gene (22.Zellmer E. Zhang Z. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Adachi M. Browne D. Lewis E.J. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 539-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24.Kim H.S. Seo H. Yang C. Brunet J.F. Kim K.-S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8247-8260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DBH promoter region also contains two putative E-box motifs (CAATTG and CAAATG), yet neither matches the dHAND consensus sequence (CATCTG) determined by the in vitro CASTing method (6.Dai Y.-S. Cserjesi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12604-12612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Arix and dHAND are expressed at the same time in development (15.Howard M. Stanke M. Schneider C. Wu X. Rohrer H. Development. 2000; 127: 4073-4081PubMed Google Scholar), but the interactions between dHAND and Arix and their effect on the noradrenergic phenotype are not yet known. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interactions between dHAND and Arix at the DBH promoter region. In this study, we demonstrate that dHAND interacts directly with Arix to cooperatively activate transcription of the DBH promoter. Whereas the action of Arix is dependent upon the presence of its DNA recognition sites, the action of dHAND is independent of DNA binding. RT-PCR—RNA was isolated from tissues and cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. RNA (2.5 μg), oligo(dT) (500 ng; Invitrogen), and dNTPs (10 mm each) were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and transferred to ice for 2 min. Dithiothreitol (10 mm) and 5× buffer were added and incubated at 42 °C for 2 min. Superscript reverse transcriptase (200 units; Invitrogen) was added and incubated at 42 °C for 50 min. The reaction was stopped by incubating the samples at 70 °C for 10 min. 2 μl of the RT reaction was used for PCR. The PCR mixture contained 100 ng of each primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 200 nm dNTP. Mixtures were heated at 94 °C for 3 min and at 80 °C for 2 min; 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega) was added; and reactions were cycled at 94 °C for 45 s, at 60 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles, followed by a 10-min polymerization step at 72 °C. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 6% acrylamide gels. Primers used for amplification of cDNAs are as follows: mouse and rat dHAND, 5′-TCCAAGATCAAGACACTGCG-3′ and 5′-CGTTGCTGCTCACTGTGC-3′; human dHAND, 5′-GGCAGAGATCAAGAAGACCG-3′ and 5′-CGTTGCTGCTCACTGTGC-3′; mouse, rat, and human tyrosine hydroxylase, 5′-CATTGGACTTGCATCTCTGG-3′ and 5′-GTTCCTGAGCTTGTCCTTGG-3′; mouse, rat, and human Arix, 5′-GGAAGCCCTTTCTTGCTAGG-3′ and 5′-AACCACTTTGTTCCGTTCCC-3′; mouse and rat DBH, 5′-AAGGTGGTTACTGTGCTCGC-3′ and 5′-CACACATCTCCTCCAAGATTCC-3′; human DBH, 5′-TCAACAACGAGGATGTCTGC-3′ and 5′-CAGTGTGGAGATGACCTTGG-3′; mouse and rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TTCAACGGCACAGTCAAGG-3′ and 5′-TCCACGACATACTCAGCACC-3′; and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CAACGACCACTTTGTCAAGC-3′ and 5′-GGTCTCTCTCTTCCTCTTGTGC-3′. Plasmid Constructs—The construction of the DBH-(-232/+10)-luciferase reporter plasmid containing the promoter and the 5′-flanking sequence was described previously (25.Swanson D.J. Adachi M. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2911-2923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). dHAND-BSKS was a generous gift from Dr. Marthe Howard (Medical College of Ohio). To clone dHAND into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.0, a BamI/XhoI fragment from dHAND-BSKS containing the complete coding sequence was inserted into the vector. To construct dHAND-HA6.1, a full-length dHAND PflMI/XhoI fragment was ligated to an oligonucleotide to create a second XhoI site, and then the entire fragment was cloned into the XhoI site of HA6.1. To create His-dHAND, the XhoI fragment from dHAND-HA6.1 was inserted into pET28b (Novagen). The construction of His-Arix-pET28b from HA-Arix-pcDNA3.0 was described previously (23.Adachi M. Browne D. Lewis E.J. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 539-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MyoD-pGEX6 was kindly provided by Dr. Matt Thayer (Oregon Health and Sciences University). pcDNA3.1-dHAND-wt (where “wt” is wild-type), pcDNA3.1-dHAND-RRR109–111EDE (dHAND-EDE), and pcDNA3.1-dHAND-basic deletion (dHAND-Δbasic) were generously provided by Dr. Eric Olson (University of Texas). To create His-tagged dHAND-Δbasic, the StuI/PstI fragment of pcDNA3.1-dHAND-Δbasic was cloned into pET28b-His-dHAND. All dHAND clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfections and Reporter Assays—NT2 teratocarcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 g/liter streptomycin, and 10 g/liter penicillin. Cells were plated at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/well 1 day prior to transfection. All transfections were performed in 6-well plates with Genefector (Venn Nova, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of pRL-null (Promega), 0.1 μg of DBH-luciferase, 0.4 μg of Arix, 0.4 μg of E12, 0.5 μg of dHAND-HA, 0.8 μg of wild-type dHAND, 0.8 μg of dHAND-EDE, and 0.8 μg of dHAND-Δbasic. Initial studies determined the amount of each dHAND contract that produced maximal luciferase activity. The total amount of DNA in each transfection was adjusted to 2.8 μg using the backbone vector pcDNA3.0. Experiments were done in triplicate and repeated three times. All cells were transiently transfected with pRL-null as a control for transfection efficiency. Expression of Recombinant Proteins—The pET and pGEX plasmids were transformed into the bacterial host BL21(DE3). Log-phase bacterial cultures were treated with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in sonication buffer (23.Adachi M. Browne D. Lewis E.J. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 539-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and sonicated. Soluble fractions were applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.), and His-tagged proteins were eluted by stepwise gradients of imidazole-containing elution buffer. The concentration of His-tagged proteins was estimated by Western analysis using nickel-labeled horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.). The GST-tagged MyoD soluble fraction was applied to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and eluted with 20 mm glutathione. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). EMSAs—To create a probe spanning rat DBH sequence -183 to -57, the primer pair 5′-ATGATGTCCATGCGTCATTAGTGTCAATTAGGGG-3′ (corresponding to bases -183 to -150 of the mouse DBH promoter) and 5′-CAAATGTGATTAGGTAC-3′ (corresponding to bases -73 to -57 of the mouse DBH promoter) was γ-32P-end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and used to amplify the DBH DNA. The PCR was the same as described above with 100 ng of template. The resulting DNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on 3% low melting point agarose. The correct band was excised and digested by β-agarase (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, MA) according to the manufacturer's directions. Labeled probe (10,000 cpm, Cerenkov counts) and recombinant proteins (0.625 μg of Arix and 2 μg each of dHAND, E12, and MyoD) were added to binding reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.5 μg poly(dI-dC)), incubated on ice for 30 min, and resolved on 6% acrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. Autoradiographs were quantitated by densitometry. In Vitro Protein Interactions—For the in vitro protein-protein interaction assay, dHAND, dHAND-Δbasic, and c-Jun were transcribed in the presence of [35S]methionine by the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). GST-Arix (10 μg) was conjugated to glutathioneagarose beads and incubated with 5 μl of in vitro translated labeled proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose was washed five times with buffer (10 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the resin was boiled for 3 min with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation of Arix—SK-N-SH cells were transfected with 10 μg of dHAND-HA in pcDNA3; and after 2 days, 300 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was added. After 3 weeks, cells were isolated and maintained with G418. The expression of dHAND-HA was confirmed by Western blotting. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline/Tween and 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C with rat anti-HA antibody (200 ng/ml in Tris-buffered saline/Tween and 5% milk; Roche Applied Science), washed, incubated with sheep anti-rat horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:8000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween and 5% milk), and washed; and immunoreactive bands were visualized with Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescence solution (Pierce). Nuclear proteins were extracted from SK-N-SH cells and SK-N-SH cells that had been stably transfected with dHAND-HA using the CellLytic NuClear extraction kit (Sigma) and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5mm dithiothreitol to remove salts. Nuclear proteins (300 μg) were incubated with 200 ng/ml anti-HA antibody overnight and precipitated with 30 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science). Precipitates were washed five times with 10 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; boiled, subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis; and transferred to membranes. After the blocking step, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with chicken anti-Arix antibody (1:500), washed, incubated with goat anti-chicken horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:5000), and washed; and immunoreactive bands were visualized with a 50:50 mixture of Super Signal West Pico and Femto chemiluminescence solutions. Distribution of dHAND mRNA—To evaluate the distribution of dHAND in catecholaminergic cells, the expression of dHAND mRNA in various cell types and tissues was evaluated by RT-PCR. dHAND mRNA was not detected in NT2 teratocarcinoma cells, but was detected in adrenal gland-derived PC-12 cells and in the following neuroblastoma cell lines: CATH.a, M17, SH-SY5Y, and SK-N-SH (Fig. 1 and Table I). dHAND mRNA (adult rat and mouse) was not detected in mouse kidney or pons medulla, but was detected in mouse adrenal gland, rat heart, and sympathetic ganglia. The expression of dHAND mRNA in sympathoadrenal tissue correlated with the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, DBH, and Arix. Previous work has demonstrated the expression of dHAND in fetal and embryonic human sympathetic neuronal tissue (14.Gestblom C. Grynfeld A. Øra I. Örtoft E. Larsson C. Axelson H. Sandstedt B. Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Påhlman S. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 67-79PubMed Google Scholar), but this is the first evidence of dHAND mRNA in adult sympathoadrenal tissue. All RT reactions were run with and without Superscript, and no products were observed in the treatments lacking Superscript (data not shown).Table IDistribution of dHAND, tryrosine hydroxylase, DBH, and Arix mRNAs in cell lines and tissues as determined by RT-PCRCell type/tissuedHANDTHaTyrosine hydroxylaseDBHArixNT2————PC-12++++CATH.a++++M17++++SH-SY5Y++++SK-N-SH++++Mouse kidney————Mouse pons medulla—+++Mouse adrenal gland++++Rat heart+———Rat sympathetic ganglia++++a Tyrosine hydroxylase Open table in a new tab Transient Transfection Assays—The DBH promoter contains three HD sites (ATTA) that interact with Arix (22.Zellmer E.

To investigate the ability of dHAND to interact with Arix at the DBH promoter region, NT2 cells were transiently transfected with the DBH-(-232/+10)-luciferase reporter plasmid plus various expression plasmids. When cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.0 backbone plasmid, basal levels of expression were observed (Fig. 3A). Transfection of NT2 cells with dHAND, dHAND-E12, or MyoD-E12 expression plasmids resulted in luciferase activity that was unchanged from basal activity. When the Arix plasmid was added to the transfection, the relative luciferase activity increased to 2.5-fold over basal levels. This amount of Arix is below that which maximally stimulates the DBH-luciferase constructs (23.Adachi M. Browne D. Lewis E.J. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 539-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When dHAND was added in the presence of Arix, the activity increased to 5.3-fold; however, when similar amounts of MyoD were added with Arix, expression was similar to that with Arix alone. Therefore, it appears that, together, dHAND and Arix interact synergistically to activate the DBH promoter.Fig. 3Transcriptional activities of dHAND and Arix on the DBH promoter.A, NT2 cells were transfected with the DBH-(-232/+10)-luciferase reporter and pcDNA3.0 expression vectors encoding dHAND, E12, Arix, and MyoD.

C, NT2 cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant DBH-luciferase reporters and pcDNA3.0 expression vectors encoding Arix and dHAND.

Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). However, recent data have indicated that dHAND may be able to mediate expression via protein-protein interactions independent of DNA binding (21.McFadden D.G. McAnally J. Richardson J.A. Charité J. Olson E.N. Development. 2002; 129: 3077-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Thattaliyath B. Firulli B.A. Firulli A.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether the basic DNA-binding domain of dHAND is required for the activation of the DBH promoter, NT2 cells were transfected with two different dHAND mutants. dHAND-EDE has a mutation in the basic region (R109E/R110D/R111E), and dHAND-Δbasic lacks the entire 10-amino acid basic region. Previous work has demonstrated that these mutants cannot activate transcription from a consensus E-box in a transient transfection assay, but they are still able to cause limb abnormalities similar to those caused by wild-type dHAND in transgenic embryos (21.McFadden D.G. McAnally J. Richardson J.A. Charité J. Olson E.N. Development. 2002; 129: 3077-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No activation was observed when NT2 cells were transfected with dHAND, dHANDEDE, or dHAND-Δbasic alone (Fig. 3B), and no activation was observed when E12 was added to the assay (data not shown). As observed in the previous experiments, transfection with Arix alone resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in expression, whereas Arix and dHAND caused a 5.2-fold increase in expression (Fig. 3B). When dHAND-EDE was transfected with Arix, a 6.6-fold increase in expression was observed; and when dHAND-Δbasic was transfected with Arix, an 8.1-fold increase was observed (Fig. 3B). Because expression of the DBH promoter was observed with Arix and with both of the dHAND basic mutants, it appears that the basic region of dHAND is not needed for activation of the DBH promoter, suggesting that activation by dHAND is independent of DNA binding. Previous research has demonstrated that Arix activates transcription of the DBH promoter via three HD sites and that transcriptional activity is lost if these sites are mutated (25.Swanson D.J. Adachi M. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2911-2923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether dHAND and Arix contact the DBH promoter through the HD sites, NT2 cells were transfected with DBH-luciferase plasmids containing mutations in the HD sites. Transfection of wild-type DBH-luciferase with dHAND resulted in basal levels; transfection with Arix resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in luciferase activity; and the addition of dHAND to Arix doubled the luciferase activity elicited with Arix alone (Fig. 3C). In DBH-luciferase constructs containing a mutation in HD1 plus HD2 or HD3, basal activity was observed in cells treated with Arix, but 2.2- and 1.7-fold increases in activity were observed when dHAND was added to Arix. These results demonstrate that dHAND can stimulate the transcriptional activation by Arix though either HD site. Without the three HD sites, no activity was observed when cells were transfected with pcDNA3, dHAND, Arix, or dHAND plus Arix. Moreover, no activity was observed when cells were cotransfected with the DBH-luciferase construct containing mutations in all three HD sites and dHAND-EDE plus Arix or dHAND-Δbasic plus Arix (data not shown). These data indicate that each of the HD sites contributes to the activation of the DBH promoter region by Arix and dHAND and that the transcriptional activation is dependent upon the presence of the Arix-binding sites. Interactions between dHAND, Arix, and the DBH Promoter in Vitro—To further characterize the interaction between Arix and dHAND, we utilized EMSA to investigate the physical interactions between dHAND and Arix at the DBH promoter proximal region. The DBH-(-183/-57) probe containing all three HD sites and both putative E-box motifs (Fig. 2) was used to assay DNA-protein interactions. When His-dHAND was incubated with the radiolabeled DBH probe, there was no difference between it and the control lane of the probe alone (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 3). Moreover, when dHAND was i"

We assessed the native embryonic isoform, the native indirect flight muscle isoform, and two chimeric isoforms containing converter domains exchanged between the indirect flight muscle and embryonic isoforms. Myosin was purified from the indirect flight muscles of transgenic flies, and S1 was produced by α-chymotryptic digestion. Previous studies in vertebrate and scallop myosins have shown a correlation between actin filament velocity in motility assays and cross-bridge detachment rate, specifically the rate of ADP release. In contrast, our study showed no correlation between the detachment rate and actin filament velocity in Drosophila myosin isoforms and further that the converter domain does not significantly influence the biochemical kinetics governing the detachment of myosin from actin. We suggest that evolutionary pressure on a single muscle myosin gene may maintain a fast detachment rate in all isoforms. As a result, the attachment rate and completion of the power stroke or the equilibrium between actin·myosin·ADP states may define actin filament velocity for these myosin isoforms.

Cyclical shortening and lengthening of a muscle fiber is the direct result of myosin cross-bridges transiently interacting with actin filaments utilizing the energy from ATP hydrolysis. Specific muscle fibers show characteristic biochemical and mechanical properties that are largely governed by the isoform of myosin expressed (1.Pette D. Staron R.S. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 116: 1-76PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that the overall cross-bridge cycle of muscle myosin is conserved; thus alterations in this cycle are the result of changes in the biochemical kinetic constants of individual events resulting directly from myosin sequence changes. Recent work supports the inference that in Drosophila muscle myosin isoform functional diversity is the result of kinetic differences governing strong binding attachment and/or detachment kinetics rather than changes in step size (3.Palmiter K.A.

Functional studies of these natural variants along with intentionally modified myosin isoforms have begun to probe the structure-function relationship critical to elucidating the molecular mechanism of myosin (for reviews, see Refs. 12.Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C.

To study specific regions and amino acids within myosin that define the complex structure-function relationship, we have turned to the genetically tractable organism, Drosophila melanogaster. This model system allows the creation of transgenic organisms containing altered regions or amino acids within myosin to probe the functional contribution of these residues in the mechanochemical cycle (14.Swank D.M.

These myosin isoform differences modulate the mechanical performance of the muscle fiber in which they are expressed (15.Swank D.M. Knowles A.F. Suggs J.A. Sarsoza F. Lee A. Maughan D.W. Bernstein S.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A kinetic analysis of the Drosophila native and mutant myosin isoforms will yield further insight into the molecular mechanism underlying myosin function. To date, at least 15 different muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms are known to be expressed in Drosophila (16.George E.L. Ober M.B. Emerson Jr., C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2957-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17.Hastings G.A. Emerson Jr., C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18.Kronert W.A.

Isoform differences are coded for by six sets of alternative exons (16.George E.L. Ober M.B. Emerson Jr., C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2957-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) that generate amino acid sequence variation; four of these regions are found in the catalytic domain, one is found in the hinge region of the rod region, and one is found at the C terminus of the rod region (for an overview, see Ref. 9.Bernstein S.I.

Biol. 1998; 453: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, we studied two chimeric myosin isoforms in which the converter domain was genetically swapped between the IFI and EMB isoforms (Fig. 1) to create IFI-EC (IFI isoform with embryonic converter domain) and EMB-IC (EMB isoform with IFI converter domain) (15.Swank D.M.

This converter domain was identified by Dominguez et al. (23.Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C.

To characterize these isoforms, the EMB and converter chimeric myosins were transgenically expressed in the indirect flight muscle (IFM) of an IFM myosin null mutant such that the only alteration in the fibers was the myosin isoform (4.Swank D.M.

IFI and EMB fibers subjected to sinusoidal length oscillation experiments reveal profound differences in their mechanical properties (15.Swank D.M. Knowles A.F. Suggs J.A. Sarsoza F. Lee A. Maughan D.W. Bernstein S.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 312-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These differences are also present in isolated myosin studies that show the IFI isoform moves filamentous actin 9-fold faster than the EMB isoform in the in vitro motility assay (4.Swank D.M.

Early studies revealed that differences in contraction velocity of a muscle fiber (24.Barany M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1967; 50: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 25.Marston S.B. Taylor E.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 573-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) are correlated with changes in the biochemical kinetics of a given myosin isoform. In a seminal work, Siemankowski et al. (26.Siemankowski R.F. Wiseman M.O. White H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) postulated that the rate of ADP release, a parameter governing the detachment rate, was the major contributor in defining the shortening velocity of a specific muscle type. This conclusion has been supported by two recent studies of isolated mammalian β-cardiac and skeletal muscle myosin isoforms (27.Pereira J.S. Pavlov D. Nili M. Greaser M. Homsher E. Moss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4409-4415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28.Weiss S. Rossi R. Pellegrino M.-A. Bottinelli R. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45902-45908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In an initial study of the IFI isoform, Silva et al. (29.Silva R. Sparrow J. Geeves M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the rate of ADP release from IFI S1 is of the right order to define the velocity of the IFM. The prediction is therefore that for slower Drosophila myosin isoforms ADP release will be correspondingly slower. However, in the work reported here, we show unexpectedly that the rate of ADP release does not correlate with the speed of the myosin isoform. These data suggest the detachment rate is not limiting for EMB and that a novel mechanism for modulating myosin kinetics exists in Drosophila. In addition, we found that the converter domain does not have a major influence in modulating any of the parameters measured here. The implications for these novel findings are discussed. Drosophila Myosin Isolation and S1 Production—Myosin was isolated from the IFM of 150–180 wild-type or transgenic flies (those expressing the EMB, EMB-IC, or IFI-EC myosin isoforms in the IFM) as described previously (4.Swank D.M. Bartoo M.L. Knowles A.F. Iliffe C. Bernstein S.I. Molloy J.E. Sparrow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15117-15124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The final myosin pellets were resuspended in 75–100 μl of digestion buffer (120 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mm DTT), and the production of S1 by α-chymotrypsin digestion was carried out using a method based on Silva et al. (29.Silva R. Sparrow J. Geeves M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Resuspended myosin was incubated at 20 °C for 5 min and then incubated with 0.2 mg/ml α-chymotrypsin for 6 min. To quench the reaction, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mm. Subsequently the reaction was centrifuged at 68,000 rpm (TLA 100.3 rotor) for 25 min in a Beckman ultracentrifuge to pellet the undigested myosin and myosin rods. The supernatant containing the S1 was removed and diluted to 500 μl with low salt experimental buffer (30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 4 mm DTT). To concentrate the S1, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g with a Sorvall MC 12V at 4 °C using a Millipore Ultrafree 0.5 μm centrifugal filter with a 5,000 kDa cut-off. The final volume of the supernatant was 30–50 μl containing an S1 concentration of 20–30 μm. The S1 samples were stored on ice and used within 2 weeks. S1 concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm (E1% = 0.75 cm–1) and the molecular mass of 115 kDa. Actin—Rabbit skeletal actin was prepared according to the method of Spudich and Watt (30.Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration was determined based on a molecular mass of 42 kDa and the absorbance at 280 nm (E1% = 1.104 cm–1, Ref. 49.West J.J. Nagy B. Gergely J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 611-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The actin filaments (10 μm) were stabilized by mixing them with equimolar concentrations of phalloidin and incubating for at least 4 h prior to use. Chemicals—Caged ATP (cATP) was purchased from Molecular Probes. cm-ATP was a gift from Martin Webb (National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, UK) and prepared according to Webb and Corrie (31.Webb M.R. Corrie J.E. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1562-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Flash Photolysis Set-up—The flash photolysis system used in this work was described previously (32.Weiss S. Chizhov I. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 20-μl sample is held in a quartz cuvette, and ATP is release from cATP by a single 5-ns flash from a neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser (Surelite I-10, 70 mJ maximum power) at 353 nm along the vertical axis of the cell. This liberates up to 50 μm ATP from 0.5 mm cATP at a rate of 90 s–1. The cuvette allows simultaneous monitoring of the absorbance and 90° light scattering (or fluorescence) changes following the laser flash. The sample was exposed to white light >389 nm (from a 100-watt halogen lamp). The absorbance was measured at 405 nm via a monochromator, and the rate and quantity of ATP liberated in each laser flash was monitored. Light scattering was monitored using the white light and records the dissociation of the actomyosin or acto-S1 complex on release of ATP. Apart from the components of the low salt experimental buffer (described above), the 20-μl samples contained 10 mm DTT, various cATP concentrations, and either 2 units/ml apyrase (ATP-induced dissociation of acto-S1) or a glucose-hexokinase system (0.03 units/ml hexokinase, 1 mm glucose, and 100 μm Ap5A) (KAD determination) (32.Weiss S. Chizhov I. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Each experiment used the same sample subjected to multiple laser flashes. In KAD determination experiments, both ADP and cATP were added between laser flashes: ADP was added to the desired concentration, and cATP was adjusted to keep the concentration constant. The dissociation of the acto-S1 complex was monitored by following the light scattering changes at 90° to incident light. In experiments measuring coumarin-ADP (cm-ADP) dissociation from S1, 4 μm S1 was incubated with 10 μm cm-ATP to hydrolyze the nucleotide to cm-ADP. The bound cm-ADP was replaced by ATP released from cATP, and the changes in coumarin fluorescence were monitored (excitation at 434 nm and emission through a 455 nm cut-off filter, 75-watt xenon/mercury lamp). Basal and Actin-activated Mg2+ATPase Assays—The Mg2+ ATPase activities were measured in low salt buffer (30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 4 mm DTT) using the coupled enzyme assay described by Nørby (33.Norby J.G. Acta Chem. Scand. 1971; 25: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absorbance at 340 nm was monitored with a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer to detect the conversion of NADH to NAD+ (molar equivalent to the hydrolysis of ATP). The S1 concentration was 0.2–0.5 μm in these assays. Subsequent to basal Mg2+ ATPase measurements, three to five 50-μl aliquots of 100 μm rabbit actin were added one at a time (increasing actin concentrations from 0–30 μm), and the actin-activated Mg2+ ATPase activity was measured. Co-sedimentation Assay—S1 (100 nm) was incubated with increasing actin concentrations of 0–500 nm in low salt experimental buffer (30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 4 mm DTT) with a total volume of 100 μl and then centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 30 min at 20 °C to determine KA. Measurements were repeated in the presence of 10 mm ADP with 500 nm S1 and actin concentrations between 0 and 5 μm to determine KDA. The supernatant was separated from the pellet at each actin concentration, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of water. All samples were applied to a 10% SDS gel. Gels in the absence of nucleotide (100 nm S1) were silver-stained (Bio-Rad) to visualize the protein bands, while those obtained in the presence of 10 mm ADP (500 nm S1) were stained with Coomassie Blue. The density of each protein band was quantified and used to determine the affinity of S1 for actin. The actin-bound S1 concentration was estimated from the pellet S1 band densities or from the supernatant S1 band densities by subtracting them from the S1 density measured in the absence of actin where all the S1 remained in the supernatant. The [bound S1] versus [actin] plots were analyzed with the following equation (34.Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar),[A]0F2-([A]0+[S1]0+K)F+[S1]0=0(Eq. 1) where [S1]0 and [A]0 are the total S1 and actin concentrations, respectively, and F is the fraction of bound S1 ([acto-S1]/[S1]0). Analysis of the Kinetic Data—The kinetic scheme for the interaction of actin and S1 with ATP and ADP is described in Scheme 1. The following equation was derived from the scheme and used to determine the value of KAD,kobs=K1k+2([ATP]/(1+[ADP]/KAD))(Eq. 2) where kobs represents the observed rate constant for the ATP-induced acto-S1 dissociation reaction, K1k+2 is the second order rate constant for the binding of ATP to acto-S1, and KAD is the equilibrium dissociation constant for ADP binding to acto-S1. The relative rate constants (krel) for Fig. 7 were calculated as krel = kobs/k0 where k0 is the value measured in the absence of ADP.Fig. 7The affinity of ADP for acto-S1 (KAD). Flash photolysis experiments were carried out in the presence of [ADP] ranging from 0 to 1500 μm. The kobs values were determined from single exponential fits of light scattering traces, and the kobsversus [ADP] plots were fitted with kobs = (K1k+2 [ATP]/(1 + [ADP]/KAD)) (Scheme 1 and Equation 1). For easier comparison the relative kobs (krel) values are shown. The hyperbolic fits gave KAD values of 409 ± 26, 838 ± 75, 418 ± 18, and 587 ± 48 μm for IFI (a, filled circles), IFI-EC (a, empty circles), EMB-IC (b, filled squares), and EMB S1 (b, empty squares), respectively. The conditions were as follows: 1 μm unlabeled actin (phalloidin-stabilized), 1–3 μm S1 (in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT), 500 μm cATP, and hexokinase-glucose-Ap5A system (see “Materials and Methods”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Production of Drosophila S1—EMB and chimeric converter myosin isoforms were isolated from the IFMs of transgenic flies expressing a single isoform in an IFM null mutant (35.Collier V.L. Kronert W.A. O'Donnell P.T. Edwards K.A. Bernstein S.I. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The procedure of Silva et al. (29.Silva R. Sparrow J. Geeves M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) was modified to produce a more concentrated and pure solution of S1 (Fig. 2). The previous study of Silva et al. (29.Silva R. Sparrow J. Geeves M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) used dialyzed S1 samples containing measurable quantities of actin, myosin rods, and other proteolytic fragments. The 10% SDS gel showed no detectable contamination of the S1 samples with actin or other proteins. In addition, the clarified S1 was concentrated rather than dialyzed to exchange the buffer, eliminating possible loss of the S1 fragment. The regulatory light chain is lost (Fig. 2) following α-chymotrypsin digestion, but the essential light chain is intact. Drosophila myosin S1 isoforms were produced in sufficient quantities (60–150 μg) to perform experiments utilizing the flash photolysis/light scattering method (32.Weiss S. Chizhov I. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mg2+ATPase Activities—Basal Mg2+ ATPase activity of the IFI isoform was ∼4-fold faster (0.083 ± 0.017 s–1) than that for the EMB isoform (0.022 ± 0.004 s–1) (Table I), similar to the 5-fold difference found previously for basal Mg2+ ATPase activities of the full-length native Drosophila myosin isoforms (Table I) (4.Swank D.M.

The chimeric converter S1 isoforms showed little difference in the basal Mg2+ ATPase activities when compared with the parent backbone. IFI-EC S1 activity was 0.098 ± 0.028 s–1, similar to IFI isoform activity, while EMB-IC activity was 0.014 ± 0.003 s–1, slightly lower than EMB isoform activity. These Mg2+ ATPase activities were in good agreement with the trend reported for full-length myosin isoforms (IFI-EC > IFI > EMB > EMB-IC) (5.Littlefield K.P. Swank D.M. Sanchez B.M. Knowles A.F.

Open table in a new tab The actin-activated Mg2+ ATPase activities were determined in the presence of increasing actin concentrations, and all four isoforms showed linear increases in activity at the measured actin concentrations. The initial slope of Mg2+ ATPase activity versus [actin] plots gives an estimate of the ratio kcat/Km where kcat is the maximum actin-activated Mg2+ ATPase activity and Km is the actin concentration required for half-maximal activation (Table I). The actin activation of Mg2+ ATPase activity was greater for IFI S1 than for EMB S1, and the extent of actin-activated Mg2+ ATPase activity of the converter chimeric isoforms was identical to that observed for the parent S1. The Affinity of S1 for Actin—The affinity of the S1 isoforms for actin was measured using the co-sedimentation method. In the absence of nucleotide, incubation of 100 nm IFI S1 with increasing actin concentrations (Fig. 3b) indicates a tight affinity (<10 nm) of S1 for actin (KA). The plot was generated after quantitation of the S1 and actin bands on SDS gels of both the supernatants and pellets (e.g.Fig. 3a). Characterization of the rigor actin affinity of the other three isoforms suggests similar tight affinities. Quantitative affinities (KA) could not be determined for any isoform using this method given the tight binding, represented in Fig. 3b as a dotted line. In the presence of 10 mm ADP, the affinity of S1 for actin (KDA) was weakened for all isoforms (Table II); a representative plot of IFI S1 density versus [actin] in the presence of ADP is shown (Fig. 3c).Table IITransient kinetic parameters for Drosophila S1 isoformsMyosin isoformIFIIFI-ECEMBEMB-ICK1k+2 (106m-1 s-1)0.75 ± 0.080.84 ± 0.090.91 ± 0.130.51 ± 0.05k-D (s-1)7.5 ± 1.38.4 ± 1.71.8 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.3KD (μm)aData estimated from k-D (for cm-ADP) assuming association rate constant of 106m-1 s-1.7.58.41.81.7KAD (μm)409 ± 26838 ± 75587 ± 48418 ± 18k-AD (s-1)bData estimated from KAD assuming association rate constant of 107m-1 s-1.4090838058704180KA (nm)<10<10<10<10KDA (nm)217 ± 6764 ± 18102 ± 80117 ± 67KAD/KD55100326246a Data estimated from k-D (for cm-ADP) assuming association rate constant of 106m-1 s-1.b Data estimated from KAD assuming association rate constant of 107m-1 s-1. Open table in a new tab cm-ADP dissociation from S1—To estimate the rate constant for ADP dissociation from IFI S1 in the absence of actin we used a fluorescent analogue of ADP and a novel flash photolysis method described recently (36.Clark R.J. Nyitrai M. Webb M.R. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2003; 24: 315-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IFI S1 (4 μm) was incubated with 10 μm cm-ADP and 100 μm cATP, and the S1-bound cm-ADP was displaced by releasing ATP (15 μm) from cATP (100 μm) with a single laser flash. The coumarin fluorescence was monitored, and the transients were fitted with a single exponential function (Fig. 4) and gave a kobs value of 7.5 ± 1.3 s–1. The kobs was ATP concentration-independent between 15 and 75 μm indicating that ATP effectively displaced cm-ADP, and the kobs values corresponded to the dissociation rate constant (k–D) of cm-ADP from S1. Similar cm-ADP displacement experiments were repeated with IFI-EC, EMB-IC, and EMB S1 samples and gave k–D values of 8.4 ± 1.7, 1.7 ± 0.3, and 1.8 ± 0.4 s–1 for the IFI"
https://openalex.org/W2052023857,"We have demonstrated previously that kinin-free high molecular weight kininogen, its domain 5 (D5H, Gly402–Lys502), and peptides derived from D5H inhibited vitronectin-mediated migration and invasion of cancer cells in vitro (Kamiyama, F., Maeda, T., Yamane, T., Li, Y. H., Ogikubo, O., Otsuka, T., and Ohkubo, I. (2001) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 288, 975–980). In this study, we found that the amino acid sequence His-Gly-Lys (HGK) in D5H is the core motif for inhibition of adhesion and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro. P-5m (484GHGKHKNK491, Gly484–Lys491), an octapeptide including the HGK motif derived from D5H, and HGK, a tripeptide, inhibited both cell adhesion and invasion in vitro. However, an octapeptide designated P-5m (K487R), in which Lys487 was changed to Arg, did not inhibit either cell adhesion or invasion, and peptides HGR and HGG also had no inhibitory effect. Recombinant GST-D5H expressed in Escherichia coli had a stronger inhibitory effect on cell adhesion and invasion in vitro than did GST-D5H (K487R) in which Lys487 was changed to Arg. Furthermore, P-5m (Gly484–Lys491) peptide clearly suppressed lung metastasis in mice experimentally induced by using B16-F10 cells, but P-5m (G487R) had no effect. These data strongly indicate that both the HGK motif and lysine residue (Lys487) play essential roles in inhibition of cell adhesion and invasion in vitro and in prevention of metastasis of cancer cells in vivo. We tried to identify the HGK motif binding protein on the surface of cancer cells. A 95-kDa surface biotin-labeled membrane protein was specifically detached from GST-D5H by P-5 (His479–Lys493) peptide but not by P-1 (Gly402–Lys420) peptide originating from the N-terminal region of D5H. We have demonstrated previously that kinin-free high molecular weight kininogen, its domain 5 (D5H, Gly402–Lys502), and peptides derived from D5H inhibited vitronectin-mediated migration and invasion of cancer cells in vitro (Kamiyama, F., Maeda, T., Yamane, T., Li, Y.

Schmaier H.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein assists conversion of factor XII to factor XIIa with kallikrein and a negatively charged surface (1.Colman W.R. Schmaier H.A. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma kininogens are categorized into two types, high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and low molecular weight kininogen. Both types of kininogen have been shown to be cysteine protease inhibitors (2.Ohkubo I. Kurachi K. Takasawa T. Shiokawa H. Sasaki M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5691-5697Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). HK consists of six domains. After cleavage by kallikrein, factor XIIa, or plasmin and release of kinin from HK molecules, HK changes into kinin-free high molecular weight kininogen (HKa). It has been reported that HKa possesses anti-adhesive properties (3.Asakura S. Wurley R.W. Skorstengaard K. Ohkubo I. Mosher D.F. J.

However, the core amino acid sequence responsible for and the mechanism underlying the inhibitory activities have not been elucidated, and it has also not been determined whether these peptides have the same effect in vivo. Here we report that the HGK amino acid sequence in D5H of HK is the core motif for inhibition of VN-mediated cancer cell adhesion and invasion in vitro and also that an HGK-containing peptide suppressed experimental lung metastasis in vivo. We also report that a cancer cell surface membrane protein with a molecular mass of 95 kDa binds to the D5H molecule.

After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, non-adherent cells were removed by rinsing three times with PBS, and adherent cells were fixed for 15 min with 10% formaldehyde and then stained with Giemsa staining solution. Cells in four non-overlapping microscopic fields (×100) inside each well were counted. These experiments were performed independently at least three times. Cell Invasion Assay—The effects of peptides derived from HK on invasion of cancer cells were assessed using the modified Boyden chamber assay (32.Meng Q. Gao B. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Fan S.

Prevostel C. Derocq D. Joubert D. Rochefort H. Garcia M. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As preparation, the lower surfaces of polyvinyl 8-μm pore membranes were each coated with 25 μl of 160 nmol/liter VN and dried for 2 h at 37 °C. The upper surfaces of the membranes were each coated with 100 μl of Matrigel (15 μg/100 μl), dried overnight at 37 °C, and reconstituted in a standard medium to give an even layer over the membrane surface. The lower chamber was filled with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. One hundred μl of cell suspension containing 1 × 105 cells in DMEM with 0.1% BSA was added to each of the upper wells with or without various concentrations of GST-D5H, GST-D5H (K487R), and peptides. After incubation for 7 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells on the upper surface were removed by wiping with a cotton swab. Cells that had traversed into the Matrigel and attached to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, stained with Giemsa staining solution, and counted in 5 randomly selected microscopic fields (×100) per filter. These experiments were performed independently at least three times. Assay for Experimental Metastasis in Mice—Female mice of the C57BL/6J strain, 6–7 weeks old, were purchased from Nippon CREA (Tokyo, Japan). The mice were maintained in the Laboratory of Animal Experiments under laminar airflow conditions. All animal experiments were carried out according to the institutional guidelines for animal use. To produce experimental lung metastasis, 2 × 105 B16-F10 malignant melanoma cells were injected into the lateral tail vein with or without 500 μg of P-5m (Gly484–Lys491) and P-5m (K487R). At 2 weeks after the injection, the mice were sacrificed under anesthesia; lungs were removed and fixed in Bouin's solution, and visible metastatic colonies were counted using a dissecting microscope. Endothelial Cell Tube Formation Assay—The wells of a 96-well tissue culture plate were coated with 90 μl of ice-cold 5 mg/ml Matrigel and incubated overnight at 37 °C. One hundred μl of a suspension of 2 × 104 HUVEC in HuMedia-EG2 medium with 10 μm ZnCl2 (5.Zhang J.-C. Claffey K. Sakthivel R. Darzynkiewicz Z. Shaw E.D. Leal J. Wang Y.-C. Lu F.-M. McCrae R.K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2589-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was layered on top of the gel with or without 2 μm of GST, GST-D5H, and GST-D5H (K487R) or 400 μm of peptides P-5m (Gly484–Lys491) and P-5m (K487R). After incubation for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and pictures were taken. Labeling of Cell Surface Membrane Proteins with Biotin—Four × 107 MDA-MB-231 cells were detached in 0.05% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA, washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0), and incubated in 2 ml of PBS containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin at 4 °C for 1 h (36.Parrott M.B. Barry M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thereafter, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Detection of D5H-binding Protein—Biotinylated cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (38.Shurety W. Pagan J.K. Prins J.B. Stow J.L. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained was incubated with 30 μg of GST-D5H and 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4 °C to produce a labeled D5H-binding protein-GST-D5H-glutathione-Sepharose 4B complex. After precipitation by centrifugation at 3,000 × g, the complex was washed three times with the above-described lysis buffer. The bound proteins were then detached from the complex by the addition of 15 μl of elution buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml peptide (P-1 or P-5), 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (37.Bushkin-Harav I. Garty N.B. Littauer U.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13422-13428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The labeled sample was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 1% low fat milk for 30 min and incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:500) in PBS for 30 min to visualize the resolved proteins. Then the membrane was washed three times with PBS and developed using ECL reagent (38.Shurety W. Pagan J.K. Prins J.B. Stow J.L. Lab. Investig. 2001; 81: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Statistics—Error bars in all figures represent standard deviations. The significance of differences in numbers of cells was determined using the Student's two-tailed t test compared with the control. Inhibition of Cell Adhesion by Peptides Derived from D5Hin Vitro—We have shown previously that peptide P-5 (His479–Lys493) derived from D5H inhibited VN-mediated haptotaxis and haptoinvasion of MG-63 cells (27.Kamiyama F. Maeda T. Yamane T. Li Y.H. Ogikubo O. Otsuka T. Ohkubo I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the basis of those findings, we synthesized three additional overlapped peptides derived from P-5, P-5n (Lys480–Lys487), P-5m (Gly484–Lys491), and P-5c (His488–Asn495), and we attempted to identify the core sequence on D5H for inhibition of cell adhesion and invasion in vitro (Table I). We first carried out VN-mediated MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion assays using GST-D5H, P-5, P-5n, P-5m, and P-5c. The doses of protein and peptides used were based on doses of GST-D5H and P-5 that resulted in about 50% inhibition in preliminary studies. Cell adhesion activity was expressed as percent of the control level. GST-D5H, P-5, P-5n, and P-5m inhibited cell adhesion by 57, 48, 31, and 40% of the control level at concentrations of 2 μm GST-D5H and 400 μm peptides (Fig. 1). However, P-5c did not show inhibitory activity. We assumed that the site of inhibitory activity for VN-mediated cell adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells is in the Gly484–His–Gly–Lys487 sequence, because both P-5n (Lys480–Lys487) and P-5m (Gly484–Lys491) peptides also showed inhibitory activity. Inhibition of Cell Invasion by Peptides Derived from D5Hin Vitro—VN-mediated haptoinvasion assays were performed using MDA-MB-231 cells and tested GST-D5H, P-5, P-5n, P-5m, and P-5c. GST-D5H and peptides were added at concentrations of 0.25–2.0 and 100–400 μm, respectively. The maximum dose used was based on results of the cell adhesion assay. GST-D5H, P-5, P-5n, and P-5m all inhibited cell invasion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, data for GST-D5H not shown). At concentrations of 2 μm GST-D5H and 400 μm peptides, they inhibited cell invasion by 66, 54, 40, and 50% of the control level, respectively. However, P-5c did not inhibit the invasion at any dose as was observed in the cell adhesion assay (Fig. 2, data for GST-D5H not shown). In the haptoinvasion experiments, we assumed that the GHGK sequence is the core sequence for expression of both inhibitory activities. We further constructed a new peptide with a scrambled P-5n (His480–Lys487) sequence, designated P-5nS (KGHHGKHG). At a concentration of 400 μm, this peptide inhibited both cell adhesion and invasion by 11 and 34% of the control level, respectively (data not shown). Based on this finding, we hypothesize that HGK is the minimum active sequence because HGK exists as a common amino acid sequence in both peptides P-5n and P-5nS. Determination of Active Amino Acid Residues in Peptides Containing HGK and HGR for Both Cell Adhesion and Invasion in Vitro—We synthesized peptide P-5m (K487R) in which Lys487 was changed to Arg (Gly484–Lys491), and we compared the inhibitory effects on MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion and invasion of P-5m (Gly484–Lys491) and P-5m (K487R). Their inhibitory activities were expressed as percent of the control level. P-5m (K487R) had no effect on cell adhesion, but P-5m (Gly484–Lys491) inhibited cell adhesion by 40% of the control level at 400 μm (Fig. 3A). In haptoinvasion assays, P-5m (K487R) had no effect at any dose, but P-5m (Gly484–Lys491) inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). These results also indicate that HGK is the core sequence for inhibition of cell adhesion and haptoinvasion. To confirm that the HGK amino acid sequence is the minimum core sequence for inhibition of cell adhesion and haptoinvasion, we synthesized three tripeptides, HGK, HGR, and HGG. The peptide HGK inhibited VN-mediated cell adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells by 20% of the control level at the concentration of 1.6 mm, but HGR and HGG showed no effect at the same concentration (Fig. 4A). In haptoinvasion assays, the peptide HGK inhibited VN-mediated haptoinvasion in a dose-dependent manner by 25% of the control level at the concentration of 1.6 mm, but neither HGR nor HGG showed an inhibitory effect at any dose as was observed in the cell adhesion assay (Fig. 4B). Effects of D5H(K487R) on Cell Adhesion and Invasion—To determine whether the HGK sequence also worked as the core site of inhibitory effects on MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion and invasion in the D5H protein, we expressed recombinant protein GST-D5H (K487R) in which Lys487 was changed to Arg. GST-D5H and GST-D5H (K487R) inhibited cell adhesion by 57 and 10% of the control level at a fusion protein concentration of 2 μm, respectively (Fig. 5A). GST-D5H (K487R) inhibited VN-mediated cell invasion in a dose-dependent manner, and the level of inhibition was almost half that by GST-D5H. GST-D5H and GST-D5H (K487R) inhibited haptoinvasion by 70 and 30% of the control level at fusion protein concentration of 2 μm, respectively (Fig. 5B). Peptide P-5m (K487R) had no effect on cell adhesion or invasion at any dose (Fig. 3, A and B), but GST-D5H (K487R) had an inhibitory effect on VN-mediated cell invasion. These results indicate that the local conformations of HGK in the peptide and in the domain structure are different. Inhibition of Experimental Lung Metastasis by Peptide P-5m (Gly484–Lys491) in Vivo—On the basis of the possibility that cell invasion in Matrigel is closely related to tumor metastasis, we examined the effect of P-5m (Gly484–Lys491) on metastasis in vivo. Because MDA-MB-231 cells have been reported to be cells with low metastatic potential in vivo (39.Yang X.H. Wei L.L. Tang C. Slack R. Mueller S. Lippman M.E. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5284-5288PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Lin V.C.L. Eng A.S. Hen N.E. Ng E.H.L. Chowdhury S.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 2880-2886PubMed Google Scholar), we used highly metastatic tumor cells, B16-F10 cells, for this in vivo assay. Before this experimental metastasis assay was performed, we confirmed that P-5m (Gly48"

In eukaryotic cells, the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartmentalization requires that a large number of molecules be continuously transported through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), 1The abbreviations used are: NPCnuclear pore complexNTF2nuclear transport factor 2r.m.s.d.root mean square deviationCaC. albicans. a huge macromolecular structure that spans the nuclear envelope. Nucleoporins represent a subset of the NPC components and form a dense network of proteins that line the channel of the NPC. Transport through the channel requires binding of protein or RNA cargoes to soluble transport receptors and is mediated by the phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats that characterize most nucleoporins. The two most common repeats that are found in nucleoporins and are often present in many copies along the whole molecule are based on GLFG or FXFG cores (1Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin.

The best characterized pathway of protein import and export involves members of the conserved family of transport receptors called karyopherins/importin-β, also known as exportins/importins. The karyopherin transport factors share a common structural framework and respond to the small GTPase, Ran, to bind or release their cargo within the appropriate cellular compartments. Meanwhile, Ran must also shuttle across the NPC to equilibrate its nuclear level; this is performed via a specific nuclear import factor known as nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) (4Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 5Stewart M. Cell Struct.

Unlike this well established protein transport pathway, no karyopherin family member that would function in general mRNA export has been identified. Instead, recent studies in yeast and metazoans have pointed to several highly conserved proteins that are known as nuclear export factor (NXF) and are specifically required for mRNA export, but do not include karyopherin or NTF2 (9Herold A. Suyama M. Rodrigues J.P. Braun I.C. Kutay U. Carmo-Fonseca M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8996-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Among members of the NXF family, the best characterized candidate is the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Mex67, whose conserved metazoan counterpart is known as TAP or NXF. Mex67 interacts with both bulk poly(A+) RNA and nuclear pore complexes (10Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Luhrmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and binds ∼1150 mRNAs corresponding to ∼36% of all transcriptional events in yeast (11Hieronymus H. Silver P.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar); this suggests that Mex67 plays a key role in yeast nuclear mRNA export. The specific association of Mex67 with the small Mtr2 protein was shown to be essential for nuclear mRNA import and this heterodimer also shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (12Kadowaki T. Hitomi M. Chen S. Tartakoff A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. Pante N. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Mex67/TAP is structurally unrelated to other Ran-dependent karyopherins and is composed of three distinct modules: a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a middle (M) domain that shares a NTF2-like fold and a carboxyl (C) domain with a UBA (ubiquitin-associated) fold (8Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 9Herold A. Suyama M. Rodrigues J.P. Braun I.C. Kutay U. Carmo-Fonseca M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8996-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The M and C domains of Mex67/TAP were shown to function in shuttling and contacting the nucleoporins FG repeats that line the pore channel (14Strasser K. Bassler J. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 15Strawn L.A. Shen T. Wente S.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 5405-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This suggests that they compete with the karyopherins for binding to FG nucleoporins and that both types of receptors use the same binding sites for translocation through the NPCs. The crystal structure of the human TAP-p15 heterodimer complex bound to a FG repeat demonstrated that this complex closely resembles the NTF2 homodimer necessary for shuttling Ran (17Fribourg S. Braun I.C. Izaurralde E. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, a single FG repeat binding site was identified at the molecular surface of the TAP NTF2-like domain, consistent with genetic and biochemical studies (16Braun I.C. Herold A. Rode M. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5405-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the human TAP-p15 complex partially restores the growth of the lethal mex67/mtr2 double knockout strain in yeast (18Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of a conserved mRNA export machinery from yeast to humans (8Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Indeed, the crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae Mtr2-Mex67 NTF2-like fold domain (Mtr2-Mex67) complex revealed that Mtr2 is a novel member of the NTF2-like family and that its association with Mex67 resembles that of the TAP-p15 complex (19Fribourg S. Conti E. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, several more recent discordant results remain to be elucidated. First, Mex67 must associate with Mtr2 to efficiently bind to FG repeats (14Strasser K. Bassler J. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whereas TAP can interact with FG nucleoporins in the absence of p15 (16Braun I.C. Herold A. Rode M. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5405-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Second, Mtr2 associates with Nup85, a subunit of the Nup84 complex that is crucial for nuclear mRNA export (13Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. Pante N. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and both Mex67 and Mtr2 coimmunoprecipitate with the NPC-associated protein SacIII (20Lei E.P. Stern C.A. Fahrenkrog B. Krebber H. Moy T.I. Aebi U. Silver P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Finally, two Mtr2 mutant alleles (mtr2-1 and mtr2-33) were shown to impair 60S ribosomal subunit export (21Bassler J. Grandi P. Gadal O. Lessmann T. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Lechner J. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) while Mtr2 associates with the 60S pre-precursor particle Arx1 during ribosomal nuclear export (22Nissan T.A. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5539-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), indicating that Mtr2 alone is directly linked to ribosomal nuclear export. Altogether, these data suggest that Mtr2, unlike p15, has gained additional functions in binding non-FG containing proteins within the NPCs, and that Mtr2 and p15 have related but distinct functions for nuclear export of mRNAs. To address these issues, we have solved the crystal structures of Candida albicans apo Mtr2 and of its complex with the Mex67 NTF2-like domain at 1.75 Å and 1.95 Å resolution, respectively. The structure of Mtr2 unexpectedly shows that it retains its NTF2 fold and does not assemble as a homodimer in contrast to other members of the NTF2 fold family. Moreover, this structure highlights novel features that are unique to the yeast proteins and may explain the additional functions recently reported for yeast Mtr2, compared with its human homolog p15. Finally, the overall structure of the Mtr2-Mex67 complex, which overall resembles those of the human and S. cerevisiae homologs, reveals the presence of three putative FG repeats binding sites respectively located in Mex67, Mtr2 and at the complex interface. Expression and Purification of the Native and Selenomethionyl Proteins—The nucleotide sequence of C. albicans Mtr2 was subcloned into a pET28 derivative expression vector, resulting in the pSZ52 expression construct, and transformed into BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells. Expression of N-terminal His6-tagged Mtr2 was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 28 °C according to the high cell density cultivation protocol (23Riesenberg D. Schulz V. Knorre W.A. Pohl H.D. Korz D. Sanders E.A. Ross A. Deckwer W.D. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 20: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), supplemented with 60 g/liter glycerol and 20 g/liter casamino acids. The recombinant protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity, anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography and dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl. The final yield was 0.70 mg of pure Mtr2 per g of wet pellet. Purified Mtr2 was concentrated to 3.5 mg/ml and stored at -20 °C. The nucleotide sequence of the Mex67 NTF2-like domain (residues 294-512) was inserted immediately after the 6-His-tagged Mtr2 termination codon (plus the Shine-Dalgarno sequence) into the pSZ52 expression vector, resulting in the pSZ52-Mdomain expression construct. Co-expression in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells used the same conditions as for Mtr2; the heterodimer complex was purified and dialyzed as described for Mtr2, except that cation exchange was used as the second purification step, concentrated to 9.5 mg/ml and stored at -20 °C. The final yield was 0.28 mg of pure complex per g of wet pellet. For production of selenomethionyl (Se-Met) Mtr2-Mex67 complex, the pSZ52-Mdomain plasmid was transferred to a MetA-β180 (DE3) E. coli strain; co-expression of the complex was performed as described above, except that Se-Met was added to the medium instead of casamino acids, glycerol at 30 g/liter was used as a carbon source and the induction time was increased to 18 h. The purification procedure was identical to that used for the native complex. Protein Crystallization—C. albicans Mtr2 was crystallized by vapor diffusion at 20 °C using hanging drops containing equal volumes of the protein solution and of a reservoir solution made of 0.8 m NaH2PO4/K2HPO4 at pH 7.0. Needle-shaped Mtr2 crystals appeared within 3 days; they belong to the monoclinic space group C2 with cell dimensions a = 62.5 Å, b = 54.3 Å, c = 61.3 Å, and β = 99.0° and contain one Mtr2 molecule per asymmetric unit. Crystals selected for data collection were briefly soaked by successive steps into the reservoir solution supplemented with increasing amounts of glycerol up to 20-25% (v/v), flashcooled at 100 K in the nitrogen gas stream and stored in liquid nitrogen. A 1.75 Å resolution data set was collected on beamline ID14-EH2 at ESRF (Grenoble, France). The C. albicans Se-Met Mtr2-Mex67 complex was crystallized at 20 °C after mixing equal volumes of the complex solution and of a reservoir solution made of 18% PEG 4000, 0.2 m imidazole-malate, pH 6.0. Thick plate-shaped crystals appeared within 1 week; they belong to the monoclinic space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 70.1 Å, b = 54.1 Å, c = 109.7 Å, and β = 96.1° and contain two Mtr2-Mex67 complexes in the asymmetric unit. A 3-wavelength MAD experiment was performed on beamline BW7A (peak, inflection) and X11 (remote) (DESY, Germany) using the Se-Met Mtr2-Mex67 complex crystals. All oscillation images were integrated with DENZO (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Further phase improvement techniques, including solvent flattening, non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging and phase extension with RESOLVE yielded an electron density map interpretable up to 1.95 Å resolution. The model was automatically built using ARP/wARP (27Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), carefully examined using TURBO-FRODO (28Roussel A. Cambillau C. Committee S.G.

The final Mtr2 model comprises residues 3-176 with a disordered loop from residues 125-136; the Mex67 NTF2-like domain (residues 305-509) could be modeled with the exception of two disordered surface loop regions (residues 346-351 and 446-457). The structure of C. albicans Mtr2 in its apo form was solved by the molecular replacement method with AMoRe (30Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) using the coordinates from the Mtr2-Mex67 complex as search model. Further refinement steps using REFMAC (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13911) Google Scholar), alterned with a graphic inspection of the model using TURBO-FRODO (28Roussel A. Cambillau C. Committee S.G. TURBO-FRODO Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar), yielded the final model. The structure of apo-Mtr2, which encompasses residues 3 to 176 with the exception of a disordered surface loop region (residues 127-135), is very similar to that of Mtr2 in the complex with an r.m.s.d. of 0.5 Å for 152 Cα atoms. The r.m.s.d. between the two complexes present in the asymmetric unit is 0.58 Å for 333 Cα atoms. Refinement statistics are reported in Table I. The stereochemistry of the refined structures were analyzed using PROCHECK (31Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). No residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The coordinates of the apo-Mtr2 and Mtr2-Mex67 complex have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, accession numbers 1Q42 and 1Q40, respectively.

Invariant and conserved residues as well as the secondary structure elements between these members of the NXF family are indicated as in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Crystallization and Structure Determination—Initial efforts to solve a Mtr2 structure by MAD phasing using Se-Met-substituted protein were hampered by the weak phase information provided by a single well ordered Se-Met residue out of three. In addition, the low solvent content of these crystals along with the presence of a single molecule in the asymmetric unit precluded the use of phase improvement techniques. Subsequent attempts to solve the Mtr2 structure using crystals soaked/cocrystallized with heavy atom derivatives or halides or using various NTF2-like structures as search model were again unsuccessful. However, success in obtaining a soluble complex by co-expression in bacteria along with the high number of Met residues (six) present in the sequence of the Mex67 NTF2-like domain prompted us to solve the structure of Mtr2 in complex with the Mex67 NTF2-like domain by MAD phasing using a Se-Met-substituted protein complex. Then the structure of apo-Mtr2 could be solved by molecular replacement using, as a search model, the coordinates of Mtr2 from the Mtr2-Mex67 complex (Table I). Mtr2 Retains Its NTF2 Fold and Does Not Assemble as a Dimer—The sequences of yeast Mtr2 proteins are significantly longer than those of any other members of the NTF2 family (180 amino acids in Mtr2, 125 in human p15, and 140 in yeast NTF2). Yet, Mtr2 shares the overall α/β barrel made of a highly curved, central 5-stranded β-sheet that is flanked on one side by one long and two shorter α-helices and is characterized by an atypical cone-like shape reminiscent of other members of the NTF2 fold family, as also found for S. cerevisiae Mtr2 bound to the Mex67 NTF2-like domain (Fig. 1) (5Stewart M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Fribourg S. Conti E. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Bullock T.L. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Structure-based sequence alignment of Mtr2 with either p15 or NTF2 shows only 18 and 15% identities (Fig. 2), respectively, resulting in r.m.s. deviations of 1.4 Å and 1.5 Å for only 104 and 102 Cα atoms. In fact, Mtr2 displays several new structural features that are unique to yeast proteins compared with other members of the NTF2 fold family, but were not visible in the crystal structure of the homologous S. cerevisae Mtr2 bound to the Mex67 NTF2-like domain (19Fribourg S. Conti E. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In comparison to human p15 and S. cerevisiae Mtr2, and starting from the N-terminal region, the C. albicans Mtr2 structure reveals: a large extension in the α1-α2 loop (insert 1, 18 residues) that protrudes 20 Å away from the p15 β-hairpin; a newly formed helix 2 along with melting of p15 helix2; a second insertion within p15 β2 that defines a new loop region (insert 2, seven residues); a third insertion that protrudes 20 Å away from the short turn (insert 3, 31 residues) in the p15 β4-β5 loop and a 5-residue elongation of β5 (Fig. 1). The conservation of most of these structural elements within yeast Mtr2 proteins suggests that they are involved in novel biological functions and that Mtr2 alone can fulfill these additional functions independently from its association with Mex67 (Fig. 2). Gel-filtration experiments showed that Mtr2 is monomeric in solution (data not shown) as it is in the crystals. An insertion in the p15 β3-β4 loop has been reported to prevent homodimer formation of human p15 (17Fribourg S. Braun I.C. Izaurralde E. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but no such impairment is found in a putative Mtr2-Mtr2 homodimer modeled from the typical NTF2 homodimer (34Bullock T.L. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Instead, the interface of this Mtr2-Mtr2 dimer presents unfavorable acidic bridges between Asp residues and steric clashes involving the His91, His102, and Arg169 side chains. Therefore, in contrast to NTF2, which is functional as a homodimer for binding GDP Ran and nucleoporin FG repeats (5Stewart M. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), yeast Mtr2 and human p15 have evolved to specifically form functional heterodimers with the Mex67 and TAP NTF2-like domains, respectively. Mtr2 Possesses the Hydrophobic Cavity Identified in NTF2 but Not in p15—As a consequence of the unusual NTF2 conical shape, the α/β barrel opening out at the wider end creates a hydrophobic cavity between the three helices on one side and the curved β sheet on the other side (34Bullock T.L. Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the NTF2-Ran complex revealed that residues from the NTF2 hydrophobic cavity largely contribute to the binding interface with Ran where Phe72 from the switch II loop is inserted (35Stewart M. Kent H.M. McCoy A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Mtr2, unlike p15, exposes at the open end of the cone a similar hydrophobic cavity, 15 Å long, 6-7 Å wide, and 6 Å deep, that is lined by hydrophobic residues (Val54, Ile59, Phe71, Trp75, Pro79, Phe109, Tyr168,"
https://openalex.org/W1971366230,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins have been demonstrated to bind transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in certain cell lines. However, the identity of these GPI-anchored proteins and the role they may play in TGF-β signaling remain unknown. We have previously reported the presence of GPI-anchored TGF-β-binding proteins on human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes (Tam, B. Y. Y., and Philip, A. (1998) J. Cell.

On human keratinocytes, we identified a 150-kDa GPI-anchored TGF-β1-binding protein (r150) and demonstrated that it can form a heteromeric complex with the type I and II TGF-β signaling receptors. To explore whether GPI-anchored proteins modulate TGF-β signaling in keratinocytes, we created keratinocytes defective in GPI anchor biosynthesis (GPI mutant cells) by chemical mutagenesis of HaCaT cells. Mutant clones were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis based on the loss of a CD59 marker. In comparison with parental HaCaT cells, GPI mutant cells demonstrated a significant loss of r150 expression. In contrast, the levels of the type I and II TGF-β receptors and their ligand affinities, cell morphology, and doubling time remained unchanged. Importantly, GPI mutant cells displayed enhanced gene transcriptional activity and Smad2 and Smad3 activation in response to TGF-β1 treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our results indicate that GPI-anchored protein(s) inhibit TGF-β signaling and implicate r150 as the GPI-anchored protein responsible for this inhibition in human keratinocytes.

It is a member of the TGF-β superfamily, which includes activin, inhibin, bone morphogenic protein, growth and differentiation factor-1, and glial derived neurotropic growth factor (2.Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). Three distinct isoforms of TGF-β (TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3) have been described in mammals. There is ∼70% homology between the isoforms, but they appear to have distinct activities in vivo as suggested by their differences in receptor binding; potencies; developmental expression; and the dissimilar phenotypes exhibited by mice null for TGF-β1, -β2, or -β3 genes (3.Roberts A.B.

TGF-β signaling is transduced by a pair of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases known as type I and type II receptors, which are present in almost all cell types analyzed. The type I receptor does not bind TGF-β in the absence of the type II receptor. According to the current model, the binding of TGF-β to the type II receptor, a constitutively active kinase, results in the recruitment and phosphorylation of the type I receptor in its “GS sequence” upstream of the kinase domain, resulting in its activation. The activated type I receptor then phosphorylates its intracellular substrates, Smad2 and Smad3, which are released from the receptor and form a complex with Smad4. This heteromeric Smad complex then translocates to the nucleus and interacts with DNA to regulate target gene expression by recruiting transcriptional coactivators such as CBP (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein)/p300 and corepressors such as TGF-β-induced factor, Ski, and SnoN (5.Heldin C.H.

Other cell-surface TGF-β-binding proteins that have been identified include betaglycan (type III TGF-β receptor) and endoglin (CD105), which have a more limited tissue distribution and are considered to be accessory receptors. Betaglycan, a membrane proteoglycan, binds all three TGF-β isoforms with high affinity and is thought to facilitate TGF-β binding to the type II TGF-β receptor (8.Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 9.Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Endoglin shows 70% homology to betaglycan and binds TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 with high affinity through its association with the type II receptor (10.Cheifetz S. Hernandez H. Laiho M. ten Dijke P.

Furthermore, endoglin appears to interact with activin and bone morphogenic protein in the presence of their cognate receptors (12.Letamendía A. Lastres P. Botella L.M. Raab U. Langa C. Velasco B. Attisano L. Bernabeu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of endoglin attenuates TGF-β responses in monocytes and myoblasts (13.Li C. Hampson L. Bernabeu C. Kumar S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of betaglycan enhances TGF-β responses in these cells (9.Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, which lack transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, have also been shown to bind TGF-β. These proteins have been reported in several cell lines (14.Cheifetz S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20767-20772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Dumont N.

We have shown recently that GPI-anchored proteins bind TGF-β in early passage human endometrial stromal cells (15.Dumont N. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Philip A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), skin fibroblasts (16.Tam B.Y.Y. Philip A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and keratinocytes (17.Tam B.Y.Y. Germain L. Philip A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, we have characterized a 150-kDa GPI-anchored TGF-β1-binding protein on human keratinocytes (designated as r150) that can form a heteromeric complex with the type I and II TGF-β receptors (17.Tam B.Y.Y. Germain L. Philip A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have generated a GPI anchor mutant form of a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) and have demonstrated that these cells display reduced levels of r150 on their cell surface relative to parental HaCaT cells. Furthermore, these cells show an enhanced responsiveness to TGF-β1. Our results suggest that GPI-anchored proteins regulate TGF-β signaling and implicate r150 as an inhibitor of TGF-β1 signal transduction in human keratinocytes.

Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventrus F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar). (CAGA)12-lux and the empty vector MLP-lux were gifts from Dr. S. Huet (Laboratoire Glaxo Wellcome, France). (CAGA)12-lux is a luciferase construct specific for Smad3/4-driven signaling and contains 12 repeats of the sequence CAGA upstream of the MLP of adenovirus and a luciferase gene (19.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar, 20.Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Dominant-negative Smad3 and its empty vector pcDNA3 were gifts from Dr. J. J. Lebrun (McGill University). Dominant-negative Smad3 has its C-terminal region deleted (21.Valderrama-Carvaji H. Cockolakis E. Lacerte A. Lee E.-H. Krystal G. Ali S. Lebrun J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—HaCaT cells were obtained from Dr. P. Boukamp (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). HaCaT cells are a spontaneously immortalized cell line and show no major differences in differentiation compared with normal keratinocytes. They exhibit a transformed phenotype, but are not tumorigenic (22.Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3476) Google Scholar). HaCaT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin (Invitrogen). Cell Growth Assay—Cells (8 × 105) were seeded in 60-mm dishes (Falcon, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). At the indicated times, cells were trypsinized and counted on a hemocytometer. Affinity Labeling of Cells with125I-TGF-β—Affinity cross-link labeling was performed as described by Dumont et al. (15.Dumont N. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Philip A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell monolayers were washed three times for 10 min each with ice-cold binding buffer (PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, pH 7.4 (Dulbecco's PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cells were then incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with 100 pm125I-TGF-β1. Incubations were also done in the presence of excess nonradioactive TGF-β1 (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA) to confirm specific binding (data not shown). The receptor-ligand complexes were then cross-linked with 1 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3, Pierce). After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 mm glycine (final concentration of 10 mm) for 5 min. The supernatant was aspirated, and cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS. Cells were lysed with solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml benzamide, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). The solubilized material was mixed with 0.2 volume of 5× electrophoresis sample buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 50% glycerol, and trace bromphenol blue). Samples were resolved by 3–11% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing or reducing (in the presence of 5% β-mercaptoethanol) conditions. The gels were analyzed by autoradiography, and radioactive bands were quantitated by densitometry. Isolation and Cloning of GPI Anchor Mutant Keratinocytes—The preparation and selection of cells mutated in GPI biosynthesis was based on the method described by Stevens (23.Stevens V.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 116: 13-22PubMed Google Scholar). HaCaT cells grown to 50–60% confluence in a 75-cm2 flask (Falcon) were treated with 300 μg/ml EMS for 24 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and air. Cells were allowed to recover for 48 h in normal growth medium. FACS was performed to select cells that lost expression of GPI-anchored proteins on their cell surface. GPI anchor mutant cells were negatively sorted for a GPI-anchored protein (CD59) known to be expressed on human keratinocytes. Briefly, cells were trypsinized, and ∼2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of FACS buffer (PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum). Cells were incubated on ice for 45 min with 4 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-human IgG2a (negative control) or anti-CD59 antibody (Pharmingen, Mississauga). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of FACS buffer. Propidium iodide (3 μg/ml; Sigma) was added to the cells prior to sorting, which was performed using the FACS Vantage system (BD Biosciences, Mississauga). Cell sorting was repeated twice. At the third and final FACS step, a single CD59-negative cell was seeded into each well of a 96-well plate using the FACS Vantage automated cell deposition unit. The surviving clones were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine which cells expressed deficient levels of CD59. Affinity cross-link labeling with125I-TGF-β1 was performed to confirm reduced expression of r150. Transient Transfection Assays—HaCaT cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates and allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were transiently transfected with 1.0 μg each of 3TP-lux and pCMV-βgal using Superfect reagent (QIAGEN, Mississauga) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine whether the effects of TGF-β1on 3TP-lux reporter activity involve activation of Smad3, cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg each of 3TP-lux, pCMV-βgal, and either dominant-negative Smad3 or pcDNA3 (empty vector). Alternatively, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg each of (CAGA)12-lux or MLP-lux (control reporter) and pCMV-βgal. Cells were allowed to recover overnight and then serum-starved for 3 h prior to treatment with various doses of TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 (Austral Biochemicals Inc.) for the indicated times. Cells were solubilized in 150 μl of lysis buffer (Pharmingen) for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and supernatants were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using commercially available kits (BD Biosciences). Western Blotting of Phosphorylated Smad2—HaCaT and GPI M cells were grown in 60-mm dishes to 70–80% confluency and serum-starved overnight. Cells were washed with PBS and treated with various doses of TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 for the indicated times. Cells were solubilized with 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml benzamide, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin) for 30 min at 4 °C with mild agitation. Cell lysates were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Lysates containing equivalent protein concentrations were mixed with 0.2 volume of 5× electrophoresis sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Samples were resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 3 h in blocking buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline/Tween) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder). The blot was incubated for 60 min at room temperature with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-phospho-Smad2 antibody (a gift from Dr. S. Souchelnytskyi, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). Membranes were also probed with goat polyclonal anti-Smad2 or rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to confirm equal protein loading. Blots were washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween and incubated for 45 min at room temperature with a 1:5000 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibody (rabbit or goat) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Chemiluminescence detection of the immune complexes was performed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Kinase Assay—HaCaT and GPI M cells grown in 75-cm2 flasks were serum-starved overnight and treated with or without 100 pm TGF-β1 for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were scraped in 200 μl of lysis buffer and incubated for an additional 30 min on ice. The cells were pelleted, and the supernatants were precleared with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and 3 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. One milligram of protein was incubated with 3 μg/ml anti-type II TGF-β receptor antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and one time with 0.5 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2). After the last wash, pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer and incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 5× electrophoresis sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. The extracts were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. Isolation and Cloning of HaCaT Cells Mutated in GPI Anchor Biosynthesis—HaCaT cells were treated with 300 μg/ml EMS for 24 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” EMS is an ethylating agent that has been used to cause mutagenesis of genes, including those involved in the biosynthesis of the GPI anchor (23.Stevens V.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 116: 13-22PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Sega A. Mutat. Res. 1984; 134: 113-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). CD59, a 21-kDa GPI-anchored protein expressed on keratinocytes, was used as a marker for the cloning of GPI anchor-deficient cells. CD59 is an inhibitor of the membrane attack complex (25.Venneker G.T. Das P.K. Meinardi M.M. van Marle J. van Veen H.A. Bos J.D. Asghar S.S. J. Pathol. 1994; 172: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26.Pasch M.C. Okada N. Bos J.D. Asghar S.S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 683-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). After EMS treatment, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD59 antibody and negatively sorted by FACS analysis. Cells selected from CD59-negative populations were cloned using the FACS Vantage automated cell deposition unit. Ten clones survived and were reanalyzed for CD59 expression by flow cytometry. Two clones displayed reduced expression of CD59 on their cell surface and were presumed to be mutated in GPI anchor biosynthesis. These clones were designated as GPI M and GPI M1. Fig. 1A illustrates the flow cytometric analysis of parental HaCaT and GPI M cells. Although the expression of CD59 was not completely abolished in GPI M cells, the immunofluorescence intensity of CD59 was approximately half of that obtained for HaCaT cells (56.3 ± 7.4%, p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained with GPI M1 cells (data not shown). To confirm that the cloned GPI mutant cells display reduced levels of r150 on their cell surface, we affinity-labeled HaCaT and GPI M cells with125I-TGF-β1, and r150 levels were compared by autoradiography. Fig. 1B shows a significant reduction in r150 levels in GPI M cells relative to parental cells, whereas the relative amounts of type I, II, and III receptors bound to125I-TGF-β1 in HaCaT versus GPI M cells remained equivalent. Cell Growth and Morphology Are Unchanged in GPI Anchor Mutant Cells—A deficiency or loss of GPI-anchored proteins as a result of EMS mutagenesis has no reported effects on cell morphology or cell cycle progression in other cell types (23.Stevens V.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 116: 13-22PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that these parameters are not altered in GPI M cells, the doubling times and cell morphologies of HaCaT and GPI M cells were compared. Fig. 2A demonstrates that HaCaT and GPI M cells have similar growth rates with equivalent doubling times (∼16 h). In addition, the morphologies of HaCaT (Fig. 2B) and GPI M (Fig. 2C) cells are similar. GPI-anchored Proteins Inhibit TGF-β1-induced Transcriptional Activity—The 3TP-lux transcriptional reporter contains TGF-β-responsive elements from the PAI-1 promoter and is widely used to assess TGF-β signaling requirements (28.Choy L. Skillington J. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 667-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To examine the potential effect(s) of GPI-anchored proteins on TGF-β signaling in keratinocytes, we transfected HaCaT and GPI M cells with the 3TP-lux reporter construct and compared luciferase activities after 4 and 16 h of TGF-β1 treatment. A HaCaT cell clone subjected to the same EMS cloning procedure but not mutated in GPI anchor biosynthesis (GPI NM) was included as a control. GPI M cells exhibited a 30% increase in luciferase activity relative to HaCaT cells following a 4-h treatment with 10 pm TGF-β1 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). At 100 pm TGF-β1, GPI M cells showed an even greater (50%) increase in luciferase activity relative to HaCaT cells (p < 0.003). Interestingly, the -fold induction of luciferase activity in HaCaT cells treated with 10 and 100 pm TGF-β1 remained similar (3.3 and 3.9, respectively), whereas GPI M cells displayed a dose response with 4.9- and 8.4-fold increases, respectively. Similarly, after 16 h of TGF-β1 treatment, GPI M cells displayed a markedly enhanced response to 100 pm TGF-β1 compared with HaCaT cells (Fig. 3B). GPI M cells exhibited a 91.2-fold induction, which is approximately twice that of HaCaT (50.2-fold) and GPI NM (51.3-fold) cells (p < 0.01 for GPI M versus HaCaT) in response to 100 pm TGF-β1. In contrast, HaCaT, GPI NM, and GPI M cells showed no significant difference in response to 100 pm TGF-β2 (Fig. 3B). In addition, both HaCaT and GPI M cells displayed a dose-dependent response to 10 and 100 pm TGF-β1 at this time point (data not shown). After treatment with 10 pm TGF-β1 for 16 h, GPI M cells displayed a 21.4-fold stimulation of luciferase activity, with HaCaT and GPI NM cells showing 13.6- and 10.6-fold increases in luciferase activities, respectively (p < 0.005 for GPI M versus HaCaT). GPI Anchor Mutant Cells Display Enhanced Smad2 Phosphorylation at Low Doses of TGF-β1—To determine whether the loss of GPI-anchored proteins has any effect on the phosphorylation of endogenous Smad2, HaCaT and GPI M cells were treated with 1–50 pm TGF-β1 for 20 min, and immunoblotting was performed with anti-phospho-Smad2 antibody. As demonstrated in Fig. 4A, GPI M cells displayed enhanced phosphorylation of Smad2 compared with HaCaT cells. In both cell types, Smad2 phosphorylation became detectable at 2 pm TGF-β1 and increased in a dose-dependent manner. However, GPI M cells exhibited enhanced Smad2 phosphorylation in response to low (2 and 5 pm), intermediate (10 pm), and higher (50 pm) doses of TGF-β1. Immunoblotting with an anti-Smad2 antibody that detects both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of Smad2 demonstrated equivalent protein loading and showed that the enhanced Smad2 phosphorylation was not a result of increased expression of Smad2. Equal protein loading of HaCaT and GPI M cell lysates was also confirmed upon immunoblotting with anti-STAT3 antibody because the STAT3 level is not affected by TGF-β treatment during the time period used (27.Wierenga A.T. Schuringa J.J. Eggen B.J. Kruijer W. Vellenga E. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2002; 16: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Importantly, TGF-β2 treatment did not result in enhanced phosphorylation of Smad2 in GPI M cells compared with HaCaT cells, as GPI M and HaCaT cells demonstrated the same weak pattern of TGF-β2-induced Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Elevated Smad2 Phosphorylation Is Sustained in GPI Anchor Mutant Cells—We further examined whether the GPI anchor-deficient cells exhibited enhanced Smad2 phosphorylation upon prolonged exposure to TGF-β1 (Fig. 5A). In response to 100 pm TGF-β1, maximal stimulation of Smad2 phosphorylation in HaCaT cells occurred at 10 min and was maintained for 180 min. In comparison with HaCaT cells, GPI M cells displayed significantly elevated Smad2 phosphorylation, which was evident at 45 min and was sustained for up to 180 min. The second GPI anchor mutant clone (GPI M1) also exhibited enhanced Smad2 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β1 (Fig. 5B). In this experiment, GPI M1 cells displayed an elevated level of TGF-β1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation compared with HaCaT cells after 20 min, and this was sustained for up to 180 min. On the other hand, Smad2 phosphorylation in GPI NM control cells in response to TGF-β1 was similar to that in HaCaT cells at all time periods studied (Fig. 5C). Immunoblotting with anti-STAT3 antibody demonstrated equal protein loading of the cell lysates. These results show that the GPI anchor-deficient cells (GPI M and GPI M1), but not GPI NM control cells, exhibit enhanced TGF-β1-stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous Smad2 in comparison with parental HaCaT cells. GPI Anchor Mutant Cells Display Enhanced Smad3 Activation at Low Doses of TGF-β1—Although both Smad2 and Smad3 act as mediators of cellular responses elicited by TGF-β, they have been shown to have differing functions (28.Choy L. Skillington J. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 667-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 29.Piek E. Ju W.J. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19945-19953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Also, Smad3 binds DNA directly, whereas Smad2 does not (19.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). Because the experiments described above demonstrate that GPI mutant cells displayed enhanced Smad2 phosphorylation, it was of interest to determine whether these cells demonstrate augmented Smad3 activation. To analyze Smad3 activation, we transfected GPI M and HaCaT cells with the (CAGA)12-lux reporter construct specific for Smad3-driven signaling and compared luciferase activity in response to TGF-β1 treatment. Fig. 6 shows that GPI M cells had a higher luciferase activity than HaCaT cells at 0, 5, and 50 pm TGF-β1 (p < 0.05, p < 0.0006, and p < 0.001, respectively). Stimulation of TGF-β1-induced Transcriptional Activity in GPI Anchor Mutant Cells Involves Smad3—We then determined whether Smad3 is involved in the stimulation of PAI-1 transcriptional activity induced by TGF-β in GPI M cells. The PAI-1 promoter present in the 3TP-lux reporter construct contains three consensus binding sites for Smad3, but is also responsive to other transcription factors such as c-Jun (30.Qing J. Zhang Y.

Frozen cell mass (5 g) was thawed in 25 ml of 50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 7.2, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A). The suspension was subjected to ultrasonic treatment and was then centrifuged. The supernatant was dialyzed against 10 volumes of buffer A and centrifuged. The solution was placed on top of a column of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (2 × 18 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer A and was then developed with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in buffer A (total volume, 280 ml; flow rate, 1 ml min–1). Riboflavin synthase was eluted from 200 to 240 ml. Fractions were combined, concentrated, dialyzed against 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and centrifuged. The supernatant was passed through a Superdex 200 HiLoad 26/60 column (2.6 × 60 cm) that was developed with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7. Riboflavin synthase was eluted from 210 to 225 ml. Fractions were combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration was determined photometrically (ϵ280 = 47,700 m–1 cm–1).Stopped Flow Measurements—Experiments were performed with an SFM4/QS apparatus from Bio-Logic (Claix, France) equipped with a linear array of three mixers and four independent syringes. The content of a 1.5-mm light path quartz cuvette behind the last mixer was monitored by a Tidas diode array spectrophotometer (200–610 nm) equipped with a 15-watt deuterium lamp as light source (J&M Analytische Messund Regeltechnik, Aalen, Germany). The reaction buffer contained 150 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.9, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The enzyme solution was mixed with substrate solution at a ratio of 1:1 at a temperature of 25 °C and a total flow rate of 4 ml s–1. The calculated dead time was 7.6 ms. Spectra integrated over 96 ms were recorded at intervals of 100 ms.Quenched Flow Experiments—The mixing apparatus described above was equipped with a computer-controlled valve instead of the optical cuvette. A delay loop of 230-μl nominal volume was filled with reactants at a temperature of 25 °C and a total flow rate of 4 ml s–1. At the times indicated, the reaction mixtures in the delay loop were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with 0.3 m hydrochloric acid at a flow rate of 4 ml s–1. Trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 50 mm, and the samples were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was stored at –80 °C for further analysis.High Performance Liquid Chromatography—Experiments were performed with a column of Hypersil RP 18 (4 × 250 mm, Schambeck, Bad Honnef, Germany) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min–1. An eluent containing methanol/formic acid/water (25:1:288, v/v/v) was used for determination of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (retention volume, 6.5 ml) and compound 6 (retention volume, 7.4 ml). An eluent containing 0.1 m ammonium formate and 40% methanol (v/v) was used for determination of riboflavin (retention volume, 2.2 ml). The effluent was monitored by a diode array photometer.Global Analysis of Data from Stopped Flow Experiments—Prior to data analysis, the absorbance background caused by the enzyme was removed by subtraction of a blank data set obtained without addition of substrate. Data reduction and stronger weighting of early spectra were achieved by extracting 300 spectra on a pseudo-logarithmic time base from the difference data sets. These data sets were then analyzed using the program SPECFIT/32 3.0.30 (Spectrum Software Associates, Marlborough, MA).Analysis of Data from Quenched Flow Experiments—The data sets were analyzed using the program DynaFit (17Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar).RESULTSFor presteady state kinetics studies, substrate and protein were mixed at 25 °C. After rapid mixing, the solution typically contained 56 μm enzyme subunits and 92 μm 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (i.e. slightly less than one substrate molecule per binding site). Subsequent to mixing, the samples were monitored at 25 °C by multiwavelength photometry. Alternatively, they were incubated for a predetermined period at 25 °C, and the reaction was then terminated by rapid mixing with 0.3 m hydrochloric acid.Optical spectra from stopped flow experiments were corrected for the absorbance contribution of the protein by subtraction of a blank data set acquired without addition of substrate. A series of absorption spectra from a stopped flow experiment extending over a period of 100 s is shown in Fig. 2; the complex landscape reveals major absorption changes over the entire spectral range from 240 to 500 nm.Fig. 2Optical spectra from a single turnover stopped flow experiment. A solution of riboflavin synthase in 150 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.9, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, was rapidly mixed with a solution of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine in the same buffer at 25 °C. The concentrations after mixing were 56 μm enzyme subunits and 92 μm 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine. Absorption spectra were recorded at intervals of 100 ms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)For easier inspection, selected spectra from Fig. 2 are shown in Fig. 3. The first spectrum was acquired by data accumulation during the initial 100 ms after mixing. Although the spectrum is qualitatively similar to that of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine in aqueous solution at pH 7 (Fig. 4A), there are some significant differences, which will be discussed below.Fig. 3Selected optical spectra from the single turnover experiment shown inFig. 2.A, early reaction phase; B, later reaction phase.

Notably, that decrease is the fastest process observed (Fig. 3A and Fig. 5). The spectrum acquired 2.2 s after mixing (Fig. 3A) indicates a decrease of absorption at 408 and 256 nm and an increase of absorption in the range of 300–320 and in the range above 445 nm.Fig. 5Absorbance changes observed during a single turnover stopped flow experiment.Symbols represent experimental data from Fig. 2. Solid lines represents the numerical simulation using the kinetic constants in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In the later phase of the experiment, the long wavelength region of the spectra (Fig. 4B) is similar to the characteristic spectrum of riboflavin. The absorption at 480, which is almost exclusively due to enzymatically formed riboflavin (see below for details), increases monotonously with a markedly sigmoidal initial phase (Fig. 5).Numerical deconvolution of the spectra in Fig. 2 afforded three components (Fig. 6A). The reconstructed spectrum A is similar to but not identical with the spectrum of free 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (Fig. 4A) and will be discussed in more detail below. Transient B is similar to the spectrum of compound 6 (Fig. 4A). Transient C (Fig. 6A) is similar to a mixture of riboflavin and the compound 9 (Fig. 4B). The subtle differences between the reconstructed transient spectra and the spectra of compounds 1, 6, 8, and 9 in aqueous solutions without enzyme are relevant and will be addressed under the “Discussion.”Fig. 6Numerical simulation of stopped and quenched flow data.A, reconstructed absorbance spectra of transient chromophores.

B, concentrations of transient species afforded by regression analysis (▪, compound 6 from quenched flow data).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The concentrations of the transient species as a function of time were extracted from the data in Fig. 2 by linear deconvolution (Fig. 5). The concentration of the transient species A (enzyme-bound substrate, cf. “Discussion”) shows a monotonous decrease. The concentration of the transient species B (i.e. the pentacyclic intermediate, compound 6) goes through a maximum at about 3 s. The transient species C (i.e. the sum of riboflavin and 9 formed in a 1:1 ratio) shows a monotonous increase with a sigmoidal initial phase. For the interpretation of the kinetic data, it is important to note that the formation of compound 6 from two molecules of lumazine (1) is a reversible reaction. Our earlier studies have shown that the partitioning factor for the transformation of compound 6 into compound 1 (reverse reaction) and to riboflavin (8) (forward reaction) by riboflavin synthase of E. coli has a value of about 5 (12Illarionov B. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7224-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). That ratio was included in the numerical analysis described below.The data in Fig. 2 were numerically fitted to Reaction 1 and Equation 1.2compound1⇌k2k1compound6→k3compound8+compound9Reaction 1 k3=5k2(Eq. 1) The forward reaction affording 6 from 1 is best described as a second order reaction, whereas the subsequent decay of 6 affording two molecules of 1 or one molecule each of riboflavin (8) and compound 9 is best described as a first order reaction. The best fit was obtained with the rate constants shown in Table I. The calculated absorption of the samples at different wavelength as a function of time affords the lines shown in Fig. 5. The experimental data (symbols in Fig. 5) agree well with the results of the numerical simulation.Table IKinetic constants obtained from single turnover stopped flow and quenched flow experimentsRate constants, quenched flowRate constants, stopped flowk1, μM-1 S-10.0048 ± 0.00080.0023 ± 0.0003k2, S-10.060 ± 0.0070.036 ± 0.002k3, S-10.29 ± 0.030.18 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab In order to confirm unequivocally the identity of all transient species, we performed quenched flow experiments under experimental conditions closely similar to the stopped flow experiments. After rapid mixing of enzyme solution and substrate solution and a subsequent incubation period, the reaction was terminated by rapid mixing with hydrochloric acid. The samples were than analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography, which indicated three components with significant absorbance in the spectral range above 320 nm. Based on the retention volumes and the optical spectra, these components could be easily assigned as riboflavin (8), 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (1), and the pentacyclic intermediate (6).The second enzyme product, compound 9, migrates with the solvent front on the reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography column and is relatively unstable. However, that compound did not require individual monitoring because riboflavin and compound 9 are formed in a 1:1 molar ratio. When the experimentally determined concentrations of compounds 1, 6, and 8 were added up under consideration of the reaction stoichiometry (2 equivalents of compound 1 are equivalent to compound 6 and compound 8, respectively), the sum was found to be constant within the experimental limits throughout the time course of the quenched flow experiment (Fig. 7). This suggests that no significantly populated transient species had gone undetected. Stopped flow as well as quenched flow experiments indicate that the pentacyclic intermediate (compound 6) is the only transient species that is significantly populated.Fig. 7Numerical simulation of quenched flow data.Symbols represent experimental data. ▪, compound 1; ○, compound 6; ▴, riboflavin (8); ▵, molar sum. Lines represent the numerical simulation using the kinetic constants in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In Fig. 6B, the concentration of compound 6 observed in a typical quenched flow experiment is shown together with concentrations calculated from optical stopped flow data. The results from the two methods are in reasonable agreement.The quenched flow data were again fitted to Reaction 1 and Equation 1. The curves in Fig. 7 give a fit obtained with the parameters in Table I. The kinetic constants derived from stopped flow and quenched flow experiments differ by factors of ∼2.The approximate concentration of riboflavin formed in stopped flow experiments can be gleaned easily from the absorption at 480 nm. More specifically, riboflavin has an absorbance coefficient of 7140 m–1 cm–1, and compound 6 in the enzyme-bound form has an absorbance coefficient of about 1100 m–1 cm–1 at that wavelength. Moreover, we know from the analysis described above that the fraction of 6 is always low and negligible in the terminal reaction phase.In order to determine how riboflavin synthase responds kinetically when the amount of substrate is insufficient to load all six binding sites on the protein trimer in single turnover experiments, we performed a series of stopped flow experiments with different enzyme/substrate ratios (0.5–2 substrate molecules per enzyme subunit). The formation of riboflavin was monitored photometrically at 480 nm. In Fig. 8, these data have been normalized to the initial substrate concentration. The normalized absorption curves are closely similar at the higher substrate concentrations used but differ at the lower substrate concentrations used in the experiment.Fig. 8Stopped flow experiments performed with different enzyme to substrate ratios, normalized to the initial substrate concentration. The concentration of enzyme subunits was constant for all experiments (56 μm). The concentrations of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine were (from top to bottom) 92, 77, 61, 46, 31, and 15 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONRowan and Wood (18Rowan T. Wood H.C.S. Proc. Chem. Soc. 1963; : 21-22Google Scholar) found that riboflavin is formed upon boiling of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine in neutral phosphate buffer without a catalyst. Later, Rowan and Wood (13Rowan T. Wood H.C. J. Chem. Soc. 1968; 4: 452-458Google Scholar) and Plaut and Beach (14Beach R. Plaut G.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1969; 40: 3489-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) extended these observations and showed that the uncatalyzed reaction can proceed in neutral as well as in acidic aqueous solution. The uncatalyzed and the enzyme-catalyzed reactions were shown to proceed with the same regiospecificity (5Paterson T. Wood H.C.S. Chem. Commun. 1969; : 290-291Crossref Google Scholar, 19Beach R.L. Plaut G.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 2913-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).The enzyme does not require cofactors or metal ions for activity, and systematic mutagenesis failed to identify amino acid residues that could be assigned a specific role in enzyme catalysis (16Illarionov B. Kemter K. Eberhardt S. Richter G. Cushman M. Bacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11524-11530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although certain modifications of the N-terminal amino acid sequence are conducive to the loss of catalytic activity, the respective amino acids are not in direct contact with the substrate and must exert their influence by indirect effects on the active site topology. The replacement of serine 41 in the E. coli enzyme or cysteine 48 in the enzyme from Schizosaccharomyces pombe is conducive to the loss or substantial reduction of catalytic activity (11Gerhardt S.

Hence, the enzyme may primarily exert its catalytic activity by establishing a favorable topologic relationship of the two-substrate molecules.The riboflavin synthase substrate 1 has rather unusual properties. Deprotonation (pKa 8.3) affords a complex mixture of monoanions (Fig. 9) (20Bown D.H. Keller P.J. Floss H.G. Sedlmaier H. Bacher A. J. Org. Chem. 1986; 51: 2461-2467Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A minor anionic species characterized by a position 7 exomethylene group (compound 10) results from deprotonation of the unusually acidic position 7 methyl group, but the equilibrium mixture is dominated by the tricyclic species 11 and 12, which arise by the addition of the 2′- or 3′-hydroxy groups of the ribityl side chain to the ring carbon atom 7. Rowan and Wood (13Rowan T. Wood H.C. J. Chem. Soc. 1968; 4: 452-458Google Scholar, 18Rowan T. Wood H.C.S. Proc. Chem. Soc. 1963; : 21-22Google Scholar) and Beach and Plaut (14Beach R. Plaut G.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1969; 40: 3489-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) suggested that the initial reaction step in the uncatalyzed as well as the enzyme-catalyzed reaction could involve the electrophilic attack of an exomethylene anion by a second substrate molecule (Fig. 1). Later, Beach and Plaut (3Beach R.L. Plaut G.W. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 760-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) suggested the involvement of tricyclic anion species but that hypothesis appears unlikely in light of recent protein structure data (11Gerhardt S.

Chem. 2001; 66: 3811-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).With this information in hand, we can now address the interpretation of the transient optical spectra in Fig. 6A in closer detail. The major absorption maxima in the reconstructed spectrum of transient A are similar to those of the neutral form of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (1); the observed wavelength shifts (Table II) may arise by modulation of the lumazine chromophore by the protein environment. The minor absorption maxima of transient A in Fig. 6A at 308 and 318 nm are believed to represent a species of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine bound to the enzyme, possibly compound 2b. A comparison of transient A with the spectrum of compound 1 in aqueous solution at pH 6.9 (Fig. 4A) suggests that the pKa of the substrate is decreased to some extent upon binding to the enzyme.Table IIOptical absorption maxima of compounds occurring in the reaction trajectory of riboflavin synthase (150 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.9)λ1λ2λ3λ4nmCompound 1256276408Transient A257279318409Compound 6256279306415Transient B254280308415Compound 8266370445Compound 8, enzyme-bound272385453Compound 9284Compound 9, enzyme-bound278Transient C272385454 Open table in a new tab The first spectrum in Fig. 3, which was accumulated during a period of about 100 ms after termination of the mixing process, is virtually identical with the reconstructed transient A spectrum in Fig. 6B. This suggests that binding of the substrate to the enzyme is too rapid to be resolved under our experimental conditions. Hence, kon cannot be determined from the present data.The spectrum of transient B (Fig. 6A) closely resembles that of compound 6 in aqueous solution (Fig. 4A). The concentration of that transient species passes through a maximum at about 4 s after mixing, as shown in Fig. 6B. The data from quenched flow experiments agree with the data from stopped flow within the experimental limits. Hence, transient B in Fig. 6B can be assigned as enzyme-bound compound 6.The reconstructed spectrum C in Fig. 6A is similar to the spectrum of the enzyme-bound stoichiometric mixture of riboflavin and compound 9 (Fig. 4B), but the long wavelength maxima are shifted from 445 to 453 nm and from 370 to 385 nm. This is similar to bathochromic shifts observed upon binding of flavins to a variety of flavoproteins (24Harvey R.A. Plaut G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2120-2136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The failure to detect other reaction intermediates in the presteady state experiments could be due to the following reasons. (i) The reaction mechanism may involve fewer intermediates than suggested in Fig. 1. (ii) With the exception of compound 6, the transient concentrations of all intermediates may be too low for optical detection. (iii) The spectra of certain intermediates may be too closely similar to those of compounds 1, 2, or 3 to permit detection by numerical deconvolution.The hypothetical exomethylene anion 2a in Fig. 1 should absorb around 360 nm, based on comparison with spectroscopic data of 6,7,8-trimethyllumazine (25Beach R.L. Plaut G.W.E. J. Org. Chem. 1971; 36: 3937-3943Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). That species, if sufficiently populated, would probably not have escaped detection. Similarly, the hypothetical intermediate 4 in Fig. 1 would be expected to absorb around 360 nm and should have been detected if the transient concentration had been sufficiently large. The hypothetical intermediate 7 is structurally similar to a transient species of the reaction catalyzed by 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase (26Schramek N. Haase I. Fischer M. Bacher A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 4460-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which shows strong absorbance at 455 nm but not around 370 nm. Again, such a transient spectrum would probably have been picked up by the deconvolution program if the concentration had been sufficient enou"
https://openalex.org/W1562166306,"The roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis by MutS in mismatch repair are poorly understood. MutS E694A, in which Glu-694 of the Walker B motif is substituted with alanine, is defective in hydrolysis of bound ATP and has been reported to support MutL-dependent activation of the MutH d(GATC) endonuclease in a trans DNA activation assay (Junop, M. S., Obmolova, G., Rausch, K., Hsieh, P., and Yang, W. (2001) Mol. Cell 7, 1–12). Because the MutH trans activation assay used in these previous studies was characterized by high background and low efficiency, we have re-evaluated the activities of MutS E694A. In contrast to native MutS, which can be isolated in a nucleotide-free form, purified MutS E694A contains 1.0 mol of bound ATP per dimer equivalent, and substoichiometric levels of bound ADP (0.08–0.58 mol/dimer), consistent with the suggestion that the ADP·MutS·ATP complex comprises a significant fraction of the protein in solution (Bjornson, K. P. and Modrich, P. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 18557–18562). In the presence of Mg2+, endogenous ATP is hydrolyzed with a rate constant of 0.12 min-1 at 30 °C, and hydrolysis yields a protein that displays increased specificity for heteroduplex DNA. As observed with wild type MutS, ATP can promote release of MutS E694A from a mismatch. However, the mutant protein is defective in the methyl-directed, mismatch- and MutL-dependent cis activation of MutH endonuclease on a 6.4-kilobase pair heteroduplex, displaying only 1 to 2% of the activity of wild type MutS. The mutant protein also fails to support normal assembly of the MutS·MutL·DNA ternary complex. Although a putative ternary complex can be observed in the presence of MutS E694A, assembly of this structure displays little if any dependence on a mismatched base pair. The roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis by MutS in mismatch repair are poorly understood.

This bidirectional excision capability implies that the mismatch repair system must establish the relative orientation of the mismatch and strand break that directs the reaction. This is necessary to ensure loading of a 3′ to 5′ excision system when the nick resides 3′ to the mispair and a 5′ to 3′ system when it is located 5′ to the mismatch. In addition to its mismatch binding site, MutS has a carboxyl-terminal ATPase that is required for function of the protein in mismatch repair (7.Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Several models for ATPase function in MutS homolog action have been suggested. One class of mechanism is based on a variety of observations indicating that in the presence of ATP, MutS homologs can leave a mismatch by movement along the helix (26.Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 27.Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

This movement is postulated to link mismatch recognition to activation of downstream events at the strand break that directs excision, and can in principle account for the orientation-dependent loading of the excision system at the strand break that is necessitated by the bidirectional nature of the repair system. Two types of mechanisms have been proposed to explain ATP-dependent movement of MutS homologs along the DNA contour. One model posits that movement depends on ATP hydrolysis by the DNA-bound protein. The alternate molecular switch model postulates a G-protein like mechanism whereby binding of a MutS·ADP complex to a mismatch promotes ATP exchange for ADP, with the resulting MutS·ATP complex diffusing freely along the helix. Evidence consistent with both the hydrolytic model (26.Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D.

A distinct role for ATP binding and hydrolysis has been proposed based on use of a trans assay for MutH activation (23.Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this work, a mismatch on one oligonucleotide duplex was shown to lead to MutH activation and d(GATC) incision on a second synthetic duplex in a reaction dependent on MutL and MutS. These observations have led to the suggestion that once mismatch recognition occurs, MutS remains bound to the mispair during the course of repair, with mismatch-strand signal interaction mediated by DNA bending (23.Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In this proposal, ATP binding and hydrolysis by DNA-bound MutS functions in a kinetic proofreading mechanism that serves to verify mismatch recognition. Once bound to a putative mismatch, MutS is postulated to bind ATP. If the complex involves a misrecognition event, MutS is released and ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP. However, if MutS resides at a bona fide mismatch, ATP binding serves to verify mismatch recognition and is sufficient for activation of downstream repair activities in the absence of hydrolysis (23.Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The latter feature of the model is based on the experimental observation that MutS E694A, which is defective in ATP hydrolysis, supports MutH activation in the trans assay. However, the trans activation reactions on which this conclusion is based are several hundredfold less efficient than cis activation that occurs on 6,400-base pair heteroduplexes that have been used to study methyl-directed repair in vivo and in vitro (2.Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1984; 49: 589-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When normalized to input MutH, the rate of the cis reaction is about 0.1 min-1 per mol of MutH (7.Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding value for the trans reaction calculated from the data of Junop et al. (23.Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) is about 0.0002 min-1 per mol. Furthermore, in contrast to the cis reaction (7.Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the trans activation reaction employed in these earlier studies (23.Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 34.Junop M.S. Yang W. Funchain P. Clendenin W. Miller J.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 387-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) is subject to high background d(GATC) cleavage in the absence of MutS or a mismatched base pair (≈45% of that observed when these required repair components are present). Corresponding values for the cis assay are <3 and ≤10%, respectively (7.Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons we have re-evaluated the ability of MutS E694A to support MutH activation using the cis assay. In contrast to results obtained with the trans assay, we find MutS E694A to be defective in MutH activation, a defect that is probably due to its inability to support mismatch-dependent assembly of a MutL·MutS·heteroduplex complex. Proteins and DNAs—The expression plasmid MutSE694A/pET15b for a His6-tagged version of Escherichia coli MutS E694A (23.Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) was generously provided by Peggy Hsieh (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). An expression plasmid for a non-tagged version of the mutant protein was constructed by insertion of a NcoI-BamHI fragment containing COOH-terminal MutS E694A sequences into NcoI- and BamHI-cleaved pVB661. The latter plasmid is a derivative of pET3a containing a 934-bp NdeI fragment that corresponds to NH2-terminal mutS sequences beginning with the initiating ATG located within the NdeI recognition site. Sequence analysis of the entire mutS gene of the resulting plasmid, SpET3a-E694A, confirmed the presence of the E694A mutation within an otherwise native sequence that lacks the His6 tag. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) mutS::Tn10 pLysS containing SpET3a-E694A was grown at 37 °C in a BioFlow 4500 fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific) to an A590 of 5.6 in 22 liters of supplemented L broth (0.1 m KPO4, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 22 g/liter yeast extract, 11 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter NaCl, 4 mg/liter thymine, and 10 mg/liter thiamine) with O2 aeration. After addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm, growth was continued for 2 h at 37 °C (final A590 = 13.8) and cells were harvested by centrifugation. Use of BL21(DE3) mutS::Tn10 as host for expression of the mutant protein precludes contamination of MutS E694A isolates with wild type MutS expressed by the cellular gene. E. coli MutS and MutS E694A were purified as described (30.Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34339-34347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) except that chromatography on a heparin affinity column was added as a last step. Pooled fractions eluting from the hydroxylapatite column (75–150 mg, ∼0.5 mg/ml) were dialyzed against 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol and loaded onto a Heparin Hi-Trap column (Amersham Biosciences, 5 ml) equilibrated with 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. After a wash with 20 ml of starting buffer at 1 ml/min, the column was eluted with a 40-min gradient of KCl (100–640 mm) buffered as above. MutS E694A eluted from the column as a single peak at about 280 mm KCl. Wild type MutS eluted in two peaks at 230 and 330 mm KCl. The earlier eluting material, which was the minor component, displayed reduced activity and was discarded. MutS E694A fractions, or those corresponding to the later eluting peak of wild type protein, were pooled, dialyzed, and stored as concentrated stocks (100–400 μm as monomer) in 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50% (v/v) glycerol at -20 °C. Preparations obtained in this manner were estimated to be greater than 98% pure as judged by electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. MutS and MutS E694A concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a monomer extinction coefficient of 69,240 calculated from primary amino acid sequence (35.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Unless specified otherwise, MutS, MutL, and MutH concentrations are expressed as monomer equivalents. As described under “Results,” preparations of MutS E694A contain 1 mol of bound ATP per dimer equivalent and substoichiometric quantities of bound ADP. Analysis of individual fractions indicated that ADP content of the protein decreased across the hydroxylapatite elution profile. To obtain MutSE E694A isolates of differing ADP content, the hydroxylapatite peak was in some cases split into two pools corresponding to early and late eluting fractions. These two pools were separately subjected to chromatography on Heparin Hi-Trap columns as described above. Forty-one and 201-bp G-T heteroduplexes and otherwise identical A·T homoduplexes tagged with 5′-terminal biotin at one end were prepared as described previously (27.Blackwell L.J. Martik D.

Adenine Nucleotide Content of Isolated Proteins—Adenine nucleotide content of MutS and MutS E694A was determined using a bioluminescent assay kit (Sigma). Proteins were diluted to 400 nm (as monomer) with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, heated to 92 °C for 5 min, and transferred to an ice bath for 15 min. After centrifugation through Nanosep MF 0.45-μm filters (Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI), samples of the filtrate were assayed directly for ATP content. ADP was determined after conversion to ATP by incubation of filtrate samples for 45 min at room temperature in reactions containing 67 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.75, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm KCl, 3.2 mm EDTA, 0.18 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 units of pyruvate kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.; desalted prior to use by passage through Sephadex G-25 equilibrated in 88 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8). ADP content was calculated as the difference between the ATP content of samples treated with pyruvate kinase and those not treated. Nucleotide content was determined at MutS concentrations of 12–200 nm (as monomer). Assay response was linear over ADP and ATP concentration ranges of 1.5 to 200 nm and 3 to 400 nm, respectively. Nucleotide Removal from MutS E694A—Two methods were used to deplete MutS E694A isolates of endogenous nucleotide. In Method A the protein was incubated at room temperature for 5 min in 1.5-ml reactions containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2,2 μm MutS E694A, followed by dialysis at 4 °C against 1 liter of 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA for 6 h and against a second 1.5-liter change for an additional 26 h. MutS E694A preparations treated in this manner contained about 0.02 mol of residual ATP and <0.01 mol of ADP per mol of monomer. In Method B, MutS E694A (20 μm) was incubated in 2.5-ml reactions containing 20 mm bis-Tris 1The abbreviations used are: bis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolAMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imido-diphosphateATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)SPRSsurface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 31 units of biotinylated calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was passed over a streptavidin-agarose column (1 ml, Pierce) equilibrated with reaction buffer. Material passing through the column was dialyzed at 4 °C for 3 h against 2 liters of 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and loaded onto a 1-ml Heparin Hi-Trap column, which was washed and eluted as described above. Residual nucleotide content was similar to that obtained with Method A (≈0.02 mol of ATP and <0.01 mol of ADP per mol monomer). 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imido-diphosphate adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. ATPase, Mismatch Repair Assays, and Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—Steady state MutS ATPase hydrolytic parameters and activation of the MutH d(GATC) endonuclease were determined as described previously (36.Bjornson K.P.

Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPRS) was performed on a BIAcore 2000. Streptavidin SA sensor chips were derivatized with about 150 resonance units of biotin-derivatized 41- or 201-bp heteroduplex and homoduplex as indicated. MutS or MutS E694A in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 0.005% surfactant P20 (Buffer B) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and nucleotides as indicated were flowed across the SA chip at 20 μl/min. Measurements were performed at 25 °C, and samples were maintained at 4 °C prior to injection. Chips were regenerated by a 20-μl injection of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate. DNA binding isotherms for MutS and MutS E694A were determined by titration of chip-bound DNA with increasing concentrations of MutS or MutS E694A. Maximum binding values obtained in this manner were analyzed as a function of protein concentration as described previously (30.Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34339-34347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). MutS E694A Is Defective in ATP Hydrolysis and Purifies with One Bound ATP per Dimer Equivalent—It has been previously shown that substitution of Ala for Glu-694 renders His-tagged MutS defective in ATP hydrolysis (ATP Km = 2.2 μm; kcat = 0.02 min-1 per monomer at 23 °C as compared with 116 μm and 2.15 min-1 for the wild type protein (23.Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar)). We have confirmed the E694A hydrolytic defect for the His tag-free form of the mutant protein (Km ≤2 μm; kcat = 0.040 min-1 per monomer at 30 °C and 0.060 min-1 at 37 °C for the mutant protein in the presence of 0.1 m KCl and 5 mm MgCl2 as compared with wild type values of 24 ± 4 μm and 2.1 min-1 per monomer at 30 °C and 29 ± 4 μm and 2.9 min-1 at 37 °C; data not shown). We have previously found that isolated MutS is free of ATP but can contain variable, substoichiometric quantities of bound ADP (<0.01–0.15 mol/mol of monomer) (36.Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 2C. Baitinger and P. Modrich, unpublished observations. Recently modified purification methods (Ref. 30.Blackwell L.J.

Preparations isolated as described under “Experiental Procedures” contained <0.01 mol of adenine nucleotide per mol of MutS monomer. By contrast, near homogeneous preparations of MutS E694A contained 0.50 ± 0.03 mol of ATP and 0.04–0.29 mol of ADP/mol of monomer (four independent preparations; as noted under “Experimental Procedures,” chromatography on hydroxylapatite leads to partial resolution of E694A species according to their ADP content). The presence of the ATP in near homogenous isolates of the mutant protein presumably reflects the hydrolytic defect conferred by the E694A mutation. Because MutS exists as dimers and tetramers in solution and these oligomers harbor two classes of nucleotide binding sites that display specificity for ADP or ATP (22.Lamers M.H. Perrakis A.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the simplest interpretation of the composition of bound nucleotide in MutS E694A preparations is that the triphosphate site is fully occupied in these isolates, but the diphosphate site is only partially populated. ATP and ADP in these preparations are tightly bound as 70–80% of both nucleotides were retained upon 7 h dialysis against buffers containing 1 mm EDTA and 150 mm KCl or 1 m NaCl (not shown). However, incubation of the protein in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2 followed by dialysis (“Experimental Procedures”) resulted in the loss of 90–95% of bound nucleotide. The latter observation suggested that release of endogenous nucleotides may depend on hydrolysis of bound ATP. Indeed, incubation of MutS E694A in the presence of Mg2+ resulted in the hydrolysis of the bound ATP with the concomitant appearance of ADP. As shown in Fig. 1, this event is well described by a single exponential with a rate constant of 0.12 min-1 at 30 °C. The simplest interpretation of this value is that it corresponds to the intrinsic ATP hydrolytic rate constant for the mutant protein. This parameter is almost identical to the kcat for steady state ATP hydrolysis by MutS E694A at 30 °C (see above), which is 0.08 min-1 when expressed per dimer, the minimum MutS functional unit (22.Lamers M.H.

The similarity of these values indicates that hydrolytic chemistry is largely rate-limiting for turnover by MutS E694A. This differs from wild type MutS, for which ATPase turnover in the absence of DNA is governed by product release (36.Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the hydrolytic defect conferred by the E694A substitution can be estimated by comparing the apparent hydrolytic rate constant of 0.12 min-1 at 30 °C for the mutant protein with the rate constant of 80 min-1 at 4 °C that governs the pre-steady-state burst of ATP hydrolysis by wild type MutS (36.Bjornson K.P.
