However, the molecular basis that regulates the production of the adiponectin oligomers remains largely elusive. We have shown previously that several conserved lysine residues (positions 68, 71, 80, and 104) within the collagenous domain of adiponectin are modified by hydroxylation and glycosylation (Wang, Y., Xu, A., Knight, C., Xu, L. Y., and Cooper, G. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 19521–19529). Here, we investigated the potential roles of these post-translational modifications in oligomeric complex formation of adiponectin. Gel filtration chromatography revealed that adiponectin produced from mammalian cells formed trimeric, hexameric, and high molecular weight (HMW) oligomeric complexes. These three oligomeric forms were differentially glycosylated, with the HMW oligomer having the highest carbohydrate content. Disruption of hydroxylation and glycosylation by substitution of the four conserved lysines with arginines selectively abrogated the intracellular assembly of the HMW oligomers in vitro as well as in vivo. In type 2 diabetic patients, both the ratios of HMW to total adiponectin and the degree of adiponectin glycosylation were significantly decreased compared with healthy controls. Functional studies of adiponectin-null mice revealed that abrogation of lysine hydroxylation/glycosylation markedly decreased the ability of adiponectin to stimulate phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase in liver tissue. Chronic treatment of db/db diabetic mice with wild-type adiponectin alleviated hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance, whereas full-length adiponectin without proper post-translational modifications and HMW oligomers showed substantially decreased activities. Taken together, these data suggest that hydroxylation and glycosylation of the lysine residues within the collagenous domain of adiponectin are critically involved in regulating the formation of its HMW oligomeric complex and consequently contribute to the insulin-sensitizing activity of adiponectin in hepatocytes.

Adiponectin, a hormone synthesized by adipocytes, is an abundant serum adipokine with potent insulin-sensitizing activity (1Matsuzawa Y. Funahashi T. Kihara S. Shimomura I. Arterioscler. Thromb.

Elevation of circulating adiponectin by either transgenic overexpression or direct supplementation with recombinant adiponectin can alleviate many metabolic abnormalities associated with various insulin-resistant and/or diabetic animal models (8Fruebis J.

The globular domain of adiponectin decreases postprandial blood glucose, enhances lipid clearance, and increases insulin sensitivity by enhancing fatty acid β-oxidation in skeletal muscle (8Fruebis J. Tsao T.S. Javorschi S. Ebbets-Reed D. Erickson M.R. Yen F.T. Bihain B.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). On the other hand, full-length adiponectin generated from mammalian cells enhances the sensitivity of insulin to inhibit hepatic glucose production by suppressing the expression of several key enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and glucose-6-phosphatase (10Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Du X. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). In addition to its metabolic effects, adiponectin also possesses anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective functions. This adipokine can prevent atherosclerotic lesion formation in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, possibly by decreasing endothelial expression of inflammatory adhesion molecules, blocking foam cell formation, and inhibiting proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells (11Yamauchi T.

It can also alleviate both alcoholic and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver injuries induced by toxins such as carbon tetrachloride and lipopolysaccharides (17Masaki T. Chiba S. Tatsukawa H.

More recently, adiponectin has been proposed to play a protective role against cardiac hypertrophy and ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in myocardium (21Shibata R.

Adiponectin belongs structurally to the complement C1q-like protein family, members of which consist of an N-terminal collagenous domain comprising of 22 Gly-X-Y repeats and a C-terminal globular head domain (3Berg A.H. Combs T.P. Scherer P.E. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 84-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 24Hu E. Liang P. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol.

In the circulation, adiponectin is predominantly present as several characteristic oligomeric complexes (26Pajvani U.B. Du X. Combs T.P. Berg A.H. Rajala M.W. Schulthess T. Engel J. Brownlee M.

The basic building block of the adiponectin complex is a trimer or low molecular weight (LMW) oligomer, which is formed via hydrophobic interactions within its globular domain. Two trimers self-associate to form a disulfide-linked hexamer or middle molecular weight (MMW) oligomer, which further assembles into a bouquet-like high molecular weight (HMW) multimeric complex that consists of 12–18 monomers. Different oligomeric forms of adiponectin might activate different signaling pathways and exert distinct functions on its target tissues (16Wang Y. Lam K.S. Xu J.Y. Lu G. Xu L.Y. Cooper G.J. Xu A. J.

The globular domain of adiponectin, which can form only trimers, is more potent than the other two oligomers in inducing AMPK activation and fatty acid β-oxidation in skeletal muscles (33Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Minokoshi Y. Ito Y. Waki H. Uchida S. Yamashita S. Noda M. Kita S. Ueki K. Eto K. Akanuma Y. Froguel P. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Carling D. Kimura S. Nagai R. Kahn B.B. Kadowaki T. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (3460) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the HMW complex is the most active form of adiponectin in suppressing hepatic glucose production (26Pajvani U.B. Du X. Combs T.P. Berg A.H. Rajala M.W. Schulthess T. Engel J. Brownlee M. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9073-9085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 30Pajvani U.B. Hawkins M. Combs T.P. Rajala M.W. Doebber T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 12152-12162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Furthermore, only the HMW adiponectin, but not the trimeric and hexameric forms, can protect endothelial cells from apoptosis (34Kobayashi H. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Walsh K. Kumada M. Abe Y. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: e27-e31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed recently that the HMW/total adiponectin ratios, but not the absolute amounts of adiponectin, are closely correlated with insulin sensitivity in humans and rodents (30Pajvani U.B. Hawkins M. Combs T.P. Rajala M.W. Doebber T. Berger J.P. Wagner J.A. Wu M. Knopps A. Xiang A.H. Utzschneider K.M. Kahn S.E. Olefsky J.M. Buchanan T.A. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12152-12162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). The percentage composition of the HMW form in db/db diabetic mice is much lower than in wild-type littermates, despite similar levels of total adiponectin in the circulation (29Xu A. Chan K.W. Hoo R.L. Wang Y. Tan K.C. Zhang J. Chen B. Lam M.C. Tse C. Cooper G.J. Lam K.S. J. Biol.

Clinical studies have also demonstrated that T2DM and coronary heart disease are associated with selective reduction of the HMW oligomeric adiponectin (35Tonelli J. Li W. Kishore P. Pajvani U.B.

On the other hand, weight reduction or treatment with the insulin-sensitizing drug rosiglitazone preferentially elevates the HMW form of adiponectin without significant effects on the other two oligomeric complexes (30Pajvani U.B. Hawkins M. Combs T.P. Rajala M.W. Doebber T. Berger J.P. Wagner J.A. Wu M. Knopps A. Xiang A.H. Utzschneider K.M. Kahn S.E. Olefsky J.M. Buchanan T.A. Scherer P.E. J. Biol.

Spranger J. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2712-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two rare missense mutations (G84R and G90S) identified in T2DM patients can form trimers and hexamers, but lack the capacity to form the HMW complex (36Waki H. Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Ito Y. Uchida S. Kita S. Hara K. Hada Y. Vasseur F. Froguel P. Kimura S. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40352-40363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). These data collectively suggest that impaired formation of the HMW adiponectin might be causally associated with insulin resistance and T2DM. The mechanism that regulates the formation and distribution of the oligomeric adiponectin complexes remains largely obscure at this stage. We have shown previously that adiponectin is modified at the post-translational level during its secretion from adipocytes (38Wang Y. Xu A. Knight C. Xu L.Y. Cooper G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19521-19529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Several conserved lysine residues (positions 68, 71, 80, and 104) within the collagenous domain of murine adiponectin are hydroxylated and glycosylated by an α-1,2-glucosylgalactosyl group, which might in turn contribute to its insulin-sensitizing activity in hepatocytes (28Wang Y. Lu G. Wong W.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Gerwig G.J. Lam K.S. Cooper G.J. Xu A. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 3933-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38Wang Y. Xu A. Knight C. Xu L.Y. Cooper G.J. J.

In this study, we investigated the potential roles of these post-translational modifications in regulating the oligomeric complex formation of adiponectin in cell culture systems, animal models, and human subjects. Materials—Minoxidil, dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, FLAG peptide, and anti-FLAG antibody M2 affinity gel were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Lipofectamine transfection reagent were from Invitrogen. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene. The Adeno-X expression system and the Immun-Blot kit for glycoprotein detection were from Clontech and Bio-Rad, respectively. The antibodies against total AMPKα and phospho-Thr172 AMPKα were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Diagnostics. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The expression vector pcDNA-Ad-F, which encodes full-length murine adiponectin with a FLAG epitope tag at its C terminus (38Wang Y. Xu A. Knight C. Xu L.Y. Cooper G.J. J.

The oligonucleotide primers used for mutation of each lysine residue are listed in Table 1. Expression vectors encoding various FLAG-tagged adiponectin variants with one, two, three, or all four lysine residues substituted with arginines were constructed by sequential mutation of each site. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Primer sequences used for site-directed mutagenesisMutation siteSequence (5′-3′)68Forward: GGCACTCCTGGAGAGCGGGGAGAGAAAGGReverse: CCTTTCTCTCCCCGCTCTCCAGGAGTGCC71Forward: GGAGAGAAGGGAGAGCGAGGAGATGCAGGTCReverse: GACCTGCATCTCCTCGCTCTCCCTTCTCTCC68/71Forward: GCACTCCTGGAGAGCGGGGAGAGCGAGGAGATGCAGGReverse: CCTGCATCTCCTCGCTCTCCCCGCTCTCCAGGAGTGC80Forward: GGTCTTCTTGGTCCTCGGGGTGAGACAGGAGReverse: CTCCTGTCTCACCCCGAGGACCAAGAAGACC104Forward: CCCCTGGCAGGCGAGGAGAGCCTGGAGReverse: CTCCAGGCTCTCCTCGCCTGCCAGGGG Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Recombinant Murine Adiponectin and Its Variants—The vectors for expression of wild-type adiponectin or its variants were transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 0.2% vitamin C and 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 48 h. The FLAG-tagged recombinant proteins were purified using the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 affinity gel as we described previously (38Wang Y. Xu A. Knight C. Xu L.Y. Cooper G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19521-19529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The cells were solubilized with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture and stored at –80 °C until used. Construction and Production of Recombinant Adenoviruses Encoding Wild-type or Mutant Adiponectin—Adenovirus expression vectors that encode FLAG-tagged adiponectin and its variants were generated using the Adeno-X expression system as we described previously (39Xu A. Lam M.C. Chan K.W. Wang Y. Zhang J. Hoo R.L. Xu J.Y. Chen B. Chow W.S. Tso A.W. Lam K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The recombinant virus was packaged and amplified in HEK293 cells and purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. The titers of the recombinant virus were determined by plaque assay. Quantification of Different Oligomeric Forms of Adiponectin by Gel Filtration Chromatography and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Serum samples, conditioned culture medium, or cell lysates were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline to a final volume of 1 ml, loaded onto an ΔKTA Explorer fast protein chromatography system, fractionated through a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Each 1-ml fraction was collected and subjected to ELISA analysis for murine adiponectin to determine the concentrations of each oligomeric form of adiponectin as we have described elsewhere (29Xu A.

Western Blot Analysis—For detection of different oligomeric adiponectin complexes, mouse serum samples, cell lysates, or conditioned culture medium was incubated with nonreducing sample buffer (1% SDS, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)) at room temperature for 10 min, separated by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse adiponectin IgG as we described previously (29Xu A.

For detection of total or phosphorylated AMPK, 50 μg of protein homogenates from liver or gastrocnemius muscle was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-total AMPK or anti-phospho-AMPK antibody as described (33Yamauchi T.

Pulse-Chase Experiment—HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors that encode wild-type adiponectin or its variants. 24 h after transfection, cells were starved for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM, which was then replaced with the same fresh medium plus 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Redivue Pro-mix l-[35S] mixture, GE Healthcare) for 2 h. The labeling medium was then replaced with cold DMEM plus a 20-fold excess of methionine and cysteine for different time periods. Both the culture medium and cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation using rabbit anti-mouse adiponectin antibody (29Xu A. Chan K.W. Hoo R.L. Wang Y. Tan K.C. Zhang J. Chen B. Lam M.C. Tse C.

Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm each EDTA and EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitor mixture), and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. All cell lysates were adjusted to an equal protein concentration (0.5 μg/μl) with immunoprecipitation buffer. Cell lysates (500 μl) were preincubated with 50 μl of protein A/G beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h to remove nonspecific binding. The supernatants were incubated with 10 μg of rabbit anti-mouse adiponectin IgG overnight at 4 °C with shaking, and 50 μl of protein A/G beads was then added to the supernatant for another 1 h. The beads were precipitated and washed with immunoprecipitation buffer three times, and the immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted by incubation with 100 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The eluted samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by phosphorimaging (Fujifilm BAS-2000). The radioactivity associated with each band was quantified as we described previously (29Xu A. Chan K.W. Hoo R.L. Wang Y. Tan K.C. Zhang J. Chen B. Lam M.C. Tse C. Cooper G.J. Lam K.S. J. Biol.

Lysyl Hydroxylase Inhibitor Study in Rat Primary Adipocytes—White fat precursor cells were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of 6-week-old male Wistar rats and differentiated into mature adipocytes as described previously (29Xu A.

The cells were treated with either vehicle (0.1% ethanol) or the lysyl hydroxylase inhibitor minoxidil at the indicated concentrations for 2 days in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then incubated with serum-free medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and the inhibitor for another 24 h.

The most common disease-causing protein folding mutation, ΔF508-cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), is destroyed by ERAD to cause cystic fibrosis (CF). p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP) physically interacts with gp78/autocrine motility factor receptor to couple ubiquitination, retrotranslocation, and proteasome degradation of misfolded proteins. We show here that p97/VCP and gp78 form complexes with CFTR during translocation from the ER for degradation by the cytosolic proteasome. Interference in the VCP-CFTR complex promoted accumulation of immature CFTR in the ER and partial rescue of functional chloride channels to the cell surface. Moreover, under these conditions, interleukin-8 (IL8), the expression of which is regulated by the proteasome, was reduced. Inhibition of the proteasome with bortezomib (PS-341/Velcade) also rescued CFTR, but with less efficiency, and suppressed NFκB-mediated IL8 activation. The inhibition of the major stress-inducible transcription factor CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein)/GADD153 together with bortezomib was most effective in repressing NFκB-mediated IL8 activation compared with interference of VCP, MLN-273 (proteasome inhibitor), or 4-phenylbutyrate (histone deacetylase inhibitor). Immunoprecipitation of ΔF508-CFTR from primary CF bronchial epithelial cells confirmed the interaction with VCP and associated chaperones in CF. We conclude that VCP is an integral component of ERAD and cellular stress pathways induced by the unfolded protein response and may be central to the efficacy of CF drugs that target the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). ERAD targets are selected by a quality control system within the ER lumen and are ultimately destroyed by the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-proteasome system. The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a pivotal role in cell homeostasis and is vital in regulating various cellular processes. In normal cells, nearly all proteins are continuously degraded and replaced by de novo synthesis. The spatial separation between substrate selection and degradation in ERAD requires substrate transport from the ER to the cytoplasm by a process termed dislocation, recently reviewed by Meusser et al. (2Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). The most common disease-causing protein folding mutation is deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (ΔF508-CFTR), which results in a temperature-sensitive folding defect and premature degradation by ERAD (3Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). The absence of CFTR at the airway epithelial cell surface disrupts luminal hydration and is associated with an exaggerated immune response (4Rowe S.M. Miller S. Sorscher E.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 1992-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Functional CFTR can be restored by growth at lower temperature (25-27 °C) or incubation with chemical chaperones, which rescues ΔF508-CFTR from ERAD (5Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Mammalian p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP) and its yeast counterpart, Cdc48, participate in retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from the ER for degradation by the cytosolic proteasomes (6Wang Q. Song C. Li C.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). p97/VCP and its cofactors (Ufd1, Npl4, and p47) interact with misfolded ubiquitinated substrates to dislodge them from the ER to the cytosol for proteasome degradation (7Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We have reported recently that p97/VCP physically interacts with gp78 to couple ubiquitination, retro translocation, and proteasome degradation (8Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45676-45684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Originally identified as the tumor autocrine motility factor receptor, gp78 is a multimembrane-spanning protein with RING finger-type ubiquitin-protein ligase activity exposed to the cytoplasmic ER surface. gp78/autocrine motility factor receptor is thus distinguished from CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) and Parkin ubiquitin-protein ligases and closely resembles the yeast ERAD ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase Hrd1p/Der3p. In yeast, Hrd1p/Der3p and Cdc48 are required for CFTR degradation (9Gnann A. Riordan J.R. Wolf D.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4125-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that selective inhibition of ERAD not only rescues ΔF508-CFTR, but also suppresses interleukin (IL)-8 levels, the major inflammatory cytokine in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways. Human Subjects—CF (homozygous for ΔF508-CFTR; n = 3, 7-9 years old) and non-CF (n = 3, 8-17 years old) subjects who were undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for a clinical indication were invited to participate in a Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board- and General Clinical Research Center-approved protocol. All three children with CF were chronically infected with one or more bacteria. The non-CF subjects were children with airway pathology: 1) a case of focal bronchiectasis from an earlier Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (the BAL fluid was culture-positive for Branhamella catarrhalis, and the cytopathology contained neutrophils and lipid-laden macrophages); 2) a case of chronic lung disease and yellow nail syndrome (culture-positive for Hemophilus influenza and associated with neutrophils and lipid-laden macrophages upon BAL); and 3) a case of psychogenic cough (culture-negative and associated with lipid-laden macrophages upon BAL). Except for the case of psychogenic cough, there was a mild inflammatory phenotype. Parents signed informed consent on behalf of their children. Bronchial brushings were obtained after BAL to minimize contamination with mucus and neutrophils. Brushes were directly immersed in cell culture medium on ice for later transport to the laboratory. Investigational Therapeutics—The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib or PS-341 or Velcade (Johns Hopkins Pharmacy) and MLN-273 (under a material transfer agreement) were from Millenium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Cambridge, MA), and 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) was from Sigma. Antibodies and Plasmids—Rabbit anti-CFTR 169 and anti-gp78 polyclonal antibodies have been described previously (8Zhong X. Shen Y.

Mouse/rabbit anti-VCP polyclonal antibodies from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) were used. Anti-Hsp90 (rat monoclonal), anti-Hsp70 (mouse monoclonal/rabbit polyclonal), anti-Hsc70 (rabbit polyclonal), and anti-Hsp40 (rabbit polyclonal) antibodies were purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp. (San Diego, CA). Rabbit anti-CHIP polyclonal antibody was obtained from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The plasmid constructs pCIneo-gp78, pCIneo-gp78C, and VCPQQ have been described previously (8Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45676-45684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). ΔF508-CFTR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and wild-type (wt) CFTR-GFP were constructed in the pS65T-C1 vector. VCP short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was constructed in the pSM2 vector (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). Briefly, the single oligonucleotide containing the hairpin and common 5′- and 3′-ends was used as a PCR template. The oligonucleotide was PCR-amplified using universal primers containing XhoI (5′) and EcoRI (3′) sites. The PCR fragment was then cloned into the hairpin cloning site of pSM2. The VCP anti-sense/target sequence 22-mer is shown in boldface, and common microRNA-30 context regions are shown in italics below. The VCP shRNA was amplified using the Advantage-GC PCR kit (Qiagen Inc.) with a single-strand 97-nucleotide “microRNA-30-like” DNA template oligonucleotide (TGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGCCCGCAAGAAGATGGATCTCATTAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTAATGAGATCCATCTTCTTGCGGATGCCTACTGCCTCGGA) and primers 5′-miR30PCRXhoIF (CAGAAGGCTCGAGAAGGTATATTGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCG) and 3′-miR30PCREcoRIF (CTAAAGTAGCCCCTTGAATTCCGAGGCAGTAGGCA). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 94 °C for 30 s, and 55 °C for 30 s for 25 cycles; 75 °C for 10 min; and 4 °C forever). The CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) shRNA was purchased from Open Biosystems. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Metabolic Labeling—IB3-1 cells (ΔF508/W1282X, low level expression of ΔF508-CFTR and no W1282X-CFTR protein), CF tracheal epithelial (CFTE) cells (homozygous for ΔF508-CFTR), and S9 cells (IB3-1 cells corrected with adenoassociated virus-CFTR) were maintained in LHC-8 medium (BIO-SOURCE) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% fetal bovine serum (all from Invitrogen). The cells were plated on 6-well plates, transfected with 4 μg of each ΔF508/wt-CFTR-GFP plasmid DNA, and cotransfected with the VCP shRNA (ΔVCP), VCPQQ (deficient in AAA ATPase domains D1 and D2), gp78 small interfering RNA (Δgp78), or gp78ΔC (deficient in the VCP-binding domain) construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. After 48 h of transfection, cells were rinsed three times and starved for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were pulse-labeled with 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (ICN Biomedical, Irvine, CA) for 30 min and then chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm methionine and 4 mm cysteine for the indicated times. Fluorescence Microscopy—After 48 h of transfection, cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing calcium and magnesium (Invitrogen) and loaded with 1 μm ER-Tracker™ Blue-White DPX dye (Invitrogen). Plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 h and examined under a Zeiss Axiovert 135-N fluorescence microscope. A Quantix 1401 charge-coupled device camera and IPLab software Version 3.5 with appropriate filter settings for GFP (fluorescein isothiocyanate) or ER-Tracker Blue (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) were used to capture the images. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed directly on plates using M-PER protein lysis buffer (Pierce) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) after three washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. CF bronchial brushings were transferred to lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitation, total protein extracts (500 μg/ml for cell culture and 50 μg/ml for bronchial brushings) were incubated with 50 μlof protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 3 h at 4 °C. After preclearing, 5 μg of respective primary antibody or preimmune serum (negative control) was added to each tube. After 1 h, protein A/G-agarose beads (50 μl) were added to each tube, and tubes were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed once with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), followed with two washes with phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer (30 μl) containing β-mercaptoethanol, vortexed for 1 min, resolved by 4-10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a 0.4-μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were detected using the respective primary antibodies. For pulse-chase experiments, CFTR immunoprecipitate was eluted with sample buffer and separated on a 4-8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, dried for 2 h, and processed for autoradiography. IL8 Cytokine Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—IB3-1 cells were transfected with the ΔVCP, VCPQQ, Δgp78, or gp78ΔC construct and treated with 5 μm bortezomib or 5 mm 4-PBA. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were induced with 1 ng/ml IL1β. After 48 h of transfection, supernatants were collected, and IL8 levels were measured by solid-phase enzyme amplified sensitivity immunoassay (BIOSOURCE) as specified by the manufacturer. Standards and high and low cytokine controls were included. The plates were read at 450 nm on a 96-well microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.) using SoftMax Pro software. The mean blank reading was subtracted from each sample and control reading. The amount of substrate turnover was determined calorimetrically by measuring the absorbance proportional to IL8 concentration. A standard curve was plotted, and an IL8 concentration in each sample was determined by interpolation from the standard curve. The data represent the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. NoShift NFκB Binding Assay—IB3-1 cells transfected (24 h) with ΔVCP, ΔF508-CFTR, or ΔCHOP were treated with 5 μm bortezomib (6 h), 5 μm MLN-273 (6 h), or 5 mm 4-PBA (24 h). Cells were induced with IL1β (1 ng/ml) for 12 h. After 24 h of transfection, nuclear extracts (11Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) were collected using a NucBuster protein extraction kit (Novagen, San Diego, CA), and the shift in bound NFκB was measured using a NoShift NFκB binding assay kit (Novagen) as specified by the manufacturer. The signal from nuclear extracts was compared with the negative control (minus the extract). The specificity of protein binding was established using NFκB-specific and mutant competitors. The plates were read at 450 nm on a 96-well microplate reader using SoftMax Pro software. The absorbance readings were used to determine the levels of bound NFκB. The data represent the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. N-(Ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-6-methoxyquinolinium Bromide (MQAE) Assay—CFTR-mediated chloride transport activity in IB3-1 cells transfected with the ΔVCP, VCPQQ, Δgp78, or gp78ΔC construct and treated with bortezomib (1, 5, or 10 μm) was assayed using the halide-sensitive dye MQAE. Fluorescence of MQAE is quenched by halides. Cells were grown on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were loaded with the dye by hypotonic shock at 37 °C for 40 min in Opti-MEM/water (1:1) containing 10 mm MQAE, washed, and then mounted in a perfusion chamber for fluorescence measurements. Fluorescence was measured using a Zeiss inverted microscope coupled to a charge-coupled device camera. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 350 and 460 nm, respectively. The stage and objective lenses were maintained at 37 °C. The medium was kept flowing through the perfusion chamber at 1 ml/min using a peristaltic pump. Both 10 μm forskolin and 10 μm genistein were used to induce Cl- transport in IB3-1 cells. CFTR was inhibited with either 5 μm CFTR inhibitor-172 (12) or myristoylated protein kinase A inhibitor 14-22 amide (calbiochem) to reduce cAMP-mediated phosphorylation. Chloride efflux was calculated using Equations 1, 2, 3. F0/FCl=1+[Cl−]i·KSV(Eq. 1) F0=F20·(1+0.02·KSV(Eq. 2) dCl/dt=F0/(KSV·(FCl)2)·dFCl/dt(Eq. 3) Statistical Analysis—All data are represented as the means ± S.D. of three experiments. One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's planned comparison was run for each sample versus the control. A p value <0.05 was considered to have statistical significance. p97/VCP Participates in ERAD of ΔF508-CFTR—To test the hypothesis that VCP is involved in ΔF508-CFTR degradation, we first estimated VCP protein levels in freshly isolated bronchial epithelial cells from ΔF508 CF and non-CF subjects. As expected, VCP levels were up-regulated in all ΔF508 CF subjects compared with non-CF controls (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the difference between CF and non-CF bronchial expression was striking. We next hypothesized that transient knock-down of either VCP or gp78 would rescue ΔF508-CFTR from ERAD in CF bronchial epithelial cells. To reduce the expression of these proteins, we constructed short hairpin/small interfering RNA. The efficiency of VCP shRNA (ΔVCP)-mediated inhibition of VCP protein levels in IB3-1 cells (ΔF508/W1282X CF bronchial epithelial line) (13Zeitlin P.L. Lu L. Rhim J. Cutting G. Stetten G. Kieffer K.A. Craig R. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) was evaluated by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1B, upper panel). To localize ΔF508-CFTR signal, the IB3-1 cells were transfected with ΔF508-CFTR-GFP and cotransfected with ΔVCP or a plasmid control. Inhibition of VCP was associated with accumulation of ΔF508-CFTR-GFP in the ER compared with the control (Fig. 1B, lower panels). Accumulation of ΔF508-CFTR in the ER was confirmed by co-localization of the GFP signal with the signal from ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX. Furthermore, spreading of the GFP signal beyond the ER tracker dye compartment suggested that ΔF508-CFTR-GFP escaped from the ER in ΔVCP IB3-1 cells (Fig. 1C). p97/VCP Inhibition Rescues ΔF508-CFTR from ERAD—In IB3-1 cells, the ER-retained ΔF508-CFTR protein is core-glycosylated (160-kDa immature B form), whereas growth at 26 °C allows the ΔF508-CFTR protein to transit the biosynthetic pathway and to acquire complex glycosylation (180-kDa mature C form) (5Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ΔF508-CFTR band C form has a faster turnover rate from the plasma membrane (14Sharma M. Benharouga M. Hu W. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8942-8950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of ΔVCP on the stability of ΔF508-CFTR bands B and C, IB3-1 cells were first transiently transfected with ΔF508-CFTR-GFP for 48 h and then metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. ΔF508-CFTR was immunoprecipitated with anti-CFTR antibody 169 (15Crawford I. Maloney P.C. Zeitlin P.L. Guggino W.B. Hyde S.C. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Harris A. Higgins C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9262-9266Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) after the indicated chase time (Fig. 2A, Control). Cotransfection with ΔVCP (Fig. 2A) resulted in stabilization of both B and C forms. By comparison, cotransfection with gp78 small interfering RNA (Δgp78) produced only a transient rescue of the mature C form with a peak at 1 h (Fig. 2A), suggesting that VCP (not gp78) is central to extraction of CFTR from the ER for ERAD. S9 cells (IB3-1 cells corrected with wt-CFTR) were similarly transfected with additional wt-CFTR and ΔVCP. We observed an efficient maturation and stability of band B to band C (Fig. 2B), confirming that wt-CFTR and ΔF508-CFTR are extracted and degraded through the same VCP-mediated pathway.FIGURE 2p97/VCP is involved in ERAD of CFTR, and inhibition of VCP or proteasome degradation by bortezomib/PS-341 can rescue CFTR. IB3-1 cells were transfected with ΔF508-CFTR for 48 h, metabolically labeled for 30 min with Tran35S-label, and chased for the indicated time periods. ΔF508-CFTR was immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-CFTR polyclonal antibody 169. A, IB3-1 cells were transfected with ΔF508-CFTR and cotransfected with ΔVCP or Δgp78 for 48 h. VCP/gp78 inhibition resulted in accumulation of ΔF508-CFTR (B form) and partial rescue of the mature C form. B, S9 cells were transfected with wt-CFTR for 48 h or treated with 10 μm PS-341 for 6 h at 42 h post-transfection. Transfected cells were metabolically labeled for 30 min with Tran35S-label and chased for the indicated time periods. wt-CFTR was immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-CFTR polyclonal antibody 169. VCP inhibition rescued wt-CFTR, whereas proteasome modulation by PS-341 stabilized the wt-CFTR mature C form. Data are the means ± S.D. of three experiments. C, CFTE cells were transfected with ΔF508-CFTR. At 42 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 0 or 10 μm PS-341 for 6 h. Proteasome modulation by PS-341 rescued the ΔF508-CFTR mature C form by 2 h. D, IB3-1 cells were transfected with pCIneo, pSM2, pcDNA3, gp78ΔC, ΔHsp70, ΔVCP, Δgp78, or VCPQQ for 48 h or treated with 10 μm PS-341 for 6 h. Both VCP inhibition and proteasome modulation by PS-341 partially rescued ΔF508-CFTR. Data are the means ± S.D. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We considered the proteasomal compartment as a potential therapeutic target for CF not only to test the role of VCP in proteasome-mediated degradation of CFTR, but also because both VCP and proteasome inhibitors are known to stabilize IκB, the inhibitor of the NFκB-mediated inflammatory response (16Dai R.M.

We used bortezomib (6-h treatment) at 10 μm, which leads to partial inhibition of protease activity in IB3-1 cells. Phase microscopic examination revealed no difference in morphology of treated and untreated monolayers (data not shown). To study the effect of bortezomib on another epithelial cell type homozygous for ΔF508-CFTR, we transfected CFTE cells (homozygous for ΔF508-CFTR) (18Kunzelmann K. Schwiebert E.M. Zeitlin P.L. Kuo W.L. Stanton B.A. Gruenert D.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 8: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with ΔF508-CFTR-GFP. After 42 h of transfection, cells were induced with bortezomib (10 μm) for 6 h. We observed a significant increase in the accumulation and stabilization of the B form with 10 μm bortezomib compared with the untreated control (Fig. 2C). S9 cells transfected with wt-CFTR and exposed to bortezomib similarly produced substantial amounts of mature band C (Fig. 2B). To study the effect of inhibiting components of ubiquitination and proteasome degradation on ERAD, we first compared the relative basal levels of the immature B and mature C forms of ΔF508-CFTR in IB3-1 cells by metabolic labeling (t = 2 h) (Fig. 2D, lane 1). We observed no changes in the levels of the B and C forms of ΔF508-CFTR upon transfecting IB3-1 cells with empty vectors (pCIneo/pcDNA3/pSM2) compared with the control (lanes 2-4). In contrast, both VCP and gp78 inhibition resulted in accumulation of the B form compared with the control, whereas the C form showed a more significant increase with VCP inhibition compared with a minimal increase with gp78 inhibition (lanes 7 and 8). Because VCP physically interacts with gp78 (8Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R. Fang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45676-45684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), it is expected that the gp78-VCP interaction may represent one way of coupling ubiquitination with retrotranslocation and degradation of ΔF508-CFTR. To evaluate the effect of this interaction on ERAD of ΔF508-CFTR, we used a gp78ΔC construct deficient in the VCP-binding domain; no change in the levels of the B and C forms of ΔF508-CFTR compared with the control was observed (lane 5), suggesting that this gp78-VCP interaction is required for ERAD of ΔF508-CFTR. Moreover, the VCPQQ construct (deficient in AAA ATPase domains D1 and D2) partially rescued the B and C forms of ΔF508-CFTR (lane 9), indicating that two AAA ATPase domain are involved in ERAD of ΔF508-CFTR. The level of the C form was lower after transfection with the VCPQQ construct compared with complete VCP gene inhibition (ΔVCP) probably due to residual VCP AAA ATPase domain activity. Interference with Hsp70 expression (lane 6) did not rescue CFTR, which we expected because it is the increase in Hsp70 expression that promotes maturation of band B to C (19Choo-Kang L.R. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L58-L68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation by bortezomib partially rescued ΔF508-CFTR from ERAD (lane 10). To investigate the effects of bortezomib on components of ERAD, IB3-1 cells were treated with bortezomib for 6 h and then immunoblotted for ERAD components. Induction of Hsp70 and inhibition of VCP were observed with no change in gp78 and Hsp40 (Fig. 3A). p97/VCP Interacts with the CFTR Immunocomplex—To confirm that both ΔF508-CFTR and wt-CFTR are VCP substrates, we immunoprecipitated CFTR from IB3-1 and S9 total protein extracts (500 μg/ml) using rabbit anti-CFTR polyclonal antibody 169 (15Crawford I. Maloney P.C. Zeitlin P.L. Guggino W.B. Hyde S.C. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Harris A. Higgins C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9262-9266Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). VCP was co-immunoprecipitated with both ΔF508-CFTR and wt-CFTR (Fig. 3B, upper panel), indicating VCP to be the integral component of ERAD of CFTR. It is possible that VCP interacts with residual ΔF508-CFTR in the S9 cell line. Anti-VCP antibody was used as a positive control, and preimmune serum was used as a negative control for immunoprecipitation from IB3-1 cells. We also observed that VCP was co-immunoprecipitated with Hsp40 probably as part of the ΔF508-CFTR immunocomplex from IB3-1 cells (Fig. 3C). To understand the mechanism of VCP-mediated ERAD of CFTR, we analyzed the interaction of VCP with other molecular chaperones known to be associated with ΔF508-CFTR or wt-CFTR degradation machinery. We immunoprecipitated CFTR, Hsp40, Hsp90, Hsc70, Hsp70, CHIP, and VCP from IB3-1 and S9 total protein extracts (500 μg/ml) to evaluate relative VCP levels from each IB3-1 and S9 immunoprecipitate. We found that VCP was independently co-immunoprecipitated with ΔF508-CFTR, Hsp40, Hsp90, Hsc70, Hsp70, and CHIP from IB3-1 cells (Fig. 4A). Relatively higher amounts of VCP were pulled down with anti-Hsp40 and anti-Hsc70 antisera compared with other proteins, suggesting a stronger interaction or higher stoichiometry. VCP was pulled down together with Hsp90 and Hsp70 immunocomplexes from IB3-1 cells, but not from S9 cells (Fig. 4A). Moreover, VCP had a higher stoichiometry for these molecular chaperones in the presence of ΔF508-CFTR (IB3-1 cells) compared with wt-CFTR (S9 cells). Freshly isolated bronchial epithelial cells brushed from CF patients homozygous for ΔF508-CFTR were examined by immunoprecipitation of individual components of ERAD and immunoblotting for VCP or Hsc70 (Fig. 4B). Again, VCP and Hsc70 were prominent with anti-Hsp40 antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2018179312,"Proline oxidase (POX), often considered a ‘housekeeping enzyme’ might play an important role in apoptosis. We have shown that POX generated proline-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically superoxide radicals, and induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway. In our current report, we used DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells stably transfected with the POX gene under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter and found POX-stimulated expression of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), DR5 and cleavage of caspase-8. Importantly, apoptosis measured by flow cytometry was partially inhibited by Z-IETD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase-8. These findings suggest that the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway also is activated by POX. Furthermore, the mechanism of this effect on the extrinsic pathway, specifically, the induction of TRAIL by POX, may be mediated by NFAT transcription factors. Additionally, POX expression also dramatically decreased phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, and the decrease was partially reversed by expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Overexpression of constitutively active form of MEK, acMEK, partially blocked POX-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest the involvement of MEK/ERK signaling and further confirm the role of ROS/superoxides in POX-induced apoptosis. Combined with previously published data, we conclude that POX may induce apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways and is involved in nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling and regulation of the MEK/ERK pathway. It is suggested that, as a nutrition factor, POX may modulate apoptosis signals induced by p53 or other anti-cancer agents and enhance apoptosis in stress situations."
https://openalex.org/W2035279478,"A truncated naturally occurring variant of the human receptor P2X7 was identified in cancer cervical cells. The novel protein (P2X7-j), a polypeptide of 258 amino acids, lacks the entire intracellular carboxyl terminus, the second transmembrane domain, and the distal third of the extracellular loop of the full-length P2X7 receptor. The P2X7-j was expressed in the plasma membrane; it showed diminished ligand-binding and channel function capacities and failed to form pores and mediate apoptosis in response to treatment with the P2X7 receptor agonist benzoyl-ATP. The P2X7-j interacted with the full-length P2X7 in a manner suggesting heterooligomerization and blocked the P2X7-mediated actions. Interestingly, P2X7-j immunoreactivity and mRNA expression were similar in lysates of human cancer and normal cervical tissues, but fulllength P2X7 immunoreactivity and mRNA expression were higher in normal than in cancer tissues, and cancer tissues lacked 205-kDa P2X7 immunoreactivity suggesting lack of P2X7 homo(tri)-oligomerization. These results identify a novel P2X7 variant with apoptosis-inhibitory actions, and demonstrate a distinct regulatory property for a truncated variant to antagonize its full-length counterpart through hetero-oligomerization.

Although most cases are detected and managed at an early stage of development, an estimated 13,000 women progress to invasive cancer and about 4000 women die annually of the disease in the United States (21Saslow D.

Until recently little was known about the role of the P2X7 system in human cancer cervical cells. ATP and the P2X7-specific agonist 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-adenosine 5′-triphosphate (BzATP) 3The abbreviations used are: BzATP, 2′,3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-adenosine 5′-triphosphate; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RT, reverse transcriptase; HA, hemagglutinin. can induce apoptosis in both normal and cancer cervical cells. However, the effects are greater in normal than in cancer cells (19Wang Q. Wang L. Feng Y.H. Li X. Zeng R. Gorodeski G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1349-C1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting that cancer cervical cells have evolved mechanisms that protect them from P2X7-mediated apoptosis. Understanding these phenomena is important because mechanisms that block apoptosis could provide growth advantage to cells and enhance the growth of cancers. The present paper reports our discovery of a novel variant of the human P2X7 (P2X7-j) that lacks the entire intracellular carboxyl terminus, the second transmembrane domain, and the distal third of the extracellular loop of the P2X7. This variant was deficient in ligand binding, but interacted with the full-length P2X7 and blocked P2X7-mediated channel activity. Because pore formation depends on oligomerization of P2X7 molecules (22North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar), the present results suggest that the P2X7-j variant hetero-oligomerizes with the full-length P2X7 to form nonfunctional P2X7 oligomers that do not mediate P2X7-dependent apoptosis. Because in cancer cervical cells the P2X7-j is co-expressed with the wild-type P2X7 (present results), it is hypothesized that co-expression of the P2X7-j could lead to defective apoptosis and enhance the growth of the cancer cervical cells. Reagents, Cells, and Human Tissues—All chemicals, unless specified otherwise, were obtained from Sigma. The following types of cells were used (all from ATCC): human cervical epithelial cancer CaSki, HeLa, SiHa, and HT3 cells; MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, strain II); and HEK293 (human embryonic kidney 293 cells). MDCK cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing Earle's salts and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cell culture conditions for the other types of cells were described (19Wang Q. Wang L. Feng Y.H. Li X. Zeng R. Gorodeski G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1349-C1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Discarded human uterine cervical tissues from women undergoing hysterectomy for indications unrelated to the present study were obtained according to IRB protocols 12-03-50 and 03-90-300 from the Human Tissue Procurement Facility of University Hospitals of Cleveland and the Comprehensive Cancer Center Tissue Procurement Core Facility (CTPC), Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH; and from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) (National Cancer Institute) through the Human Tissue Resource Network (HTRN), Department of Pathology at the Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. Upon removal, tissues were washed in cold saline, snap frozen in liquid N2, transferred in liquid N2, or shipped on dry ice to the laboratory and stored at -80 °C until assayed. The present experiments utilized a total of three histologically normal human uterine cervical tissues and three tissues designated histologically as squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix. The histological diagnoses were assigned by the Departments of Pathology at University Hospitals of Cleveland or at Ohio State University. All six tissues were from premenopausal women ages 44-49. For assays, cultured cells were lysed as described (14Feng Y.H. Wang L. Wang Q. Li X. Zeng R. Gorodeski G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1342-C1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Tissues (about 30 mg) were minced using mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Halt Protease Inhibitor Mixture Kit, Pierce). Protein quantification was performed using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were mixed with 2 × SDS sample buffer, boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, and stored at -80 °C. Molecular Biology Techniques and Transfections—Total RNA extracted from CaSki cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used for RT-PCR using the RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen Corp.) to amplify the human P2X7 gene (Ref. 23Buell G.N. Talabot F. Gos A. Lorenz J. Lai E. Morris M.A. Antonarakis S.E. Receptors Channels. 1998; 6: 347-354Google Scholar, GenBank™ accession number Y09561). Oligo(dT) primer was used for the RT reaction. A pair of P2X7 primers (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) of sense (TTTTTAAGCTTATGCCGGCCTGCTGCAGCTG) and antisense (TTTTTGCGGCCGCTCAGTAAGGACTCTTGAAGCC) were used for PCR amplification. The amplified P2X7 genes were subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT vector (Invitrogen) with HindIII and NotI sites. For inducible expression of P2X7 receptors in MDCK cells that lack endogenous expression of the receptors, P2X7 genes were subcloned into pcDNA4/TO vector (Invitrogen) with HindIII and NotI sites. A c-Myc tag was also attached to the NH2-terminal of the P2X7 genes with a new Myc-containing sense primer (TTTTAAGCTTATGGAACAAAAACTTATTTCTGAAGAAGATCTGCCGGCCTGCTGCAGCTGA) and the same antisense primer. For simultaneous heterologous expression of both the P2X7 and the P2X7-j in HEK293 cells, P2X7 and Myc-P2X7-j or Myc-P2X7 and P2X7-j DNAs were subcloned into pBud 4.1 plasmid (Invitrogen) with HindIII and NotI sites or XbaI and BglII sites, respectively. All genes were fully sequenced for both strands (Cleveland Genomics, Cleveland, OH). Transfections of P2X7 plasmid DNAs were performed using Gene-PORTER Transfection Reagent (GST Inc. San Diego, CA). For generation of stable MDCK cells, zeocin at 300 μg/ml was used. Stable clonal cells were maintained in minimal essential medium containing 5% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml zeocin. Inducibility of expression of P2X7 genes (Myc-P2X7 and Myc-P2X7-j) in the stable MDCK cells was confirmed by RT-PCR with sense primer (CTGTTCCTCTGACCGAGGTT) and antisense primer (TCCGTTTCTCAACATTGTTTTCC). The PCR products for the Myc-P2X7 and Myc-P2X7-j were 539 and 401 bp, respectively (Fig. 2). Expression of Myc-P2X7 and Myc-P2X7-j proteins in stable MDCK cells was induced by 100 ng/ml doxycycline. Stable HEK293 clonal cells were generated by transfection of P2X7 genes in pBud4.1 vector or pcDNA5/FRT vector in Flp-In™-293 cells (Invitrogen) and selection in the presence of 300 μg/ml zeocin or 500 μg/ml hygromycin, respectively. Transfections of P2X7 genes in pcDNA5/FRT vector were carried out in the presence of pOG44 plasmid (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers instruction. The expression of P2X7 genes in both stable MDCK and stable HEK293 cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. The hygromycin-inducible HEK293 cells expressing the full-length P2X7 were kindly provided by Dr. George Dubyak, Case Western Reserve University. Stable HEK293 clones were maintained in the presence of 100 μg/ml zeocin, 500 μg/ml hygromycin, or both. Real time PCR assays utilized SYBR Green PCR master mixture machine with ABI 7500 Real-time PCR SDS software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and experiments were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were as follows: full-length P2X7: forward, ATACAGTTTCCGTCGCCTTG; reverse, AACGGATCCCGAAGACTTTT. The truncated P2X7 variant P2X7-j: forward, TTTCAGATGTGGCAATTCAGATA, reverse, AAGTAGGAGAGGGTTGAGCC; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: forward, CAATGACCCCTTCATTGACC; reverse, GACAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAG. The reaction mixture was composed of 0.5 μl of primers (5 μm), 9 μl of diluted cDNA, and 10 μl of SYBR Green PCR master mixture. PCR conditions were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, and 60 °C for 1 min. Results were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method of relative quantitation (RQ). Protein Methods—Western blots were carried out on post-nuclear supernatant of cell lysates (14Feng Y.H. Wang L. Wang Q. Li X. Zeng R. Gorodeski G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1342-C1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and total proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were mixed with 2 × SDS sample buffer and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Fractionation of cultured cells was done using the Proteo-Extract Subcellular Proteome Extraction kit (EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of cell lysates (normalized to 15 μg of protein) were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide 6-10% gels by gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and blotted by Western analysis. Receptor polypeptides were visualized using 1.5 μg/ml of primary antibodies. The rabbit polyclonal anti-P2X7 antibody (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) recognizes the stretch of 12 amino acids (KKGWMDPSKGIQTGRC) from 136 to 152 of the mouse P2X7 receptor. Rabbit monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-tubulin antibody (hybridoma supernatant, clone E7, generated with the antigen of β-tubulin-galactosidase/ftz fusion protein) was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA), and was used at 1:500 dilution. Anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used for visualization (ECL kit, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA). Co-immunoprecipitation, immunostaining, light microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy were described (14Feng Y.H. Wang L. Wang Q. Li X. Zeng R. Gorodeski G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1342-C1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cell Number, Cell Cycle, Flow Cytometry, and Apoptosis Assays—Cell number was evaluated using the CyQUANY cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cell cycle analysis cells were synchronized by culturing in 10% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight and serum starvation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 6 h. Cells were shifted to 10% fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1:500 defined keratinocyte growth factors from bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen) for 18 h, and treated with 100 μm BzATP (or the vehicle) for 8 h. Harvested cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 100% methanol at -20 °C overnight. Following treatment with 20 μg/ml RNase, the cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Aliquots of 5 × 104 cells were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry using Beckman Epics XL-MCL. Apoptosis was quantified using Roche Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells plated in 96-multiwell plates at 104 cells/well and maintained overnight in 10% serum-enriched medium were serumstarved for 6 h in the absence or presence of added BzATP. At the completion of incubation the medium was removed, spun, and the pellet stored. The cells together with the stored pellet were lysed with the provided lysis buffer, and the mixture was spun at 200 × g for 10 min at room temperature. An aliquot from the supernatant, containing the cytoplasmic fraction of oligonucleosomes was added to a streptavidincoated multiplate and mixed with pre-prepared reaction reagent containing the anti-histone-biotin and anti-DNA-POD antibodies. After a 2-h incubation on a shaker at room temperature the solution was collected and mixed with 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenziazolin-6-sulfonic acid) solution at room temperature for 15 min. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm against blank, and the degree of apoptosis was determined in reference to the control/standard provided in the kit. Dynamic Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—We used a described method (24Tagliarino C. Pink J.J. Dubyak G.R. Nieminen A.L. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19150-19159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were seeded at 2-3 × 105 on 35-mm glass bottom Petri dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA), and allowed to reach confluence. Cells were loaded with 5 μm Fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, Ringer's solution for 20 min at 37 °C, rinsed twice with Ringer's solution, and incubated for additional 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted real time confocal microscope equipped with a ×20 water immersion objective at room temperature (Comprehensive Cancer Center Microscopy Facility of Case Western Reserve University). Images were collected at 488/505 nm (excitation/emission) before and after treatment with 100 μm BzATP, added to both the luminal and subluminal perfusates, at intervals of 10 to 15 s afterward. For ethidium bromide influx experiments, cells cultured on glass-bottomed dishes were loaded onto the microscope. Images (collected at 488/505 nm (excitation/emission)) were taken before, and at intervals of 30 s after adding 5 μm ethidium bromide to both the luminal and subluminal perfusates. Average fluorescence intensity was quantified from collated images using MetaVue software (Fryer Company Inc., Huntley, IL) by subtracting the basal intensity value. Densitometry—Densitometry was done using a AGFA Arcus II scanner (AGFA, New York) and Un-Scan-It gel automated digital software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.D. and significance of differences among means was estimated by Student's t test. Trends were analyzed by analysis of variance. Cloning and Expression of the Truncated P2X7 Variant P2X7-j—A PCR product (∼1652 bp) of smaller size than the expected full-length P2X7 (∼1789 bp) was identified in RT-PCR experiments trying to amplify the full-length P2X7 gene (data not shown). DNA sequencing and gene analysis of the 1652-bp PCR product revealed an identical P2X7 gene that lacks the putative exon 8 except the A882, with a shift of coding frame to a new variant (Fig. 1A). As a result, the gene product becomes a truncated variant of only 258 amino acids (compared with 595 of the full-length P2X7) with 10 altered unique residues at the COOH-terminal (Fig. 1B). The predicted sequence of this variant lacks the entire carboxyl cytoplasmic domain, the second transmembrane domain, and the distal third of the extracellular domain of the full-length P2X7 (Fig. 1B, lower panel). We named this newly discovered variant as P2X7-j because previous studies identified splice variants isoforms designated P2X7-b-P2X7-h (Ref. 25Cheewatrakoolpong B. Gilchrest H. Anthes J.C. Greenfeder S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, accession numbers AY847 (298-304)), and a truncated P2X7 variant 2 (149 residues) (Ref. 26Georgiou J.G. Skarratt K.K. Fuller S.J. Martin C.J. Christopherson R.I. Wiley J.S. Sluyter R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 482-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, accession number NM177427). The sequence of our novel P2X7-j variant has been deposited in the GenBank (accession number DQ399293). Blast search of available gene data base showed that this variant has not been reported before. To determine the translational product of the P2X7-j gene, the P2X7-j cDNA was subcloned into various expression vectors as described under “Materials and Methods,” and was introduced into MDCK and HEK293 cells by transfection. MDCK cells, in contrast to the HEK293 cells form sheets of cells with typical epithelial characteristics. Stable lines of MDCK and HEK293 cells expressing the P2X7-j were successfully generated, and the expression of P2X7-j was confirmed at both the mRNA level by RT-PCR (Fig. 2A) and the protein level by Western blots (Fig. 2, A-E). Specific bands at 75 kDa for the full-length P2X7 proteins and 45-42 kDa for the P2X7-j proteins expressed in MDCK cells were visualized with both anti-Myc antibodies and anti-P2X7 antibodies (Fig. 2, B-D). Similar patterns of expression of the P2X7 and the P2X7-j proteins were also observed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, E and F). To determine whether the P2X7-j gene is also naturally translated into protein, CaSki cells expressing P2X7-j mRNA were examined by Western blot with anti-P2X7 antibody. Fig. 2G shows two main specific forms at 75 and 42 kDa that can be blocked by the P2X7 antigen. The 75-kDa form is most likely the full-length P2X7 (14Feng Y.H. Wang L. Wang Q. Li X. Zeng R. Gorodeski G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C1342-C1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15Wang L. Feng Y.H. Gorodeski G.I. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The 42-kDa is likely the P2X7-j because the sizes of heterologously expressed P2X7-j in MDCK cells (Fig. 2, B-D) and HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, E and F) were also 42 kDa. The presence of the P2X7-j variant (45-42 kDa) was confirmed also in the human cancer cervical cell lines HT3, SiHa, and HeLa (Fig. 2H). Collectively, these data suggest that the P2X7-j is a naturally occurring P2X7 variant. Cellular Localization of the P2X7-j—In MDCK cells and HEK293 cells, both the 75-kDa P2X7 and the 45-42-kDa forms were present predominantly in the plasma-membrane fraction. Small amounts of the 75-kDa P2X7 were detected also in the cytosol, nuclear, and cytoskeletal fractions (Fig. 3). Interestingly, a significant amount of the 45-42-kDa form was also detected in the nuclear fraction. These findings are supported by the results obtained using laser confocal microscopy (Fig. 3C), which also show that some of the P2X7-j localizes in nuclear/perinuclear regions of the HEK293 cells. Deficient Induction of Apoptosis and Activation of Pore Formation—In cervical cells an important function of the full-length P2X7 is induction of apoptosis (19Wang Q. Wang L. Feng Y.H. Li X. Zeng R. Gorodeski G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1349-C1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To examine whether the P2X7-j preserves this action, the cell number, cell cycle, and direct apoptosis assays were performed using both MDCK and HEK293 cells. In MDCK cells, Inducible expression of P2X7 alone, but not P2X7-j alone resulted in a significant decrease in cell numbers (∼25%, Fig. 4A). A similar effect was observed in HEK293 cells where induced expression of the P2X7 alone, but not the P2X7-j, decreased cell number by about 35% compared with mock HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, P2X7-j expressing cells, in particular HEK293 cells, showed an increase in cell number (by about 35%, Fig. 4A). Cell cycle assays in MDCK and HEK293 cells showed that expression of the full-length P2X7 induced a 2-4-fold increase of cells in the sub-G1 phase. Treatment with BzATP augmented the effect (Fig. 4B) in P2X7-expressing HEK293, suggesting increased apoptosis. In contrast, expression of the P2X7-j altered only little the percent of cells in the sub-G1 phase as compared with control cells (Fig. 4B). Direct apoptosis assays in MDCK and HEK293 cells showed that expression of the P2X7 increased apoptosis by about 2-fold, and treatment with BzATP augmented the effect (Fig. 4C). In contrast, expression of the P2X7-j resulted in no change in baseline or in BzATP-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C). In HEK293 cells, co-expression of the P2X7-j blocked P2X7-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 4C). In cervical cells, P2X7-mediated apoptosis requires formation of pores (19Wang Q. Wang L. Feng Y.H. Li X. Zeng R. Gorodeski G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1349-C1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Wang Q. Li X. Wang L. Feng Y.H. Zeng R. Gorodeski G.I. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5568-5579Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The failure of P2X7-j-expressing cells to undergo apoptosis could be the result of the inability of the P2X7-j to effectively activate pore formation. As expected, in both MDCK and HEK293 cells stimulation of P2X7-j with BzATP induced only a negligible influx of ethidium bromide compared with effects in cells expressing the P2X7 (Fig. 5A), suggesting deficient pore formation. In HEK293 cells, co-expression of the P2X7-j inhibited by about 80% the P2X7-mediated influx of ethidium bromide in the presence of BzATP (Fig. 5A). Deficient BzATP-induced Acute Ca2+ Influx—An early event of P2X7 receptor activation is the acute channel opening that precedes, and possibly mediates P2X7 pore formation (22North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). MDCK and HEK293 cells expressing P2X7 or P2X7-j were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fluo-4 and examined using dynamic confocal laser scanning microscopy in the absence and presence of BzATP. In P2X7-expressing cells BzATP induced an acute transient increase in cytosolic calcium (Fig. 5B). The BzATP effects could be blocked by pre-treatment with 1.2 mm EGTA (to chelate extracellular calcium) (data not shown), indicating that the acute increase in cytosolic calcium is the result of calcium influx. In P2X7-j-expressing cells BzATP induced a significantly smaller increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 5B). In P2X7-expressing HEK293 cells, co-expression of the P2X7-j inhibited the BzATP-induced increase in cytosolic Ca2+ to levels seen in cells expressing P2X7-j alone (Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2036792438,"Environmental chemicals such as dioxin adversely affect immune, neurological and reproductive functions and have been implicated in cancer development. However, the mechanisms responsible for dioxin toxicity are still poorly understood. Here, we show that dioxin and related pollutants trigger a marked morphological change in epithelial cells that remodel their cytoskeleton to increase interaction with extra cellular matrix while loosening cell–cell contacts. Furthermore, dioxin-treated cells show increased motility. These dioxin-mediated effects are mimicked by constitutive expression and activation of the intracellular dioxin receptor (aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)). They correlate with activation of the Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and are reverted by treatment with a JNK inhibitor. Dioxin-induced effects occur 48 h post-treatment initiation, a time scale, which argues for a genomic effect of the AhR, linked to induction of target genes. This novel Ahr action on cell plasticity points to a role in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2059847417,"hTERT is the catalytic subunit of the telomerase and is hence required for telomerase maintenance activity and cancer cell immortalization. Here, we show that acute hTERT depletion has no adverse effects on the viability or proliferation of cervical and colon carcinoma cell lines, as evaluated within 72 h after transfection with hTERT-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Within the same time frame, hTERT depletion facilitated the induction of apoptotic cell death by cisplatin, etoposide, mitomycin C and reactive oxygen species, yet failed to sensitize cells to death induction via the CD95 death receptor. Experiments performed with p53 knockout cells or chemical p53 inhibitors revealed that p53 was not involved in the chemosensitizing effect of hTERT knockdown. However, the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bax was involved in cell death induction by hTERT siRNAs. Depletion of hTERT facilitated the conformational activation of Bax induced by genotoxic agents. Moreover, Bax knockout abolished the chemosensitizing effect of hTERT siRNAs. Inhibition of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization by overexpression of Bcl-2 or expression of the cytomegalovirus-encoded protein vMIA (viral mitochondrial inhibitor of apoptosis), which acts as a specific Bax inhibitor, prevented the induction of cell death by the combination of hTERT depletion and chemotherapeutic agents. Altogether, our data indicate that hTERT inhibition may constitute a promising strategy for facilitating the induction of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W1985133272,"Glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity is mediated by glutathione depletion in the HT22 mouse hippocampal cell line. Previous results with pharmacological agents implicated the extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2 (ERK1/2) in glutamate toxicity in HT22 cells and immature embryonic rat cortical neurons. In this report, we definitively establish a role for ERK1/2 in oxidative toxicity using dominant negative MEK1 expression in transiently transfected HT22 cells to block glutamate-induced cell death. In contrast, chronic activation of ERK (i.e. brought about by transfection of constitutively active ERK2 chimera) is not sufficient to trigger HT22 cell death demonstrating that ERK1/2 activation is not sufficient for toxicity. Activation of ERK1/2 in HT22 cells has a distinct kinetic profile with an initial peak occurring between 30 min and 1 h of glutamate treatment and a second peak typically emerging after 6 h. We demonstrate here that the initial phase of ERK1/2 induction is because of activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor type I (mGluRI). ERK1/2 activation by mGluRI contributes to an HT22 cell adaptive response to oxidative stress as glutamate-induced toxicity is enhanced upon pharmacological inhibition of mGluRI. The protective effect of ERK1/2 activation at early times after glutamate treatment is mediated by a restoration of glutathione (GSH) levels that are reduced because of depletion of intracellular cysteine pools. Thus, ERK1/2 appears to play dual roles in HT22 cells acting as part of a cellular adaptive response during the initial phases of glutamate-induced oxidative stress and contributing to toxicity during later stages of stress. Glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity is mediated by glutathione depletion in the HT22 mouse hippocampal cell line.

Thus, ERK1/2 appears to play dual roles in HT22 cells acting as part of a cellular adaptive response during the initial phases of glutamate-induced oxidative stress and contributing to toxicity during later stages of stress. Oxidative stress can contribute to neuronal toxicity and has been implicated in both acute injury and chronic neuropathological conditions (1Pettmann B. Henderson C.E.

Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Many intracellular second messenger pathways are required for oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells including arachidonic acid metabolites, cyclic GMP (cGMP), and calcium (8Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In addition, signaling kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), are activated upon glutamate-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells and primary neurons and are likely to affect targets that either limit or promote oxidative toxicity.Extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1/2 (ERK1/2) has been implicated in glutamate-induced neuronal oxidative toxicity based upon the neuroprotective effects of U0126, a specific inhibitor of the ERK1/2-activating kinase, MEK1/2 (5Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S. Kress G. Reynolds I. Klann E. Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12200-12206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). U0126 is also effective at reducing brain injury following focal ischemia in rodents suggesting that ERK1/2 may also promote neuronal cell death resulting from acute injury in vivo (9Namura S. Iihara K. Takami S. Nagata I. Kikuchi H. Matsushita K. Moskowitz M.A. Bonventre J.V. Alessandrini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11569-11574Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, the role of ERK1/2 in neuronal cell death remains controversial (10Chu C.T. Levinthal D.J. Kulich S.M. Chalovich E.M. DeFranco D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2060-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 11Hetman M. Gozdz A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 12Cavanaugh J.E. Eur.

In a number of studies, ERK1/2 has been found to promote neuronal survival and reduce cell death induced by various insults (13Grewal S.S. York R.D. Stork P.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 14Spencer J.P. Rice-Evans C. Williams R.J. J. Biol.

BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Furthermore, even in HT22 cells, ERK1/2 may limit toxicity in response to specific insults such as serum withdrawal (16Rossler O.G. Giehl K.M. Thiel G. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1240-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Distinct kinetic profiles of ERK1/2 activation are observed in response to different extracellular signals and also can be associated with differential compartmentalization of active ERK1/2 within the cell. For example, in PC12 cells, prolonged, nerve growth factor-induced activation of ERK1/2 leads to its persistent accumulation within nuclei; however, rapid and transient epidermal growth factor-induced activation of ERK1/2 is unable to trigger its efficient nuclear translocation (15Colucci-D'Amato L. Perrone-Capano C. di Porzio U. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, increasing evidence suggests that the kinetics and duration of ERK1/2 activation, as well as its subcellular localization, may direct ERK1/2 toward downstream targets that will either promote or limit neuronal survival (10Chu C.T.

Persistent activation of ERK1/2 in these cells is mediated primarily through the oxidative inhibition of select ERK phosphatases (19Levinthal D.J. Defranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5875-5883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for the initial rapid activation of ERK1/2 by glutamate in HT22 cells and primary neurons are not known. Furthermore, the impact of the first wave of ERK1/2 activation on the response of HT22 cells and primary neurons to oxidative stress has not been established.In this report, we show that rapid activation of ERK1/2 by glutamate in HT22 cells is driven by type I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRIs). Furthermore, mGluRI activation of ERK1/2 represents a cellular defense response that attempts to limit glutathione depletion resulting from glutamate-induced cysteine depletion. This protective response mediated by ERK1/2 is however unable to overcome an overwhelming and chronic oxidative stress that utilizes ERK1/2 in its final stages to promote neuronal cell death. Thus, ERK1/2 activation may serve opposing roles in neuronal oxidative toxicity acting initially through effects on glutathione metabolism to limit oxidative stress but serving as a necessary signal to trigger cell death when cellular defense against oxidative stress is exhausted.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids—The expression plasmids for LAERK2-MEK1 and ERK2-MEK1 were kind gifts from Dr. Melanie Cobb (20Robinson M.J.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pMCL-MEK1 Lys-97 → Met (K97M), an HA-tagged dominant negative (DN) mutant of MEK1 was provided by Dr. Jane Cavanaugh (12Cavanaugh J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2056-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial-targeted enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. Ian Reynolds, and the expression plasmid for the ELK-1-GAL4 fusion protein, the luciferase reporter, and the constitutive Renilla reporter plasmids were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).Cell Culture—HT22 cells, a mouse hippocampal cell line, were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 100 units of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Cell Viability Assay—HT22 cells grown in 24-well plates were incubated for 10 min with 1 μl (1:1000 dilution) of a 6.25 mg/ml solution of propidium iodide (PI) to visualize dead or dying PI-positive cells (7Levinthal D.J. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11206-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with phase-contrast optics (Nikon Eclipse TE200). Three random fields were counted for each condition in at least three separate cultures. For experiments that did not involve transfection, the fraction of PI-positive cells was scored relative to total cells/field visualized by phase contrast microscopy. In transfection experiments, the extent of PI-positive staining was scored in eYFP-positive transfected cells.Transfection and Western Blotting—Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using conditions recommended by the supplier. During transfection, cells were maintained in serum- and antibiotic-free medium. Following 4 h of exposure to DNA-Lipofectamine mixture, cells were refed with medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. On the following day, cells were washed, scraped, collected into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), pelleted at 2–3 × 103 × g for 5 min, and disrupted in Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μm NaVO4, 100 μm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 5 μl/ml of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equivalent amounts of total protein, 30 μg, were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-phospho-ERK, anti-total ERK, all from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) overnight at 4 °C with 3% dry milk, washed 3 × 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% v/v Tween 20, and then exposed to the appropriate horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were again washed 3 × 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, and immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) using standard x-ray film (Kodak). Several different exposure times were used for each blot to ensure linearity of band intensities. Densitometry was performed using a Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Biosciences) linked to the Image-Quant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics).Luciferase Assay—Components of the Path Detect In Vivo Signal Transduction Pathway trans-Reporting System (Stratagene) were used to monitor ELK-1-dependent transcription in HT22 cells (19Levinthal D.J. Defranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5875-5883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with an expression plasmid coding for an ELK-1-GAL4 fusion protein, a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene linked to a synthetic promoter containing five tandem GAL4 binding sites, a Renilla expression plasmid, and various MEK1 expression plasmids (i.e. DN-MEK1, LA-MEK1ERK2). In this system, luciferase activity is a measure of the extent of ELK-1-activated transcription. Both luciferase activity and Renilla activity were examined with the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) using a luminometer (Wallac Victor3, PerkinElmer Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Results shown were from at least three separate experiments. All luciferase values were normalized to the internal control, Renilla, within each sample.Glutathione Concentration Measurement—A glutathione assay kit from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI) was used to measure glutathione concentrations. Cells from two 60-mm plates were collected and sonicated in 50 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (i.e. 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6–7, containing 1 mm EDTA). After centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected for deproteination with the exception of a small amount of cell lysate that was used to determine lysate protein concentration. Deproteination was necessary to avoid interference in the assay because of particulates and protein sulfhydryl groups. An MPA reagent (10% metaphosphoric acid in water; Sigma) and 4 m TEAM reagent (triethanolamine from Sigma) were used to deproteinize lysates. An equal volume of ice-cold MPA was added to ice-cold supernatant and left on ice for 10 min. Samples were then centrifuged at top speed in a microfuge for 5 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of TEAM reagent was added per ml of supernatant. 50 μl of sample or the standard provided in the kit was applied to each sample well. An assay mixture mix was prepared with the following reagents: MES buffer (11.25 ml), reconstituted cofactor mixture (0.45 ml), reconstituted enzyme mixture (2.1 ml), water (2.3 ml), and reconstituted DTNB (5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), 0.45 ml). 150 μl of the freshly prepared assay mixture was added to each of the wells containing standards and samples. The plate was incubated in the dark on an orbital shaker at room temperature. Absorbance was measured at 405 or 414 nm using a plate reader 25 min later. An end point method was used to calculate and determine the sample glutathione concentration according to the instructions provided by the supplier. All glutathione concentration values were normalized to the protein concentration within each sample.Statistical Analysis—Comparisons of multiple mean values were accomplished by analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post-hoc tests for significance. Comparisons of two means were performed using a paired t test. p values less than 0.05 were taken to be significant, and all data were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism version 3.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).RESULTSERK1/2 Activation Is Necessary for Glutamate-induced Oxidative Toxicity in HT22 Cells—ERK1/2 has been implicated in both neuronal cell survival and cell death although the basis for its disparate effects is not known. In fact, even in HT22 cells, opposing roles for ERK1/2 have been proposed (5Stanciu M. Wang Y. Kentor R. Burke N. Watkins S. Kress G. Reynolds I. Klann E. Angiolieri M.R. Johnson J.W. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12200-12206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 16Rossler O.G. Giehl K.M. Thiel G. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1240-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Maher P. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because part of the discrepancy for the role of ERK1/2 in neuronal cell survival may be because of secondary effects of pharmacological agents used to block ERK1/2 activation, we used a molecular approach to definitively assess the role of ERK1/2 in HT22 cell response to oxidative stress.HT22 cells were therefore cotransfected with dominant negative MEK1 (DN-MEK1) and mitochondrial-targeted enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (mt-eYFP) expression plasmids. Because the cotransfected plasmids enter cells with equal probability, eYFP-positive cells were likely to contain DN-MEK1 DNA. DN-MEK1 contains a point mutation at position 97 (i.e. lysine to methionine) that inactivates its kinase activity (21Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). As a result, the DN-MEK1 interferes with activation of wild type MEK1. Cell death was measured in transfected cells 7 h after 5 mm glutamate treatment using a PI staining assay (7Levinthal D.J. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11206-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, DN-MEK1 overexpression blocked glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells. These data confirm our previous results with a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK1 (i.e. U0126) and demonstrate that ERK1/2 activation is necessary for glutamate toxicity.To confirm the inhibitory effect of DN-MEK1 on ERK1/2 activation, we used a sensitive assay to detect functional ERK1/2 in nuclei. Specifically, HT22 cells were transfected with the DN-MEK1 expression plasmid along with an expression vector for an ELK-1-GAL4 fusion protein and a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a promoter containing five tandem GAL4 DNA binding sites i.e. GAL4UAS-luciferase (UAS, upstream activator sequences). Given that ELK-1 is an established nuclear target of ERK1/2, enhanced transactivation activity resulting from its phosphorylation by nuclearly localized ERK1/2 is easily monitored through the activity of the luciferase reporter (19Levinthal D.J. Defranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5875-5883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).As shown in Fig. 1B, 10 μm U0126 treatment decreased luciferase activity from GAL4UAS-reporter significantly in both untreated and glutamate treatment HT22 cells. Luciferase activity from the GAL4UAS-luciferase reporter was induced nearly 2-fold following a 7-h treatment with 5 mm glutamate (Fig. 1B) consistent with previous results of ERK1/2 activation using this assay (19Levinthal D.J. Defranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5875-5883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The expression of DN-MEK1 significantly reduced luciferase activity from the GAL4UAS-reporter in glutamate treated cells (Fig. 1C). The reduced effectiveness of DN-MEK1 to block ELK-1-activated transcription relative to U0126 treatment most likely results from variable expression of the DN-MEK1 within individual transfected cells. Nonetheless, these results confirm the expected inhibition of ERK1/2 activity in the nucleus of HT22 cells upon overexpression of DN-MEK1.Prolonged ERK Activation Is Not Sufficient to Induce Toxicity in HT22 Cells—To assess whether chronic activation of ERK was sufficient to induce toxicity in HT22 cells, we used constitutively active ERK2 chimeric proteins. MEK1ERK2 is a fusion protein with constitutive ERK2 activity that localizes in the cytoplasm (20Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the constitutively active ERK2 fusion LAMEK1ERK2, four leucines in MEK1 that are crucial for its nuclear export have been mutated to alanines (23Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As a result, the LAMEK1ERK2 fusion protein is localized in the nucleus (20Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, by virtue of its retention within nucleus, LAMEK1ERK2 exhibits a 5–10-fold higher ERK2 activity than MEK1ERK2 (20Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To verify the activation of ERK signaling by LAMEK1ERK2, the Path Detect in vivo signal transduction pathway trans-reporting system was used to access ELK-1-dependent gene expression. MEK1ERK2/LAMEK1ERK2 expression plasmids along with an expression vector for an ELK-1-GAL4 fusion protein and the GAL4UAS-luciferase reporter gene were transfected into HT22 cells. Cell lysates were collected, and luciferase activity was measured 18 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 2A, LAMEK1ERK2 overexpression can induce robust ERK1/2 activation compared with that of MEK1ERK2. The enhanced activation of the GAL4UAS luciferase reporter in LAMEK1ERK2-transfected cells likely results from its more efficient localization within nuclei.FIGURE 2Chronic activation of ERK1/2 is not sufficient to induce HT22 cell death. A, a constitutively active LAMEK1ERK2 fusion plasmid was transfected into HT22 cells, and luciferase activity was measured from an ELK-1-driven luciferase reporter plasmid. Expression of the LAMEK1ERK2 plasmid induced a robust increase in luciferase activity compared with transfections with a MEK1ERK2 plasmid (**, p < 0.01). B, HT22 cells were transfected with LAMEK1ERK2 (LA), MEK1ERK2 fusion plasmid, or empty vector PSG5 (PSG5). Cell toxicity was detected using the PI staining assay in the presence or absence of a 22-h 1.5 mm glutamate treatment (glu). Activation of ERK1/2 in LA-transfected cells did not trigger cell death (*, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then accessed the effects of LAMEK1ERK2 overexpression on HT22 cell viability using the PI staining method. As shown in Fig. 2B, both LAMEK1ERK2- and MEK1ERK2-transfected cells showed no enhanced toxicity as compared with empty vector-transfected HT22 cells. Robust ERK activation upon overexpression of LAMEK1ERK2 chimera also did not unleash toxicity in HT22 cells exposed to a low dose of glutamate (1.5 mm). As will be shown below, 1.5 mm glutamate can trigger cell death under conditions of altered mGluRIs activity. Thus, although necessary, prolonged ERK activation is not sufficient to induce toxicity in HT22 cells nor does it predispose cells to toxicity under conditions of minimal glutamate exposure.mGluRIs Are Involved in Glutamate-induced Oxidative Toxicity—HT22 cells express both type 1 and type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) (24Sagara Y. Schubert D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6662-6671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors are likely to be activated during glutamate exposure that triggers oxidative stress. Because mGluRIs have been suggested to play a protective role in glutamate toxicity (24Sagara Y. Schubert D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6662-6671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to examine their role in promoting or attenuating ERK1/2-dependent toxicity in HT22 cells. HT22 cells were therefore pretreated with a mGluRI antagonist (R,S)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA) or mGluRI agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) at 500 or 1000 μm, respectively. Glutamate was added 30 min later at 5 mm (maximally toxic dose) or at 1.5 mm, a dose that exhibits minimal cytotoxic effects. 7 h after 5 mm glutamate and 22 h after 1.5 mm glutamate treatment, cell viability was measured by PI staining. 1.5 mm glutamate treatment of HT22 cells for 22 h only results in a 17% reduction in cell viability as assessed by PI staining (Fig. 3A). However, a 30-min pretreatment with AIDA potentiated toxicity in the presence of 1.5 mm glutamate resulting in 66% cell death after 22 h (Fig. 3A). In contrast, a 30-min pretreatment of HT22 cells with DHPG significantly reduced the minimal toxicity induced by 1.5 mm glutamate treatment to 5% (Fig. 3A). The toxicity observed in HT22 cells treated with glutamate and AIDA or DHPG was reduced by U0126 establishing that the toxicity regulated by the mGluRIs remains ERK1/2-dependent. In HT22 cells treated with 5 mm glutamate, AIDA and DHPG have similar effects as those observed in 1.5 mm glutamate-treated cell (Fig. 3B). These results confirm that mGluRIs play a role in limiting oxidative toxicity induced by glutamate treatment (24Sagara Y. Schubert D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6662-6671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and establish that limiting mGluRI activation promotes ERK1/2-dependent toxicity at subthreshold levels of glutamate.FIGURE 3Effects of mGluRI activation or inactivation on glutamate toxicity in HT22 cells. The percentage of cell death was measured using a PI staining assay as described above. The mGluRI antagonist AIDA enhanced glutamate (glu) toxicity while the mGluRI agonist DHPG decreased glutamate toxicity at both 1.5 mm (A) and 5 mm glutamate (B). In both groups, U0126 prevented cell death (*, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effects of mGluRIs Activation on the ERK1/2 Activation in Glutamate-induced Oxidative Toxicity—Given the protective effects of mGluRI activation on ERK1/2-dependent oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells, we set out to investigate whether mGluRI impacts ERK1/2 activation. Western blots were therefore performed with lysates prepared from HT22 cells treated with 1.5 mm glutamate and AIDA or DHPG and probed to detect phosphorylated ERK1/2.

https://openalex.org/W1531323834,"Nutritional stress caused by amino acid starvation involves a coordinated cellular response that includes the global decrease of protein synthesis and the increased production of cell defense proteins. Part of this response is the induction of transport system A for neutral amino acids that leads to the recovery of cell volume and amino acid levels once extracellular amino acid availability is restored. Hypertonic stress also increases system A activity as a mechanism to promote a rapid recovery of cell volume. Both a starvation-dependent and a hypertonic increase of system A transport activity are due to the induction of SNAT2, the ubiquitous member of SLC38 family. The molecular mechanisms underlying SNAT2 induction were investigated in tissue culture cells. We show that the increase in system A transport activity and SNAT2 mRNA levels upon amino acid starvation were blunted in cells with a mutant eIF2α that cannot be phosphorylated. In contrast, the induction of system A activity and SNAT2 mRNA levels by hypertonic stress were independent of eIF2α phosphorylation. The translational control of the SNAT2 mRNA during amino acid starvation was also investigated. It is shown that the 5′-untranslated region contains an internal ribosome entry site that is constitutively active in amino acid-fed and -deficient cells and in a cell-free system. We also show that amino acid starvation caused a 2.5-fold increase in mRNA and protein expression from a reporter construct containing both the SNAT2 intronic amino acid response element and the SNAT2-untranslated region. We conclude that the adaptive response of system A activity to amino acid starvation requires eukaryotic initiation factor 2α phosphorylation, increased gene transcription, and internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. In contrast, the response to hypertonic stress does not involve eukaryotic initiation factor 2α phosphorylation, suggesting that SNAT2 expression can be modulated by specific signaling pathways in response to different stresses.

The severe nutritional stress caused by amino acid starvation triggers several adaptive changes. One of these is the stimulation of transport system A for neutral amino acids. Adaptive regulation of system A has been described in most amino acid-starved animal cells (1Guidotti G.G. Borghetti A.F. Gazzola G.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Erickson J.D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The induction of SNAT2 transcription leads to the increased synthesis of SNAT2 carriers, which are found in greater amounts on the membranes of starved cells (5Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J.

Recently, an amino acid-responsive element has been identified in the first intron of the mouse and human SNAT2 genes (9Palii S.S. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3463-3471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that transcriptional activation contributes to the adaptive regulation of system A.Unlike transcriptional activation, the translation of SNAT2 during amino acid starvation has received little attention thus far. However, it is known that amino acid deprivation profoundly affects overall protein synthesis. Indeed, in amino acid-starved cells uncharged transfer RNAs activate the GCN2 pathway, a master regulator of the cellular response to nutritional stress from yeast to mammals (10Zhang P. McGrath B.C.

Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Biochem. Soc.

Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). In contrast, the translation of mRNAs that encode proteins that are essential for the cellular stress response is promoted (13Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C.

Moreover, amino acid starvation causes the dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E, thus lowering the activity of eIF4F (20Kimball S. Jefferson L. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 2000; 2 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 561-580Google Scholar). Because the vast majority of eukaryotic mRNAs are translated via the scanning mechanism, which requires the recognition of the 5′-end of the mRNA and its m-7G-cap by eIF4F (19Hershey J. Merrick W. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 2000; 2 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 33-88Google Scholar), the dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E is associated with a decreased translation efficiency of most mRNAs in amino acid-depleted cells (20Kimball S. Jefferson L. Translational Control of Gene Expression. 2000; 2 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 561-580Google Scholar). However, a selected pool of mRNAs, which encode either cell-defense proteins or proteins involved in apoptosis, are endowed with internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and, thus, are efficiently translated via a cap-independent mechanism during amino acid starvation (21Komar A.A.

This is the case for the mRNA that encodes the cationic amino acid transporter cat-1 (SLC7A1), which has an IRES in its 5′-UTR that mediates efficient translation of the cat-1 mRNA upon amino acid starvation (22Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the preferential translation of cat-1 mRNA in amino acid-starved cells requires eIF2α phosphorylation (23Fernandez J.M. Yaman I. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A.E. Wek R.C. Sood R. Hensold J.O. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2050-2058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). No information is yet available about the presence of IRES sequences in SNAT2 mRNA or the relationships between SNAT2 induction and eIF2α phosphorylation.Amino acid starvation is not the sole stress that modifies SNAT2 transcription because the mRNA is also transiently induced by hypertonic treatment (24Alfieri R.R. Petronini P.G. Bonelli M.A. Caccamo A.E. Cavazzoni A. Borghetti A.F. Wheeler K.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), leading to an enhanced expression of SNAT2 carriers (8Franchi-Gazzola R. Gaccioli F. Bevilacqua E. Visigalli R. Dall'Asta V. Sala R. Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. Gazzola G.C. Bussolati O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1667: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The resulting increase in the sodium-dependent transport of neutral amino acids is essential for the fast recovery of cell volume (25Bevilacqua E. Bussolati O. Dall'Asta V. Gaccioli F. Sala R. Gazzola G.C. Franchi-Gazzola R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3376-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The relationship between the response of system A activity to amino acid starvation and hypertonic stress has been widely debated and is not yet completely clarified (2McGivan J.D. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 26Bussolati O. Dall'Asta V. Franchi-Gazzola R. Sala R. Rotoli B.M. Visigalli R. Casado J. Lopez-Fontanals M. Pastor-Anglada M. Gazzola G.C. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2001; 18: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our previous results have demonstrated that amino acid starvation causes significant cell shrinkage and induces osmo-responsive genes, suggesting that this experimental condition is also associated with hypertonic stress (27Franchi-Gazzola R. Visigalli R. Dall'Asta V. Sala R. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Gazzola G.C. Bussolati O. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: 1465-1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the transduction pathways involved in the response to amino acid starvation and hypertonic stress of system A transport activity appear to differ significantly (27Franchi-Gazzola R. Visigalli R. Dall'Asta V. Sala R. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Gazzola G.C. Bussolati O. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: 1465-1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lopez-Fontanals M.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 5477-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).In this study we report on the mechanism of SNAT2 induction during stress conditions. We demonstrate that eIF2α phosphorylation is required for the increase of SNAT2 expression and the maintenance of cell viability during amino acid starvation but not hypertonic stress. We also provide evidence that the 5′-UTR of the SNAT2 mRNA, which has the potential to form a stable secondary structure, contains an IRES that has similar activity in amino acid-fed and -depleted cells. Thus, the expression of the system A transporter SNAT2 during amino acid starvation is the result of both transcriptional activation and IRES-mediated translation, which allows the efficient production of new carriers under conditions where protein synthesis is inhibited.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells, Cell Culture, and Cell Viability—HeLa and C6 cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. ATF4–/–, eIF2α-S/S (S/S), and eIF2α-A/A (A/A) mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in the same medium supplemented with both essential amino acid solution 50×, Sigma and nonessential amino acids (MEM nonessential amino acid solution 100×, Sigma). S/S and A/A cells, generous gifts from R. Kaufman (12Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), had been obtained from embryos expressing normal (S/S) or S51A (A/A) eIF2α at the homozygous state. The S51A mutation eliminates the phosphorylation site of eIF2α.Cells were starved for amino acids by culturing in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Hypertonic treatment consisted of the incubation in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 100 mm sucrose for a final osmolality of 400 mosmol/kg (hypertonic DMEM).Cell viability was assessed with resazurin (30O'Brien J. Wilson I. Orton T. Pognan F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5421-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). S/S and A/A cells were seeded in complete growth medium in 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and grown for 24 h before treatment. Growth medium was then substituted with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, hypertonic DMEM, or complete medium with 1 mm dithiothreitol. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 44 μm resazurin (Sigma) for 2 h, and fluorescence was measured as described.Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis of eIF2α and phospho-eIF2α were carried out using a mouse monoclonal antibody (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc.) and rabbit polyclonal antibody (BIOSOURCE), respectively. 4E-BP1 was detected using an anti-PHAS-1 peptide antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), whereas anti-ATF4 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. α-Tubulin antibody was from Sigma.RNA Isolation and Analysis—SNAT2, asparagine synthase, and GAPDH mRNAs as well as 18 S ribosomal RNA were detected by Northern blotting using 32P-labeled DNA hybridization probes as previously described (31Aulak K.S. Mishra R. Zhou L. Hyatt S.L. de Jonge W. Lamers W. Snider M. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30424-30432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) or CsCl centrifugation. One μg of total RNA was incubated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega) followed by Superscript III (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase and gene-specific antisense primers (mSNAT1, 5′-GCTCCGAAGATCACCAGCTTCCCC-3′; mSNAT2, 5′-CACTTGAACCCAATTCCAACAG-3′; mSNAT4, 5′-CATTTCTCAGCACCCTGGGCTTCG-3′; GAPDH, 5′-TCATCATACTTGGCAGGTTTCTCC-3′; exogenous luciferase, 5′-GGGAGGTAGATGAGATGTGACG-3′) at 55 °C for 1 h. The resulting cDNAs were amplified by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase. 5′-Forward primers were mSNAT1 (5′-GTGCCCGAAGATGACAACGTCAGC-3′), mSNAT2 (5′-GGTTCCTGAACTGAATTCTCAGCC-3′), mSNAT4 (5′-GCTCTGGATCACAACAACGGAAATCTGACG-3′), GAPDH (5′-ACTTTGGCATCGTGGAAGGG-3′), TET5 (5′-GAGACGCCATCCACGCTGTTTTGACC-3′), with the respective antisense primers described above. The TET5 primer was 10 nt downstream of the transcription start site and 60 nt upstream of the cloning site of the hairpin. Products were resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The primers that were used for RT/PCR of bicistronic mRNAs have previously been described (32Fernandez J. Yaman I. Huang C. Liu H. Lopez A.B. Komar A.A. Caprara M.G. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Kaufman R.J. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Real-time PCR was performed with iCycler (Bio-Rad). Primers for the endogenous mSNAT2 and GAPDH were the same as primers used in RT-PCR; exogenous m/SNAT2-2 and m/SNAT2-2in were 5′-GTCGACGTATTTGACTGAGAGAAACCCACTG-3′ (sense) at the 5′-end of the SNAT2 5′-UTR and 5′-GGGAGGTAGATGAGATGTGACG-3′ (antisense) annealing 77 nt downstream of the LUC ATG. Each gene was assayed in triplicate with Sybr Green (Applied Biosystems); PCR reactions (25 μl) contained 1.4 μl of 1:60-diluted cDNA. GAPDH expression levels were used to normalize gene expression in each sample.Amino Acid Transport Analysis—Cells were seeded in 24-well trays (Falcon) at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 for S/S and A/A cells and cultured for 2 days. The activity of transport system A was evaluated by measuring the uptake of [14C]methylaminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB, 0.1 mm, 2 μCi/ml) for 1 min at 37 °C in 0.25 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer. The incubation was terminated with two rapid washes in 3 ml of ice-cold 300 mm urea. Ethanol extracts of cells were added to 0.6 ml of scintillation fluid (Hisafe, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and counted for radioactivity in a Wallac Microbeta Trilux counter (PerkinElmer). Cell monolayers were then dissolved with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in 1 n NaOH, and protein content was determined using a modified Lowry procedure (27Franchi-Gazzola R. Visigalli R. Dall'Asta V. Sala R. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Gazzola G.C. Bussolati O. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: 1465-1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Expression Vectors—The 5′-end of the SNAT2 mRNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using 5′-SalI (5′-AAAGTCGACCGACGCCGCCGCCTTAGAACGCCT-3′) and 3′-NcoI (5′-TTTCCATGGTAAGCACTGGGAGGAATCGGGTGCAG or 5′-TTTCCATGGCGGCCTTCTTCATGCTAAGCACTGGGAG) primers. Because the SNAT2 mRNA has two in-frame potential initiation ATGs with the second being in better consensus flanking sequences, we isolated both cDNAs and named them SNAT2-1 and SNAT2-2. These cDNAs were cloned into the SalI/NcoI site of the pSVCAT/BiP/LUC plasmid by replacing the IRES from the BiP mRNA. The resulting vectors were named b/SNAT2-1 and b/SNAT2-2, respectively. The plasmids b/hpSNAT2-1 and b/hpSNAT2-2 were constructed by replacing the BiP IRES within the pSVhpCAT/BiP/LUC vector at the NcoI/SalI sites. The pSVCAT/ICS/LUC (b/ICS) vector contains 400 nt of irrelevant sequence and was used as a negative control for IRES-mediated translation. The b/SNAT2-2mut contained the same sequence as b/SNAT2-2, with the upstream open reading frame (uORF) ATG changed to TTG using the polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis.The m/SNAT2-1 and m/SNAT2-2 expression vectors were generated by cloning the chimeric LUC cDNAs into the pUHD10–3 expression vector (33Triezenberg S.J. Kingsbury R.C. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 718-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) cleaved at the XbaI site 3′ to the promoter region and the EcoRI site 5′ to the polyadenylation signal. This vector contains a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter and the SV40 polyadenylation signal. SNAT2-1 (342 bp) and SNAT2-2 (360 bp) cDNAs were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using 5′-EcoRI (5′-AAAGAATTCCGACGCCGCCGCCTTAGAACGCCT) and 3′-NcoI (5′-TTTCCATGGCGGCCTTCTTCATGCTAAGCACTGGGAG-3′ and 5′-TTTCCATGGTAAGCACTGGGAGGAATCGGGTGCAG-3′, respectively) primers and were cloned into the EcoRI/NcoI site of the pUHD10–3/LUC vector. We obtained the m/hpSNAT2-1 and m/hpSNAT2-2 vectors by inserting a hairpin in the SacII site. The SacII site is 70 nt downstream of the transcription start site. The hairpin was generated by annealing phosphorylated primers 5′-GGAAGCTTATCGATTTCGAACCCGGGGTACCG and 5′-AATTCGGTACCCCGGGTTCGAAATCGATAAGCTTCCGC. The m/SNAT2-2in vector was obtained by PCR amplification using adult human liver genomic DNA. The GC-rich PCR System (Roche Applied Science) with 1 m resolution solution was used. The PCR primers were EcoRI (5′-AAAGAATTCCGACGCCGCCGCCTTAGAACGCCT-3′) and NcoI (5′-TTTCCATGGCGGCCTTCTTCATGCTAAGCACTGGGAG-3′). The PCR product was ligated into the m/SNAT2-2 vector at the EcoRI/NcoI site by replacing the SNAT2 5′-UTR. The final vector was sequenced to confirm the presence of the intronic sequence.The LUC-P98 expression vector was obtained from M. W. Hentze (34Thoma C. Ostareck-Lederer A. Hentze M.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 257: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar). Monocistronic and bicistronic DNA vectors for in vitro transcription were generated by introducing the appropriate fragments into the corresponding sites of Bluescript KS–(Stratagene) and ligating it to LUC P98, which was obtained from the LUC-P98 vector. The LUC-P98 vector contains 98 A residues cloned at the 3′-end of the LUC ORF and upstream of a NotI site that was used to linearize the plasmids and generate RNA transcripts.Cell Transfections and Analytical Procedures—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Falcon) at a density of 20 × 104 cells/plate for HeLa, 50 × 104 cells/plate for mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs), and 100 × 104 cells/plate for C6 cells. The following day cells were transfected with 500 ng/well of bicistronic vectors or cotransfected with 100 ng/well each of monocistronic vectors and β-galactosidase expression vector. Cells were subjected to treatment and/or collected for enzymatic assays 48 h after transfection. LUC, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (22Fernandez J. Yaman I. Mishra R. Merrick W.C. Snider M.D. Lamers W.H. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12285-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The activities were normalized to the protein content of the cell extracts, which was measured using the Bio-Rad DC assay.Cell-free Translation Assays—DNAs were linearized by digesting with NotI, and capped RNAs were synthesized using the mMessage mMachine T3 kit (Ambion). The purity and integrity of the RNA molecules was checked on urea-polyacrylamide gels. In vitro translations were performed using the Promega nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) cell-free system, and the LUC and CAT enzymatic activities were determined. HeLa (S3) cell extracts were prepared as previously described (34Thoma C. Ostareck-Lederer A. Hentze M.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 257: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cell extracts were treated with 0.01 unit of micrococcal nuclease for 6 min just before the translation reactions. EGTA was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and after a brief centrifugation at 14,000 × g, the supernatant was used immediately for in vitro translation. Each in vitro translation reaction contained 6–8 μg/μl extract, and the reaction was as previously described (34Thoma C. Ostareck-Lederer A. Hentze M.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 257: 171-180PubMed Google Scholar). Translation reactions in the presence of [35S]Met (15 mCi/ml) and analysis of the products on SDS-PAGE gels were as described previously (35Yaman I. Fernandez J. Liu H. Caprara M. Komar A.A. Koromilas A.E. Zhou L. Snider M.D. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Hatzoglou M.

Erickson J.D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). It has been shown that system A transport activity is enhanced by amino acid starvation via an increased abundance of SNAT2 mRNA (4Gazzola R.F. Sala R. Bussolati O. Visigalli R. Dall'Asta V. Ganapathy V. Gazzola G.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that induction of SNAT2 mRNA may be part of the global response of cells to nutritional stress and, therefore, involves eIF2α phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis we studied the accumulation of SNAT2 mRNA in MEF homozygous for a Ser-51 to Ala mutation in eIF2α (A/A) and wild type MEFs (S/S) during amino acid starvation and hypertonic stress. We found that amino acid starvation (6 h) increased SNAT2 mRNA levels by 5-fold in S/S cells and 3-fold in A/A cells, suggesting that the induction involves eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). This conclusion was confirmed using real-time RT/PCR analysis of SNAT2 mRNA levels in fed- and amino acid-depleted cells (data not shown). To determine the specificity of SNAT2 behavior, we also tested the accumulation of asparagine synthase (AS) mRNA. Induction of AS mRNA levels requires the transcription factor ATF4, which is induced during amino acid starvation in an eIF2α phosphorylation-dependent manner (36Siu F. Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24120-24127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In agreement with those previous results, we observed the induction of AS mRNA levels in S/S cells but not in A/A cells (Fig. 1A). Moreover, AS induction was also completely suppressed in ATF4–/– cells that, on the contrary, exhibit a significant induction of SNAT2 under amino acid free conditions (Fig. 1B, 3.9- and 3.5-fold induction in S/S and ATF4–/– cells, respectively).SNAT2 synthesis is also induced during hypertonic stress to promote recovery of cell volume by increasing the sodium-dependent transport of neutral amino acids (8Franchi-Gazzola R. Gaccioli F. Bevilacqua E. Visigalli R. Dall'Asta V. Sala R. Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. Gazzola G.C. Bussolati O. Biochim. Biophys.

Commun. 2001; 283: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast to what was observed for amino acid starvation, hypertonic stress caused a comparable induction of SNAT2 mRNA levels in S/S and A/A cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that eIF2α phosphorylation is not required for this regulation. Hypertonic stress had no effect on AS mRNA levels (Fig. 1C). As a control for the two stress conditions, we tested induction of SNAT2 mRNA levels in HeLa cells, which showed the expected induction by both amino acid starvation and hypertonic stress (Fig. 1, A and C).To investigate the relationship between the accumulation of SNAT2 mRNA and system A transport activity, we measured the uptake of MeAIB, a specific substrate for system A, in S/S and A/A cells. After 8 h of amino acid starvation, MeAIB uptake showed a 5-fold induction in S/S cells but only a 2-fold stimu"

Eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized into membrane-enclosed organelles that communicate with each other by membrane traffic. Each trafficking step involves three basic steps: the formation of an organelle by budding from a precursor, transport of the vesicle to its destination along cytoskeletal tracks, and finally docking and fusion of the organelle with its target membrane (reviewed in Refs. 1Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar and 2Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Docking and fusion are mediated by the ordered assembly of multimolecular protein complexes that form upon organelle contact and that are disassembled after fusion is completed. Tethering and docking require large arrays of proteins, many of which are specific for a given transport step. Fusion itself, however, is catalyzed by a set of conserved proteins termed soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) 4The abbreviations used are: SNARE, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; SNAP, soluble N-ethylmaleimide attachment protein; TMR, transmembrane region; BoNT, botulinum neurotoxin; Syb, synaptobrevin 2; Syx, syntaxin; MS, mass spectrometry; aa, amino acids; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NBD, N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxodiazole-4-yl); PE, phosphatidylethanolamine.

SNARE proteins comprise a superfamily of mostly membrane-bound proteins with at least 24 members in yeast and 35 members in mammals (5Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H.

The characteristic feature of all SNAREs is the presence of a stretch of ∼60 amino acids arranged in heptad repeats that is referred to as a SNARE motif. In most SNAREs, SNARE motifs are positioned adjacent to a transmembrane domain at the C terminus. Exceptions include SNAREs that lack a transmembrane domain and contain two SNARE motifs, instead of one, which are connected by a flexible linker, such as mammalian SNAP-25, SNAP-23, and SNAP-29/GS32. SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 contain multiple palmitate residues attached to cysteine residues in the linker region (7Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H. J.

Each of the membranes destined to fuse contains sets of SNAREs that are complementary to each other. Before membrane merger, the SNAREs are thought to connect with each other in a “trans-configuration,” forming an α-helical bundle of four SNARE motifs. It is thought that “zippering” of the helix bundle proceeds from the N-terminal to the membrane-adjacent C-terminal ends, thus clamping the membranes together and initiating fusion (11Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of two SNARE complexes revealed that each helical bundle contains four SNARE motifs, which each belong to an evolutionarily conserved subfamily (12Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D.

Inspired by a highly conserved layer of interacting amino acid side chains in the center of the SNARE complex, in which a glutamine (Q) or arginine (R) is contributed by each of the proteins, these subfamilies are classified as Qa-, Qb-, Qc-, and R-SNAREs, respectively (5Bock J.B.

More thorough sequence analysis, however, revealed two SNARE motifs belonging to the Qb and Qc subfamilies, respectively, that are connected by a linker region, thus identifying the protein as a new member of the SNAP-25 subgroup (Qbc-SNARE). Here we report a preliminary characterization of this novel SNARE with respect to tissue and subcellular distribution. Furthermore, we have investigated whether SNAP-47 enters SNARE complexes and is capable of functioning as a SNARE in the fusion of proteoliposomes. Identification and Cloning of SNAP-47—Subcellular fractionation of rat brain, allowing the preparation of highly purified synaptic vesicles by controlled pore glass size exclusion chromatography was performed as described (15Baumert M. Takei K. Hartinger J. Burger P.M. Fischer von Mollard G. Maycox P.R. De Camilli P. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Approximately 500 μg of synaptic vesicle proteins were separated by 16BAC/SDS-PAGE (16Hartinger J. Stenius K. Hogemann D. Jahn R. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). After Coomassie Blue staining, all visible spots were excised, cut into ∼1-mm2 pieces, and subjected to in-gel trypsinization (17Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The extracted peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem MS (liquid chromatography-MS/MS) on a Q-ToF Ultima mass spectrometer (Waters), and proteins were identified in the National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant data base using MASCOT software (Matrix Science, London, UK) as a search engine. Based on the nucleotide sequence, full-length SNAP-47 cDNA was amplified by PCR from a mouse fetal brain cDNA library using the following primers 5′-AAGCTT(HindIII)ATGAGTTCTGATATGCGTGTCC-3′ and 5′-CTCGAG(XhoI) CTACATCAGCTTTCTCATACGC-3′, followed by subcloning into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Full-length SNAP-47 (amino acids (aa) 1–412), N-terminally EGFP-tagged full-length SNAP-47 (aa 1–412), and His-tagged N-terminally truncated SNAP-47 (aa 115–412) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1, pEGFP-C3, and pET28a vectors, respectively. Recombinant Protein Purification—The expression constructs for cysteine-free SNAP-25A (C84S, C85S, C90S, C92S; aa 1–206), for the syntaxin 1a SNARE motif (SyxH3; aa 180–262), and for synaptobrevin 2 (Syb; aa 1–96) have been described before (18Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 19Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). SNAP-47 was used as either the full-length protein (aa 1–412) or the N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN-SNAP-47, aa 115–412; see Fig. 1), which contained both entire SNARE helices and was less prone to precipitate. Recombinant SNARE proteins were isolated from Escherichia coli and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, followed by ion exchange chromatography on anÄKTA system (GE Healthcare), essentially as described (19Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The TMR-containing constructs, syntaxin 1a SNARE motif (aa 183–288), and full-length synaptobrevin 2 (aa 1–116) were purified in the presence of 20 mm cholate or 15 mm Chaps, respectively. Ternary SNARE complexes were assembled overnight and purified using a Mono Q-column (GE Healthcare). Protein concentration was determined by absorption at 280 nm. Native PAGE was carried out as described (18Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Rabbits were immunized to raise antisera against SNAP-47, using as antigen either recombinant ΔN-SNAP-47 or a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence AASRPKGCTPHRELPT, which is derived from the linker region between the two SNARE motifs, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an N-terminal cysteine. The resulting sera were affinity-purified using ΔN-SNAP-47 coupled to CNBr-Sepharose (Sigma) as the solid phase. Other antibodies used were as follows: monoclonal antibodies against synaptobrevin 2 (clone 69.1), Rab5 (clone 621.3), polyclonal antibody against SNAP-29 (SySy); and monoclonal antibodies against proteindisulfide isomerase and γ-adaptin (BD Biosciences). Peroxidase-labeled Cy3 and Cy5, and Alexa-dyed labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma, Dianova, and Molecular Probes, respectively. Tissue Distribution Analysis—A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was hybridized at high stringency according to the manufacturer's protocol. [35S]dATP was used to produce uniformly labeled probes derived from the full coding sequence (1242 bp) of SNAP-47 cDNA. In situ hybridization was performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed 12-μm-thick cryostat sections from freshly frozen adult mouse brains. Antisense oligonucleotides representing bp 438–482 and bp 986–1030 of mouse SNAP-47 cDNA were chosen as probes and labeled with [35S]dATP by using terminal transferase. Both generated probes gave identical labeling. In control experiments, hybridizations were performed with a 1000-fold excess of the respective unlabeled oligonucleotide (20Augustin I. Betz A. Herrmann C. Jo T. Brose N. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Sections were exposed to Kodak Biomax films for 2 weeks. For immunoblot analysis, mouse brains from different developmental stages and tissues and brain regions from adult mice were taken out, protein samples were prepared, and Western blots were performed as previously described (21Speidel D. Varoqueaux F. Enk C. Nojiri M. Grishanin R.N. Martin T.F. Hofmann K. Brose N. Reim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52802-52809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Immunoautoradiography was performed as described (22Herzog E. Bellenchi G.C. Gras C. Bernard V. Ravassard P. Bedet C. Gasnier B. Giros B. El Mestikawy S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, sagittal sections of rat brain were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with the SNAP-47 anti-peptide antiserum (1:1000) and then with 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (0.25 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences). Sections were exposed to Biomax films for 5 days. Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary neurons were prepared from newborn mouse striata and maintained in culture as described (23Dresbach T. Neeb A. Meyer G. Gundelfinger E.D. Brose N. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2004; 27: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After 3 weeks in vitro, neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer for 10 min on ice and processed for immunostaining. Briefly, neurons were incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibodies diluted in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, 5% normal goat serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100, washed thoroughly, further incubated for 1 h with fluorescent secondary antibodies, washed again, and mounted with Mowiol on gelatin-coated slides. All fluorescently labeled preparations were observed at high magnification with an inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope and corresponding software (Axiovert 200-LSM510; Zeiss) or with an upright epifluorescence Olympus BX-61 microscope coupled to a digital camera (F-ViewII) and the AnalySIS image acquisition software (Soft-Imaging Systems). Transfection of GFP-SNAP-47 in HEK293 cells was performed using the calcium phosphate method (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Thirty-six hours post-transfection, the cells were labeled by immunofluorescence (as above), or protein was extracted using 1% Triton X-100 solubilization and subsequently used for immunoblot analysis. Protein Spectroscopy—SyxH3, containing a single cysteine residue at position 197 (25Margittai M. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Jahn R. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13169-13177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), was labeled with the sulfhydryl-reactive fluorophore Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide essentially as described (SyxH3197OG). The concentration of the labeled protein was determined by measuring absorption at 488 and 280 nm, using the molar absorption coefficients of the dye and protein, respectively. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried out using a Fluorolog-3 spectrometer equipped with autopolarizers (Jobin Yvon), essentially as described (26Fasshauer D. Margittai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7613-7621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). All measurements were performed at 25 °C in 1-cm quartz cuvettes (Hellma) using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Protein concentrations used were as follows: 500 nm SyxH3197OG; 1 μm SNAP-25 or (ΔN)-SNAP-47; 1 μm Syb (aa 1–96). CD spectroscopy was performed using a Jasco model J-720 instrument. All experiments were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. For thermal denaturation experiments about 10 μm purified ternary SNARE complexes were heated in Hellma quartz cuvettes, with a path length of 0.1 cm. The ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded between 25 and 95 °C with a temperature increment of 30 °C/h. Fusion of Proteoliposomes—Liposome fusion by lipid dequenching was carried out as described (27Hoekstra D. Duzgunes N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 220: 15-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In brief, two populations of liposomes were prepared using SyxH3 with TMR (aa 183–288) and full-length synaptobrevin (aa 1–116), with a final lipid/protein ratio of 100:1 (n/n). The SyxH3 containing liposomes were reconstituted together with a mixture of fluorescent phospholipids, NBD-PE and rhodamine-PE. Fluorescence dequenching upon fusion with unlabeled synaptobrevin containing liposomes was measured using 460 nm for excitation and 538 nm for emission in a Fluoromax-2 (Jovin Yvon) at 30 °C. The total reaction volume was 75 μl, with liposomes added to a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. After 90 min, Triton X-100 was added to completely solubilize the liposomes and dequench the fluorescence of NBD. To normalize the experiments, the lowest NBD fluorescence signal was set to 0%, and the maximal signal, reached after detergent addition, was set to 100% fluorescence. SNAP-47 Is a Novel SNAP-25 Homologue—During the course of a comprehensive proteomic analysis of synaptic vesicles, we separated a highly purified fraction of rat brain synaptic vesicles by means of 16BAC/twodimensional SDS-PAGE. In two spots that migrated at ∼47 kDa, we sequenced two tryptic peptides by liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray ionization MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry) that matched previously uncharacterized gene products when we searched the fragment spectra of the peptides against all entries in the NCBI nr data base using Mascot as the search engine. One peptide (MESDLDVADR, sequenced in its oxidized and non-oxidized form) appeared in both the RIKEN cDNA 1110031B06 (Mus musculus) (gi:21362303) and in the rat hypothetical protein (Rattus norvegicus) (gi:40786477), whereas a second peptide, VPAVVSQR, was found only in the latter. BLAST homology searches revealed sequence similarity to a human protein containing a single SNARE motif and which had been deposited in the data base as SVAP1 (gi:56206865) (30Weimbs T. Mostov K. Seng H.L. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 260-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). SVAP1 exhibits a high similarity to its rodent orthologues (∼70% amino acid identity). Other orthologues were identified in several vertebrate species (Fig. 1A). Using PCR with a mouse fetal brain cDNA library as a template, we isolated the corresponding mouse cDNA clone of mSVAP1. The nucleotide sequence was identical to that of the RIKEN cDNA clone 1110031B06. Based on the nucleotide sequence, a protein with a theoretical molecular mass of 46,524 Da and a pI of 5.54 was predicted. The closest mammalian homologue of this protein appeared to be SNAP-29, a SNARE protein that contains two SNARE motifs connected by a linker (Fig. 1B). Whereas the data base predicted only a single SNARE motif at the C terminus in mSVAP1, another SNARE motif toward the N terminus of the protein was identified when we compared the sequence with SNAP-23, SNAP-25, and SNAP-29 (Fig. 1B). Both SNARE motifs contain a glutamine in the position aligning with the highly conserved “0” layer. Based on the predicted molecular weight, which is in good agreement with the apparent Mr determined by SDS-PAGE, and the characteristic tandem SNARE motifs, we propose to rename the novel Qbc-SNARE SNAP-47. Sequence comparison of SNAP-47 with other SNAP-25 homologues shows that SNAP-47 has a longer N-terminal stretch and a markedly extended loop between its two SNARE motifs (Fig. 1C). As in the other SNAP-25 homologues, a typical transmembrane domain is missing. However, unlike SNAP-25 and SNAP-23, SNAP-47 lacks a conserved stretch of cysteine residues in the linker region connecting the two SNARE motifs. In SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 these cysteines are palmitoylated to allow for stable membrane association of the proteins, and they are characterized by flanking hydrophobic and basic residues, respectively (31Liu Y. Fisher D.A. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10714-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, hydroxylamine treatment, which is known to remove esterified palmitate residues (32Chapman E.R. Blasi J. An S. Brose N. Johnston P.A. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), did not induce any noticeable change in the apparent molecular mass (data not shown), suggesting that SNAP-47, similar to its closest relative SNAP-29, is not palmitoylated. Furthermore, SNAP-47 is not cleaved by botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) A or E light chains, two bacterial proteases that are known to cleave SNAP-25 but not SNAP-29 (33Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar) (data not shown). SNAP-47 Exhibits a Widespread Tissue and Subcellular Localization—Unlike SNAP-25, whose expression is limited to neurons and neuroendocrine cells and tissues, SNAP-23 and SNAP-29 are expressed in a wide variety of tissues (8Ravichandran V. Chawla A. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13300-13303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 9Steegmaier M. Yang B. Yoo J.S. Huang B. Shen M. Yu S. Luo Y. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34171-34179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To learn about the expression pattern of SNAP-47, we investigated SNAP-47 mRNA and protein distribution in a variety of mouse tissues. In Northern blot analysis, SNAP-47 mRNA was always detected as a single transcript of ∼2 kb, suggesting that it is not alternatively spliced. The signal was particularly strong in brain, followed in abundance by liver, kidney, heart, and testis. Low levels of mRNA were detectable in the lung, skeletal muscle, and spleen (Fig. 2A). Since the transcript was comparatively highly expressed in brain, we performed in situ hybridizations on sagittal mouse brain sections (Fig. 2B). SNAP-47 mRNA was broadly distributed throughout all brain regions, with particularly strong signals obtained in the cortex, the principal cell layers of the hippocampus (CA layers and dentate gyrus), and the cerebellar granule cell layer. Strong expression was also observed in the olfactory bulb, the thalamus, and the brain stem, with relatively weaker expression in the striatum. For the characterization of SNAP-47 protein distribution, we generated polyclonal antibodies to SNAP-47, using as antigens either a recombinant fragment lacking part of the N terminus (ΔN-SNAP-47) or a peptide corresponding to a stretch in the linker region between the two SNARE motifs. All antibodies were affinity-purified against recombinant ΔN-SNAP-47. The antibodies recognized a major band with an approximate Mr of 47,000 (Figs. 3, 4 and supplemental Fig. 1). No significant difference in labeling pattern was found between these antibodies. We next assayed the tissue distribution of SNAP-47 by immunoblotting. The protein was found to be prominently expressed in brain, liver, and kidney (Fig. 3A). Whereas the signal was weak on the Northern blot, SNAP-47 was clearly detectable in tissues such as lung and spleen. Thus, SNAP-47 appears to be ubiquitously expressed, since slight discrepancies between the signal strength in the Northern blot (standardized to actin content) and Western blot (standardized to total protein) are expected. In the brain, the protein was ubiquitously expressed, with strongest expression in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and colliculi, as shown by immunoautoradiography and Western blot (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, we investigated the expression levels of SNAP-47 during mouse brain development. SNAP-47 is detectable as early as embryonic day 10 (E10) and reaches maximal levels at embryonic day 18 (E18) (Fig. 3D) (i.e. well before synaptogenesis peaks and before presynaptic proteins reach maximal expression levels) (34Shimohama S.

A, fractions obtained during purification of synaptic vesicles were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Fractions blotted represent increasing levels of purification (left to right) and include whole brain homogenate (H), 10,000 × g supernatant (S2), pellet (P3), and supernatant (S3) obtained after S2 centrifugation at 165,000 × g, washed synaptosomes (P2′), 25,000 × g pellet obtained after synaptosomal lysis (LP1), crude synaptic vesicles (LP2), first peak from the size exclusion column containing large membrane fractions (PK1), and purified synaptic vesicles (CPG). SNAP-47 copurifies with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin 2, with the highest enrichment in the synaptic vesicle (CPG) fraction. B, staining of mouse striatal neurons for SNAP-47 (Alexa 555; red)(B1, single-scan confocal image; B2, fluorescent micrograph) shows that it is widely expressed in both cell body and dendrites. SNAP-47 staining is punctate and enriched in the perinuclear and proximal dendritic areas. Double labeling with γ-adaptin, a protein of the trans-Golgi network (B1-Alexa 488; green) shows part of the SNAP-47 staining in close proximity to, but not overlapping with, the trans-Golgi network (arrows in the middle panel presenting a perinuclear area at higher magnification). Double labeling with synapsin (B2-Alexa 488; green) shows that SNAP-47 is not selectively localized to presynaptic nerve terminals, although colocalization was observed on rare occasions (B2, arrows).

As shown in Fig. 4A, the distribution pattern of SNAP-47 resembled that of synaptobrevin 2 (also referred to as VAMP2), a known synaptic vesicle-resident R-SNARE that plays a role in neuronal exocytosis (4Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). The similarity was particularly evident in purification steps after lysis of synaptosomes (P2′) that enrich for small vesicles in three consecutive purification steps, including differential centrifugation (LP2), sucrose gradient centrifugation, and finally size exclusion chromatography in which a fraction containing exclusively small vesicles (CPG) is separated from a fraction that contains additional larger membrane fragments (PK1; see also Ref. 36Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, SNAP-29, the closest relative of SNAP-47, showed a very similar distribution. In contrast, markers of the endoplasmic reticulum, including protein-disulfide isomerase (Fig. 4B) and the SNAREs Use1 and Sec22 (data not shown), were reduced or absent in the CPG fraction, as was the trans-Golgi marker γ-adaptin. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that SNAP-47 was absent from the soluble fractions S3 and LS2, suggesting that the protein is exclusively membrane-bound. We conclude that SNAP-47 has a widespread intracellular distribution that includes synaptic vesicles but also other intracellular membrane pools. Finally, we performed immunocytochemistry on primary neurons. SNAP-47 staining displayed a widespread punctate pattern in the cytoplasm, with prominent labeling of both neuronal cell bodies and dendrites (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, SNAP-47 immunoreactivity accumulated in the proximity of, but did not overlap with, the trans-Golgi network, visualized by staining for γ-adaptin (Fig. 4B, B1, arrows in the higher magnification panel). In contrast, SNAP-47-labeled dots only occasionally superimposed with nerve terminals (Fig. 4B, B2, arrows), suggesting that SNAP-47 is not selectively l"
https://openalex.org/W2046743471,"Keloids, partially considered as benign tumors, represent the most extreme example of cutaneous scarring that uniquely afflicts humans as a pathological response to wound healing. It is characterized by excessive deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix components by dermal fibroblasts. Upon cutaneous injury, cocktails of chemokines, cytokines and growth factors are secreted temporally and spatially to direct appropriate responses from neutrophils, macrophages, keratinocytes and fibroblasts to facilitate normal wound healing. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is an oncogene and a latent transcription factor activated by various cytokines and growth factors. We investigated the possible role of Stat3 in keloid scar pathogenesis by examining skin tissue and cultured fibroblasts from keloid-scarred patients. We observed enhanced expression and phosphorylation of Stat3 in keloid scar tissue, and in cultured keloid fibroblasts (KFs) in vitro. Increased activation of Janus kinase (Jak)2, but not Jak1, was detected in KFs, and suppression of Jak2 by its inhibitor repressed Stat3 Y705 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Stat3 expression and phosphorylation by short interfering RNA or Cucurbitacin I resulted in the loss of collagen production, impaired proliferation and delayed cell migration in KFs. We show, for the first time, a role of Stat3 in keloid pathogenesis. Inhibitors of Stat3 may be useful therapeutic strategies for the prospective treatment of keloid scars."
https://openalex.org/W2167850337,"Impaired survival signaling may represent a central mechanism in neurodegeneration. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is an oxidative neurotoxin used to injure catecholaminergic cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although 6-OHDA elicits phosphorylation of several kinases, downstream transcriptional effects that influence neuronal cell death are less defined. The cAMP response element (CRE) is present in the promoter sequences of several important neuronal survival factors. Treatment of catecholaminergic neuronal cell lines (B65 and SH-SY5Y) with 6-OHDA resulted in repression of basal CRE transactivation. Message levels of CRE-driven genes such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the survival factor Bcl-2 were decreased in 6-OHDA-treated cells, but message levels of genes lacking CRE sequences were not affected. Repression of CRE could be reversed by delayed treatment with cAMP several hours after initiation of 6-OHDA injury. Furthermore, restoration of CRE-driven transcription was associated with significant neuroprotection. In contrast to observations in other model systems, the mechanism of CRE repression did not involve decreased phosphorylation of its binding protein CREB. Instead, total CREB and phospho-CREB (pCREB) were increased in the cytoplasm and decreased in the nucleus of 6-OHDA-treated cells. 6-OHDA also decreased nuclear pCREB in dopaminergic neurons of primary mouse midbrain cultures. Co-treatment with cAMP promoted/restored nuclear localization of pCREB in both immortalized and primary culture systems. Increased cytoplasmic pCREB was observed in degenerating human Parkinson/Lewy body disease substantia nigra neurons but not in age-matched controls. Notably, cytoplasmic accumulation of activated upstream CREB kinases has been observed previously in both 6-OHDA-treated cells and degenerating human neurons, supporting a potential role for impaired nuclear import of phosphorylated signaling proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1996529719,"Cited (CBP/p300-interacting transactivators with glutamic acid (E)/aspartic acid (D)-rich C-terminal domain) 2, which is a CBP/p300-binding transcription co-activator without typical DNA-binding domains, has been implicated in control of cell growth and malignant transformation in Rat1 cells. In this report, we provide evidence that Cited2 is an important regulator of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling. Overexpression of Cited2 enhanced TGF-β-mediated transcription of a Smad-Binding Element-containing luciferase reporter construct, SBE4-Luc. This may occur through a direct physical association of Cited2 with Smads 2 and 3, as supported by co-immunoprecipitation, mammalian two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase-pull down assays. The transcription factor p300, which binds to Smad3, was shown to further enhance the interaction between Cited2 and Smad3, and the transcriptional responses of Smad3 by Cited2 in reporter assays. Cited2 enhances TGF-β-mediated upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) in Cited2 inducible mouse embryo fibroblasts. Overexpression of Cited2 enhanced TGF-β-mediated MMP9 promoter reporter activity. Moreover, knockdown of Cited2 in MDA-MB-231 cells attenuated TGF-β-mediated upregulation of MMP9 and TGF-β-mediated cell invasion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Cited2 and Smad3 were recruited to MMP9 promoter upon TGF-β stimulation. This is the first demonstration that Cited2 functions as a Smad3/p300-interacting transcriptional co-activator in modulating the expression of MMP9, which could affect tumor cell invasion mediated by TGF-β."

https://openalex.org/W2087248734,"Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a glycoprotein that is part of the carcinoembryonic antigen and the immunoglobulin superfamilies. We have shown that it functions as a tumor suppressor and that this function depends upon the presence of the longer CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domain. In this report, we describe the generation of a Ceacam1−/− mouse. The Ceacam1−/− colon exhibits increased in vivo proliferation relative to the wild-type counterpart with a corresponding decreased expression of the p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 Cyclin D kinase inhibitors. The colonic villi undergo decreased apoptosis. Out of 35 litters of mice, no spontaneous tumors in any tissues normally expressing CEACAM1 were found over the lifespan of the animals, suggesting that CEACAM1 may not be involved in initiation of tumor development. However, when mice are treated with azoxymethane to induce colonic tumors, we find that Ceacam1−/− mice developed a significantly greater number of tumors than their littermate controls. Moreover, the tumor size was greater in the knockout mice relative to that in the wild-type mice. These results indicate that deletion of CEACAM1 favors progression of colon tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2032162774,"Genetic evidence from both humans and mice suggests that Wnt/beta-catenin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways are essential for bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts. Here we describe a mechanism through which BMPs antagonize Wnt signaling and retard bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell proliferation. Treatment with Wnt3a, but not BMP-2, stimulated Lef1-mediated transcriptional activity, whereas co-stimulation with both Wnt3a and BMP-2 markedly reduced Wnt3a-induced reporter activity. Immunoprecipitation assays in 293T cells transfected with individual Smads and Wnt pathway components revealed a specific interaction between Dvl-1 and Smad1 that was dependent on the presence of Wnt3a or BMP-2. Under unstimulated conditions, Dvl-1 and Smad1 are co-immunoprecipitated and form a complex through the linker region of Smad1. Wnt3a treatment transiently disrupted the Dvl-1/Smad1 interaction coincident with nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. In contrast, when cells were exposed to both Wnt3a and BMP-2, there was an enhanced accumulation of the Dvl-1-Smad1 complex and a decreased nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. Expression of a mutant Smad1 protein, which cannot be phosphorylated in response to BMP, eliminated the inhibitory effect of BMP on Wnt-inducedbeta-catenin accumulation and transcriptional activity. These results identify a potential mechanism whereby BMP-2 antagonizes Wnt signaling in osteoblast progenitors by promoting an interaction between Smad1 and Dvl-1 that restricts beta-catenin activation."

https://openalex.org/W1972535443,"Betaglycan is a co-receptor that mediates signaling by transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily members, including the distinct and often opposed actions of TGFβs and inhibins. Loss of betaglycan expression, or abrogation of betaglycan function, is implicated in several human and animal diseases, although both betaglycan actions and the ligands involved in these disease states remain unclear. Here we identify a domain spanning amino acids 591–700 of the betaglycan extracellular domain as the only inhibin-binding region in betaglycan. This binding site is within the betaglycan ZP domain, but inhibin binding is not integral to the ZP motif of other proteins. We show that the inhibin and TGFβ-binding residues of this domain overlap and identify individual amino acids essential for binding of each ligand. Mutation of Val614 to Tyr abolishes both inhibin and TGFβ binding to this domain. Full-length betaglycan V614Y, and other mutations, retain TGFβ binding activity via a distinct site, but are unable to bind inhibin-A. These betaglycan mutants fail to mediate inhibin antagonism of activin signaling but can present TGFβ to TβRII. Separating the co-receptor actions of betaglycan toward inhibin and TGFβ will allow the clarification of the role of betaglycan in disease states such as renal cell carcinoma and endometrial adenocarcinoma.

Betaglycan is a co-receptor for members of the TGFβ 3The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; TβRII, transforming growth factor β type II receptor; TβRI, transforming growth factor β type I receptor; ActRII, activin type II receptor; ActRIIB, activin type IIB receptor; BMPRII, BMP type II receptor; ECD, extracellular domain; DMBT1, deleted in malignant brain tumor 1; ZP, zona pellucida; PEI, polyethyleneimine; DMEM, Dul-becco's modified Eagle's medium; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HEK, human embryonic kidney. superfamily, with vital roles in mediating and regulating signaling of diverse superfamily members. The importance of betaglycan is highlighted by loss of expression or mutation of betaglycan in various human diseases. For example, there is a strict correlation between a loss of betaglycan expression in human patients and development of both renal cell carcinoma and endometrial adenocarcinoma (1Copland J.A. Luxon B.A. Ajani L. Maity T. Campagnaro E. Guo H. LeGrand S.N. Tamboli P. Wood C.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8053-8062Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Florio P. Ciarmela P. Reis F.M. Toti P. Galleri L. Santopietro R. Tiso E. Tosi P. Petraglia F. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 152: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results also highlight the difficulty in understanding the role of betaglycan in different cellular contexts, because betaglycan can impinge on signaling by so many TGFβ superfamily members. In the studies cited above, loss of betaglycan in renal cell carcinoma has been proposed to impair TGFβ-2 signaling, because impaired TGFβ signaling due to loss of TβRII expression has also been detected in these carcinomas (1Copland J.A. Luxon B.A. Ajani L. Maity T. Campagnaro E. Guo H. LeGrand S.N. Tamboli P. Wood C.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8053-8062Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, loss of betaglycan in endometrial adenocarcinoma is speculated to involve betaglycan regulation of inhibin action, due to the fact that the inhibin α-subunit is also disrupted in endometrial adenocarcinomas (2Florio P. Ciarmela P. Reis F.M. Toti P. Galleri L. Santopietro R. Tiso E. Tosi P. Petraglia F. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 152: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, these conclusions will remain primarily correlative until methods are developed to dissect the various co-receptor roles of betaglycan. Betaglycan directly binds TGFβ isoforms, which is functionally vital in the case of TGFβ-2. Betaglycan facilitates TGFβ-2 binding to the TGFβ type II receptor TβRII, leading to the formation of a ternary complex containing TGFβ-2, TβRII, and betaglycan (3Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Once this complex has formed, TβRI (ALK5) then binds to TGFβ-2 and TβRII, displacing betaglycan. TβRII then phosphorylates TβRI, which, in turn, propagates TGFβ signals into the cell via phosphorylation of intracellular Smad proteins (reviewed in Ref. 4Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar). Expression of betaglycan in cells that normally lack this co-receptor leads to an increase in cellular sensitivity to TGFβ-2 and a concomitant increase in TGFβ-2 binding to TβRII and TβRI (5Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Because TGFβ-2 does not interact with TβRII or TβRI with high affinity in most cells, betaglycan has as essential, although indirect, role in promoting TGFβ-2 signaling. Betaglycan also directly binds inhibin isoforms and promotes inhibin binding to type II receptors (6Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), primarily the activin type II receptors ActRII and ActRIIB and the BMP type II receptor BMPRII. However, the functional consequences of inhibin binding to betaglycan are diametrically opposed to the events that occur subsequent to TGFβ binding. Inhibin-betaglycan-type II receptor complexes are very stable and, because inhibins do not interact with type I receptors, these complexes do not result in Smad phosphorylation and downstream signaling. Instead, this inhibin-betaglycan-type II receptor complex sequesters type II receptors, thereby forestalling their interactions with signaling ligands such as activins or BMPs. Expression of betaglycan in cells that respond poorly to inhibin leads to dramatic increases in inhibin sensitivity (6Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 7Wiater E. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7934-7941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because inhibins bind with low affinity to type II receptors in the absence of betaglycan, betaglycan has as essential, direct role in potentiating inhibin antagonism of activin and BMP signaling. By functioning as a co-receptor for both TGFβs and inhibins, betaglycan can potentially affect signaling by the majority of TGFβ superfamily ligands. In addition, betaglycan may inhibit TGFβ signaling in certain systems, depending on the cell-specific glycosaminoglycan modification of betaglycan (8Eickelberg O. Centrella M. Reiss M. Kashgarian M. Wells R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In vivo studies demonstrate the functional role of betaglycan as a co-receptor is clearly vital. Mice lacking betaglycan die during embryogenesis with heart and liver defects (9Stenvers K.L. Tursky M.L. Harder K.W. Kountouri N. Amatayakul-Chantler S. Grail D. Small C. Weinberg R.A. Sizeland A.M. Zhu H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4371-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), whereas experimental targeting of betaglycan during development has been shown to disrupt mesenchyme formation in the heart (10Brown C.B. Boyer A.S. Runyan R.B. Barnett J.V. Science. 1999; 283: 2080-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and branching morphogenesis in the lung (11Zhao J. Tefft J.D. Lee M. Smith S. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 75: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the adult, loss of betaglycan is associated with tumorigenesis (1Copland J.A. Luxon B.A. Ajani L. Maity T.

Prostate. 2005; 63: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rat betaglycan is an 853-amino acid protein with a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular domain lacking obvious signaling motifs (3Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of betaglycan can be removed without grossly altering co-receptor function, although this domain can be bound by β-arrestin (15Chen W. Kirkbride K.C. How T. Nelson C.D. Mo J. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Blobe G.C. Science. 2003; 301: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and the PDZ domain protein GIPC (16Blobe G.C. Liu X. Fang S.J. How T. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39608-39617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of betaglycan contains sites for attachment of heparin and chrondoitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains as well as sites for N-glycosylation (17Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and binds TGFβ superfamily ligands. Betaglycan has at least two independent binding sites for TGFβs, which have been roughly delineated within the two halves of the betaglycan ECD (17Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 18Pepin M.C. Beauchemin M. Collins C. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Individual deletion of either half of the betaglycan ECD does not prevent betaglycan from mediating TGFβ-2-induced phosphorylation of Smad2, suggesting that each half of the betaglycan ECD can independently function to present TGFβ-2 to TβRII (19Esparza-Lopez J. Montiel J.L. Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Okadome T. Miyazono K. Lopez-Casillas F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14588-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In contrast to TGFβs, inhibins may bind only to the membrane proximal half of the betaglycan ECD (19Esparza-Lopez J. Montiel J.L. Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Okadome T. Miyazono K. Lopez-Casillas F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14588-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This portion of the betaglycan ECD contains only one recognizable feature: a ZP domain, a motif found in several extracellular proteins, including endoglin, the α- and β-tectorins of the inner ear, the zona pellucida proteins (ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3), renal uromodulin, and DMBT1 (20Bork P. Sander C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). ZP domains are composed of around 260 amino acids, including eight conserved cysteines, which are thought to mediate a related three-dimensional structure to these domains (20Bork P. Sander C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The ZP domains of ZP2, ZP3, and uromodulin are responsible for polymerization of these proteins into filaments (21Jovine L. Qi H. Williams Z. Litscher E. Wassarman P.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), although less is known about the role the ZP domain plays in transmembrane proteins, such as betaglycan. Despite the crucial role of betaglycan as a co-receptor for TGFβ-2 and inhibins, the inhibin and TGFβ-binding sites within betaglycan have not been precisely mapped. The two halves of the betaglycan ECD are not highly related to each other, suggesting their ligand-binding sites may have important differences. Furthermore, the role of ZP domains in binding TGFβ superfamily ligands has not been investigated. To separate betaglycan co-receptor actions toward TGFβs and inhibins, there is a need to fully delimitate the sites of betaglycan involved in inhibin and TGFβ binding, and to develop mechanisms to specifically disrupt either the TGFβ or inhibin co-receptor actions of betaglycan. Therefore, we have utilized truncation and site-directed mutagenesis studies to delineate the inhibinbinding domain on betaglycan and identify amino acids involved in inhibin and TGFβ binding. Here we map the inhibin- and TGFβ-binding sites within the membrane proximal domain of betaglycan, demonstrate that they overlap, and identify individual amino acids essential for the binding of both ligands. Through binding and functional studies we have generated betaglycan mutants that bind TGFβs but not inhibins, allowing experimental separation of betaglycan co-receptor actions toward TGFβs and inhibins. Materials—NuPAGE gels, molecular weight markers, and nitrocellulose blotting membranes were purchased from Invitrogen. Recombinant human TGFβ-1 and TGFβ-2 were purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Recombinant human activin-A and inhibin-A were produced using an inhibin-α and -βA expressing stable Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Activin-A and inhibin-A were each purified by consecutive heparin affinity, gel filtration, and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography steps. Final purity was found to be >99% as accessed by SDS-PAGE. 125I-Inhibin-A and 125I-TGFβ-1 were prepared using a modified chloramine-T method (22Vaughan J.M. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2038-2050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG, chemiluminescent substrate (Supersignal™), and TMB-turbo peroxidase (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) substrate were obtained from Pierce. Perfectin transfection reagent was purchased from Gene Therapy Systems (San Diego, CA) and SuperFect transfection reagent was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Anti-FLAG antibodies (M2) were purchased from Sigma and anti-c-myc antibodies (9E10) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). High molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI) was purchased from Sigma. The betaglycan constructs used in this study were expressed from the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Mutagenesis of Betaglycan—The internal truncation series of betaglycan constructs were the generous gift of Dr. J. Massague (17Lopez-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The N-terminal-deleted betaglycan construct Δ26-575 (which we refer to as BG-(576-853) was a generous gift from Dr. M. O'Connor-McCourt (18Pepin M.C. Beauchemin M. Collins C. Plamondon J. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The betaglycan ΔZP construct was generated by deleting residues 456-733 of rat betaglycan. The BG/DMBT1 ZP chimera was made by replacing residues 456-733 of rat betaglycan with residues 362-561 of the human DMBT1 cDNA. Most other betaglycan mutants were initially constructed using the rat betaglycan-Δ26-575 cDNA as a template for overlap PCR-based mutagenesis. Standard molecular biology techniques were used to purify and clone mutant constructs into the expression vector pcDNA3. All mutants were fully sequenced before use. Transfection of Betaglycan and Betaglycan Mutants in HEK293T Cells—HEK293T cells were grown in 5% CO2 in a 37 °C humidified incubator in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% bovine calf serum. Transfection of myc-tagged wild-type or mutant betaglycan constructs was performed using a modified high molecular weight PEI protocol, as previously described (23Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Fischer W.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T were plated at 1 × 105 cells per well in 24-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine. After recovery overnight, cells were transfected with a total of 500 ng of DNA per well. DNA was diluted to a final volume of 10 μg/ml in serum-free DMEM. PEI (frozen as a 10 mg/ml stock) was diluted to 1 mg/ml in H2O and added to the DNA solution to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. The DNA/PEI solution was vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. During this incubation, media was removed from the plates and 250 μl of serum-free DMEM was added to each well. After 10 min, 50 μl of the DNA-PEI complexes were added directly to each well and plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 4 h, wells were aspirated and 300 μl of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 to allow cells to recover and express protein for 48 h prior to assay. For co-expression of betaglycan and ActRII, equal amounts of betaglycan and ActRII cDNAs were used and cells were transfected using Perfectin reagent according to the manufacturers instructions. Detection of Surface-expressed Betaglycan—A cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to ensure expression of betaglycan constructs. This method is a modification of a previously described protocol (25Gray P.C. Greenwald J. Blount A.L. Kunitake K.S. Donaldson C.J. Choe S. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3206-3212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h after transfection, intact cells were chilled on ice, washed in cold binding buffer (12.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 5 mm KCl) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2 and blocked with binding buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with an anti-myc (9E10) antibody (1 μg/ml in binding buffer with 1% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h, washed three times in binding buffer, and finally incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for 2 h. Cells were washed three times in binding buffer and anti-myc antibody binding was quantitated using TMB-turbo peroxidase substrate. Peroxidase activity was quenched using 0.18 n H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Expression data were analyzed and graphed using the Prism software package (version 2.0 from GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA)). Inhibin-A and TGFβ-1 Binding to Betaglycan and Betaglycan Mutants—Inhibin and TGFβ binding was measured in intact cells. 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed in binding buffer and then incubated in binding buffer with 2 × 105 cpm/well of 125I-inhibin-A or 125I-TGFβ tracer and increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligand. Plates were incubated for 2 h with gentle rocking and then wells were washed three times in binding buffer to remove free tracer. Cells were solubilized in 500 μl of 1% SDS and 125I-inhibin-A or 125I-TGFβ-1 bound in each well were determined using a γ-counter. Binding data were analyzed and graphed using the Prism program. Cross-linking of Inhibin-A or TGFβ-1 to Betaglycan and Betaglycan Mutants—For cross-linking, HEK293T cells were plated on six-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA/well with the indicated constructs using Perfectin according to the manufacturers instructions. 48 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with 5 × 105 cpm/well 125I-inhibin-A or 125I-TGFβ-1 for 4 h at room temperature in binding buffer with gentle rocking. Cells were washed in binding buffer, resuspended in cross-linking buffer (0.5 mm disuccinylsuberate in HDB), and incubated 30 min on ice. Cross-linking reactions were quenched with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and cells were solubilized in TBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 2 mm EDTA and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc antibodies as indicated. Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Transfection and Luciferase Assays in AtT20 Cells—AtT20 cells were grown in 5% CO2 in a 37 °C humidified incubator in complete DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum. For transfection, cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates and allowed to recover overnight. The next day cells were transfected with SuperFect reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions using 1 μg of DNA and 1.2 μl of SuperFect/well. Cells were transfected with the 3TP-Lux reporter plasmid, CMV-β-galactosidase, and either pcDNA3 vector or rat betaglycan construct. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h and were then treated with vehicle, 1 nm activin-A, or 1 nm activin-A and 5 nm inhibin-A. After 24 h of treatment, cells were harvested and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Data were analyzed and graphed using the Prism software package. Transfection and Luciferase Assays in HepG2 Cells—HepG2 cells were grown in 5% CO2 in a 37 °C humidified incubator in complete α modification of Eagle's media with 10% bovine calf serum. For transfection, HepG2 cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates and allowed to recover overnight. Cells were transfected with the 3TP-Lux reporter plasmid, CMV-β-galactosidase, and pcDNA3 vector or rat betaglycan construct as shown. Transfections were performed using SuperFect reagent and a total of 500 ng of DNA and 1 μl of SuperFect/well. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h and then treated with activin-A (500 pm or 1 nm) and various doses of inhibin-A as shown. After 16-20 h of treatment, cells were harvested in solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EGTA) and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Data were analyzed and graphed using the Prism software program and data are presented as percent inhibition. Identification of a Single, Functional Inhibin-binding Region of Betaglycan—Betaglycan is able to bind both TGFβs (3Lopez-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J.

Inhibin-A, in contrast, binds only to the membrane proximal half of the betaglycan ECD (19Esparza-Lopez J. Montiel J.L. Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Okadome T. Miyazono K. Lopez-Casillas F. J. Biol.

To extend these findings, we tested the ability of additional betaglycan deletion mutants to form complexes with inhibin-A in the presence or absence of ActRII and to mediate inhibin antagonism of activin signaling. All of the deletion mutants examined were expressed at the cell surface at levels approximating wild-type betaglycan (Fig. 1B). Removal of the cytoplasmic tail (Δ811-853), or mutation of the glycosaminoglycan attachment sites in the betaglycan ECD (S535A/S546A), did not affect inhibin binding (Fig. 1A). Similarly, each of the mutants with deletions through the membrane distal region, except betaglycan-Δ287-409, bound inhibin-A robustly (Fig. 1A). The apparent decrease in inhibin binding observed for the Δ287–409 mutant has been described previously with respect to TGFβ binding (19Esparza-Lopez J. Montiel J.L. Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Okadome T. Miyazono K. Lopez-Casillas F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14588-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and may relate to downstream folding effects. As expected, deletion of the membrane proximal region of betaglycan-Δ499-783 completely abrogated inhibin-A binding (Fig. 1A). We next utilized cross-linking assays to examine inhibin complex formation with the betaglycan deletion mutants alone (Fig. 1C), or when co-expressed with ActRII (Fig. 1D). In support of the binding studies (Fig. 1A), immunoprecipitation of cross-linked complexes with a myc antibody directed against the epitope tag on betaglycan confirmed the importance of the C-terminal, membrane proximal half of the betaglycan ECD for inhibin binding. Deletion of residues 45-199, 200-285, 287-409, 811-853, or the glycosaminoglycan attachment sites did not prevent inhibin cross-linking, although complex formation was substantially lower with the Δ287-409 mutant (Fig. 1C). In contrast, deletion of residues 499-783 abolished cross-linking. A pattern of weak binding was observed to the betaglycan core protein (∼110 kDa for wild-type betaglycan), which lacks glycosaminoglycan chains, and stronger binding to the fully processed betaglycan, which runs as a smear above 200 kDa (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the cooperative nature of inhibin binding to betaglycan and type II receptors, co-expression of ActRII in this system increased the total levels of cross-linked complexes (compare Fig. 1, C and D). ActRII did not, however, enable betaglycan-Δ499-783 to form a cross-linked complex with inhibin-A (Fig. 1D, lane 6). These data support the conclusion that betaglycan-Δ499-783 lacks residues necessary for inhibin binding to betaglycan and formation of the inhibin-ActRII-betaglycan complex. We previously described the ability of activin to suppress ACTH secretion by AtT20 corticotrope cells and showed that inhibin could not antagonize this activin response (28Bilezikjian L.M. Blount A.L. Campen C.A. Gonzalez-Manchon C. Vale W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1389-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, when AtT20 cells were transfected with betaglycan, the activin actions in these cells become sensitive to inhibin blockade (6Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To test which betaglycan mutants could confer inhibin sensitivity, we co-transfected AtT20 cells with the various betaglycan constructs and the activin-responsive 3TP-Lux luciferase reporter and determined the ability of inhibin to block activin signaling. In cells transfected with vector, activin-A induced a 2.5-fold increase in luciferase activity that was unaffected by 5 nm inhibin (Fig. 1E). In contrast, in cells expressing wild-type betaglycan, this dose of inhibin-A was able to antagonize activin signaling (Fig. 1E). Expression of betaglycan constructs that bound inhibin: i.e. betaglycan-Δ44-199, -Δ200-285, -Δ287-409, -Δ811-853, or betaglycan S535/546A, similarly endowed cells with inhibin sensitivity. Of all the mutants tested, only betaglycan-Δ499-783 failed to promote inhibin antagonism of activin signaling (Fig. 1E, sixth set). The ZP Domain of Betaglycan Is Required for Inhibin Binding—The inhibin-binding region of betaglycan we identified contains a ZP domain (residues 456-733), and we therefore examined whether this domain was necessary and sufficient for inhibin binding. Initially, we removed the entire ZP domain of betaglycan to generate a ΔZP betaglycan construct and, subsequently, replaced the betaglycan ZP domain with the ZP domain of DMBT1 (deleted in malignant brain tumor-1) to generate a betaglycan/DMBT1(ZP) chimera. DMBT1 was selected because the DMBT ZP domain has relatively high conservation with the betaglycan ZP domain. The betaglyc"

The roles of the active site residues in Streptococcus pneumoniae FabF (β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II; SpFabF) were investigated to clarify the mechanism for this enzyme superfamily. The nucleophilic cysteine of the active site triad was required for acyl-enzyme formation and the overall condensation activity. The two active site histidines in the elongation condensing enzyme have different electronic states and functions. His337 is essential for condensation activity, and its protonated Nϵ stabilizes the negative charge developed on the malonyl thioester carbonyl in the transition state. The Nϵ of His303 accelerated catalysis by deprotonating a structured active site water for nucleophilic attack on the C3 of malonate, releasing bicarbonate. Lys332 controls the electronic state of His303 and also plays a critical role in the positioning of His337. Phe396 functions as a gatekeeper that controls the order of substrate addition. These data assign specific roles for each active site residue and lead to a revised general mechanism for this important class of enzymes. β-Ketoacyl-ACP synthases catalyze the condensation steps in fatty acid and polyketide synthesis and are targets for the development of novel antibiotics and anti-obesity and anti-cancer agents.

These data assign specific roles for each active site residue and lead to a revised general mechanism for this important class of enzymes. The condensing enzymes play a central role in fatty acid biosynthesis by elongating the growing acyl chain by two carbon atoms to initiate each elongation cycle (1Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 2Smith S. Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Somewhat uniquely in biological synthesis, the enzymes create a carbon-carbon bond via a Claisen-like condensation reaction (3Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Specifically, they catalyze the condensation of malonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) 2The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; CoA, coenzyme A; TAL, triacetic acid lactone; DTT, dithiothreitol. with an acyl-ACP intermediate via a two-step ping-pong kinetic mechanism. In the first step, an acyl chain from either acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP is transferred to an active site cysteine, and the cofactor is released. During the second step, malonyl-ACP binds, and a carbanion is generated on the C2 of malonate concomitant with the release of the C3 carboxyl group (4Greenspan M.D. Alberts A.W. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6477-6485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Vagelos P.R. Alberts A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2786-2791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10877-10887Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The carbanion then attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate to produce the β-ketoacyl-ACP product. In the dissociated, type II synthases, the condensation reaction is carried out by monofunctional enzymes (7Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and most bacteria have only a single elongation-condensing enzyme that belongs to the FabF class. In mammals and yeast, the condensing enzyme component, KS, is fused into a multidomain complex referred to as the type I or associated FAS system (8Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). However, it is clear from primary sequence analysis that the active site of the FAS I condensation module is very similar to the FAS II elongation enzymes (Fig. 1A). The polyketide synthases also contain a condensing enzyme module in which the same signature active site residues can be identified (Fig. 1A). The importance of the elongation condensing enzymes in regulating fatty acid formation (7Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1996; (American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Rep. 2002; 19: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) have focused our interest on understanding the specific tasks of each active site residue in catalysis. In addition, these enzymes have emerged as attractive targets for the development of new broad-spectrum antibiotics (10Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Prog.

Science. 2005; 308: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These efforts will be facilitated by a complete mechanistic understanding of the active site. At their catalytic cores, the elongation enzymes possess a Cys-His-His triad. These residues have been mutated and are thought to be critical to the overall forward condensation reaction (8Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 19Huang W. Jia J. Edwards P. Dehesh K. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y.

There are also conserved lysine, glutamate and phenylalanine residues in the vicinity of the active site, and the structural and/or catalytic roles for these residues are not understood (Fig. 1A). Our systematic analysis of a panel of mutants in a model elongation condensing enzyme and the correlation of this new information with new and previously determined structures led to a reevaluation of the roles for the active site residues in the catalytic cycle. We selected SpFabF as the basis for this work, since its x-ray structure is known at the highest resolution (1.3 Å) (21Price A.C. Rock C.O. White S.W. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4136-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A stereo view of the SpFabF active site illustrating the orientation of the key residues investigated in this study is shown in Fig. 1B. Materials—Myristoyl-ACP was prepared using an established acyl-ACP synthetase method (23Rock C.O. Garwin J.L. J. Biol.

[2-14C]Malonyl-CoA and sodium [14C]bicarbonate were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. [1-14C]Lauroyl-CoA was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Malonyl-ACP was prepared using AcpS (ACP synthase) with apo-ACP and malonyl-CoA as described (25Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Hofmann J. Schweizer E. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (M413686200)Google Scholar). His-tagged AcpS, FabD, FabG, FabI, FabZ, FabB (β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I), FabF, and FabH (β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III) from Escherichia coli and FabF from Streptococcus pneumoniae were purified as described previously (21Price A.C.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Construction of Mutants and Protein Purification—A DNA fragment encoding the wild-type S. pneumoniae FabF was cloned into the pET15b vector between the NdeI and BamHI sites. Mutations at the active site residues were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All clones were checked by automated sequencing on an ABI Prism 3700 DNA Analyzer. His-tagged mutant proteins were expressed in Rossetta (DE3) cells and purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The proper folding of the mutant proteins was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. β-Ketoacyl-ACP Synthase Assay—The condensation assay for EcFabB and SpFabF was described previously (29Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the assays contained 45 μm myristoyl-ACP, 50 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 52 Ci/mol), 100 μm ACP, 1 μg of EcFabD, and the indicated amount of EcFabB or SpFabF in a final volume of 20 μl. ACP was reduced by 0.3 mm DTT before the other reaction components were added. After incubation of the sample at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.4 ml of reducing agent containing 0.1 m K2HPO4, 0.4 m KCl, 30% tetrahydrofuran, and 5 mg/ml NaBH4. The reaction mixtures were vigorously mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min, followed by extraction with 0.4 ml of toluene. The 14C-isotope in the upper phase was quantitated. Reconstituted Fatty Acid Synthase Assay—The overall fatty acid synthase activity in vitro was measured using purified fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes (30Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1833-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The 40-μl reaction contained 200 μm ACP, 200 μm NADH, 200 μm NADPH, 50 μm acetyl-CoA, 250 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 10.4 mCi/mmol), 2 μg of EcFabD, 2 μg of EcFabH, 2 μg of EcFabG, 2 μg of EcFabZ, 2 μg of EcFabI, and 4 μg wild-type or mutant SpFabF in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. ACP was reduced by 1 mm β-mecaptoethanol for 20 min at 37 °C before the remaining components were added. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reactions were stopped by placing the reaction tubes on an ice slurry. The entire mixture was loaded onto a conformationally sensitive 2 m urea, 13% acrylamide gel, and the gel was stained, dried, and exposed to a phosphor storage screen (Amersham Biosciences). The radioactivity was detected by a Typhoon 9200 PhosphoImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software. Transacylation Assay—The assay for the transacylase activity of the condensing enzyme contained 25 μm ACP, 0.3 mm DTT, 50 μm [1-14C]lauroyl-CoA (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol) and the indicated amount of (2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, or 0.125 μg) enzyme in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, buffer in a total volume of 40 μl. ACP was reduced by DTT in buffer before the rest of the reaction components were added. Following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reactions were stopped by pipetting 35 μl of the reaction mix onto DE81 filter discs (Whatman). The discs were then washed three times with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (2:5:3 volume ratio) containing 0.2 m LiCl (20 min/wash with 20 ml/disc). The discs were dried and counted to quantitate [14C]acyl-ACP. Malonyl-ACP Decarboxylation Assay—The decarboxylase assay measured the conversion of malonyl-ACP to acetyl-ACP and triacetic acid lactone (TAL) (31Zha W. Shao Z. Frost J.W. Zhao H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 4534-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The reaction mix contained 50 μm ACP, 0.3 mm DTT, 50 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 52 mCi/mmol), 1 μg of EcFabD, and 10 μg of wild-type or mutant SpFabF in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, in a final volume of 60 μl (26Davies C. Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Structure. 2000; 8: 185-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). ACP was reduced by DTT in buffer before the rest of the reaction components were added. The reaction was started by the addition of SpFabF. Following incubation at 37 °C for 40 min, the reactions were stopped by placing the reaction tubes on an ice slurry, and 35- and 25-μl aliquots were removed. The 35-μl portion was loaded onto a conformationally sensitive 0.5 m urea, 13% acrylamide gel. The 25-μl reaction mix was spotted on a preadsorbent Silica Gel G plate (Analtech) developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (24:1:1, v/v/v), dried, and exposed to a phosphor storage imager (Amersham Biosciences). The distribution of radioactivity was detected and quantitated as described above. Malonyl-ACP Bicarbonate Exchange Reaction—The carbon exchange between malonyl-ACP and bicarbonate is the reverse reaction of the condensing enzyme (5Vagelos P.R. Alberts A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2786-2791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction contained 50 μm malonyl-ACP, 5 μm myristoyl-ACP, 10 mm [14C]bicarbonate and 8 μg of wild-type SpFabF or mutants in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, in a final volume of 20 μl. Following incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by placing the tubes in an ice slurry before being loaded onto a conformationally sensitive 0.5 m urea, 13% acrylamide gel. Radioactivity was detected and quantitated as described above. Complementation of the fabB(Ts) Growth Phenotype—Strain CY274 (fabB15(Ts)) was unable to grow at the nonpermissive temperature (42 °C) unless unsaturated fatty acids (oleate) were supplied or the fabB gene was expressed in trans. The ability of wild-type and mutant FabB to complement the fabB(Ts) phenotype was tested after transformation of strain CY274 with plasmids carrying wild-type or mutant fabB (32Tsay J.-T. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SpFabF-ACP Interactions—AlphaScreen technology is an experimental method to quantitate protein-protein interactions (33Beaudet L. Bedard J. Breton B. Mercuri R.J. Budarf M.L. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 600-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Upon laser excitation, a chemical signal is generated on the donor beads (streptavidin-coated). When a specific interaction brings the acceptor beads (coated with a specific antibody or nickel chelater) to the proximity of the donor beads, a cascade of energy transfers take place, emitting highly amplified fluorescence (or AlphaScreen signal) at a wavelength that is lower than that of the excitation. We measured ACP affinity using the competitive binding approach. Briefly, 1 μm biotinylated ACP was mixed with 1 μm His-tagged wild-type SpFabF or mutant in the presence of different concentrations of regular ACP (120 nm to 10 μm) in a 384-well ProxiPlate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After a 30-min incubation, streptavidin donor beads and Ni2+ chelate acceptor beads (50 μg/ml final concentration for each bead; Alphascreen Histidine Detection Kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added to the above solutions. The reaction mixtures were then incubated for 1 h before being read by Fusion™ Universal Microplate Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), with excitation at 680 nm and emission at 600 nm. X-ray Crystallography—Crystals of the SpFabF[H303A] mutant were grown in 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2 m potassium acetate and were in space group P21212 with cell dimensions a = 60.39 Å, b = 88.82 Å, and c = 61.05 Å. Rod-shaped crystals measuring ∼0.25 mm on edge were harvested after 9 days and frozen in liquid nitrogen using 25% PEG 400 as a cryoprotectant. A 2.6 Å data set was collected at the SER-CAT ID beamline (Sector 22 at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne National Laboratory), and processed using MOSFLM (34Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and SCALA (35Evans P.R.

The active site cysteine (Cys164) and the two histidines (His303 and His337) that comprise the central Cys-His-His triad were obvious choices for site-directed mutagenesis. Also selected were Lys332 and Glu346 that have been implicated in catalysis, although Glu346 is not conserved in FAS I and polyketide synthases (Fig. 1). Finally, Phe396 was also included in the analysis, because it is located in a flexible region of the active site surrounded by conserved glycines. Each of these residues (Fig. 1) was mutated to alanine in SpFabF, and the mutants were analyzed for their ability to carry out the biochemical activities that comprise the full and partial reactions of the condensing enzyme catalytic cycle. The overall condensation reaction was determined using [2-14C]malonyl-ACP and myristoyl-ACP as substrates. With the exception of SpFabF[H303A] and SpFabF[E346A], which retained 26 and 100% of the wild-type activity, respectively, all of the mutant condensing enzymes were deficient in their overall condensation activity (Fig. 2A, Table 1). The function of the mutants was also evaluated in an assay to reconstitute multiple rounds of fatty acid synthesis starting with acetyl-CoA as the primer (Fig. 2B). The SpFabF[H303A] and SpFabF[F396A] mutants retained activity, whereas the other mutants were inactive in this assay format, although neither active mutant produced as much long-chain acyl-ACPs as the wild type. In order to detect very low levels of activity, the assays were repeated at higher protein concentrations, and this revealed that SpFabF[K332A] exhibited a low, but significant, activity that was estimated at 0.2% of wild-type (Table 1). The activity of the other mutant proteins was not detected at the highest protein concentrations permitted by the assay format, setting the condensation activity of these constructs to <0.2% (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of the activities of S. pneumoniae FabF active site mutants The specific activities for the 100% reactions were as follows: condensation, 147 ± 7 pmol/μg/min; transacylation, 4.15 ± 0.46 pmol/μg/min; acetyl-ACP formation, 2.49 ± 0.04 pmol/μg/min; and TAL formation, 0.122 ± 0.03 pmol/μg/min.SpFabFCondensation Myristoyl-ACP + [2-14C]Mal-ACP ↓ 14C-β-ketopalmitoyl-ACPTransacylation 14C-Lauroyl-CoA + ACP ↓ 14C-lauroyl-ACPDecarboxylationAc-ACP formation [2-14C]Mal-ACP ↓ HCO3– + 14C-Ac-ACPTAL formation 3 [2-14C]Mal-ACP ↓ 3 HCO3– + 14C-TAL%%%%Wild-type100100–a<0.2% of control activity100C164A100–K332A0.228.53.510H303A25.660–500H337A–122.5–C164A/K332A––3.4–C164A/H303A––100–C164A/H337A––2.5–F396A0.759.44.339.9E346A100100–100a <0.2% of control activity Open table in a new tab The results with SpFabF[H303A] and SpFabF[K332A] were inconsistent with previous conclusions from work on EcFabB (40McGuire K.A. Siggaard-Andersen M. Bangera M.G. Olsen J.G. Wettstein-Knowles P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9836-9845Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This study concluded that the equivalent residues of His303 and Lys332 in EcFabB are both essential, whereas our analysis indicated that the these two residues have important, but not absolutely essential, roles in promoting the overall condensation reaction. This apparent inconsistency might be attributable to subtle differences between the FabB and FabF subfamilies. We explored this point by constructing the same panel of mutants in EcFabB as reported previously (40McGuire K.A. Siggaard-Andersen M. Bangera M.G. Olsen J.G. Wettstein-Knowles P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9836-9845Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); all of the FabB mutants appeared to be inactive using a protein concentration in the linear range for the wild-type enzyme (not shown). However, we were able to detect a trace of activity (∼1% of wild type) in the EcFabB[H298A] and EcFabB[K328A] mutants when assayed at higher protein concentrations, illustrating that they retained partial condensation activity in vitro. We corroborated this conclusion using an in vivo complementation test to verify the activities of the FabB mutants (Table 2). The panel of fabB mutant alleles was introduced into E. coli strain CY274 (fabB15(Ts)), and the resulting strains were scored for correction of the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype (Table 2). The EcFabB[H298A] and EcFabB[K328A] mutants restored growth at the nonpermissive temperature, demonstrating that they retained condensing enzyme activity in vivo. In contrast, the inactive EcFabB[C163A] and EcFabB[H333A] mutants were unable to complement the growth phenotype. Importantly, since the condensation enzymes function as dimers, the lack of activity of the latter two mutants ruled out the possibility that complementation arose from the stabilization of the temperature-sensitive fabB allele by the expression of a properly folded protein. The results with the E. coli mutant panel (Table 2) were qualitatively the same as with the SpFabF panel (Table 1), although the level of enzyme activity in the EcFabB[H298A] was less than the residual activity in SpFabF[H303A]. Thus, the different condensing enzyme mutant sets differed in their absolute values of activity, but the rank order of activity in the mutant proteins was the same.TABLE 2Complementation of E. coli strain CY274 (fabB15(Ts)) by a panel of fabB mutantsPlasmidGrowth of strain CY27430 °C42 °CpBluescript+–pfabB++pfabB[C163A]+–pfabB[K328A]++pfabB[H298A]++pfabB[H333A]+– Open table in a new tab Active Site Residues Participating in Transacylation—The first step in the condensing enzyme reaction is the transfer of the acyl group to the active site cysteine, and this activity was assayed by monitoring the transfer of the isotopic labeled acyl group from [1-14C]lauroyl-CoA to ACP via the acyl-enzyme intermediate. As expected, mutants lacking this critical cysteine were completely inactive in the transacylation step (Fig. 2C). In contrast, SpFabF[H337A], SpFabF[H303A], SpFabF[F396A], SpFabF[E346A], and SpFabF[K332A] all retained transacylation activity (Fig. 2C, Table 1), indicating that none of these residues were absolutely essential for transthioesterification. The transacylation assay can also detect accumulation of the [14C]acyl-enzyme intermediate, and this was only measurable for the SpFabF[K332A] mutant (not shown), indicating the removal of the conserved lysine either accelerated the rate of formation or reduced the rate of release of the acyl-enzyme intermediate. These results showed that the only active site residue required for transacylation was Cys164. The finding that the SpFabF[H337A] mutant had 12% the transacylation activity of wild-type (4.15 ± 0.46 pmol/μg/min) suggests that it has little influence on the ionization of the active site cysteine. Although His337 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of Cys164, its electronic state is inconsistent with a role for this residue in deprotonating the active site sulfhydryl. The Nδ nitrogen of His337 accepts a hydrogen bond from a backbone amide, meaning that the lone pair cannot be on the Nϵ nitrogen adjacent to Cys164 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the fixed electronic state of the histidine renders it unable to facilitate the abstraction of a proton from Cys164. Perhaps one could postulate a conformational change, but none of the many available structures give any hint of this. The cerulenin and thiolactomycin inhibitor structures (27Price A.C. Choi K.H.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6031-6034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) show that the Nϵ nitrogen of His337 donates a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl of the antibiotics, supporting the placement of the lone pair on Nδ rather than on the Nϵ adjacent to Cys164. In the related FabH condensing enzymes, this histidine is replaced by an asparagine residue, and the Oδ1 receives the same hydrogen bond from the backbone amide as does the Nδ nitrogen of His337, again placing the protonated nitrogen adjacent to the active site cysteine. Although there may be mechanistic differences between the FabH and FabB/F classes of condensing enzymes, the requirement to generate the thiolate is a common feature and is attributed to the strong helix dipole conserved between the two proteins rather than the histidine, which is not conserved (26Davies C.

Residues Participating in the Decarboxylation Step—The formation of acetyl-ACP from malonyl-ACP measures the ability of the enzymes to create the carbanion intermediate via the release of the C3 carboxyl group and occurs in the absence of an acyl-enzyme intermediate.

https://openalex.org/W2009801111,"Interleukin enhancer binding factor (ILF) is a human transcription factor and a new member of the winged helix/forkhead family. ILF can bind to purine-rich regulatory motifs such as the human T-cell leukemia virus-long terminal region and the interleukin-2 promoter. Here we report the 2.4 Å crystal structure of two DNA binding domains of ILF (FOXK1a) binding to a 16-bp DNA duplex containing a promoter sequence. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies demonstrate that two ILF-DNA binding domain molecules cooperatively bind to DNA. In addition to the recognition helix recognizing the core sequences through the major groove, the structure shows that wing 1 interacts with the minor groove of DNA, and the H2-H3 loop region makes ionic bonds to the phosphate group, which permits the recognition of DNA. The structure also reveals that the presence of the C-terminal α-helix in place of a typical wing 2 in a member of this family alters the orientation of the C-terminal basic residues (RKRRPR) when binding to DNA outside the core sequence. These results provide a new insight into how the DNA binding specificities of winged helix/forkhead proteins may be regulated by their less conserved regions."

Helix 69 (H69) (position 1906-1924), a highly conserved stem-loop in domain IV of the 23 S rRNA of bacterial 50 S subunits, is located on the surface for intersubunit association with the 30 S subunit by connecting with helix 44 of 16 S rRNA with the bridge B2a. H69 directly interacts with A/T-, A-, and P-site tRNAs during each translation step. To investigate the functional importance of the highly conserved loop sequence (1912-1918) of H69, we employed a genetic method that we named SSER (systematic selection of functional sequences by enforced replacement). This method allowed us to identify and select from the randomized loop sequences of H69 in Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA functional sequences that are absolutely required for ribosomal function. From a library consisting of 16,384 sequence variations, 13 functional variants were obtained. A1912 and U(Ψ)1917 were selected as essential residues in all variants. An E. coli strain having 23 S rRNA with a U to A mutation at position 1915 showed a severe growth phenotype and low translational fidelity. The result could be explained by the fact that the A1915-ribosome variant has weak subunit association, weak A-site tRNA binding, and decreased translational activity. This study proposes that H69 plays an important role in the control of translational fidelity by modulating A-site tRNA binding during the decoding process.

Ribosomes translate the genetic information contained in mRNAs into proteins. The large (50 S) subunit of the ribosome catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between the aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) 3The abbreviations used are: aa-tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA; SSER, systematic selection of functional sequences by enforced replacement; CMC, N-cyclohexyl-N′-β-(4-methylmorpholinium)ethylcarbodiimide p-tosylate); SDG, sucrose density gradient; TC, tight-coupled ribosome; Ψ, pseudouridine; m3Ψ, 3-methylpseudouridine; EF, elongation factor; H69, helix 69; Spc, spectinomycin; Amp, ampicillin; Km, kanamycin; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. bound to the A-site and the peptidyl-tRNA at the P-site. This peptide bond formation takes place at the peptidyltransferase center of the 50 S subunit. Codon-anticodon pairing occurs at the decoding center of the small (30 S) subunit. The aa-tRNA is delivered to the ribosome as a ternary complex of aa-tRNA, EF-Tu, and GTP. Cognate codon recognition is strictly monitored by 16 S rRNA and triggers GTP hydrolysis and dissociation of EF-Tu. This allows aa-tRNA to be accommodated by the A site of the 50 S subunit. Thus, accuracy of protein synthesis is based on the synergistic interplay of the large and small subunits of the ribosome. However, mechanistic insights into the ribosome dynamics during decoding are still rudimentary. The intersubunit bridges of the ribosome are functional sites that are not only necessary for subunit connection but also play roles in translation. Helix 69 (H69) (position 1906-1924) is a highly conserved stem-loop in domain IV of 23 S rRNA of the bacterial 50 S subunit (Fig. 1A). In fact, each base in the loop of H69 shows more than 98% conservation in 436 bacterial rRNAs (www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu). Crystallographic studies revealed that H69 is located on the surface involved in intersubunit association with the 30 S subunit by connecting with helix 44 (h44) of 16 S rRNA forming the bridge B2a; A1912, A1913, A1914, A1918 and A1919 in H69 make contact with positions 1407-1410 and 1494-1495 in h44 and G1517 in h45 (1Yusupov M.M.

In the free 50 S subunit, H69 makes a compact structure and interacts with H71 of 23 S rRNA (3Harms J. Schluenzen F. Zarivach R. Bashan A. Gat S. Agmon I. Bartels H. Franceschi F. Yonath A.

The tip of H69 moves about 13.5 Å during this structural change. In addition, H69 directly interacts with A/T-, A-, and P-site tRNAs during each translation step (1Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H. Noller H.F. Science. 2001; 292: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). During the decoding step, aa-tRNA is brought into the A/T-site as a complex with EF-Tu/GTP (ternary complex). Cryoelectron microscopy analyses showed a kinked conformation for aa-tRNA at the A/T state (molecular spring) (4Valle M. Zavialov A. Li W. Stagg S.M. Sengupta J. Nielsen R.C. Nissen P. Harvey S.C.

This interaction is supposed to facilitate the structural distortion of tRNA that enables the anticodon-stem to fit into the decoding center of 16 S rRNA. In the crystal structure of the 70 S ribosome complexed to both A- and P-site tRNAs, H69 is positioned between the two tRNAs (1Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Z. Baucom A. Lieberman K. Earnest T.N. Cate J.H.

The minor groove of H69 (positions 1908-1909, 1922-1923) interacts with the minor groove of the D-stem of the P-site tRNA (positions 12-13, 25-26) (Fig. 1B), whereas the conserved loop (positions 1913-1915) of H69 makes a contact with the D-stem of A-site tRNA (positions 11-12 and 25-26) (Fig. 1B). Moreover, it has been reported that H69 interacts with various translational factors. In the post-translocational state, H69 is proximal to EF-G (6Agrawal R.K. Spahn C.M. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A.

Chemical footprinting analysis revealed that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of IF3 binds to h44 in 16 S rRNA, which is the site of bridge B2a, indicating that CTD of IF3 mimics H69 to protect subunit association during translation initiation (7Dallas A.

S. Sato, N. Hirabayashi, and T. Suzuki, submitted for publication. This method allowed us to identify the residues absolutely essential for ribosomal function in Escherichia coli cells from a randomized rRNA library. The library was constructed by completely randomizing the loop sequence of H69 (Fig. 1B). The variants were then subjected to selection, and the selected variants were sequenced. The selected variants contained natural rRNA sequences from other organisms as well as unnatural but nonetheless functional sequences. The results throw new light on the nature of the bases required for H69 function. Biochemical and genetic analysis of H69 variants provide insights into the functional roles played by H69 in translation. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Cultivation—E. coli Δ7rrn strain TA542 (ΔrrnE ΔrrnB ΔrrnA ΔrrnH ΔrrnG::cat ΔrrnC::cat ΔrrnD::cat ΔrecA56/pTRNA66 pHKrrnC) (14Asai T. Zaporojets D. Squires C.

The rescue plasmid pRB1014 was constructed by introducing the sacB gene and rrnB operon into pMW118 (Ampr) (Nippon gene). The plasmid pRB1024 was constructed from pMW218 (Kmr) (Nippon gene) by inserting the rrnB operon only. The plasmid pHKrrnC in strain TA542 was replaced by pRB101 to generate strain NT101, which was used as the host cell for SSER selection and B-scan analysis. Cells were grown at 37 °C in 2× Luria-Bertani medium. For solid medium, 1.5% agar was added to LB medium. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations when required: 40 μg/ml spectinomycin (Spc), 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Amp), and 50 μg/ml kanamycin (Km). To induce plasmid replacement in NT101, 5% sucrose was added to the LB medium. NT102 is an E. coli strain series that harbors pRB102 or its derivatives instead of pRB101. The growth rates of the NT102 variants were determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm every 15 min using a plate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc.). Construction of the Plasmid Library of 23 S rRNA Randomized at Position H69—G1910-C1920 of H69 in 23 S rRNA (Fig. 1B) encoded in pRB102 was flipped by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions using a set of primers C1910-G1920F (5′-cggcggccctaactataagggtcctaaggtagcg-3′) and C1910-G1920R (5′-ccttaggacccttatagttagggccgccgtttaccgggg-3′). This resulted in the construction of pRB102-(C1910-G1920), which was used as a template for PCR randomization to distinguish the selected variants from contamination of the template plasmid after SSER. The resulting plasmid was checked to ensure that the mutations did not confer dominant lethality by introducing it into NT101 (by the process described below). pRB102-(C1910-G1920) was hypermethylated by DNA methyltransferases, M-AluI, M-HaeIII, and M-HapII (Takara BIO, Inc.) as described 4N. S. Sato, N. Hirabayashi, and T. Suzuki, submitted for publication. and employed as a template for PCR randomization to reduce the background for SSER selection. In the first PCR, a set of primers complementary to sequences just outside the target sequence, gap-F (5′-ggtcctaaggtagcgaaattccttgtcggg-3′) and gap-R (5′-ggccgccgtttaccggggcttcgatcaag-3′), was employed to generate gapped pRB102. This enhances the efficiency of PCR randomization and reduces the background for SSER selection. The gapped pRB102-(C1910-G1920) was then gel-purified and used as a template for PCR randomization. The N primer (5′-gctaccttaggaccgtNNNNNNNacggccgccgtttaccgggg-3′) and the gap-F primer were employed to randomize seven bases in the loop of H69. 4N. S. Sato, N. Hirabayashi, and T. Suzuki, submitted for publication. C1910-G1920 mutations were changed back to the original sequence in this step. To obtain enough material for the randomized library, the reaction was performed in 56 tubes (total 2800 μl). After PCR, the reaction mixture was treated with DpnI (New England Biolabs) and λ exonuclease (New England Biolabs) to digest the template plasmid. The products were then cleaned up with QIA-Quik (Qiagen) and checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Unbiased distribution of four nucleotides at each randomized position was confirmed by direct sequencing of the plasmid library before selection. SSER Selection—Detailed procedure of SSER was described in Sato et al. 4N. S. Sato, N. Hirabayashi, and T. Suzuki, submitted for publication. NT101 was then transformed by the randomized library and spread onto LB plates (56 plates in total) containing Spc/Km. Transformants (896 colonies) were picked to make a suspension in LB broth and then spotted onto LB plates containing Spc/Km/sucrose to force plasmid replacement. When variants showing slow growth phenotypes were picked, their resulting cell suspensions were first spotted and cultivated on LB plates containing Spc/Km (instead of being spotted directly onto LB-sucrose plates) before transfer to LB-sucrose plates. Sucrose-resistant colonies (48 colonies) (NT102 variants) were then cultured in 2× LB broth to make mini-preps of plasmids for sequencing. To check for plasmid replacement, each transformant was spotted onto two LB plates containing Spc/Amp and Spc/Km/sucrose. No growth of the spotted cells on the Amp plate demonstrated complete plasmid replacement. Functional variants were sequenced by the ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). B-scan Analysis and Deletion-Insertion Mutations—To analyze the functional importance of the conserved loop of H69 (1912-1918), we replaced these positions with the other three bases by QuikChange site-directed PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene) using a set of mixed primers. Thus, if the targeted position has A, G, C, or T, it was replaced with B (G, C, and T), H (A, C, and T), D (A, G, and T) or V (A, G, and C), respectively. The primer sets employed were B1912F (5′-ccggtaaacggcggccgtBactataacggtcctaagg-3′ and B1912R (5′-ccttaggaccgttatagtVacggccgccgtttaccgg-3′), B1913F (5′-cggtaaacggcggccgtaBctataacggtcctaaggtagc-3′) and B1913R (5′-gctaccttaggaccgttatagVtacggccgccgtttacc-3′), D1914F (5′-ggtaaacggcggccgtaaDtataacggtcctaaggtagc-3′) and D1914R (5′-gctaccttaggaccgttataHttacggccgccgtttacc-3′), V1915F (5′-gtaaacggcggccgtaacVataacggtcctaaggtagc-3′) and V1915R (5′-gctaccttaggaccgttatBgttacggccgccgtttac-3′), B1916F (5′-gtaaacggcggccgtaactBtaacggtcctaaggtagc-3′) and B1916R (5′-gctaccttaggaccgttaVagttacggccgccgtttac-3′), V1917F (5′-gtaaacggcggccgtaactaVaacggtcctaaggtagc-3′) and V1917R (5′-gctaccttaggaccgttBtagttacggccgccgtttac-3′), B1918F (5′-gtaaacggcggccgtaactatBacggtcctaaggtagcg-3′) and B1918R (5′-cgctaccttaggaccgtVatagttacggccgccgttta-3′). The primer sets for deletion and insertion mutations are Δ1913F (5′-cggtaaacggcggccgtactataacggtcctaaggtagc-3′) and Δ1913R (5′-gctaccttaggaccgttatagtacggccgccgtttacc-3′), Δ1916F (5′-gtaaacggcggccgtaacttaacggtcctaaggtagc-3′) and Δ1916R (5′-gctaccttaggaccgttaagttacggccgccgtttac-3′), Δ(1910-1920)F (5′-cggcggcctaactataaggtcctaaggtagcg-3′) and Δ(1910-1920)R (5′-ccttaggaccttatagttaggccgccgtttaccgggg-3′), insN1913-4F (5′-ggtaaacggcggccgtaaNctataacggtcctaaggtagc-3′) and insN1913-4R (5′-gctaccttaggaccgttatagNttacggccgccgtttacc-3′). As with the SSER method, the resulting pRB102-derived library bearing mutations at each position was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and then introduced into NT101. Functional variants were selected on sucrose plates and sequenced. If the target base was essential for ribosomal function, no variants could be obtained. Subunit Association—NT102 of each variant was cultured in 50 ml of 2× LB medium until 0.5 A600 and harvested. The cultured cells were dissolved in RBS buffer (20 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.6), 30 mm NH4Cl, 6 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) with 0.75 mg/ml lysozyme. After freeze-thawing by liquid N2, 200 μl of the lysate was loaded onto a 10-40% (w/v) sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 14 h at 20,000 rpm in a SW28 rotor. As for Mg2+ titration in Fig. 2B, Mg2+ concentration was adjusted with RBS buffer (6, 10, and 15 mm). Sucrose density gradient (SDG) centrifugation profiles of ribosomal subunits were monitored by using a Bio-mini UV monitor (ATTO, Japan). Translational Fidelity Measured by β-Galactosidase Activity—The mobile plasmid pNT3-lacZ (Ampr) (kindly provided by Dr. Akiko Nishimura) (15Saka K. Tadenuma M. Nakade S. Tanaka N. Sugawara H. Nishikawa K. Ichiyoshi N. Kitagawa M. Mori H. Ogasawara N. Nishimura A. DNA Res. 2005; 12: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was employed to construct a series of lacZ reporters for measuring the recoding activities of ribosome variants. Windows of test sequences for frameshift or read-though were introduced at the beginning of the lacZ open reading frame in pNT3-lacZ. The resultant plasmids pNT3-lacZ (+1), pNT3-lacZ (-1), pNT3-lacZ (UGA), and pNT3-lacZ (UAG) were used to measure +1 or -1 frameshift and UGA or UAG stop codon read-through, respectively. E. coli JA200 (F+ Δ(trpE)5 recA thr-1 leu-6 lacY thigal xyl ara mtl), which was used as a donor strain for plasmid transfer, was transformed with each reporter plasmid. Each E. coli NT102 bearing a pRB102 with a H69 variation was mated with the donor strain harboring each of the lacZ reporter plasmids transferred through the pilus during conjugation (15Saka K. Tadenuma M. Nakade S. Tanaka N. Sugawara H. Nishikawa K. Ichiyoshi N. Kitagawa M. Mori H. Ogasawara N. Nishimura A. DNA Res. 2005; 12: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For mating, precultured JA200-pNT-lacZ (10 μl) and NT102 (10 μl) were mixed and diluted in 200 μl of 2× LB without antibiotics. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, NT102 harboring the pNT-lacZ reporter was selected on LB plates containing Spc, Km, Amp, and 5% sucrose. Single colonies were grown to confluence, diluted (1:30) into fresh medium, and cultured at 37 °C until logarithmic phase; the cells were harvested at 0.5 A600. The β-galactosidase assay was performed according to Miller (16Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. 1992; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY): 72-74Google Scholar). A detailed description for this method will be published elsewhere. Preparation of Ribosomes and Elongation Factors—Ribosomes were prepared from variant strains as described (17Spedding G. Isolation and Analysis of Ribosomes from Prokaryotes, Eukaryotes, and Organelles, Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis, A Practical Approach. 1990; (Oxford University Press, New York): 1-30Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Each E. coli strain grown up to 0.5 A600 was harvested, ground with Al2O3, then dissolved in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 30 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm Mg(Ac)2,and 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The lysate was subjected to ultracentrifugation to obtain the crude ribosome. 70 S tight-coupled (TC) ribosomes were then purified from the crude ribosome preparation by 14-16 h of ultracentrifugation in a 6-38% (w/v) SDG as described (18Hanada T. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Takemoto-Hori C. Sprinzl M. Watanabe K. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 1019-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recombinant elongation factors were prepared as described (19Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). Poly(U)-programmed Polyphenylalanine Synthesis—In vitro translation was performed at 37 °C in 80 μl of reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm KCl, 6.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml poly(U), 0.1 mm spermine, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvic acid, 2.5 unit/ml pyruvate kinase, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.6 μm E. coli EF-Tu, 0.6 μm E. coli EF-G, 0.15 μm E. coli EF-Ts, 0.075 μm 70 S ribosome, and 0.15 μm [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe. 10 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto filtration paper (Whatman No. 3MM) every minute. Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble product was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (ALOKA) after Phe-tRNAPhe deacylation by heating at 80 °C for 30 min. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4B, the concentration of [14C]Phe-tRNAphe ranged from 0 to 0.9 μm. Amounts of [14C]Phe incorporated in 10 μl of the reaction mixture at 6 min were plotted. tRNA Binding to A and P Sites—For P-site tRNA binding (Fig. 5A), 12.5 pmol of 70 S ribosome, 2.5 pmol of Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe, and 2.5 μg of poly(U) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6.5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm spermine were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. An aliquot was then spotted onto a nitrocellulose filter (Advantec) and washed with 5 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6.5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm spermine). Ac-[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe bound on the P-site was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (ALOKA). Concerning A-site tRNA binding (Fig. 5B), the P-site of the ribosome was occupied by deacyl-tRNAPhe in a mixture (10 μl) consisting of 5 pmol of E. coli 70 S TC ribosome, 2 μg of poly(U), 10 pmol of E. coli tRNAPhe, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6.5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm spermine, which was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Then 10 μl of aa-tRNA mixture consisting of 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvic acid, 2.5 unit/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mm GTP, 10 pmol of [14C]Phe-tRNAPhe, and 12.5 pmol of E. coli EF-Tu was added to the ribosome mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The following step was as described above. Primer Extension Analysis to Detect Post-transcriptional Modifications in 23 S rRNA—Isolation of total RNA and primer extension to detect pseudouridine (Ψ) were performed basically as described (20Ofengand J. Del Campo M. Kaya Y. Methods. 2001; 25: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Dried total RNA (4 μg) of each strain was dissolved in 30 μl of CMC solution (0.17 m N-cyclohexyl-N′-β-(4-methylmorpholinium)ethylcarbodiimide p-tosylate (CMC), 7 m urea, 50 mm Bicine, and 4 mm EDTA) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Stop solution (100 μl) consisting of 0.3 m NaOAc (pH 5.6) and 0.1 m EDTA was added to the reaction mixture, then 700 μl of EtOH was added to precipitate the RNA. After rinsing twice with 70% EtOH, the pellet was dissolved in 40 μl of 50 mm Na2CO3 (pH 10.4) at 37 °C for 4 h. After EtOH precipitation, it was dissolved in 10 μl of double-distilled dH2O. 5′-32P-Labeled primer, 5′-aatttcgctaccttaggaccg-3′, complementary to positions 1920-1940 in 23 S rRNA was used for the primer extension. SuperScript III RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used for reverse transcription. The cDNAs resolved on 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea was detected by fluoroimager (FLA-7000; Fujifilm). Comprehensive Genetic Selection of Functional Sequences of the H69 Loop in 23 S rRNA—To analyze the functional importance of the highly conserved loop sequence of H69 in 23 S rRNA, we employed our new genetic method (SSER).4 This system allows us to rapidly identify functional sequences in the cell among randomized sequences. Seven bases (1912-1918) in the loop of H69 in 23 S rRNA were completely randomized on pRB102 by a PCR-based method to construct a plasmid library with 16,384 sequence variations (Fig. 1B). Then we carried out large scale transformation of E. coli NT101 with each member of the library and selected for kanamycin-resistant transformants. If the incorporated plasmid had a toxic sequence that resulted in a dominant lethal pheno-type, a transformant would not be obtained. Because H69 is a critical site for ribosomal function, most of the sequences in the library must have been excluded during this step. Transformants on the kanamycin plate showed different colony sizes (data not shown), indicating that each cell contains a sequence that results in altered ribosomal activity. The kanamycin-resistant cells contain both pRB101 and pRB102 from the library. To drive plasmid replacement, each cell was picked and spotted onto selection plates containing kanamycin and sucrose. If the incorporated pRB102 plasmid had a functional sequence for ribosomal activity, it rapidly eliminated the pRB101 rescue plasmid, thus yielding sucrose-resistant cells (NT102 derivatives) because these two plasmids share the same replicon and are, thus, incompatible. Besides, if the incorporated plasmid had a non-functional or very weak functional sequence for ribosomal activity, the rescue plasmid could not be replaced by the introduced plasmid and the transformant became sensitive to sucrose due to the sacB gene. About 900 colonies on kanamycin plates were picked and spotted onto sucrose plates. The functional sequences of the H69 loop in pRB102 from the sucrose-resistant cells (NT102) were sequenced. Despite the high conservation of H69-loop sequence, 13 functional variants were obtained (Table 1). A1912 and U1917 were completely conserved in all of the selected variants. This confirms that A1912 and U1917 are essential residues for ribosomal function. AACUAUA (variant 1), which is the original sequence of E. coli 23 S rRNA as well as the conserved sequences in bacterial, archaebacterial, and eukaryotic rRNAs, was actually selected from 16,384 sequence variations. An A1913G variation was found in variants 7 and 12. G1913 is a naturally occurring variation found in Streptomyces galbus and Streptomyces mashuensis. C1914 could be replaced with A or G, although C1914 is completely conserved in bacterial and archaebacterial rRNAs. A1915 and C1915 were selected as functional variations. In fact, A1915 and C1915 are found in rRNAs from Wolbachieae and Aerophrum (Archaea), respectively. A1916 was found to be replaceable by any of three other bases. C1916 is a naturally occurring variation found in Wolbachieae, Staphylococcus piscifermentans, and Crenarchaeota (Archaea). A1918G variation was found in variants 6, 9, and 13. G1918 is a conserved base in eukaryotic rRNAs. In addition, G1918 is a natural variation found in some bacterial and archaebacterial rRNAs. Thus, the consensus sequence of the H69 loop was ARVHNUR (Table 1). 5The nomenclature for mixed bases used in this study obey the rules previously established in the literature (13Cornish-Bowden A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3021-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), namely, R is A or G, Y is U or C, B is all bases except A, D is all bases except C, H is all bases except G, V is all bases except U, and N is all bases (A, U, G, or C). TABLE 1Functional sequences (1912-1918) in the H69 loop of E. coli 23 S rRNA as selected by SSER from randomized rRNA libraries Invariant or semiconserved residues selected in this study are shown in red or orange respectively. A1915 is colored blue. RNA modifications are ignored. The nomenclature used for the mixed bases obeys the rules previously established in the literature (13Cornish-Bowden A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3021-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Relative growth rate (RGR) was obtained by calculating the ratio of the doubling time of the mutant to that of the wild type. Consensus sequences of SSER and B-scan analysis are shown in the bottom. Open table in a new tab To confirm this result, we adopted another method to test the essentiality of each base of the H69 loop for ribosomal function. Each nucleotide position was replaced with any of three other bases by PCR mutagenesis using a mixed primer. In other words, if the target position was A, it was"

We have performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments in mammalian cells transfected with fluorophore-bearing ADAR1 and ADAR2 fusion proteins to investigate the relationship between these proteins. These studies conclusively demonstrate the homodimerization of ADAR1 and ADAR2 and also show that ADAR1 and ADAR2 form heterodimers in human cells.

Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) 2The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ADAR, adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.2The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ADAR, adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. in eukaryotes are subject to a variety of processing reactions, including cleavage by the RNase III family members Drosha and Dicer in the micro RNA and small interfering RNA gene-silencing pathways and editing by members of the ADAR (adenosone deaminase that acts on RNA) enzyme family (1Carmell M.A. Hannon G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 2Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). This latter reaction involves the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) within the context of dsRNA. Editing events of this type have been demonstrated in both cellular and viral transcripts and have been shown to function in altering the coding properties of the edited RNAs. For example, the life cycle of the Hepatitis δ virus is regulated by an editing event in the anti-genome in which a UAG stop codon is converted to a UIG tryptophan codon (3Polson A.G. Bass B.L. Casey J.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). An A to I modification is involved in the functional regulation of a growing number of cellular factors. These include the tissue-specific editing of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor, which results in a reduction in response to serotonin agonists (4Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Transcripts for subunits of the neural-specific AMPA class of glutamate-gated (GluR) ion channels undergo A to I modification at two positions, the Q/R and R/G editing sites, that affect the properties of the resulting channels (5Sommer B. Kohler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 6Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Hoger T. Geiger J.R. Kuner T. Monyer H. Higuchi M. Bach A. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In addition to the editing of these and other neuronal transcripts to effect codon changes, one deaminase family member, ADAR2, has been shown to autoregulate its own expression by the creation of a 3′-splice site (CAA to CAI) (7Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of these editing substrates, the global role of A to I modification in higher eukaryotes remains unclear. Measurement of inosine levels in RNA isolated from rat tissue suggests a greater level of editing than indicated by known RNA substrates (8Paul M.S. Bass B.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A cloning protocol that depended upon an inosine-specific cleavage of RNA detected a large number of editing sites in non-coding regions of RNAs from Caenorhabditis elegans and humans that included sites in 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and introns (9Morse D.P. Bass B.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8429-8434Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recent bioinformatic studies have suggested the presence of more than 12,000 editing sites corresponding to non-coding regions of the human genome (10Athanasiadis A. Rich A. Maas S. PLoS. Biol. 2004; 2: 1-15Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 11Blow M. Futreal P.A. Wooster R. Stratton M.R. (2004) Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2379-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12Kim D.D.

The importance of editing in development has been demonstrated by studies showing that deletion of ADAR1 is an embryonic lethal event in mice; fibroblasts derived from ADAR1–/– embryos are subject to stress-induced apoptosis (14Wang Q.

Finally, it has been suggested that A to I modification antagonizes RNA interference: editing could regulate endogenous micro RNA mediated gene silencing or limit RNA interference resulting from nonspecific antisense transcription (15Tonkin L.A. Bass B.L. Science. 2003; 302: 1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Kent O.A. MacMillan A.M. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004; 2: 1957-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17DeCerbo J. Carmichael G.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).One difficulty in identifying the biological targets and, hence, roles of A to I editing is that little is understood about the sequence determinants for editing of known substrates beyond the fact that editing sites are found within dsRNAs. The first RNA deaminase to be cloned, ADAR1 (18Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1988; 55: 1089-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar); subsequently, this unwinding activity was correlated with deamination of A to I within these RNAs (25Polson A.G. Crain P.F. Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. Bass B.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11507-11514Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Constitutively expressed ADAR1 is a 110-kDa nuclear protein that contains three N-terminal double-stranded RNA binding domains, a C-terminal deaminase domain, and one N-terminal Z-DNA binding domain. ADAR1 exhibited low deaminase activity with a number of specific substrates, including the Q/R site of the GluR-B pre-mRNA, but has been shown to efficiently edit the R/G site of GluR-B as well as the anti-genome of Hepatitis δ virus (3Polson A.G.

Screening of a rat hippocampal cDNA library with probes complementary to the deaminase domain of ADAR1 resulted in the cloning of ADAR2 deaminase (29Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The shorter of two isoforms, ADAR2a, is an ∼80-kDa protein containing two N-terminal double-stranded RNA binding domains as well as a C-terminal deaminase domain (30Gerber A. O'Connell M.A. Keller W. RNA. 1997; 3: 453-463PubMed Google Scholar). ADAR2a (henceforth ADAR2) has been shown to efficiently edit both the Q/R and R/G sites of the GluR-B transcript and, in contrast to ADAR1, does not exhibit activity at a position within intron 11 of GluR-B (29Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). ADAR1 and ADAR2 are both expressed ubiquitously, although ADAR2 is enriched in the brain.During a study of the in vitro editing of the GluR-B R/G site by ADAR2, we observed that efficient editing required dimerization of the enzyme on the RNA substrate (31Jaikaran D.C. Collins C.H. MacMillan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37624-37629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on a combination of kinetic and gel mobility shift analyses as well as RNA-dependent ADAR2·ADAR2 cross-linking. Subsequently, it was reported that recombinant, tagged human ADAR1 and ADAR2 could be purified as RNA-independent homodimers from Sf9 cells (32Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17093-17102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). At the same time, O'Connell and co-workers (33Gallo A. Keegan L.P. Ring G.M. O'Connell M.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) found that the Drosophila ADAR dimerized in an RNA-dependent fashion and that this self-association was required for editing.The fact that specific non-neural substrates have not been identified for either ADAR1 or ADAR2, despite the ubiquitous expression profile of these enzymes in all tissue types, coupled with a possible RNA dependence of their dimerization complicates study of ADAR self-association. We therefore decided to create fusion proteins of both ADAR family members with cyan and yellow fluorescent protein (CFP and YFP) and probe their association by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in human cells (34Bastiaens P.I. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Soling H.D. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we have been able to observe both homo- and heterodimerization of ADAR1 and ADAR2 in HeLa cells. The results of RNase treatment before FRET measurement suggest that homodimerization of ADAR1 and ADAR2 as well as heterodimerization are independent of RNA binding. Homo- and heterodimerization of ADAR family members, most likely in association with other cellular proteins, probably represent critical regulatory mechanisms governing A to I editing in mammalian cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMammalian Expression Constructs—Human ADAR1 p110 was amplified by PCR from pJEL/hADAR1/H6 using primers containing HindIII and BamHI restriction sites. Human ADAR2 was PCR amplified from a previously described template (31Jaikaran D.C. Collins C.H. MacMillan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37624-37629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using primers containing EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. ADAR1 and ADAR2 were then inserted into pEYFP-C1, pEYFP-N1, pECFP-C1, and pECFP-N1 (Clontech) using the appropriate restriction enzymes. Plasmids were transformed into chemically competent DH5α Escherichia coli, amplified, and purified using a plasmid mini-prep kit (Sigma).Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells (2 × 105) were plated on 25-mm coverslips (Fisher Scientific) in six-well tissue culture dishes and were allowed to adhere for 24 h. The cells were transiently transfected with 1–5 μg of plasmid DNA using Perfectin (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol and analyzed 20–24 h post-transfection. To examine the RNA dependence of localization and ADAR association, HeLa cells transfected with 1–5 μg of plasmid DNA were permeabilized in Gal-Screen Buffer B (Applied Biosystems) for 10 min. They were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before being treated with an RNase mixture (RNase A, 200 μg/μl; RNase T1, 100 units/μl; RNase V1, 0.5 units/μl) for 30 min.Fluorescence Microscopy—Transiently transfected cells on coverslips were rinsed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 15 min in freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde (Sigma) at room temperature. Coverslips were washed a further three times in phosphate-buffered saline before being mounted onto slides using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were collected with a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 NLO Meat) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope with a ×40 F-fluar lens (N.A. 1.3) equipped with four visible lasers with five laser lines and a spectral Meta detector. The 458- and 514-nm laser lines (emitted from a 25-milliwatt argon laser) were used to image CFP and YFP. Band pass filters of 462–484 and 580–612 nm were used in collecting emission from CFP and YFP, respectively.Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—FRET experiments were performed on fixed cells using the donor recovery after acceptor photobleach method (34Bastiaens P.I. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Soling H.D. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). First, images were obtained in the CFP and YFP channels and the intensities of the signals were calculated. YFP was then selectively photobleached at 514 nm in a defined region of the cell. A second set of images was then obtained using the same conditions as prior to photobleaching. FRET efficiency was calculated as shown in Equation 1FRET efficiency=(Dpost−Bpost)−(Dpre−Bpre)(Dpost−Bpost)(Eq. 1) where D is the donor channel intensity, B is the background intensity, and “pre” and “post” indicate measurements before and after photobleaching. A non-bleached area of the same cell served as an internal control.RESULTSCellular Localization of ADAR1 and ADAR2 Fluorescent Fusion Proteins—To examine both cellular localization and associations of ADAR1 and ADAR2 by fluorescence, we cloned the cDNA for human ADAR1 and ADAR2 into the mammalian expression vectors ECFP and EYFP to produce ADAR fusion proteins with N-terminal CFP and YFP under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. We also prepared expression constructs with CFP C-terminal to the deaminase sequence in order to be able to probe for directionality in any observed association.Previous studies have revealed a dynamic association of ADAR1 and ADAR2 with the nucleolus; ADAR2 shuttles between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm, whereas ADAR1 shuttles between the nucleolus, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm (an interferon-inducible form of ADAR1 is cytoplasmic) (35Sansam C.L.

We determined the localization of the N-terminal CFP ADAR fusion proteins in transfected HeLa cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy and observed, as expected, a predominantly nucleolar localization for these proteins (Fig. 1). Identical results were achieved using either C-terminal CFP or N-terminal YFP expression systems (data not shown).Homo- and Heterodimerization of ADAR1 and ADAR2—Having established the nucleolar localization of the fluorescently tagged ADAR1 and ADAR2, we performed co-transfections of HeLa cells using expression vectors for N-terminal CFP/YFP ADAR1 together and CFP/YFP ADAR2 together as well as control transfections with plasmids expressing CFP and YFP alone. A FRET experiment in this system involves the direct or indirect measurement, using fluorescence, of energy transfer between CFP and YFP following specific excitation of the CFP fluorophore. To simplify analysis, FRET signals were quantified by measurement of donor recovery following photobleaching. Briefly, CFP fluorescence was measured at 475 nm, following excitation at 458 nm with a laser, both before and after specific photobleaching of YFP. The increase in CFP fluorescence after YFP photobleaching corresponds to the original amount of energy transferred from CFP to YFP; thus, the difference in CFP fluorescence prior to and after photobleaching corresponds to the level of FRET. Using this method, we were not able to measure any FRET between CFP and YFP alone. However, when N-terminal CFP ADAR1 was excited in the presence of N-terminal YFP ADAR1, we measured a FRET efficiency, between the fusion proteins localized to the nucleolus, of 18% (Fig. 2, A and B; Table 1). For comparison, in a system expressing tandem CFP·YFP joined by a short 10-amino acid linker, FRET efficiencies of 35% were measured (data not shown). When we analyzed cells transfected with N-terminal CFP ADAR2 and N-terminal YFP ADAR2, we were able to measure FRET efficiencies of 19% within the nucleolus (Fig. 2, C and D; Table 1). Thus, as assayed by FRET, both ADAR1 and ADAR2 form homodimers in the nucleolus.FIGURE 2Homodimerization of ADAR1 and ADAR2.

Because the FRET signal varies with r6 (38Förster T. Ann. Physik. 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4843) Google Scholar), we reasoned that measurements made with the fluorophores in different orientations might yield information on the disposition of the ADAR monomers with respect to one another. However, FRET levels measured using these expression constructs were essentially the same as observed in our initial experiment (data not shown). Thus, the FRET experiment does not reveal the orientation of individual ADAR proteins with respect to one another in the dimer.After determining that ADAR1 and ADAR2 form homodimers within the cell, we wanted to examine the possibility of heterodimerization between isoforms. We performed co-transfections in HeLa cells using N-terminal CFP ADAR2 and N-terminal YFP ADAR1. Both isoforms localized to identical nucleoli within the cells, and we were again able to measure a FRET signal between the two nucleolar-localized fusion proteins (Fig. 3; Table 1). The amount of FRET observed between ADAR1 and ADAR2 was 12%, which is consistent with the formation of ADAR heterodimers in the nucleolus. Again, no difference in FRET signal was measured when co-transfecting N-terminal CFP ADAR2 and C-terminal YFP ADAR1; therefore, an orientation of dimerization was impossible to determine.FIGURE 3Heterodimerization of ADAR1 and ADAR2.

O'Connell M.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Indeed, studies of ADAR dimerization are complicated by the fact that the endogenous RNA substrates for ADAR1 and for ADAR2 in most cells are unknown. The results of our FRET experiments suggest that ADAR1 and ADAR2 form both homo- and heterodimers in the nucleolus; we also wished to examine whether disruption of RNA binding by ADAR1 or ADAR2 affected cellular localization and formation of homo- or heterodimers. Emeson and co-workers (35Sansam C.L. Wells K.S. Emeson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14018-14023Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) previously noted that ADAR2 localization to the nucleolus was dependent on rRNA synthesis and was also abolished upon RNase treatment of cells. We therefore decided to examine the RNA dependence of ADAR self-association by RNase treatment of cells expressing the fluorescent fusion proteins.We repeated transient transfections, as described above, to yield cells expressing combinations of CFP/YFP ADAR1 and CFP/YFP ADAR2. Transfected cells were permeabilized and treated with a mixture of RNases before being examined to determine the cellular localization of the fusion proteins. Consistent with earlier studies (35Sansam C.L. Wells K.S. Emeson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14018-14023Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), permeabilization of the cells did not affect ADAR localization, but subsequent treatment with RNase abolished the exclusive nucleolar localization of both fusion proteins that was now observed throughout the nucleus and to a small extent within the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, A and B; data not shown). In the case of RNase-treated cells co-expressing CFP ADAR2 and YFP ADAR1, although exclusive nucleolar localization was abolished the proteins remained co-localized (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4RNA-independent homo- and heterodimerization of ADAR family members.

FRET efficiencies similar to those observed in untreated cells were measured for ADAR1-, ADAR2-, and ADAR1/ADAR2-expressing cells (Fig. 4; Table 1). These results suggest that neither homonor heterodimerization of ADAR1/ADAR2 is dependent on RNA binding.A recent paper by Bass and co-workers (39Macbeth M.R. Schubert H.L. Vandemark A.P. Lingam A.T. Hill C.P. Bass B.L. Science. 2005; 309: 1534-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) reports the crystal structure of the deaminase domain of ADAR2 and suggests that dimerization is not mediated through this domain. We expressed CFP and YFP fusion proteins of the same deaminase construct (ADAR2-(299–701)) used in the structural studies in HeLa cells, determined their localization, and looked for evidence of FRET between the fluorophores. The deaminase fusion proteins did not localize to the nucleolus (instead showing a diffuse expression throughout the cell) and did not undergo FRET (data not shown). This supports the conclusion that dimerization is not mediated by the deaminase domain and previous suggestions from work with Drosophila ADAR that ADAR self-association is mediated by N-terminal regions of the protein (33Gallo A. Keegan L.P. Ring G.M. O'Connell M.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3421-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have examined the localization and association of human ADAR1 and ADAR2 in HeLa cell culture by transient expression of fluorescent fusion proteins followed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Our observations are in agreement with the previously reported primary localization of both ADAR1 and ADAR2 to the nucleolus. The FRET studies reported here also demonstrate that nucleolar ADAR1 and ADAR2 form both homo- and heterodimers. The observation of ADAR homodimerization is consistent with previous in vitro studies (31Jaikaran D.C. Collins C.H. MacMillan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37624-37629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol.

To examine the RNA dependence of ADAR localization and dimerization, we treated cells expressing the fluorescent fusions with RNase; this had the effect of abolishing the exclusive nucleolar localization of both proteins but did not affect FRET between them. Thus, as observed by Emeson and co-workers (35Sansam C.L. Wells"

In mice, both CLP preparations induced high-titered antibody responses against the homologous OspC variant, but with substantial cross-reactivity against the other variant. Importantly, both conferred protection to mice challenged with B. burgdorferi.

The c/e1 loop lends itself as an insertion site; however, both the N and C termini of an insert must fit to the geometry of the core acceptor sites (Fig. 1B), a requirement not easily be met by many natively folded proteins. In the green fluorescent protein (GFP), the first complete protein displayed on HBcAg CLPs (6Kratz P.A. Böttcher B. Nassal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1915-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the N and C termini are closely juxtaposed (24Ormo M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1392-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). By contrast, the termini of the outer surface protein A (OspA) of the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi (see below) are at opposite ends of the elongated structure (25Li H. Dunn J.J. Luft B.J. Lawson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3584-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), such that generation of a multimerization-competent fusion required very long connecting linkers (9Nassal M. Skamel C. Kratz P.A. Wallich R. Stehle T. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Less obvious but equally critical is the propensity of a candidate insert to undergo homomeric interactions. Dimerizing and tetramerizing color variants of GFP, though isostructural to GFP, failed to form CLPs; the key role of insert quaternary structure was demonstrated by successful CLP formation when engineered monomeric variants were used instead (8Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, monomerization may involve the exchange of many amino acids (e.g. 33 in the case of the monomeric red fluorescent protein) (26Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar) and thus not be suited for a protein to be used as a vaccine. Here we explored the possibility of generating HBcAg CLPs displaying a naturally dimeric whole protein antigen. The outer surface protein C (OspC) of B. burgdorferi appeared as an ideal model insert. OspCs are ∼210 aa in length, including an 18-aa signal peptide, cleavage of which exposes an N-terminal Cys residue for subsequent lipidation. The solved structures of three OspC variants (27Eicken C. Sharma V. Klabunde T. Owens R.T. Pikas D.S. Hook M. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10010-10015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Kumaran D. Eswaramoorthy S. Luft B.J. Koide S. Dunn J.J. Lawson C.L. Swaminathan S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) revealed, for the aa sequence encompassing ∼positions 40-200, a common mushroom-shaped dimeric structure with each monomer contributing half the stalk and half the head (Fig. 1A) and with all four termini protruding from the foot of the stalk at the start and the end, respectively, of long helices (α1 and α5). Though reminiscent of the four acceptor sites in the core protein dimer, the topology of the termini in the two dimers is different (Fig. 1, B and C). Hence, within one fusion protein dimer either the core parts or the OspC parts, but not both, could interact as in the unfused proteins. Successful CLP formation would therefore require substantial flexibility in either the carrier or the insert or not be possible at all. Second, OspC is of medical interest as a major surface antigen of Lyme disease-causing Borreliae. Lyme borreliosis, the most common vector-borne disease in Europe and the United States (for reviews see Refs. 29Auwaerter P.G. Aucott J. Dumler J.S. Expert Rev. Mol.

It is transmitted to humans by Ixodes ticks from animals, mostly rodents, infected with various strains of three species of Borrelia, in the U.S. mainly by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and in Europe by B. afzelii and B. garinii as well. Of the various outer surface proteins, OspA probably mediates colonization of the tick gut (32Pal U. Li X. Wang T. Montgomery R.R. Ramamoorthi N. Desilva A.M. Bao F. Yang X. Pypaert M. Pradhan D. Kantor F.S. Telford S. Anderson J.F. Fikrig E. Cell. 2004; 119: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), whereas OspC is crucial for infection of the mammalian host (33Grimm D. Tilly K. Byram R. Stewart P.E. Krum J.G. Bueschel D.M. Schwan T.G. Policastro P.F. Elias A.F. Rosa P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3142-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Hence, despite the substantial inter-strain and intra-strain variability of OspC (34Bunikis J. Garpmo U. Tsao J. Berglund J. Fish D. Barbour A.G. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1741-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 35Liang F.T. Yan J. Mbow M.L. Sviat S.L. Gilmore R.D. Mamula M. Fikrig E. Infect.

Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 831-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and consequently shared epitopes. Importantly, mouse models of Lyme disease are established that allow us to assess the capacity of a given vaccine formulation to induce neutralizing antibodies, which play the major role in clearing infection (39Connolly S.E. Benach J.L. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For instance, a recombinant glutathione S-transferase, OspC fusion protein (recGST-OspC), but not the same OspC protein after removal of the GST part (rec-OspC), induced antibodies with prophylactic, and upon passive transfer but not active immunization, also therapeutic potential (40Zhong W. Stehle T. Museteanu C. Siebers A. Gern L. Kramer M. Wallich R. Simon M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12533-12538Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 41Zhong W. Gern L. Stehle T. Museteanu C. Kramer M. Wallich R. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we generated fusions of the HBV core protein with two variants of OspC, termed OspCa and OspCb, that according to molecular modeling form the typical mushroom-like dimer structures but differ at 15 surface-exposed aa positions (Figs. 1A and 2B). We addressed their ability to form CLPs, looked into the structural consequences of the nonmatching dimeric insert structure by electron microscopy and image reconstruction, and monitored their immunogenicity and protective potential in the mouse model. Plasmids—The parental expression vector pET28a2-HBc149_H6 encodes the HBV core protein from aa 1 to 149 with a C-terminal His6 tag; in the context of similar fusions with color variants of GFP the tag increased the assembly efficiency (8Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The genes for OspCa and OspCb were isolated from a single B. burgdorferi ZS7-infected tick and cloned into the pGEX vector. 3R. Wallich, T. Stehle, C. Brenner, A. Siebers, L. Gern, and M. Simon, unpublished data. The GST fusion protein encoded by pGEX-OspCb, recGST-OspCb, served as control antigen in the immunization experiments; recombinant OspCb without the GST part was obtained by thrombin cleavage (41Zhong W. Gern L. Stehle T. Museteanu C. Kramer M. Wallich R. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using PCR primers OspC(+) GGAGCTCGAG.GAT.gga.ggg.ggt.ggt.acc.GGA.AAA.GAT.GGG.AAT.GCA and OspC(-), complementary to GTG.GCA.GAA.AGT.CCA.AAA.AAA.CCT.ggt.ggc.TCT.AGA.GTGTG (codons separated by dots, XhoI and XbaI cloning sites in underlined italics; linker codons Gly4-Thr, and Gly2 in lowercase), the genes for OspCa and OspCb, starting with codon Gly-23 and ending with the authentic C-terminal codon for Pro-211 (Gly-5 to Pro-193 in the mature protein) were amplified from the pGEX vectors and cloned into the parental HBcAg vector such that Pro-79 and Ala-80 were replaced (Fig. 2A). The new vectors were termed pET28a2-c149_OspCa_H6 and pET28a2-c149_OspCb_H6. Fusion Protein Expression and Purification—The pET vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21<DE> Codonplus RIL cells (Stratagene). Fusion protein expression was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside addition, and after shaking for 10 h at room temperature the cultures were harvested and cleared lysates were prepared as previously described (8Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To enrich for particles, the lysates were sedimented through 10-60% sucrose step gradients (8Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Aliquots from the gradient fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the Laemmli buffer system. Proteins were stained by Coomassie Blue, or the fusion proteins were detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against HBcAg (mAb158, recognizing a linear epitope around aa 130 of the core protein) (42Sällberg M. Ruden U. Wahren B. Noah M. Magnius L.O. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or a mAb against OspC (LA97.1) (43Kramer M.D. Schaible U.E. Wallich R. Moter S.E. Petzoldt D. Simon M.M. Immunobiology. 1990; 181: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). According to densitometric scanning of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel lanes, the fusion proteins in the center gradient fractions amounted to more than 90% of the total protein present, which was sufficiently pure for electron microscopy. For immunizations, the preparations were dialyzed (Slide-a-lyzer cassettes, 30-kDa molecular mass cutoff; Pierce), concentrated (Amicon Ultra devices, 30-kDa cutoff; Millipore), and subjected to a second round of sucrose gradient sedimentation. The center gradient fractions were pooled, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and concentrated to ∼0.75 mg/ml; purity as estimated by densitometric scanning was ∼94%. Electron Cryomicroscopy and Image Reconstruction—Samples were frozen as described (44Böttcher B. Crowther R.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Micrographs were taken under low dose conditions at a nominal magnification of 52,000 at a Philips CM 120 Biotwin operating at 100 kV and equipped with a LaB6 filament. For cryomicroscopy a Gatan cryoholder maintaining a temperature of 94 K was used. Micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO 163 film and scanned with a Zeiss Scai scanner with a step size of 21 μm/pixel corresponding to 4 Å at specimen level. From 5 micrographs a total of 407 small particle images were selected. Image processing was done with the IMAGIC 5 software package (45van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 46van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional reconstructions, single particle images were normalized in their gray value distribution, inverted in contrast, and centered by translational alignment to a rotationally averaged sum of all particles. Each particle was rotated by increments of 45° (0-315°), and the rotated particles were added to the data set enabling comparison. For accessing the local organization of OspC a segment of the outer rim of the particles (140 by 150 Å, including the edge of the HBc core shell and the peripheral density of the OspC layer) was analyzed where OspC is seen in side view projection and, due to the curvature, overlaps only a little with other features. The variation in density distribution in this segment was analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis, and particles were grouped according to their similarity. Particles in the same group were averaged, showing side view projections of OspC bound to the spikes. A three-dimensional icosahedral reconstruction approach is described in the supplemental material. Immunization of Mice—For generation of immune sera (IS), four adult female BALB/c mice (H-2d; bred under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Max-Planck-Institut für Immunbiologie, Freiburg, Germany) per construct were repeatedly immunized into the base of the tail with initially 30 μg and subsequently 10 μg of the respective recombinant proteins (coreOspCa, coreOspb, and recGST-OspCb) in the presence of 100 μl of MPL-TDM adjuvant (composed of monophosphoryl Lipid A and synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate; Sigma) and bled on the indicated days post-immunization. As control, IS was generated against wild-type core protein 1-149 following the same protocol. Prior to further analyses, the IS from each group of animals immunized with the same construct were pooled. OspC- and core protein-specific Ab in IS were quantified by a solid-phase ELISA as described (43Kramer M.D. Schaible U.E. Wallich R. Moter S.E. Petzoldt D. Simon M.M. Immunobiology. 1990; 181: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using 1 μg/ml of either recombinant OspCb or wild-type core protein 1-149 CLPs as substrate and mAb 97.1 or the core-specific mAb 312 (42Sällberg M. Ruden U. Wahren B. Noah M. Magnius L.O. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) as reference antibodies. Western blot analysis using recGST-OspCb as antigen (250 ng/lane) was done as described (47Simon M.M. Gern L. Hauser P. Zhong W. Nielsen P.J. Kramer M.D. Brenner C. Wallich R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2831-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Pooled preimmune sera from the same animals served as negative controls. Disease Model and Protection Experiments—Pools of IS to be used in protection experiments were collected from immunized BALB/c mice (groups of 3-4 mice) every 7-10 days for up to 93 days post-immunization starting after the third challenge. For passive immunization, three C.B-17 SCID mice (bred under specific pathogen-free conditions) were injected intraperitoneally with IS containing the equivalent of 10 μg of antibody specific for the individual recombinant protein or with the OspA-specific mAb LA-2 (5 μg/mouse) (43Kramer M.D. Schaible U.E. Wallich R. Moter S.E. Petzoldt D. Simon M.M. Immunobiology. 1990; 181: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and challenged experimentally (subcutaneously) with 103 spirochetes (strain ZS7)/mouse 2 h later. Control mice received either anti-wild-type core IS (30 μg of specific antibody), normal mouse serum, or PBS (300 μl each). Development of clinical arthritis in the tibiotarsal joints was monitored in the right and left tibiotarsal joint and scored under double-blind conditions (40Zhong W. Stehle T. Museteanu C. Siebers A. Gern L. Kramer M. Wallich R. Simon M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12533-12538Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Testing for the outgrowth of viable spirochetes from cultured ear biopsies was done on day 42 post inoculation as described (41Zhong W. Gern L. Stehle T. Museteanu C. Kramer M. Wallich R. Simon M.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 946-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of and Efficient CLP Formation by CoreOspCa and CoreOspCb Fusion Proteins—As carrier we used a HBV core protein truncated after aa 149 with a C-terminal His6 tag that efficiently forms CLPs in E. coli (48Vogel M. Diez M. Eisfeld J. Nassal M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5211-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The inserts (Fig. 2) encompassed the nearly full-length mature proteins from aa residues 23 to 211 of OspCa and OspCb. In the OspC crystal structures, residues preceding aa 40 and following aa 204 were not resolved (27Eicken C. Sharma V. Klabunde T. Owens R.T. Pikas D.S. Hook M. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10010-10015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Kumaran D. Eswaramoorthy S. Luft B.J. Koide S. Dunn J.J. Lawson C.L. Swaminathan S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggesting these sequences are flexible; therefore, only short flanking linkers were added (G4T and G2). Both the OspCa and the OspCb fusions were well expressed and largely soluble. Upon sedimentation in sucrose gradients of the cleared bacterial lysates, both proteins formed a sharp peak in the center of the gradient (shown in Fig. 3A for coreOspCa), as is typical for ordered HBcAg CLPs (8Vogel M. Vorreiter J. Nassal M. Proteins. 2005; 58: 478-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A band of identical mobility was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-HBcAg mAb (Fig. 3A) as well as an anti-OspC mAb (not shown). Direct confirmation of efficient CLP formation was obtained by negative staining electron microscopy (EM) that revealed abundant particles exhibiting, compared with wild-type CLPs, a rough surface that on some particles appeared to consist of distinct spikes (Fig. 3B). Structural Analysis of CoreOspCa CLPs—For a more detailed analysis, the coreOspCa sample was subjected to electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and image processing. Cryoelectron micrographs confirmed the presence of abundant spherical, though sometimes distorted, shells of different size classes (Fig. 4A). Compared with CLPs from unmodified His-tagged core protein 1-149, the fraction of small particles was substantially increased, as was also found for other, including smaller, c/e1 insertions (49Böttcher B. Vogel M. Ploss M. Nassal M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 812-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All showed distinct, large, outward protruding spikes, indicating that the OspC domains are indeed surface exposed. For an approximate comparison of the size of the outer spikes with the expected dimensions of OspC, a two-dimensional image-processing approach was used. Particle images were centered, and then segments of the outer rim showing the outer densities in side view were compared. Particles with similar peripheral density distributions were grouped, and those within one group were averaged. The corresponding projections from several such groups are shown in Fig. 4B. All displayed regularly arranged densities at the positions expected for the core dimers constituting the inner shell, plus elongated and slightly kinked outward reaching protrusions. The largest of these protrusions were on average ∼6.5 nm long and ∼4 nm wide, in good agreement with the dimensions of an OspC dimer (∼6.2 by 4.2 nm when viewed from the broadside); others had a similar length but appeared narrower. This would be compatible with edgewise-viewed OspC dimers or with monomers (Fig. 4C). Obtaining three-dimensional icosahedral reconstructions was hampered by the variability in the arrangement of the OspC layer between individual particles and by difficulty in accurately assigning particle orientations. Nonetheless, a plausible model could be derived by combining a reconstruction based on a known reference map of wild-type T 3 particles that emphasizes the inner core shell with a single particle-based reconstruction emphasizing the outer OspC shell (see supplemental Fig. S1 and legend). Although little detail of the core dimer spikes was visible, indicating that the model is of limited accuracy, it strongly suggests that the packing of the core dimers and the location of the spikes in the inner shell are comparable with wild-type CLPs. Furthermore, because the OspC densities were not centered above the core dimer spikes (supplemental Fig. S2), OspC dimerization is unlikely to occur between the two OspC moieties present on one core dimer. The data are, however, compatible with dimerization between OspCs present on neighboring core dimers. Irrespective of how the OspC moieties are arranged in detail, these data provide strong evidence for the ability of the HBcAg carrier to accommodate the insertion of a dimerization-competent whole protein antigen and to present it on an intact CLP surface.

It is reasonably assumed that there is a rapid (>104 s–1) two-electron reduction of QH by the bound substrate QLH2, followed by two one-electron intramolecular transfers from the QHH2 to heme b. Hence, the suggested electron transfer sequence is as in Reaction 1. QLH2⇆QH⇆heme b⇆heme o3-CuB→O2REACTION 1 The function of the quinone cofactor bound at the QH site as a two-electron/one-electron transformer is supported by the electrochemical studies, which show that the QH site stabilizes the SQ form of the quinone bound at this site. The midpoint potential for the two-electron reduction of QHH2 is ∼+100 mV at pH 7.5, and the pH dependence (up to pH 9) of the midpoint potential shows that two protons are taken up by the protein upon reduction, probably forming the protonated dihydroubiquinol: 2 e–1 + 2H+ + QH → QHH2.The midpoint potential for the one-electron oxidation of QHH2 to the SQ species is ∼–13 mV, and the pH dependence of the oxidation of the SQ to the fully oxidized quinone indicates oxidation to form the SQ is coupled to the loss of a proton from a group with a pKa of ∼7.5. This has been interpreted as the pKa of the SQ, predicting that the SQ is an anion (QH_˙) above pH 7.5 but is a neutral species (QH_˙H) below pH 7.5 (11Ingledew W.J. Ohnishi T. Salerno J.C. Eur. J.

The hydrogen-bonded protons around the SQ in cyt bo3 were previously examined using electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques in conjunction with deuterium (D2O) exchange. The Q-band ENDOR spectrum showed only one splitting from exchangeable deuterium consistent with hydrogen bonding to the quinone oxygen(s) (16Veselov A.V. Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Scholes C.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3169-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two pairs of exchange-sensitive features were observed in the X-band ENDOR spectra of cyt bo3 bound to either native quinone or to exogenously added quinones (17Hastings S.F. Heathcote P. Ingledew W.J. Rigby S.E.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5638-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18McMillan F. Grimaldi S. Ostermann T. Weiden N. Mogi T. Ludwig B. Miyoshi H. Michel H. Prisner T.F. 5th Meeting of the European Federation of EPR Groups. 2003; (2003): 7-11Google Scholar). The data were interpreted by different laboratories as indicating either one H-bonded proton (18McMillan F. Grimaldi S. Ostermann T. Weiden N. Mogi T. Ludwig B. Miyoshi H. Michel H. Prisner T.F. 5th Meeting of the European Federation of EPR Groups. 2003; (2003): 7-11Google Scholar) or two equivalent H-bonded protons (17Hastings S.F. Heathcote P. Ingledew W.J. Rigby S.E.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5638-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).A multifrequency (9, 34, and 94 GHz) EPR study was performed with cyt bo3 bound to ubiquinone-2 selectively labeled with 13C at either the 1- or the 4-carbonyl carbons (19Grimaldi S. Ostermann T. Weiden N. Mogi T. Miyoshi H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Prisner T.F. MacMillan F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5632-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The EPR spectra revealed significant differences in the hyperfine tensors of these carbons indicating that the radical interacts with the protein in a highly asymmetric manner (19Grimaldi S. Ostermann T. Weiden N. Mogi T. Miyoshi H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Prisner T.F. MacMillan F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5632-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), consistent with a strong hydrogen bond to the O1 carbonyl oxygen. In addition, one- and two-dimensional electron spin echo envelope modulation (1D and 2D ESEEM) studies have shown that the SQ in cyt bo3 forms an H-bond with a 14N atom from the protein environment (20Grimaldi S. MacMillan F. Ostermann T. Ludwig T. Michel H. Prisner T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), tentatively assigned either as coming from the polypeptide backbone (20Grimaldi S. MacMillan F. Ostermann T. Ludwig T. Michel H. Prisner T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or from an arginine side chain (19Grimaldi S. Ostermann T. Weiden N. Mogi T. Miyoshi H. Ludwig B. Michel H. Prisner T.F. MacMillan F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5632-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Thus, previous studies have established the presence of at least one H-bond between the SQ in cyt bo3 and a nitrogen that is part of the protein environment. These results do not exclude additional hydrogen bonds between the quinone oxygens and other protein H-bonding partners, including S and O atoms.The current work provides additional information about the exchangeable protons in hydrogen bonds to the SQ species in cyt bo3 by using a combination of 1D and 2D ESEEM, and pulsed ENDOR. The major new observation is that there are at least three exchangeable protons with distinct hyperfine couplings in the immediate environment of the SQ. The data support a model in which the semiquinone is stabilized by strong hydrogen bonds from both Asp-75 and Arg-71 to oxygen O1 and with no hydrogen bonds to carbonyl O4, resulting in a highly asymmetric spin distribution.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSample Preparation—The pJRHisA plasmid encoding wild-type cyt bo3 was transformed into the C43(DE3) E. coli strain (Avidis, France). Cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.3% lactic acid, and 500 μm CuSO4 at 37°C and harvested at the mid-logarithm phase. Harvested cells were resuspended in 50 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm MgSO4, pH 8.3, and broken by passing through a microfluidizer (Microfluidics Corp., Worcester, MA) at 10,000 p.s.i. (three times), followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris. Membranes were then isolated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 180,000 × g for at least 5 h. The isolated membranes were suspended in 50 mm K2HPO4, pH 8.3, and solubilized with 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Anatrace, OH) by stirring at 4°C for 2 h. The unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 h. The solubilized cyt bo3 was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and purified as described previously (21Rumbley J.N. Furlong Nickels E. Gennis R.B. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1340: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The purified protein was then dialyzed overnight in 50 mm K2HPO4, 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, pH 8.3, and concentrated to ∼400 μm. For the deuterated sample, the dialyzed protein was concentrated, exchanged with deuterated 50 mm K2HPO4, 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, pD 8.3, and further concentrated to ∼400 μm. The enzyme was anaerobically reduced under an argon atmosphere with 500-times excess sodium ascorbate, and the reduced sample was then transferred to an argon-flushed EPR tube, followed by rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen.EPR Measurements—The continuous wave and pulsed EPR experiments were carried out using X-band Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometers equipped with Oxford CF 935 cryostats. Unless otherwise indicated, all measurements were made at 50 K. Several types of ESE experiments with different pulse sequences were employed with appropriate phase-cycling schemes to eliminate unwanted features from experimental echo envelopes. Among them are two-pulse and four-pulse sequences. In the two-pulse experiment (π/2-τ-π-τ-echo) the intensity of the echo signal is measured as a function of the time interval τ between two microwave pulses with turning angles π/2 and π to generate an echo envelope that maps the time course of relaxation of the spin system (in ESEEM), or as a function of magnetic field at fixed τ (in field-sweep ESE). In the 2D four-pulse ESEEM experiment (π/2-τ-π/2-t1-π-t2-π/2-τ-echo), also called HYSCORE (22Höfer P. Grupp A. Nebenführ H. Mehring M.M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1986; 132: 279-284Crossref Scopus (503) Google Scholar), the intensity of the stimulated echo after the fourth pulse is measured with t2 and t1 varied, and τ constant. Such a 2D set of echo envelopes gives, after complex Fourier transformation, a 2D spectrum with equal resolution in each direction. Spectral processing of ESEEM patterns was performed using Bruker WIN-EPR software.Pulsed ENDOR spectra of the radical in cyt bo3 were obtained using Davies (π-t-π/2-τ-π-τ) and Mims (π/2-τ-π/2-t-π/2-τ) sequences with different pulse lengths. In addition, radio frequency π pulse is applied during the time interval t in both sequences. The specifics of these experiments are described in detail elsewhere (23Schweiger A. Jeschke G. Principles of Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. 2001; (Oxford University Press): 359-405Google Scholar).Characteristics of HYSCORE Spectra from I = ½ Nuclei—The most informative experimental data regarding the ligand environment of the semiquinone were obtained from the 2D ESEEM (HYSCORE) experiment (22Höfer P. Grupp A. Nebenführ H. Mehring M.M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1986; 132: 279-284Crossref Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The basic advantage of the HYSCORE technique is the creation of 2D spectra with off-diagonal cross-peaks (να, νβ) and (νβ, να), whose coordinates are nuclear frequencies from opposite electron spin manifolds. The cross-peaks simplify significantly the analysis of congested spectra by correlating and spreading out the nuclear frequencies. In addition, the HYSCORE experiment separates overlapping peaks along a second dimension and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio through a second Fourier transform. HYSCORE is also valuable for the detection of extended anisotropic peaks of low intensity, which are not seen in 1D ESEEM spectra.Orientationally disordered (i.e. powder) spectra of I = ½ nuclei also reveal, in the form of cross-peak contour projections, the interdependence between να and νβ values in the same orientation. Analysis of the contours allows for direct, simultaneous determination of the nuclear isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants (24Dikanov S.A. Bowman M.K. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 116: 125-128Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (see “Appendix”).RESULTSEPR and ESEEM Spectra of the Semiquinone—The field-sweep ESE spectrum of cyt bo3 recorded at 50 K (Fig. 1) shows only one line from the SQ with g ∼2.0047 and the width ∼1.2 millitesla at the half-height. Some measurements were also performed at 90 K, and the results were similar to those obtained at 50 K.The 1D and 2D ESEEM spectra of the SQ at frequencies <10 MHz, appropriate for 14N nuclei, are identical to those reported previously by Grimaldi et al. (20Grimaldi S. MacMillan F. Ostermann T. Ludwig T. Michel H. Prisner T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These spectra were used to determine the quadrupole coupling constant K = e2qQ/4h = 0.93 MHz, and the asymmetry parameter η = 0.51, which are consistent with assigning this to a 14N nitrogen from the NH or NH2 groups forming an H-bond with the SQ (see “Discussion”).Proton HYSCORE—Fig. 2 (A–C) shows the proton part of the HYSCORE spectrum (τ = 136 ns) of the SQ radical in the cyt bo3 sample prepared in 1H2O buffer. In addition to a diagonal peak with extended shoulders at the proton Zeeman frequency (νH ∼14.7 MHz), the spectra in Fig. 2 contain up to six pairs of resolved cross-peaks located symmetrically relative to the diagonal. They are designated 1, 2, 2′,3,3′, and 4. The cross-peaks labeled 1 demonstrate the largest hyperfine splitting, of the order ∼10 MHz. The cross-peaks 2 possess the most extended anisotropic contour in the area further up the diagonal. The peaks 2′,3, 3′, and 4 are located in a similar area of the plot close to each other and partially overlap at the low intensity levels. The contours of these peaks could be separated at the higher levels of the intensity, as shown in Fig. 2C, and used for quantitative analysis. The 2, 2′, 3, and 3′ contours deviate from the normal to the diagonal, indicating a significant anisotropic component. In contrast, contours 1 and 4 are approximately normal to the diagonal, suggesting smaller anisotropy. Cross-peaks 2–4 (Fig. 2D) completely disappeared in the HYSCORE spectra obtained under the same conditions using the sample with 2H2O, showing that these are produced by exchangeable protons. However, cross-peaks 1 and the diagonal peak, with its shoulders, still appear in the spectra.FIGURE 2The proton part of the HYSCORE spectra of the SQ at the QH site of cyt bo3. A, C, and D, contour presentations of the spectra used for the quantitative analysis of lineshapes; B, stacked presentation showing more clearly the relative intensities and shapes of the peaks. Spectrum C shows higher levels of intensity than spectrum A. The microwave frequency was 9.68 GHz, the magnetic field was 345.0 milliteslas, and the time τ between first and second microwave pulses was 136 ns. Spectra were obtained after Fourier transformation of 2D time-domain patterns containing 256 × 256 points with a step of 20 ns.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quantitative analysis of the cross-peak contour lineshapes (see “Appendix”) finds that cross-peaks 2 and 2′ are produced by the same proton (H2) and that cross-peaks 3 and 3′ are also from the same proton (H3). Hence, these data derive from four protons coupled to the SQ: H1, H2, H3, and H4. Among them, H2, H3, and H4 are exchangeable protons. The isotropic (a) and anisotropic (T) components of the axial hyperfine tensors for these protons are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Hyperfine tensors of the protons H1–H4 derived from HYSCORE spectraProtona and TA⊥ = a - TA∥ = a + 2TMHzH110.0, 1.78.313.4H2±0.7, ∓6.3±7.0∓11.9H3∓1.2, ±4.2∓5.4±7.2H4∓4.6, ±1.7∓6.3∓1.2 Open table in a new tab Pulsed ENDOR—Fig. 3 shows Davies pulsed ENDOR spectra for the radical in QH site of cyt bo prepared in 1H2O and 2H2O. These spectra were obtained with two different lengths tp of the inverting π pulse. The spectrum recorded with tp = 240 ns shows complex overlap of the lines in the middle of the spectrum around the proton Zeeman frequency (νH). It is seen that the shoulders of this complex line decrease after 1H/2H exchange. The intensity from the weakly coupled protons around the proton Zeeman frequency is suppressed in the spectra recorded with shorter duration tp = 64 ns. The spectrum in 1H2O contains two pairs of peaks located symmetrically relative to the νH with splittings of ∼11 MHz and ∼5 MHz. The pair of peaks with the smaller splitting is absent in the spectrum of the sample prepared in 2H2O, thus indicating their assignment to the exchangeable proton(s). In contrast, a new doublet with splitting ∼0.73 MHz, centered at the deuterium Zeeman frequency (νD) and corresponding to the proton splitting ∼5 MHz, appears in these spectra (Fig. 3). One can also note that the shape of the peaks with ∼11 MHz splitting also changes in this spectrum due to overlap with some spectral features from exchangeable protons. The shape of these peaks after deuterium substitution becomes more asymmetric, allowing us to specify parallel and perpendicular canonical frequencies with the splittings |A##| ∼10 MHz and |A∥| ∼13 MHz. These features correspond to the cross-peaks from H1 in the HYSCORE spectra, and they are assigned to the methyl protons with the hyperfine couplings shown in Table 1 (see also “Appendix”).FIGURE 3Pulsed ENDOR spectra obtained using Davies ENDOR sequence of the SQ at the QH site of cyt bo3 prepared in 1 H2O(a and c) and 2H2O (b and d).

Biochem. 2000; 267: 5638-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported two splittings |A##| = 10.8 MHz and |A∥| = 14.4 MHz (corresponding to a = 12 MHz and T = 1.2 MHz) that were not sensitive to deuterium exchange in X-band ENDOR spectra of decyl-ubiquinone in the QH site of cyt bo3. These peaks were assigned to the protons of the methyl substituent. MacMillan et al. (18McMillan F. Grimaldi S. Ostermann T. Weiden N. Mogi T. Ludwig B. Miyoshi H. Michel H.

The most significant loss of intensity after 1H/2H exchange was reported by these authors at frequencies corresponding to the couplings |A##| = 5.1 MHz and |A∥| = 11.7 MHz (17Hastings S.F. Heathcote P. Ingledew W.J. Rigby S.E.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5638-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and |A##| = 4.5 MHz and |A∥| = 9.1 MHz (18McMillan F. Grimaldi S. Ostermann T. Weiden N. Mogi T. Ludwig B. Miyoshi H. Michel H. Prisner T.F. 5th Meeting of the European Federation of EPR Groups. 2003; (2003): 7-11Google Scholar). In both of these studies, the features were assigned to the same proton(s) and used for the calculation of the anisotropic component of the hyperfine tensor and H-bond length.Veselov et al. (16Veselov A.V. Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Scholes C.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3169-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) performed orientation-selected Q-band ENDOR experiments with the native SQ in the QH site of cyt bo3. They reported the isotropic coupling of the methyl protons to be ∼11 MHz and a loss of intensity in the 4- to 5-MHz region around the proton Zeeman frequency after 1H/2H exchange. Accordingly, the deuterium ENDOR spectrum recorded at gy exhibits only one resolved splitting ∼0.8 MHz, corresponding to a proton coupling of 5.2 MHz.In summary, the current work, as well as the previous experiments, have all found a remarkably large anisotropic coupling constant ∼10–11 MHz from the methyl protons. In addition, these studies also show similar exchangeable proton and deuterium ENDOR features. Proton ENDOR spectra show a loss of intensity after 1H/2H exchange, which is most significant at frequencies corresponding to the couplings |A##| = 4.5–5.1 MHz and |A∥| = 9.1–11.7 MHz.The powder ENDOR spectrum simulated with the contribution of all three exchangeable protons H2–H4 using the hyperfine tensors given in Table 1 reproduces intense features with a splitting of ∼5 MHz resulting from the overlap of lines from all three protons and |A∥| peaks with the splitting ∼12 MHz from H2 (Fig. 4, “Appendix”). The shape of these features depends on the linewidth of individual ENDOR transitions. Additional factors that may influence the width of these lines in the spectra are the non-axiality of the hyperfine tensors and “strain” in the values of the hyperfine couplings. Thus, the 2D ESEEM data for protons H2, H3, and H4 can explain the exchangeable features in the ENDOR spectra described above, and those data previously assigned by other authors (17Hastings S.F.

In microtubule-dependent cellular protrusions, APC frequently accumulates in peripheral clusters at the basal membrane.

In this study, we performed deletion mapping and defined a minimal sequence (amino acids 1–2226) that efficiently targets APC to membrane clusters. This sequence lacks DLG-1 and EB1 binding sites, suggesting that these partners are not absolutely required for APC membrane targeting. A series of APC sequences were transiently expressed in cells and compared for their ability to compete endogenous APC at the membrane; potent inhibition of endogenous APC targeting was elicited by the Armadillo- (binds KAP3A, B56α, and ASEF) and β-catenin-binding domains. The Armadillo domain was predicted to inhibit APC membrane localization through sequestration of the kinesin-KAP3A complex. The role of β-catenin in APC membrane localization was unexpected but affirmed by overexpressing the APC binding sequence of β-catenin, which similarly reduced APC membrane staining. Furthermore, we used RNA interference to show that loss of β-catenin reduced APC at membrane clusters in migrating cells. In addition, we report that transiently expressed APC-yellow fluorescent protein co-localized with β-catenin, KAP3A, EB1, and DLG-1 at membrane clusters, but only β-catenin stimulated APC anchorage at the membrane.

Many APC mutations also disrupt APC-dependent β-catenin degradation, causing oncogenic β-catenin to accumulate in the nucleus and activate transcription of genes that promote cell transformation (1Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lustig B. Behrens J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 129: 199-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of APC is regulated by nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking (7Henderson B.R. Fagotto F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and by plus-end-directed KAP3A/kinesin-dependent movement along microtubule filaments toward the cell periphery (8Mimoru-Kiyosue Y.

APC, like CLIP170 and EB1, is now recognized as a microtubule plus-end-binding protein (11Dikovskaya D. Zumbrunn J. Penman G.A. Näthke I.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 378-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two distinct sites of APC localization at the cell membrane have been linked to cell migration. In polarized Vero fibroblasts, APC was found to accumulate at the actin-rich leading membrane lamellipodia of migrating cells (12Watanabe T. Wang S. Noritake J. Sato K. Fukata M. Takefuji M. Nakagawa M. Izumi N. Akiyama T. Kaibuchi K. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 871-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The most frequent concentration of APC occurs at the tips of microtubule-dependent cellular protrusions (8Mimoru-Kiyosue Y. Shiina N. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 13Näthke I. Adams C.L. Polakis P. Sellin J.H. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and this membrane cluster pattern is often linked to the polarity of cell migration (13Näthke I. Adams C.L. Polakis P. Sellin J.H. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 14Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 42: 753-756Crossref Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The accumulation of APC at lamellipodia was recently found to be mediated through a direct interaction of APC with the Rac1/Cdc42 effector protein, IQGAP1 (12Watanabe T. Wang S. Noritake J. Sato K. Fukata M. Takefuji M. Nakagawa M. Izumi N. Akiyama T. Kaibuchi K. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 871-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The proteins that regulate APC localization at distinct cellular protrusions, however, have not yet been defined. APC forms a stabilizing complex at microtubule plus-ends with EB1 (15Mimoru-Kiyosue Y. Shiina N. Tsukita S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 865-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and co-localizes at the basal membrane in membrane clusters with endogenous β-catenin (13Näthke I. Adams C.L. Polakis P. Sellin J.H. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), KAP3A (9Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and DLG-1 (16Iizuka_Kogo A. Shimomura A. Senda T. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 123: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The interaction of APC with KAP3A/kinesin stimulates movement of APC along microtubules toward the membrane (9Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of APC by GSK-3β can cause APC to dissociate from microtubules (17Zumbrunn J. Kinoshita K. Hyman A.A. Nathke I.S. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 44-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and prevents its accumulation at cell protrusions (14Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 42: 753-756Crossref Scopus (712) Google Scholar). In this study, we adopted a systematic deletion mapping approach to characterize the APC sequences that mediate accumulation of APC in membrane clusters at the tips of cellular protrusions. We employed different methods including competition assays, co-transfection experiments, and siRNA silencing with the aim of identifying the binding partners that regulate APC membrane localization. Our findings support a role for KAP3A in the translocation of APC to the membrane but strongly implicate a role for β-catenin in the clustering and anchorage of APC at cellular protrusions. We propose that β-catenin mediates the effects of Cdc42-mediated inactivation of GSK-3β on APC aggregation at cell migration-associated protrusions. Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and SW480 (APCmut/mut) human colon carcinoma cells were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and were confirmed free of mycoplasma. For transfection experiments, cells were grown on glass coverslips in 8-well trays (Nunclone) and at 12 h post-seeding were transfected with 1–3 μg of DNA/ml of medium using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The lipid-DNA mix was left on cells for 6 h before replacing the medium and processing cells 40 h later (18Galea M.A. Eleftheriou A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45833-45839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For proteasome inhibition, cells were exposed to 20 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) 9 or 12 h prior to fixation and immunostaining. To examine the influence of disrupting the microtubule or actin cytoskeletons, cells were treated with 33 μm nocodazole (Sigma) or 1 μm latrunculin A (Molecular Probes), respectively, for 1 h. Cell Scratch-induced Migration Assay—NIH 3T3 or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were grown to confluence on coverslips. Individual wounds were made with a Gilson P-1000 pipette tip. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium was added. Cells were fixed at 6 h after wounding and immunostained as below. For siRNA experiments, cells were transfected 48 h before wounding. Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Antibodies—Cells were grown on coverslips at medium density and fixed in 3.7% formalin (tissue culture grade from Sigma)/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at 36 h post-transfection, and incubated with various antibodies as previously described (19Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies or serum were used: anti-APC Mab (Ab7, 1:80 dilution; Oncogene Research Products), anti-APC rabbit polyclonal M-APC (purified used at 1:1000, unpurified used at 1:80 and supplied by Dr. Inke Nathke), anti-Axin rabbit polyclonal (Zymed Laboratories; validated by detection of ectopic Axin in transfected cells), anti-FLAG Mab (M2, 1:1000 dilution; Sigma), anti-hemagglutinin tag rabbit polyclonal (sc-805, 1:250 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-EB1 goat polyclonal (N-18, 1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or EB1 monoclonal (610534/clone5, 1:100; BD Biosciences), anti-β-catenin rabbit serum (1:500 dilution; Sigma) or β-catenin Mab C19220 (1:100 dilution; Transduction Laboratory), anti-α-tubulin Mab (A-11126, 1:200 dilution; Molecular Probes), and anti-DLG-1 (Mab 2D11, 1:50 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies used were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Sigma); biotinylated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; DAKO), and anti-goat IgG (1:100; Santa Cruz). Avidin-Texas Red (1:800; Vector Laboratories) was used to label biotinylated antibodies. Phalloidin-TRITC or fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:500; Sigma) was used to visualize actin fibers. Cell nuclei were stained with the chromosome dye Hoechst 33285 (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted with Vectorshield aqueous mountant (Vector Laboratories) and observed and photographed using an Olympus BL51 fluorescence microscope at ×400 magnification. A SPOT32 camera was used for general image capture. Higher resolution imaging of stained cells was also performed with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal system attached to a Leica upright fluorescence microscope (DMRE) using Leica Confocal Software Version 2.00. Plasmid Construction—The expression vectors encoding full-length APC (pCMV-APC) or C-terminal truncated APC (pCMV-APC-(1–2644), -(1–1941), and -(1–1309) were previously described (3Smith K.J.

Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3505) Google Scholar). pCMV-APC-(1–2226) was constructed by introducing a linker containing a FLAG tag and STOP codon into the first XhoI site of the APC cDNA. Construction of pAPC-YFP was described by Henderson et al. (21Henderson B.R. Galea M.A. Schuechner S. Leung L. J. Biol.

Vogelstein (26Su L.-K. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Gyuris J. Brent R. Wiltshire R. Trent J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2972-2977PubMed Google Scholar). A series of GFP-tagged APC expression plasmids were constructed by PCR amplifying DNA sequences from the pCMV-APC template using primers that contained BamHI and SalI restriction enzyme sites and cloning the purified PCR products in-frame into the corresponding BamHI/SalI sites of pEGFP-N1. The actual sequences for the forward and reverse primers are given in Table 1, and this approach was used to construct the following plasmids: pGFP-tagged APC-(334–900), APC-(2226–2644), APC-(2650–2843), APC-(1941–2226), APC-(1941–2032), and APC-(2033–2061). The same strategy was used to clone pGFP-tagged APC-(1–302) except that the restriction sites used were HindIII and PstI (primers in Table 1). The sequence APC-(1379–2080) is contained in the plasmid pAPC-HC-GFP that was described by Rosin-Arbesfeld et al. (27Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and kindly supplied by Dr. Mariann Bienz (Cambridge).TABLE 1Primers used for PCR amplification of APC cDNA sequences cloned into pEGFP-N1 for transient expression assaysConstructForward primerReverse primerCloning siteAPC-(1-302)-GFPCTCGAGCTCAAGCTTATGGCTGCAGCTTCATATGGGTACCGTCGACTGCAGTCGAGGTGCAGAGTGTGTGCTHindIII (fwd) PstI (rev)APC-(334-900)-GFPGATCGACGTCGACGATGCTAGCTATGTCTAGCTCCCAAGACTAGTGGATCCCGAGAGGTATGAATGGCTGACACTTCSal I (fwd) BamHI (rev)APC-(2226-2644)-GFPGATCGACGTCGACGATGCGAGGCAGGACAATGATTCATATTCGACTTGTGGATCCCGAGAAACAGCAGGTGCCATTTGATAAATTAGSal I (fwd) BamHI (rev)APC-(2650-2843)-GFPGATCGACGTCGACGATGGCTGTTTCTAAAACAGAGGATGTTTGGGACTTGTGGATCCCGAACAGATGTCACAAGGTAAGACCCAGSal I (fwd) BamHI (rev)APC-(1941-2226)-GFPGATCGACGTCGACGATGCCAGACAGAGGGGCAGCAACTGATGGACTTGTGGATCCCGTCGAGAGATTGAAGGCATGTTTGCSal I (fwd) BamHI (rev)APC-(1941-2032)-GFPGATCGACGTCGACGATGCCAGACAGAGGGGCAGCAACTGATGGACTTGTGGATCCCGAATACTAAGAGAACTGAGAGAACTGSal I (fwd) BamHI (rev)APC-(2033-2060)-GFPGATCGACGTCGACGATGGACTCTGAAGATGACCTGTTGCAGGACTTGTGGATCCCGTTCATTATCACCCTTGAGTCTTGAAGGSal I (fwd) BamHI (rev) Open table in a new tab To construct a plasmid containing the GFP-tagged APC-binding domain of β-catenin, pβ-catenin-(218–467)-GFP, the pFLAG-β-catenin cDNA was used as template to amplify the sequence aa 218–467 using the forward primer 5′-GTCGACGGTACCCATGTTGCATAACCTTTCCCATCATCGTG-3′ (contains KpnI site) and reverse primer 5′-ACCGGTGGATCCCAAGCACAGATGGCAGGCTCAGTGATGTC-3′ (Bam-HI site underlined). The PCR fragment was cut with KpnI and BamHI and inserted in-frame into the same sites in pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Construct integrity was confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing. The same cloning strategy and vector were used to construct the plasmid pβ-catenin-(1–218)-GFP using the PCR forward primer 5′-GTCGACGGTACCCATGGCTACTCAAGCTGATTTGATG-3′ (KpnI site underlined) and reverse primer 5′-ACCGGTGGATCCCGGGTCCCAGCGGTACAACGAGCTG-3′ (BamHI site underlined). Cell Extract Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were resuspended in protein extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with protease inhibitor mix; Roche Diagnostics) and shock frozen in liquid nitrogen. After a quick thaw at 37 °C, cells were refrozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed on ice for 20 min, and cleared of insoluble components by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant containing total protein was quantitated using Bio-Rad protein assay. Cell extracts were then denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% SDS), and 40 μg of proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). Membranes were treated in blocking solution (5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20) and incubated with primary anti-GFP antibody (1:1000; Roche Applied Science) at room temperature for 2 h, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) exposed to x-ray film and quantified on a GE Healthcare densitometer. RNA Interference—Double-stranded 21-mer RNA oligonucleotides homologous to sequences in mouse β-catenin were purchased as purified duplexes (Qiagen-Xeragon Inc.). The DNA target sequences were number 1, 5′-CAGGGTGCTATTCCACGACTA-3′, and number 2, 5′-CAGATAGAAATGGTCCGA-3′. The control siRNA used was 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′. Cells at medium density were transfected with 3 μg of RNA duplexes in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium using Lipofectamine for 6 h and harvested 48 h post-transfection for analysis. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed on the data using the STATVIEW program (version 5; SAS Institute). Multiple samples in various treatment groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Fisher's progressive least significant differences test to establish any differences between treatments or transfections. Results were considered significant when p < 0.05. APC Localizes at Membrane Clusters at the Tips of Cellular Protrusions—APC can associate with microtubules, stimulate their bundling and polymerization in vitro (2Munemitsu S. Souza B. Muller O. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3676-3681PubMed Google Scholar, 3Smith K.J. Levy D.B. Maupin P. Pollard T.D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

Biol. 2001; 11: 44-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), and move along them toward the plus-ends in a kinesin-dependent pathway (9Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The APC-dependent bundling of microtubules contributes to extensions of the plasma membrane, referred to as cellular protrusions, and APC accumulates in “clusters” at the actin cortical zone of these membrane protrusions just beyond reach of the microtubules (see Fig. 1A). Using an anti-APC antibody well characterized for detection of APC at these structures (13Näthke I. Adams C.L. Polakis P. Sellin J.H. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), we detected APC at microtubule filaments in actively migrating Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells and confirmed that APC accumulates in clusters at the membrane periphery in a region at which the microtubules do not extend (see arrows in supplemental Figs. Sl and S2). Scoring of cells revealed that uncontacted NIH 3T3 cells exhibit 0–5 protrusions, and most commonly 3 protrusions; however, only 1–2 protrusions/cell display APC staining at membrane clusters (see supplemental Fig. S2). APC was previously shown to co-localize at these membrane clusters with the binding partners β-catenin (13Näthke I. Adams C.L. Polakis P. Sellin J.H. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), DLG-1 (16Iizuka_Kogo A. Shimomura A. Senda T. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 123: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), KAP3A (9Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and to a lesser extent EB1 (15Mimoru-Kiyosue Y. Shiina N. Tsukita S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 865-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 28Barth A.I.M. Siemers K.A. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1583-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed that endogenous APC frequently co-localizes with β-catenin, EB1, and DLG-1 at cortical clusters, and confocal microscopy determined co-localization with β-catenin at the basal membrane (see supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). Etienne-Manneville and Hall (14Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 42: 753-756Crossref Scopus (712) Google Scholar) showed in rat astrocytes that the appearance of APC at membrane clusters correlated with cdc42-dependent inactivation of the kinase GSK-3β. To determine whether APC accumulation at membrane clusters in NIH 3T3 cells is likewise regulated by cdc42, we overexpressed a cdc42 dominant negative mutant in NIH 3T3 cells and observed an ∼50% reduction in APC cluster staining, whereas constitutively active cdc42 had no significant effect (data not shown). Therefore, APC targeting and anchorage at membrane clusters in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts display similar characteristics to that reported in other cell types and thus provide a suitable model system to analyze APC at the membrane. We transfected NIH 3T3 cells with pAPC-YFP and observed staining at both microtubule filaments and at membrane clusters as revealed by co-staining microtubules with α-tubulin antibody (Fig. 1A); YFP alone stained diffusely throughout the cell (data not shown). In addition, association of APC-YFP with microtubules was abolished by the microtubule-disrupting drug nocodazole (data not shown). Three APC sequences have been proposed to mediate microtubule association, either directly via the Basic domain (2Munemitsu S. Souza B. Muller O. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3676-3681PubMed Google Scholar, 29Askham J.M. Moncur P. Markham A.F. Morrison E.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1950-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or indirectly through the APC-binding proteins EB1 (15Mimoru-Kiyosue Y. Shiina N. Tsukita S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 865-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 30Morrison E.E. Wardleworth B.N. Askham J.M. Markham A.F. Meredith D.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3471-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or KAP3A (9Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1B). The influence of protein interactions on APC microtubule-dependent localization or at membrane clusters is, however, poorly defined. Defining the Minimal Sequence Required for Targeting of APC to Membrane Clusters—We next mapped the sequences that promote APC localization at microtubules or membrane clusters. The sequence reported for APC binding to, and stabilization of, microtubules is the so-called Basic domain (2Munemitsu S. Souza B. Muller O. Albert I. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3676-3681PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mimoru-Kiyosue Y. Shiina N. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 17Zumbrunn J. Kinoshita K. Hyman A.A. Nathke I.S. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 44-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2A). There is less agreement regarding targeting of APC at membrane clusters, with different sequences having been proposed including aa 1–2158 (8Mimoru-Kiyosue Y. Shiina N. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), 461–777 (ARM domain; Refs. 9Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 28Barth A.I.M. Siemers K.A. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1583-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 932–1866 (9Jimbo T. Kawasaki Y. Koyama R. Sato R. Takada S. Haraguchi K. Akiyama T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To help resolve this issue, we performed a systematic deletion mapping to identify the membrane cluster targeting sequence(s) of APC. A series of C-terminal APC truncation mutants (Fig. 2A) were transfected into NIH 3T3 (APCwt/wt) and SW480 (APCmut/mut) cells, and the transfected cells were then compared for APC distribution at microtubule filaments or membrane clusters (Fig. 2, B and C). The distribution profiles were similar in both cell lines, and successive C-terminal deletions caused a progressive reduction in APC at microtubule filaments. The least active mutant, APC-(1–1309), is similar to the endogenous form expressed in SW480 colon cancer cells, which does not locate at cellular protrusions or contribute to their assembly. We observed that removal of the C-terminal 200 amino acids of APC caused an ∼40–60% reduction in localization at microtubules and at membrane clusters (Fig. 2, B and C). DLG-1 and EB1 bind to the extreme C terminus of APC and may therefore contribute to regulation of APC at microtubules and the membrane. Further deletion of the Basic domain abolished association with microtubule filaments. This is consistent with a role for the Basic domain in the binding and stabilization of microtubules. However, deleting the Basic domain restored APC membrane cluster localization to wild-type levels, suggesting that a domain outside of the Basic domain and the C terminus contributes to APC membrane localization. Of all the deleted sequences tested, APC-(1–2226) was preferentially targeted to the tips of cellular protrusions, and this was greatly reduced by further removal of the sequence aa 1941–2226. The sequence aa 1941–2226 contains two 20 aa repeat β-catenin binding elements and a SAMP3 Axin-binding domain. To determine whether these or other APC protein interaction domains can facilitate targeting to membrane clusters, we constructed a series of GFP-tagged APC sequences, transfected them into NIH 3T3 cells, and compared their localization profiles. Of the sequences tested, the central β-catenin binding region showed the highest level of cluster staining when compared with GFP alone (see Fig. 3A); however, we emphasize that even this APC sequence displayed relatively poor membrane cluster staining (visible in 6–9% of cells, data not shown) when compared with the APC-(1–2226) sequence (37% of cells, Fig. 2C). This indicates that subdivision of the 1–2226 sequence results in significant loss of membrane targeting. In contrast to a previous report (28Barth A.I.M. Siemers K.A. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1583-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the GFP-ARM domain sequence did not efficiently locate at membrane clusters (Fig. 3A). Our findings are most consistent with those of Mimori-Kiyosue et al. (8Mimoru-Kiyosue Y. Sh"
https://openalex.org/W2026248610,"Gene amplification of chromosomal band 11q13 is observed frequently in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). Several genes have been identified in the 11q13 amplicon, including FGF3, FGF4, CCND1, EMS1 and TAOS1. Some of these genes show good correlation between gene copy number and gene expression, and are thought to play a role in driving 11q13 amplification. The PPP1CA gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of serine/threonine protein phosphatase protein phosphatase 1alpha (PP1alpha), is also located in 11q13. Protein phosphatase 1alpha, one of the isoforms of PP1, regulates critical cellular events, such as cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. We sought to explore the possibility that PPP1CA was amplified and overexpressed in OSCC cells. Indeed, some OSCC cell lines had PPP1CA gene amplification, as analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We have also demonstrated that PPP1CA gene copy number is increased in 21% of the OSCC cell lines determined by quantitative microsatellite analysis. PP1alpha RNA expression determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was significantly higher in OSCC cell lines with 11q13 amplification compared to those without 11q13 amplification (P=0.011). The difference was even more significant between cell lines with at least three copies of the PPP1CA gene and those with less than three copies of the gene (P=0.00045). Relative PP1alpha protein levels were also significantly associated with PPP1CA gene copy number (P=0.014). Furthermore, knockdown of PP1alpha and/or cyclin D1 by small interfering RNA suppressed OSCC cell growth, at least in part by modulating pRB phosphorylation, resulting in G0 growth arrest. These data suggest that like the cyclin D1 gene, CCND1, amplification and overexpression of the PP1alpha gene, PPP1CA, may be involved in OSCC tumorigenesis and/or progression."
https://openalex.org/W1977149541,"Rhamnolipids are extracellular biosurfactants and virulence factors secreted by the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa that are required for swarming motility. The rhlG gene is essential for rhamnolipid formation, and the RhlG enzyme is thought to divert fatty acid synthesis intermediates into the rhamnolipid biosynthetic pathway based on its similarity to FabG, the β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase of type II fatty acid synthesis. Crystallographic analysis reveals that the overall structures of the RhlG·NADP+ and FabG·NADP+ complexes are indeed similar, but there are key differences related to function. RhlG does not undergo the conformational changes upon NADP(H) binding at the active site that in FabG are the structural basis of negative allostery. Also, the acyl chain-binding pocket of RhlG is narrow and rigid compared with the larger, flexible substrate-binding subdomain in FabG. Finally, RhlG lacks a positively charged/hydrophobic surface feature adjacent to the active site that is found on enzymes like FabG that recognize the ACP of fatty acid synthesis. RhlG catalyzed the NADPH-dependent reduction of β-ketodecanoyl-ACP to β-d-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP. However, the enzyme was 2000-fold less active than FabG in carrying out the same reaction.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that is capable of existing in multiple environmental niches and is an opportunistic pathogen that infects immunocompromised and cystic fibrosis patients (1Lyczak J.B.

Key pathogenic features of the organism are that it produces an extracellular rhamnolipid surfactant that facilitates the acquisition of hydrophobic carbon sources (3Noordman W.H. Janssen D.B. Appl.

Rhamnolipids also have potential industrial applications because of their ability to reduce the surface tension of water (16Lang S. Wullbrandt D. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 51: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Rhamnolipids are composed of molecules having either one or two rhamnose sugars linked to a dimer of β-hydroxyacids (primarily β-hydroxydecanoate) (17Deziel E. Lepine F. Milot S. Villemur R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The terminal stages of the rhamnolipid biosynthetic pathway are carried out by the dTDP-rhamnose transferases RhlB and RhlC that produce lipids with one or two rhamnose moieties, respectively (18Ochsner U.A.

RhlA is essential for rhamnolipid synthesis, and although its biochemical activity has not been demonstrated, it is proposed to be involved in forming the β-hydroxydecanoyl-β-hydroxydecanoate precursor (9Caiazza N.C.

Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). RhlG is an essential component in the rhamnolipid biosynthetic pathway because inactivation of the rhlG gene leads to the loss of rhamnolipid production (21Campos-Garcia J. Caro A.D. Najera R. Miller-Maier R.M. Al-Tahhan R.A. Soberon-Chavez G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4442-4451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the similarity of RhlG to FabG, 2The abbreviations used are: FabG, the β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase of type II fatty acid synthesis; ACP, acyl carrier protein; CoA, coenzyme A; SeMet, selenomethionine. the NADPH-dependent β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase of type II fatty acid synthesis, RhlG is proposed to perform the same reaction as FabG and divert intermediates in fatty acid synthesis into the rhamnolipid pathway (21Campos-Garcia J.

A transacylase may be involved downstream of RhlG, and the mechanism for the transport of rhamnolipids out of the cell is unknown. This work reports the x-ray structure of RhlG and compares its structure and biochemical activities to the FabG of type II fatty acid biosynthesis. Expression and Purification of RhlG—The P. aeruginosa rhlG gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET15b vector within NdeI/BamHI restriction sites. The recombinant RhlG protein with a N-terminal His-tag was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography as described previously (22Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10996-11000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The SeMet-labeled RhlG was expressed in an E. coli methionine auxotroph strain B834 grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with glucose and amino acid mix containing SeMet (23Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12772-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The Oligomerization State of RhlG—The Stoke's radius of RhlG was evaluated using gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex™ 200 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 200 mm NaCl. Protein molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences) were ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and RNaseA (13.7 kDa). Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted at 50,000 rpm and 4 °C using a ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge, equipped with both absorbance and interference optical detection systems, an eight-hole Beckman An-50 Ti rotor, and cells containing sapphire windows and charcoal-filled Epon double-sector centerpieces. The sedimentation velocity profiles of the protein (50 μg/ml, 400 μl) were collected at 1-min intervals with the Rayleigh interference optical system. The SEDNTERP program (24Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Analytical Centrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. 1992; (The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge): 90-125Google Scholar) was used to estimate the molecular weight and the partial specific volume. Data were modeled as a superposition of Lamm equation solutions, c(s), with the software SEDFIT 9.2 (25Schuck P. Biophys.

The sedimentation coefficient distribution c(s) was calculated with maximum entropy regularization, the molecular weight distribution, c(M), was calculated using the value determined from the c(s) distribution, and the f/f0 value was determined from the c(s) analysis (26Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Structure Determination—RhlG and SeMet-RhlG were crystallized at 18 °C by the vapor diffusion hanging drop method. Upon setup, the drop contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7, 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m ammonium sulfate, 6% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 mg/ml protein. The reservoir contained 1 m HEPES, pH 7, 0.3 m ammonium sulfate, and 12% polyethylene glycol 4000. Orthorhombic crystals in space group C2221 appeared in ∼3 days. RhlG·NADP+ co-crystals, also in space group C2221, were formed in the presence of 1 mm NADPH. Crystals were flash-frozen in mother liquor with 20% glycerol for cryoprotection. A 2.9 Å SeMet RhlG·NADP+ single wavelength anomalous dispersion data set was measured at the SER-CAT 22ID beamline of the Advanced Photon Source, the 2.3 Å native RhlG·NADP+ data set was measured at SER-CAT 22BM, and the 2.7 Å native RhlG data set was measured at SER-CAT 22ID. The data were integrated using MOSFLM (27Leslie A.G.W. Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology. 1997; (Version 6.2.2, Cambridge, UK)Google Scholar) and scaled using SCALA (28Evans P.R. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1997; 33: 22-24Google Scholar). A selenium substructure solution comprising 12 of the possible 20 selenium sites was found using CNS-1.1 (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). These were fed into Resolve (30Terwilliger T. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) for 2-fold NCS detection, density modification, and model building. Roughly 60% of the asymmetric unit was traced automatically. The homologous FabG·NADP+ structure (PDB ID 1Q7B) was then used as a guide to manually complete the model using the O program (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, molecule A was more complete, and it was therefore used to model poorly defined regions of molecule B. The model was refined using REFMAC5 (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) and subjected to another round of building and refinement. The native data were processed similarly, but the Rmerge with the RhlG·NADP+ data were 30% despite less than a 1% change in the unit cell parameters. Therefore, the apo structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRE (33Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) and the RhlG·NADP+ structure as the search model. Addition of waters, B-factor refinement, and energy minimization were all performed using CNS-1.1.

Open table in a new tab ACP-dependent Gel Reconstitution Assay of RhlG/FabG Activity—RhlG/FabG activity was tested in an ACP-dependent assay by analyzing the formation of β-hydroxyacyl-ACP with a conformational-sensitive gel electrophoresis method. The assay contained 100 μm ACP, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 55 μCi/μmol), 45 μm octanoyl-CoA, 100 μm NADPH, 1 μg of purified FabD, 1 μg of purified FabH in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and indicated amount of FabG (1 ng to 0.256 μg) or RhlG (2.20–140 μg) in a final volume of 40 μl. The ACP, β-mercaptoethanol, and buffer were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min to ensure the complete reduction of ACP. The substrate for the RhlG/FabG reaction was generated using FabD to transfer the malonyl group from CoA to ACP to produce malonyl-ACP, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis FabH to condense octanoyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP to form β-ketodecanoyl-ACP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of RhlG/FabG. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 8 μl of 6 × sample buffer to the reaction mix and placing the reaction tubes on ice. Then 40 μl of each of the assay mixtures was loaded onto conformational sensitive gels that contained 13% acrylamide and 2.5 m urea. The electrophoresis was performed at 25 °C under constant current of 32 mA/gel. The gels were stained in Coomassie Blue, destained, and dried with a vacuum gel drier at 80 °C. The gels were exposed against PhosphorImager screens that were scanned by a Typhoon 9200. The product of FabG, β-hydroxy-[1-14C]decanoyl-ACP, was quantitated with ImageQuant 5.2. ACP-independent Spectrophotometric Assay of RhlG/FabG Activity—This assay measured the disappearance of NADPH, the cofactor for the RhlG/FabG reaction, spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The reaction mixture contained 0.5 mm acetoacetyl-CoA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 8 μg of FabG or up to 100 μg of RhlG protein, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 300 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of acetoacetyl-CoA. Decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm was recorded for up to 5 min. The initial rate was used to calculate the enzymatic activity. Purification and Oligomeric State of RhlG—Purification of RhlG by metal chelate affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration yielded pure protein with an apparent mass of 29 kDa as shown by SDS gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). RhlG possessed a Stoke's radius determined by gel filtration chromatography consistent with a molecular mass of a 50.4 kDa globular protein (Fig. 1A), indicating that RhlG is a dimer in solution. The analysis of purified RhlG by analytical ultracentrifugation verified that the protein exists as a dimer with a molecular mass of 58.4 kDa at protein concentrations <0.8 mg/ml (Fig. 1B). At higher protein concentrations, RhlG tetramers (116 kDa) were also observed (not shown). The Structure of RhlG—Crystals of RhlG in space group C2221 were obtained in the absence and presence of NADP+, but the RhlG·NADP+ co-crystals grew more reproducibly and diffracted to higher resolution. These co-crystals were selected for ab initio structure determination using single wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing with SeMet-RhlG. A data set was collected at the “peak,” and this was sufficient to identify the selenium sites and to obtain initial phases to 2.9 Å. The final high resolution model was refined against 2.3 Å data collected from a native RhlG·NADP+ co-crystal. The asymmetric unit comprised an AB dimer, but NADP+ was only bound to monomer A and was absent from monomer B (Fig. 2). The N-terminal His-tag was not visible in either monomer and was absent from the final model. In addition, residues 97–104 in monomer B were not visible in the electron density. Analysis of the structure using PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 282-291Crossref Google Scholar) revealed a high quality structure, and this is consistent with the final Rwork and Rfree values of 21.2 and 26.4%, respectively. The RhlG crystals without NADP+ diffracted to 2.7 Å, and the initial structure was determined from the RhlG·NADP+ model using rigid body refinement. In the final model, residues 93–104 and 94–104 were missing from monomers A and B, respectively, and the N-terminal His-tag residues were also absent. The final Rwork and Rfree values were 22.4 and 28.6%, respectively. Pertinent data collection and refinement statistics for all structures are presented in Table 1. Each monomer of RhlG adopts a Rossmann fold structure that contains seven β-strands and eight α-helices placing the enzyme in the SDR superfamily of reductases (Fig. 2) (35Oppermann U. Filling C. Hult M. Shafqat N. Wu X. Lindh M. Shafqat J. Nordling E. Kallberg Y. Persson B. Jörnvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). As indicated by the similarities between the RhlG and FabG primary structures (Fig. 3), the overall fold (Fig. 2) is very similar to that of FabG (23Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12772-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 36Rafferty J.B. Simon J.W. Stuitje A.R. Slabas A.R. Fawcett T. Rice D.W. J. Mol.

Structure. 2004; 12: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and the description will therefore be brief. The fold contains two right-handed βαβαβ motifs (β1-α1-β2-α2-β3 and β4-α4-β5-α5-β6) connected by helix α3. Helices α6–α7 form a separate helix-turn-helix substructure, and α8–β7 conclude the fold with strand β7 completing the seven-stranded parallel β-sheet. The organization of the dimer is identical to that of FabG, with monomer-monomer interfaces involving α4 and α5. Detailed Comparison of RhlG to FabG—FabG undergoes a series of complex conformational changes in response to NADP+ binding that mediate negative allosteric kinetic behavior (23Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12772-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 37Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Most notably, the three active site residues Ser138, Tyr151, and Lys155 (E. coli FabG) are not in their catalytic conformation unless NADP+ is present. The same is not true for RhlG (Fig. 4). The three FabG·NADP+ active site residues are superimposable on RhlG residues Ser148, Tyr162, and Lys166, thereby confirming their identical roles in catalysis. In contrast, the adenineribose-phosphate half of the cofactor binds more tightly to RhlG than to FabG as judged from the interactions with the protein. In FabG, the binding pocket includes one arginine that interacts with the phosphate and a number of hydrogen bonding interactions. In RhlG (Fig. 5), arginines 19 and 41 interact with the phosphate, and the guanidinium group of Arg41 stacks onto the adenine rings to fully enclose this end of the cofactor. Also, the backbone amides of Arg41, Asp42, and Leu66 as well as the hydroxyl of Ser18 mediate hydrogen bonding interactions. Finally, it may be significant that only one active site in the asymmetric unit has a bound cofactor because both active site clefts are accessible in the crystal packing arrangement. One obvious difference between monomers A and B is the ordering of residues within the β4-α4 loop (residues 93–104), which is clearly correlated with cofactor binding. This loop, which is adjacent to but not directly a part of the nicotinamide-binding pocket, is only ordered in the presence of NADP+ (monomer A). Residues 94–96 are in van der Waals contact with Met199 when NADP+ is present, thereby sequestering the cofactor from solvent.FIGURE 5Interactions of RhlG with NADP+. NADP+ carbon bonds are green, and protein carbon bonds are colored gray. Hydrogen bonds are indicated with dashed lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An important feature of the FabG catalytic mechanism, and perhaps of many other SDR superfamily members, is the presence of a “proton relay” that shuttles protons from the solvent into the substrate (23Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12772-12781Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 37Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In E. coli FabG, Tyr151 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen at the C-3 of the substrate, thereby positioning the substrate for catalysis. Catalysis occurs by Tyr151 donating a proton to the carbonyl oxygen and NADPH donating a hydride ion to the C-3 carbon. The side chain of Lys155 binds the ribose hydroxyls of NADPH, and these groups interact with a series of water molecules to ensure that the Tyr151 hydroxyl hydrogen is replenished following catalysis. In FabG, the proton relay absolutely depends on the presence of NADP+, both to provide crucial hydrogen bonding elements and to effect necessary conformational changes in the active site residues and the backbone that allow the proton relay to form. A characteristic kink in helix α4 at a conserved asparagine (Asn110) provides a key hydrogen bond acceptor to the proton relay by releasing the backbone carbonyl oxygen from its helical hydrogen bonding interactions (37Price A.C. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). All of these structural requirements for the proton relay are present in RhlG, including the conserved Asn116, and two of the predicted four water molecules are clearly present with marginal electron density for a third water molecule at the expected location (Fig. 6). Unlike FabG, the structural requirements for the proton relay are present in the absence of cofactor, and the RhlG active site is always primed for catalysis. Although very similar, RhlG·NADP+ and FabG·NADP+ have significant differences in four regions of their structures that have functional implications. These regions in the RhlG dimer are highlighted in Fig. 7A, and they generally surround the active site cleft containing the bound NADP+. Region one encompasses the β4-α4 loop, and these residues are flexible in the absence of cofactor. The difference may be related to conformational flexibility; however, it is one of the most conserved regions in the FabG protein family, and this conservation does not extend to RhlG. The second region involves the α4-β5 loop that approaches the active site across the dimer interface from monomer B. RhlG contains a four-residue extension to this loop compared with FabG and lacks the cluster of arginines and lysines that are found in FabG sequences. Region three is within the β5-α5 loop that is adjacent to the α4-β5 loop. The fourth region is in the α6-α7 helix-turn-helix substructure. Although both substructures are similar in the two enzymes, they achieve this structure in different ways. In FabG, the helix-turn-helix is maintained by a hydrophobic interaction on the inner surface (Phe183 and Ile200 in E. coli), a salt bridge on the outer surface (Glu185 and Arg197) and a central leucine residue (Leu209). In RhlG, Trp222 corresponds to Leu209 in FabG, and a salt bridge between Arg194 and Asp213 replaces the Phe183-Ile200 interaction on the inner surface. These changes considerably reduce the interior volume and hydrophobicity of the inner cavity of the RhlG motif. Also, there are two additional proline residues in the RhlG motif (Pro196 and Pro207) compared with FabG that reduce the flexibility of the feature. One residue that is invariant in both RhlG and FabG is a methionine at the N terminus of helix α6(Met199 in RhlG and Met188 in E. coli FabG). In RhlG, this side chain extends into a small pocket flanked by the pyrophosphate of NADP+ and the backbone of residues 94–96. In FabG, helix α6 is in an open conformation, and the methionine side chain makes no interactions with the cofactor or the protein. Finally, it is apparent that the surfaces of FabG and RhlG have different electropotential characteristics (Fig. 7, B and C). Most notably, the positive potential associated with α4-β5 loop in FabG is absent in RhlG, and the hydrophobic inner surface of the α6-α7 substructure is less extensive in RhlG. These differences give rise to a different substrate docking interface and a more constricted active site tunnel in RhlG. Enzymatic Activity—The high degree of sequence similarity between RhlG and FabG (Fig. 3) led to the suggestion that RhlG is a β-ketoacyl reductase (21Campos-Garcia J. Caro A.D. Najera R. Miller-Maier R.M. Al-Tahhan R.A. Soberon-Chavez G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4442-4451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our RhlG structural analysis suggests that the ACP of fatty acid synthesis may not carry RhlG substrates because of the lack of the electropositive/hydrophobic ACP binding surface or docking site adjacent to the active site entrance that is characteristic of proteins that bind ACP (38Zhang Y.-M. Marrakchi H. White S.W. Rock C.O. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We assessed this point by measuring the activity of RhlG as a reductase using β-ketodecanoyl-ACP as substrate (Fig. 8, A and B). The in vitro assay detects formation of β-hydroxy-[1-14C]decanoyl-ACP, the product of FabG, by conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis. The specific activity of RhlG was 0.0245 pmol/min/μg, ∼2000-fold less active than that of FabG (49.7 pmol/min/μg). RhlG activity was not detected when NADH was substituted for NADPH in the assay (not shown). The stereochemistry of the product was inferred as β-d-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP based on the ability of purified E. coli FabZ of type I"

Acidification of these organelles is required for many cellular processes (maturation and processing of proteins, receptor-mediated endocytosis, coupled intracellular transport of small molecules, etc.). v-ATPases are large multimeric enzymes made up of several different subunits. These subunits are organized in two domains: a cytoplasmic domain V1 that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane domain V0 involved in proton translocation. V1 is composed of eight different subunits (A–H). V0 contains four to five proteolipid subunits c and single copies of subunits a, d, and c″ (1Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The a subunit of V0 is a 110-kDa integral membrane protein, with nine transmembrane domains located in its C-terminal half and a large N-terminal sector in the cytoplasm (3Leng X.-H. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14655-14661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Several isoforms of the a subunit have been identified. In yeast, the two a isoforms (Vph1p and Stv1p) are associated to vacuolar and Golgi/endosomal membranes, respectively (4Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W.

In mice, four different isoforms (a1–a4), encoded by different genes with tissue-specific expression, have been described (6Oka T. Murata Y. Namba M. Yoshimizu T. Toyomura T. Yamamoto A.

Three variants of a1 are generated by alternative mRNA splicing, with a1-I specifically expressed in brain, whereas a1-II and -III mRNAs, which lack the C-terminal exon C, were found in all other tested tissues (7Nishi T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17262-17266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diversity of the a subunit isoforms is not only important for tissue specificity and targeting to different membrane compartments; it could also result in the generation of v-ATPases with different functional properties (10Kawasaki-Nishi S.

Gérard V. Shiff G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1702-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). v-ATPase is present both in the presynaptic plasma membrane (13Morel N. Dedieu J.C. Philippe J.-M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4751-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and in the membrane of synaptic vesicles (14Stadler H. Tsukita S.

The large electrochemical H+ gradient generated by this enzyme, pH 5.2–5.5 inside the synaptic vesicles (16Michaelson D.M. Angel I.

V0 could also participate in the constitution of a fusion pore involved in membrane fusion (18Peters C. Bayer M.J. Bühler S. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mayer A.

Recently, in Drosophila nerve terminals, the V0 subunit a1 was shown to be required for evoked synaptic vesicle exocytotic fusion, independently of proton translocation (20Hiesinger P.R.

This could suggest the involvement of V0 domains with different a subunit isoforms in these two processes.In the present work, we studied the expression of different v-ATPase subunit a isoforms in rat neurons. We found that identified neurons coexpress isoforms a1 and a2 of subunit a. A new a1 splice variant was identified, a1-IV, that contains both exon N and exon C. Neurons express the two a1 splice variants that contain exon C, a1-I and a1-IV, whereas a1-II and a1-III are expressed by glial cells and in all tissues tested. The three different a subunits expressed by neurons, a1-I, a1-IV, and a2, are sorted to different neuronal membrane compartments. Only a1-I was specifically concentrated in nerve terminals.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRat Hippocampal Neuron Culture and Transfection—Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were performed essentially as described by Gosslin et al. (21Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Culturing Nerve Cells. 1998; (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA): 339-370Google Scholar). Hippocampi of 18-day-old rat embryos were removed and mechanically dissociated after a mild trypsin digestion. The cells were plated at medium density (17 or 34 × 103 cells/cm2 for immunofluorescence or transfection, respectively) onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and allowed to settle for 2 h. They were then transferred onto a glial cell monolayer in the neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen). Proliferation of non-neuronal cells was prevented by the addition, 1 day later, of cytosine arabinoside (final concentration, 5 μm). Most experiments were performed on cells kept for 14 days in vitro. The neurons were transfected at 7 days in vitro with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Isolation of cDNA Clones—RNA was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen) from various rat tissues (brain, kidney, liver, or adrenal medulla) or rat cells (hippocampal neurons or astroglial cells) in primary culture. It was used to synthetize first strand cDNAs using oligo(dT) priming and Moloney murine leukemia virus RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes). Then clones encoding the a1, a2, and a3 isoforms of rat v-ATPase subunit a, and the four a1 splice variants (a1-I, a1-II, a1-III, and a1-IV) were generated by PCR. Specific primers allowing the amplification of the entire coding sequence were designed based on the mouse a1, a2, and a3 isoform sequences and on partial sequences of rat genes (Infobiogen) encoding the a1 (NW_047339/Rn10_1859), a2 (NW_047375/Rn12_1896), a3 (NW_047563/Rn1_2085), and a4 (NW_047689/Rn4_2212) isoforms. Forward primers contained a 5′ extension with added restriction sites (KpnI + BglII for a1 variants, EcoRI for a2 and KpnI + EcoRI for a3). Reverse primers were extended in 3′ with the following restriction sites: XhoI for a1, NotI for a2, and BamHI for a3. We used cDNAs from brain to clone a1-I and a2, kidney for a1-II and a1-III, liver for a3, and hippocampal neurons in culture for a1-IV. cDNAs were amplified by PCR using Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (Finnzymes), cloned in pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. For expression of recombinant a1 and a2 subunits bearing an N-terminal FLAG tag, coding sequences were removed from pCR2.1 by restriction (BglII and XhoI for a1 and EcoRI for a2) and subcloned into the p3xFLAG-myc-CMV-24 expression vector (Sigma) between the BglII and SalI (a1) or EcoRI (a2) restriction sites.Patch Clamp Recording and Single Cell RT-PCR—Experiments were performed either on neurons in brain slices (in layer V of the visual cortex of 3-week-old rats) or on hippocampal neurons in primary culture. Whole cell currents were recorded with patch pipettes filled with 5 μl of RNase-free internal solution (140 mm KMeSO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH). The external solution contained 126 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 26 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH and constantly bubbled with a O2/CO2 (95/5) mix. The resistance of the patch pipette was 2–5 MΩ. Following whole cell recording, as much as possible of the cytoplasm was aspirated into the patch pipette. It was expelled (∼5 μl) into a 0.5-ml PCR tube containing 5 μl of the 2× reverse transcription mix, gently flicked, collected by spinning down, and kept in ice. The 2× reverse transcription mix contained 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.3, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm each of deoxynucleotides, 20 ng/μl random hexadeoxynucleotide primers (Promega), 4 units/μl RNAsin (Promega), and 20 units/μl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The tubes were successively incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C for 3 h, and 95 °C for 10 min. The RT products were amplified by two successive rounds of PCR. First, a multiplex PCR was performed directly in the same tubes by adding 90 μl of the PCR1 mix. This mix contained three couples of primers that hybridize with similar Tm (higher than 60 °C) to a1, a2, and c subunit cDNAs and designed to amplify DNA fragments of similar sizes (∼500 bp in the first series of experiments and 200 bp in the second one), each amplicon overlapping several exons and containing subunit specific restriction sites. Hot start amplification (40 cycles) was performed with the FastStart Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). A second isoform specific amplification was then performed in several parallel PCRs, starting from 1 μl of the PCR1 products (in 25-μl final PCR volume) and using one of the same primer pairs. To identify a1 splice variants, we also amplified PCR1 products by additional nested PCRs with one primer replaced by a new one that binds within the PCR1 a1 amplicons. PCR products were visualized after electrophoresis in ethidium bromide containing agarose gels. Specificity of the PCR amplification was checked after digestion with appropriate endonucleases.Immunofluorescence Imaging—Neurons were fixed after 14 days in vitro with 4% paraformaldehyde (diluted in 0.12 m PO4 and 0.3 m sucrose) for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized by 0.1% SDS (in the blocking medium) for 15 min before an hour of incubation in the blocking medium (1% sheep serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.1% Tween 20 containing Tris-buffered saline (TBST)). Primary antibodies were allowed to bind for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times in TBST, and bound antibodies were detected with secondary fluorescent antibodies (1 h of incubation at room temperature). The following antibodies were used: polyclonal anti-rat v-ATPase a1 subunit antibody from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany); anti-SV2 monoclonal antibody from Iowa University (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA); polyclonal anti-FLAG (F7425) and monoclonal anti-MAP2 (clone AP14) antibodies from Sigma; and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig and Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibodies from Molecular Probes. Neurons were then washed in TBST, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and imaged using a confocal microscope TCS SP2 (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). The images were coded green (FITC) and red (Alexa 568), giving yellow colocalization in merged images.RESULTSIsolation and Sequencing of cDNAs Encoding Isoforms of Rat v-ATPase Subunit a—Clones encoding the a1, a2, and a3 isoforms of rat v-ATPase subunit a and the four a1 splice variants (a1-I, a1-II, a1-III, and a1-IV) were generated by PCR. Primers were designed based on the sequences of the mouse a1, a2, and a3 isoforms (7Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6824-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3877-3881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on partial sequences of the corresponding rat genes. All of these clones were sequenced. The a1 isoform sequences we obtained (GenBank™ accession numbers DQ286421 to DQ286424) were identical with the published one (22Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Xie X.-S. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3877-3881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with only two base differences (a conservative Thr1086 to Gly change and Gly89 instead of Ala, leading to replacement of Glu29 by Gly).In mice, three alternatively spliced variants of the a1 isoform have been cloned (7Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6824-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). From rat brain, we cloned the a1-I variant (DQ286421), which contains the exon C (a 18-bp insertion in between exons 17 and 18 of the a1 cDNA). The a1-II (DQ286423) and a1-III (DQ286424) variants, cloned from rat kidney, do not contain the exon C and differ according to a 21-bp insertion in a1-II (exon N between exons 4 and 5). We looked for the forth possible splice variant of a1, a1-IV, containing both exon N and exon C. Starting from cDNAs of rat hippocampal neurons in primary culture, we isolated two clones encoding a1-IV (DQ286422), of 86 a1 clones. The a2 (DQ286425) and a3 (DQ286426) isoforms were cloned from brain and liver, respectively.Brain Expression of Subunit a Isoforms—The expression of the a1, a2, a3, and a4 isoforms and subunit c of v-ATPase in brain, kidney, liver, and adrenal medulla was studied by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1). Expression by hippocampal neurons and glial cells in culture were also compared. As expected (6Oka T. Murata Y. Namba M. Yoshimizu T. Toyomura T. Yamamoto A. Sun-Wada G.-H. Hamasaki N. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40050-40054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the kidney-specific a4 isoform was strongly expressed in kidney and not detected elsewhere. Expression of a3 was detected in all tissues tested, higher in liver, in agreement with Northern blot data from mice (7Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6824-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Neither glial cells nor hippocampal neurons in culture express detectable amounts of a3. The isoform a2 is ubiquitously expressed in all of the tissues and cells tested. Expression of a1 was detected in all tissues. It was much more highly expressed in neurons than in glial cells where it was hardly detectable. Neurons therefore express the a1 and a2 subunit a isoforms, but none of these isoforms is neuron-specific. Subunit c expression was similar in all samples except in glial cells, which showed only a faint signal. Because subunit c is encoded by a single gene in vertebrates (2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (985) Google Scholar), its expression likely reflects overall expression of the V0 domain of v-ATPase.Four a1 variants can be generated by alternative splicing of two small exons in a1 mRNAs. They differ according to the insertion of either exon C (a1-I), exon N (a1-II), neither (a1-III), or both (a1-IV). The expression of the a1 splice variants was studied by PCR (Fig. 2). In a first series of experiments (Fig. 2A), we used a combination of PCR primers that allows the specific amplification of each a1 splice variant, as demonstrated using the four corresponding plasmids. The exon C containing variants, a1-I and a1-IV, are expressed in brain and neurons and to some extent in the adrenal medulla. The a1-II and a1-III splice variants are expressed in all tissues tested, but brain expression is much lower than that of kidney or liver. Glial cells express a1-II and a1-III. Neurons express a1-I and a1-IV, the small amplification of the a1-II and -III variants from the neuronal sample being most probably due to some contaminating glial cells (see also Fig. 4).FIGURE 2Tissue specificity of a1 alternative splice variants expression. Total RNAs from the indicated rat tissues or cells (see Fig. 1) were retrotranscribed and normalized at constant v-ATPase subunit c expression (not shown). A, PCR was performed with four pairs of primers (shown in the diagram) that hybridize either in exon N (52 forward primer) or exon C (53 reverse primer) or that bind only when exons N or C are absent (51 forward and 61 reverse primers, respectively). As shown using specific plasmids encoding a1-I (I), a1-II (II), a1-III (III), and a1-IV (IV), each primer pair allows PCR amplification of a single a1 variant: primers 51-53 for a1-I, 52-61 for a1-II, 51-61 for a1-III, and 52-53 for a1-IV. B, PCR was performed with primers binding (as indicated in the diagram) on each side of exon N (primers 33-34, forward and reverse primers, respectively) or of exon C (42-2, forward and reverse primers). This allows amplification with similar efficacy of two amplicons of slightly different size, corresponding to variants that possess or do not contain the alternative exon (larger and smaller band, respectively). Plasmids encoding a1-I (I) or a1-II (II) were amplified in parallel to tissue samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4The a1 and a2 isoform expressions are differently regulated during neuritogenesis. RNAs were extracted from the same hippocampal neuron preparation after 2 or 14 days in vitro, reverse-transcribed, and normalized at constant β-actin expression. Levels of cDNA in aliquots of ×1, ×3, and ×9 increasing concentrations were compared by semi-quantitative PCRs. A, detection of cDNAs encoding the a1 (a1) and a2 (a2) isoforms, subunit c (c), and the vesicular glutamate transporter type 1 (VGlut1). B, detection of cDNAs encoding the a1 splice variants, with the primer pairs used in Fig. 2A. The corresponding plasmids (plasm.; 4 pg each) were amplified in parallel to illustrate that detection of a1-I required fewer PCR cycles than a1-IV and that a1-II and a1-III are hardly visible even after overamplification. DIV, days in vitro.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In a second series of experiments (Fig. 2B), we compared the expression of the different a1 splice variants. PCRs were performed using two pairs of primers (primers 33-34 and 42-2) that bind on each side of the site of insertion of exon N or exon C (respectively). They allowed, as shown using plasmids encoding a1-I and a1-II (Fig. 2B), the amplification of fragments of slightly different sizes according to the presence or absence of the corresponding exon. With primers 33–34, DNA fragments of 176 and 155 bp were amplified containing or devoid of exon N, respectively. From kidney, liver, and adrenal medulla, the two fragments were similarly amplified. From brain, glial cells, and neurons, the two bands are detected, but the 155-bp one is much more intense. With primers 42-2, plasmids containing or without exon C led to amplification of DNA fragments of 175 and 157 bp, respectively. A single 157-bp band was visualized with kidney, liver, and glial cells, showing that they express mostly the a1-II and -III variants that do not contain exon C. From brain and neurons in culture, only the 175-bp fragment was detected that corresponds to the exon C containing the a1-I and -IV variants. From adrenal medulla, the two fragments were amplified. All together, data from Fig. 2B show that a1-I expression is much higher than that of a1-IV in neurons and in the brain; glial cells mainly express a1-III and to a lower extent a1-II, whereas the expression of these two variants is similar in kidney and liver; finally, the four variants are expressed in adrenal medulla.Three Isoforms of the a Subunit Are Coexpressed in a Single Neuron— Coexpression of the a1-I, a1-IV, and a2 isoforms in hippocampal neurons in culture could reflect the existence of several subpopulations of neurons, each expressing a different subunit a. Alternatively, each individual neuron could coexpress the three isoforms. To address this question, we performed single-cell RT-PCRs. Cytoplasm was harvested from individual identified neurons and patch-clamped in the whole cell configuration by aspiration through the patch pipette. This was done either on pyramidal neurons in brain slices (in layer V of the visual cortex) or on hippocampal neurons in primary culture. After random-primed reverse transcription, cDNAs encoding subunits a1, a2, and c were amplified simultaneously in a first PCR. Further specific amplifications of each subunit or splice variant were obtained in second parallel PCRs (PCR2). Fig. 3 (A and B) presents results from a typical hippocampal neuron after 14 days in culture. The neuron was patch-clamped in the whole cell configuration, its resting membrane potential was measured (–65 mV), and its response to a square depolarizing pulse was recorded (evoked action potentials are shown in Fig. 3A). By RT-PCR on an aliquot of its cytoplasm, this neuron was shown to express subunit c, the a1 and a2 isoforms (Fig. 3B). The a1 amplicon comprises the site of exon N insertion. Two DNA fragments were amplified with a1 primers, where the smaller and abundant one corresponds to a splice variant without exon N, whereas the larger one contains exon N. Coexpression of two a1 splice variants containing or not containing exon N was directly demonstrated in two nested parallel PCRs using the same forward primer that hybridizes upstream of exon N insertion site and two reverse primers that bind either in exon N (+N) or only when exon N is absent (–N). These variants most likely correspond to a1-I and a1-IV (see later). The specificity of each amplification product has been verified by digestion with appropriate endonucleases that generated restriction digest products of the expected size (Fig. 3B, right panel).FIGURE 3Coexpression of different subunit a variants by individual neurons detected by single-cell RT-PCR. A, an hippocampal neuron, after 14 days in vitro, was patch-clamped, and its membrane potential was measured. A train of action potentials (upper trace) was elicited in response to a square depolarizing current pulse (lower trace). B, cytoplasm from the neuron shown in A was harvested through the patch pipette, and mRNAs were reverse transcribed. CDNAs encoding v-ATPase subunits a1, a2, and c were amplified by PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). Expression of a1, a2, and c subunits was detected (a1, a2, and c, respectively, in the left panel). Splice variants of a1 containing exon N (+N) or without N (–N) were both expressed. Specificity of the amplified products was checked by restriction (right panel) 0, without restriction; B, BamHI; P, PvuII; D, BstNI). C, in this typical experiment, single-cell RT-PCR was performed in parallel on cytoplasm samples from 17 identified hippocampal neurons. Expression of the a1 splice variants with (a1+N) or without (a1–N) exon N insertion, isoform a2 (a2), and subunit c (c) was detected as ∼200-bp PCR products. D, control experiment performed in the conditions used for the single-cell RT-PCR experiment shown in C. Six identical aliquots (aliquots 1–6) of total brain RNAs (1 pg) were reverse transcribed in parallel and, after duplication (lanes A and B), cDNAs were submitted to PCR amplification. A stochastic all-or-none detection of mRNAs encoding v-ATPase subunits a1 with (a1+N) or without (a1–N) exon N, and a2 is observed in these conditions, whereas the more abundant subunit c mRNAs (c) are always amplified.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In each experiment, several neuronal samples (12–18 samples) were harvested and processed in parallel. The results of an experiment on hippocampal neurons after 14 days in vitro are shown (Fig. 3C). Because the amount of cytoplasm that is aspirated from each neuron is difficult to estimate, expression of subunit c was taken as an internal control. Subunit c mRNAs are expected to be rather abundant in neurons; they are frequently found in expressed sequence tag data banks, V0 contains several copies of subunit c, which is encoded by a single gene in vertebrates (2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Only neuronal samples that gave positive results for c were considered (98 c+/116 harvested neurons, from seven different experiments). Considering all of the experiments, expression of the a1 isoform was detected in 80% of neurons (78 a1+/98 c+ neurons, seven experiments). Two series of experiments were performed, with primers that hybridize on both sides of the alternative splicing sites; in the first series (five experiments), we amplified 500-bp DNA fragments that contained an exon C insertion site; in the second series (two experiments), we amplified 200-bp DNA fragments containing the exon N site.

Histochemistry. 1978; 56: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition to its prominent glucose-lowering action, GIP promotes pro-insulin gene expression, proliferation of β-cells, and β-cell survival (2Trumper A. Trumper K. Trusheim H. Arnold R. Goke B.

We are interested in assessing the importance of the structure of GIP and its analogues in determining their biological activity. In this study, we present the three-dimensional solution structure of native GIP in water, as determined by NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling. The structure of GIP consists of an α-helical motif between residues Ser11 and Gln29, unlike the other major incretin hormone, GLP-1, which mainly adopts a random coil conformation, under physiological conditions (15Chang X. Keller D. Bjorn S. Led J.J. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2001; 39: 477-483Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Previous solution structural studies carried out in our research laboratory showed that the GIP-(1–30)amide also adopts a random coil conformation when dissolved in water, whereas in a TFE-d3/water-mixed solvent, the peptide showed a well defined full-length α-helix (16Alaña I.

The peptides were purified to homogeneity by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography, and their structural identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (18Gault V.A.

Test incubations were performed by a 20-min incubation at 37 °C in 1.0 ml in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5.6 mmol/liter glucose and supplemented with a range of concentrations (10–12 to 10–6 mol/liter) of GIP peptides. Insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay (20Flatt P.R. Bailey C.J. Diabetologia. 1981; 20: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar).CD Spectroscopy—CD experiments were carried out at 20 °C on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter, with wavelengths in the ranges of 180–250 and 250–340 nm, for the far- and near-UV, respectively. For studies in the far-UV, GIP samples were dissolved in acetate buffer (20 mm, pH 4.0, 5.0), phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 6.0, 7.0, 8.0), or in water (unbuffered, pH 6.8, uncorrected) for a final peptide concentration of 30 μm. For the near-UV, GIP samples were dissolved in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.0) or in water (unbuffered, pH 3.0, uncorrected) for a final peptide concentration of 0.95 mm. The peptide concentration was determined using the UV absorbance at 280 nm and an extinction coefficient of 13,980 m–1 cm–1, as calculated with ProtParam (21Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. 2005; (Humana Press, Totowa, NJ): 571-607Crossref Google Scholar). Experiments in the far-UV were performed using a response of 2 s and a scanning speed of 50 nm/min, by accumulation of 15 scans. In the near-UV, a response of 0.5 s, a scanning speed of 20 nm/min, and an accumulation of 50 scans were used. In all cases, a bandwidth of 1 nm and a data pitch of 0.2 nm were used. All samples were analyzed in a 0.1-cm cell. All the spectra were baseline-corrected with their corresponding buffer solution or water. The calculation of the helical content was carried out with the program K2D (22Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F.

An ∼2 mm peptide sample was prepared using a 9:1 mixture of H2O:D2O (600 μl, pH 3.3, uncorrected). Two-dimensional phase-sensitive DQF-COSY (26Shaka A.J. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 51: 169-173Google Scholar), TOCSY (27Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar), and NOESY (28Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) spectra were acquired with a relaxation delay of 1.4 s, an acquisition time of 0.40 s, and a spectral width of 10 kHz. TOCSY spectra were acquired with 30- and 80-ms mixing times. NOESY spectra were acquired with mixing times of 200 ms. All DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments were performed with 16, 8, and 16 transients for each of 2,048 t1 increments into 8,192 complex data points, respectively. All spectra were zero-filled to 4,096 data points in F1 and apodized using a shifted squared sinebell window function in both dimensions. The signal of 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic acid was used as an internal chemical shift reference at 0.0 ppm. All data were acquired and processed using Bruker XWINNMR (version 3.5).Structure Calculations—Two-dimensional NMR spectra were analyzed with SPARKY (version 3.110) (29Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. 2005; (University of California, San Francisco, CA)Google Scholar). The integrals of the NOEs were converted into distance constraints with CALIBA (30Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) according to three proton classes, namely backbone, flexible side chain, and methyl protons. Pseudoatoms were also introduced for protons that could not be stereospecifically assigned (31Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Structure calculations were carried out using CYANA (version 1.0.6) (30Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). 200 random structures were generated, and their energy was minimized using the anneal protocol in CYANA, including 10,000 steps of simulated annealing, as well as 5,000 steps of conjugate-gradient minimization. During the CYANA calculations, distance constraints were weighted using the force constant kNOE = 1 kJ mol–1 Å–2. The 20 structures with lowest target function values were subjected to 5,000 steps of unconstrained Powell minimization with SYBYL (version 6.8.1) using the Tripos SYBYL Force Field (32Tripos Inc.

J. Magn. Res. 1988; 79: 493-512Google Scholar) within SYBYL. The calculation was performed using a model-free approach, overall correlation times of 1–10 ns, and a Gaussian line shape. A fixed normalization method was also used along with the three-site methyl jump model to calculate methyl distances. Further CORMA simulations were carried out for the five lowest energy conformations.RESULTSFig. 1 shows the effects of GIP and GIP peptides on insulin secretion, from clonal pancreatic BRIN BD11 cells. From this figure, it is clear that native GIP dose-dependently (10–12-10–6 m) stimulated insulin secretion when compared with control incubations (5.6 mm glucose alone) (p < 0.001). Similarly, GIP-(1–42)Ala6 also stimulated insulin secretion when compared with control (p < 0.01 to p < 0.001), however not to the same extent as native GIP (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01). All other GIP peptides displayed decreased insulinotropic activity (1.2–1.9-fold decrease; p < 0.05 to p < 0.001) when compared with both glucose control and GIP.The influence of pH on the secondary structure of GIP was studied by means of CD spectroscopy. 30 μm GIP samples in 20 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.0, 5.0) and phosphate buffer (pH 6.0, 7.0, 8.0) were analyzed in the far-UV (Fig. 2A), as well as an unbuffered 30 μm sample of GIP in water (pH 6.8, uncorrected) (Fig. 2B). The helical content of GIP gradually increased from 10 to 26%, from pH 8.0 to 4.0, respectively. The helical content of the buffered sample at pH 7.0 was 20%, whereas that of the unbuffered sample was 7%.FIGURE 2Far-UV CD Spectra of GIP.

B shows the CD spectrum of an unbuffered GIP sample (pH 6.8, uncorrected), as well as the spectra of GIP samples in 20 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for comparison.

The DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra provided a basis for the identification of individual residue spin systems. Except for the N-terminal residue Tyr1, all other resonances were clearly observed in the TOCSY spectrum. The chemical shifts of methyl resonances were used to identify the alanine, isoleucine, and leucine residues, as well as a unique valine residue. The 2 serine residues, Ser8 and Ser11, were identified by their distinctive βH proton resonances. Other spin systems could not be distinguished due to the similarity of their AMX spin pattern. Discrimination of non-unique residues and identification of all other unidentified spin systems was achieved by direct comparison of the TOCSY and NOESY spectra. The 2 glycine residues, Gly4 and Gly31, showed strong, prominent cross-peaks in the TOCSY and NOESY spectra. Alanine, glycine, isoleucine, serine, threonine, and valine residues were used as starting points for the identification of sequence-specific resonance assignments. The connectivities of Ala2 to Asp9 were clearly identified using the αiH/Ni+1H and βiH/Ni+1H cross-peaks in the fingerprint region of the NOESY spectrum (Fig. 3). Distinctive βH/NH intra-residue and methyl connectivities were used to identify the connectivities of Ser11/Ile12, Ile12/Ala13, Met14/Asp15, and Lys16/Ile17. The 2 glutamine residues, Gln19 and Gln20, were identified using the backbone and βH/NH connectivities of Asp21. The unique Val23 was used to identify the spin systems of Phe22 and Asn24. The ring protons of Trp25 showed clear connectivities to αH and βH protons. The 2 leucine residues, Leu26 and Leu27, were identified by the resonances of the adjacent residues, Trp25 and Ala28. The well resolved methyl resonance of Ala28 and the prominent αH resonances of Gly31 were used to identify Gln29 and Lys32, respectively. Identification of the Asn34, Asp35, and Trp36 spin systems was made via the backbone and βiH/NHi+1 resonance connectivities of their neighboring residues. Aromatic and side-chain protons to inter-residueαH andβH cross-peaks were observed for Trp36 and His38. The prominent methyl resonances of Ile40 and Thr41 were used to identify the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain. Sequence-specific resonance assignments were completed by identification of backbone, αH, βH, aromatic, and side-chain resonance connectivities between immediately neighboring residues.FIGURE 3Fingerprint region of the NOESY spectrum.

Strong αiH/βi+3H medium range connectivities were observed suggesting the presence of an α-helix for residues Ser11–Gln29, except those between Ala13/Lys16, Asp15/His18, His18/Asp21, Asp21/Asn24, due to chemical shift degeneracy or signal overlap. Clear medium range αiH/Ni+3H connectivities for residues between Ser11 and Lys30 were also identified, except between Ala13/Lys16 and Gln20/Val23, due to overlapping. Distance constraints derived from the NOESY data were used for structure calculations (Fig. 4). 200 random structures were generated using the CYANA protocol, and the 20 conformations that best fit the experimental constraints were subjected to additional unconstrained energy minimization. The main structural feature of the peptide is a right-handed α-helix between residues Ser11 and Gln29, as determined by MOLMOL and PROCHECK-NMR. Best fit superposition of the backbone atoms between residues Ser11 and Gln29 of the 20 calculated structures is presented in Fig. 5.FIGURE 4Short and medium range connectivities of GIP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Best fit superposition of the backbone atoms between residues Ser11 and Gln29 of the 20 selected conformations of GIP (left) and a representative structure of the bundle (right).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Simulated spectra were obtained for the five conformations with the lowest energy from the final set of 20 energy-minimized conformations, with overall correlation time values of 1–10 ns.

Manhart S. Speck M. Pederson R.A. Demuth H.U. McIntosh C.H. Life Sci. 2004; 75: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, seven synthetic peptides with a single-residue replacement with an alanine in each of the first seven positions were synthesized to evaluate specific residues that play a role in insulin secretion. In comparison with GIP-(1–42), GIP-(1–42)Ala6 was the only analogue to show insulin-secreting activity similar to that of the native peptide (p < 0.001) when compared with glucose control; however, its insulinotropic ability was noticeably reduced. When compared against glucose control, the remaining alanine scan peptides (GIP-(1–42)Ala1, GIP-(1–42)Ala3, GIP-(1–42)Ala4, GIP-(1–42)Ala5, and GIP-(1–42)Ala7) showed reduced or no insulinotropic activity, leading us to believe that the amino acid residues replaced are in fact vital to the insulin-releasing activity of GIP and that the N terminus is of great importance in glucose-dependent insulin release. Interestingly, GIP-(1–42)Ala3 and GIP-(1–42)Ala4 showed such a reduced level of insulinotropic activity that these may be considered for antagonistic studies in the future, especially since it is well known that GIP-(3–42) is a GIP-receptor antagonist (10Gault V.A. Parker J.C. Harriott P. Flatt P.R. O'Harte F.P. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 175: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). With such an inactivation of insulin release when glutamic acid in position 3 is replaced, it may suggest further that position 3 is of great importance in the insulinotropic potency of GIP.A sample of native GIP was also subjected to basic solubility studies. The peptide was solubilized in Tris buffer (10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) and analyzed by spectrophotometry combined with light scattering. The results showed a single UV peak at 280 nm, revealing that GIP is monomeric under these conditions.As can be seen from Fig. 2A, the CD spectra obtained in the far-UV at pH values 4.0–8.0 are characteristic of samples with some degree of helical secondary structure, whereas the spectrum acquired for the unbuffered sample (Fig. 2B) suggests an irregular secondary structure (37Kelly S.M. Jess T.J. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar). Analysis of the spectra with the program K2D reveals an increase in helical content with decreasing pH. We have also found that GIP is 20% helical in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, increasing up to 26% when in 20 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0. These results are in contrast with studies of Manhart et al. (38Manhart S. Hinke S.A. McIntosh C.H. Pederson R.A. Demuth H.U. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3081-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), in which they reported a helical content of 11% for GIP in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. Studies in the near-UV (results not shown), carried out for 0.95 mm GIP samples in phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.0) and unbuffered (pH 3.0, uncorrected), show spectra similar to those found for folded proteins (37Kelly S.M. Jess T.J. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar). The results could be interpreted as self-association, the adoption of a regular tertiary structure, or a combination of both. However, as our spectrophotometric and light-scattering experiments show that GIP is monomeric, then the CD results should reflect the adoption of a regular tertiary structure by GIP. The near-UV CD results could be valuable in future studies as a template of the tertiary structure of native GIP (39Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2000; 1: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar).The NMR data obtained with the 800- and 900-MHz spectrometers were used for resonance identification and structure calculation. Two-dimensional DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra were used for spin system identification. TOCSY and NOESY data were used for full and unambiguous assignment of individual and sequence-specific resonances. Some side-chain and most of the aromatic protons could not be assigned due to signal overlap. Identification of βH/NH, NiH/Ni+1H cross-peaks, and aromatic proton connectivities to neighboring residues supported the reliability of the sequence-specific resonance assignments. The large number of well spread NOEs observed suggested that GIP is in a folded state. The presence of αiH/Ni+3H NOE connectivities in the fingerprint region of the NOESY spectrum and of stronger αiH/βi+3H NOEs in the range of Tyr10–Gln29 revealed the occurrence of elements of α-helical secondary structure.The helical character of GIP in water is further supported by the chemical shift index (40Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar), which suggested the presence of two helical segments between residues Ser8–Lys16 and Gln19–Lys30. It was noted that the chemical shifts of all the isoleucine residues did not follow the predicted chemical shift index pattern. However, the absence of medium range αiH/Ni+3H and αiH/βi+3H connectivities in the NOESY spectrum in the range Ser8–Tyr10, and their presence between residues Lys16 and Gln19, leads us to suggest a continuous α-helical segment between residues 11 and 29. In addition, all of the calculated structures showed a continuous helical segment in this region of the peptide chain. Analysis of the calculated structures revealed that the GIP in water adopts an α-helical motif between residues Ser11 and Gln29 for most of the calculated conformations. These results were confirmed by the secondary structure predicted within the MOLMOL package. Further analysis of the structures with PROCHECK-NMR showed that more than 98% of the residues lie within allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1).TABLE 1Structural statistics of GIP in waterNOE constraints used for calculations450NOE violations >0.2 Å23Ramachandran plot regions (%) Most favored59.3 Allowed33.9 Generously allowed5.0Mean atomic r.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.

Open table in a new tab To assess the quality of the calculated structures, the fingerprint region of the NOESY data was simulated and compared with the experimentally obtained spectrum. Simulated spectra showed an optimum level of agreement when a correlation time of 2 ns was used (Fig. 6). The fingerprint region of the simulated spectrum showed few additional cross-peaks with varying intensities. These peaks are mainly αiH/Ni+4H connectivities that arise from protons of residues that are part of the helical segment, such as α17H/N21H, and α20H/N24H. Also, several αiH/Ni+3H medium range connectivities from residues within the helical region appeared stronger in the simulation, whereas αiH/Ni+2H cross-peaks were weaker. This could be due to the fact that CORMA calculates NOE intensities by assuming a rigid backbone structure. Therefore, the simulated spectrum showed weak connectivities, such as αiH/Ni+4H, that are difficult to observe or can be seen at a lower threshold in a standard NOESY spectrum for smaller peptides. Cross-peaks with varying intensities were also observed for some side-chain resonances in the simulated spectrum. This is due to the motion of the side chain protons, which would normally be expected to be averaged in the experimental data. Since the fit between the experimentally and the theoretically calculated spectra is good, it may be concluded that the low energy structure used for the simulation satisfies the experimentally derived distance constraints; hence, the NOESY peak assignments and distance constraint calibration were also accurately carried out. These results confirmed that the calculated structure shows a true picture of the peptide in water.The root mean square deviation value of 0.67 ± 0.26 Å obtained after superposition of the"

In this study, we further investigated the intracellular mechanism of action of MNSFβ in macrophage cell line, Raw 264.7 cells. We present evidence that MNSFβ·Bcl-G complex associates with ERKs in non-stimulated Raw 264.7. We found that MNSFβ·Bcl-G directly bound to ERKs and inhibited ERK activation by MEK1. In Raw 264.7 cells treated with MNSFβ small interfering RNA (siRNA) lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ERK1/2 activation was enhanced and LPS-induced JNK and p38 activation was unaffected. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of MNSFβ increased tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) expression at mRNA and protein levels in LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells. Finally, we found that transfection with MNSFβ expression construct resulted in a significant inhibition of LPS-induced ERK activation and TNFα production. Co-transfection experiments with MNSFβ and Bcl-G greatly enhanced this inhibition. Collectively, these findings indicate that MNSFβ might be implicated in the macrophage response to LPS.

Tanigawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3463-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MNSFβ cDNA encodes a protein of 133 amino acids consisting of a ubiquitin-like protein (36% identity with ubiquitin) fused to the ribosomal protein S30.

We observed that MNSFβ siRNA increased ERK activation and TNFα production by LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells. We will show that the MNSFβ is implicated in the regulation of the ERK-MAPK cascade.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p38, ERK1, and JNK (SAPK) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK were from Promega, and rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to MNSFβ and Bcl-G were prepared as described (15Nakamura M. Xavier R.M. Tsunematsu T. Tanigawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4, containing 1 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) extracts of Raw cells were precleared with 50 μl of anti-rabbit IgG beads for 1 h on ice. Subsequently, 5 μg of primary antibody to MNSFβ or ERK1 was added to precleared lysates and incubated on ice for additional 1 h. Samples were then incubated overnight at 4°C with 50 μl of anti-rabbit IgG bead. The beads were washed with five times with RIPA buffer, and immunoprecipitates were released from the beads by 10 min boiling in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) buffer. Immunoblotting was carried out with anti-ERK1 or anti-Bcl-G antibody. A rabbit IgG TrueBlot was employed as a second antibody.Western Blot Analysis—The protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10% acrylamide), resolved by electrophoresis, and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C in a Tris-buffered saline solution with 5% milk to block nonspecific binding sites. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies for a minimum of 2 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (Tris/Tween). Horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in Tris/Tween with 5% milk. Labeled proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).In-gel Digestion and MALDI-TOF—The 33.5-kDa MNSFβ adduct was purified to homogeneity from Raw cell extracts by a combination of ion exchange chromatography, anti-MNSFβ affinity chromatography and hydroxylapatite chromatography as described previously (19Nakamura M. Tanigawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Ingel digestion and MALDI-TOF were performed as described (19Nakamura M. Tanigawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, silver-stained spots were cut out of the gels and digested with 5 μg/ml V8 protease (Sigma) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Peptide mass fingerprinting was performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences/PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager-DE-RP MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The resulting sets of peptide masses were then used to search the NCBI data base for potential matches.GST Pulldown Assay—Purified MNSFβ·Bcl-G (0.5 μg) was incubated with 2 μg of GST or GST-ERK2 bound to GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4°C with rocking followed by extensive washing of complexes. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli. MNSFβ·Bcl-G complex was separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-MNSFβ antibody. Peptide competition assay was performed by using synthetic peptides derived from ERK2 (residues 181–199, including a MEK dual phosphorylation site: FLTEYVATRWYRAPEIMLN; residues 318–338, C-teminal: SDEPIAEAPFKFDMELDDLPK). GST-ERK2 (2 μg) was immobilized on GSH-Sepharose and incubated with MNSFβ·Bcl-G (0.5 μg) in the presence of 200 μm peptide.Peptide Affinity Chromatography—For affinity chromatography on peptide columns, synthetic peptides described above were coupled to Hi-Trap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated agarose columns (Amersham Biosciences). Purified MNSFβ·Bcl-G was incubated with peptide columns, washed extensively, and eluted with 50 mm triethylamine, pH. 11. The eluates were neutralized with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and detected by immunoblotting with anti-MNSFβ antibody.Kinase Assay—To examine the effect of MNSFβ·Bcl-G complex on ERK activation, MEK kinase assay was performed. Activated GST-MEK1 (Upstate Biotechnology) was incubated with unphosphorylated GST-ERK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence or absence of MNSFβ·Bcl-G complex (0.5–2 μg) in a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 μm sodium fluoride, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 500 μm ATP, 75 mm, for 30 min at 30°C. The reaction mixture was immunoblotted with using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody.Cell Culture, the siRNAs, and Transfection of Cells—The Raw 264.7 macrophage-like cell line (ATCC TIB-71) was cultured routinely in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2. SiRNA duplexes (siRNAs) were synthesized and purified by Qiagen, Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). The target sequences were as follows: MNSFβ siRNA-332 (5′-CCCAAGGTGGCCAAACAGGAA-3′), MNSFβ siRNA-437 (5′-CCACCCTGCCATGCTAATAAA-3′), Bcl-G siRNA (5′-AGCATAATGGTTGGTAATTAA-3′. Scramble siRNA directed against 5′-GGACTCGACGCAATGGCGTCA-3′ was the negative control. Cells were treated with siRNA according to the instructions provided with the RNAiFect™ transfection reagent (Qiagen, Inc.). Raw 264.7 cells (1.2 × 105) were treated with 3 μg of siRNA in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the presence of the RNAiFect™ transfection reagent. After a 48-h incubation at 37°C, the medium containing the mixture of RNAiFectTM and siRNA was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that contained 10% FBS and cells were incubated for a further 24 h.Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RT-PCR was performed for 30 cycles as described previously (19Nakamura M. Tanigawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The PCR primers used to detect mRNA are as follows: MNSFβ, CGCCCAGGAACTACACACC (sense) and GCCTGCTACTTCCAGAGTGG (antisense) (222 bp); Bcl-G, CCCAAGCTCTCCAGAACAAG (sense) and CTGAGCTCGGATCTCCTTTG (antisense) (213 bp). All short amplified PCR products were isolated and sequenced to verify their identity. PCR products were separated in 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. In some experiments, signals were quantitated by densitometry and optical densities for MNSFβ and Bcl-G were normalized to the corresponding values for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Mutagenesis and Transfection—Mutant MNSFβ (G76A) was generated by replacing the codon for glycine 76 with the codon for alanine by utilizing QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). cDNAs encoding MNSFβ and Bcl-G were subcloned into the vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen Corp.). Transient DNA transfections were conducted using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with the protocol provided by the manufacturer and 8 μg of plasmid DNA per 6-well plate.Quantification of Cytokines—Murine cytokines were measured using sandwich ELISA (R&D System, Minneapolis, MN). The lower limits of detection for the cytokines were TNFα, 10 pg/ml; RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), 20 pg/ml.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared following the methods of Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were detected using biotin end-labeled double-stranded DNA probes. The sequence for the NFκB site was: GGGGACTTTCCC. Oligonucleotides were labeled in a reaction using terminal deoxynucleotide transferase and biotin-14-dCTP (Pierce). The binding reaction was performed using the LightShift kit according to the manufacture's instructions (Pierce). The reaction products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5% Tris borate-EDTA, transferred onto a nylon membrane, and fixed on the membrane by UV cross-linking. The biotin-labeled probe was detected using chemiluminescence (LightShift kit; Pierce).RESULTSMNSFβ Complex Is Associated with ERKs—It has been reported that ubiquitin-like protein, ISG15, covalently binds to ERK1 (8Malakhov M.P. Keun Il Kim K.I. Malakhova O.A. Jacobs B.S. Borden E.C. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16608-16613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Thus, first we addressed whether MNSFβ could associate with the MAPK family including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. Cell lysates were prepared from non-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells and immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against MNSFβ, and associated proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis by using anti-ERK1, anti-JNK, and anti-p38 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, MNSFβ associated with ERKs, but not with other members of the MAPK family, under non-stimulated conditions. It should be noted that anti-ERK1 polyclonal antibodies recognize both the 44-kDa ERK1 and the 42-kDa ERK2. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with normal IgG followed by Western blot analysis revealed no detectable association of ERKs, indicating the specificity of MNSFβ with ERKs. In addition, converse immunoprecipitation with anti-ERK1 antibody and immunoblot analysis with anti-MNSFβ antibody confirmed the association between ERKs and the MNSFβ adduct (Fig. 1B). It should be pointed out that anti-MNSFβ antibody does not recognize free 8.5-kDa MNSFβ in murine T helper type 2 clone, D.10 cells (18Nakamura M. Tanigawa Y. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In Raw macrophages as well as D.10 cells, anti-MNSFβ antibody recognized several bands including a band of 33.5-kDa protein (Fig. 1A). We have demonstrated that Bcl-G, a novel proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, is post-translationally modified by MNSFβ (19Nakamura M. Tanigawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed likely that the 33.5-kDa MNSFβ adduct was the MNSFβ·Bcl-G complex. To determine this, we carried out Western blot analysis with anti-Bcl-G antibody. As depicted in Fig. 1B, antibody directed against Bcl-G reacted with the 33.5-kDa MNSFβ adduct, indicative of the covalent interaction of MNSFβ and Bcl-G as described (19Nakamura M. Tanigawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction between MNSFβ and Bcl-G in Raw cells, MALDI-TOF was performed. The 33.5-kDa MNSFβ adduct was purified to homogeneity from Raw cell lysates by a combination of ion exchange chromatography, anti-MNSFβ affinity chromatography, and hydroxylapatite chromatography as described (19Nakamura M. Tanigawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The purified MNSFβ adduct was digested by V8 protease and subjected to MALDI-MS analysis. Table 1 shows the peptide masses of observed by MALDI-TOF mass fingerprinting of 33.5-kDa MNSFβ adduct purified from Raw cells. The resulting sets of peptide masses were then used to search the NCBI data base for potential matches, confirming the MNSFβ adduct as MNSFβ·Bcl-G complex. MNSFβ may conjugate to Bcl-G with a linkage between the C-terminal Gly-74 and Lys-110, as described (19Nakamura M. Tanigawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results indicate that covalent MNSFβ·Bcl-G complex can specifically associate with ERKs in unstimulated Raw macrophages.TABLE 1Assignments of peptide fragments from a Staphylococcus V8 protease digest of the 33.5-kDa MNSFβ adductProteinMass (MH+)ResiduesSequenceObservedCalculatedBcl-G930.0930.1208-215QIISKIVE1283.71283.5173-184VIHSQGGSKLKE1396.81396.6112-124IRAQGPQGPFPVE1598.91598.7305-317YFSPWVQQNGGWE2065.42065.4288-304NHPMNRMLGFGTKYLRE2350.02349.881-100KNISLGKKKSSWRTLFRVAEMNSFβ1241.11241.438-49DQVVLLAGSPLE1412.31411.620-32TVAQIKDHVASLEMNSFβ · Bcl-G2934.62934.4104GLPSSPKEIRAQGPQGPFPVE124|67VAGRMLGG74 Open table in a new tab MNSFβ·Bcl-G Directly Binds to ERK2—We next investigated the nature of the binding of MNSFβ·Bcl-G to ERKs. Purified MNSFβ·Bcl-G complex was incubated with GST or GST-ERK2 bound to GSH-Sepharose. The bead matrices were extensively washed before eluting bound proteins off of the bead matrices. MNSFβ·Bcl-G complex was separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-MNSFβ antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, MNSFβ·Bcl-G bound to GST-ERK2 but not to GST. Excess peptide for the MEK dual phosphorylation site of ERK2 inhibited 50–60% this association, compared with a control peptide (mapping at the C terminus of ERK2), indicating that MNSFβ·Bcl-G might bind to near the phosphorylation site. To confirm these results, we carried out peptide affinity chromatography. MNSFβ·Bcl-G was incubated with peptides derived from ERK2 immobilized on agarose columns. Bound and eluted MNSFβ·Bcl-G was resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-MNSFβ antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 2B, MNSFβ·Bcl-G bound to a column of immobilized the competitive peptide but not of control peptide, albeit this binding was not complete.FIGURE 2A, MNSFβ·Bcl-G directly associates with ERK and regulates its activity. GST pulldown assay: purified MNSFβ·Bcl-G was incubated with GST or GST-ERK2 bound to GSH-Sepharose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-MNSFβ antibody (top panel). Western blot analysis for GST was performed to confirm equal loading of proteins (bottom panel). The peptide competition assay was carried out by using peptide for the MEK dual phosphorylation site of ERK2. The data represent one of three independent experiments yielding similar results. B, peptide affinity chromatography. For affinity chromatography on peptide columns, synthetic peptides derived from ERK2 were coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated agarose columns. MNSFβ·Bcl-G was incubated with peptide columns, washed extensively, and eluted. The eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-MNSFβ antibody. The flow-through (FT) and elusion material (Elu) are indicated. Lane C, MNSFβ·Bcl-G as a control. C, MEK kinase assay. Activated GST-MEK1 was incubated with unactivated GST-ERK2 in a kinase assay buffer. To evaluate the effect of MNSFβ·Bcl-G complex on ERK activation, unphosphorylated GST-ERK2 was preincubated with the MNSFβ adduct (0.5 and 2μg) for 1 h at 4°C prior to addition of activated GST-MEK1. The reaction mixture was immunoblotted with using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. The data represent one of three independent experiments that gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MNSFβ·Bcl-G Inhibits ERK Activation—To investigate whether ERK function is directly modified by MNSFβ·Bcl-G, we carried out MEK kinase assay. GST-MEK1 activated with c-Raf was employed in this assay. Activated GST-MEK1 was incubated with unphosphorylated GST-ERK2 in the presence or absence of MNSFβ·Bcl-G as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reaction mixture was immunoblotted with using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. As depicted in Fig. 2C, ERK activation by MEK1 was significantly inhibited in the presence of MNSFβ·Bcl-G. These observations were consistent with the results of GST pulldown experiments showing that MNSFβ·Bcl-G directly binds to near the phosphorylation site of ERKs (Fig. 2A).MNSFβ siRNA Increases LPS-stimulated TNFα Production by Raw Cells—It has been reported that ERK pathway is involved in the regulation of TNFα production (23Schröder N.W.J.

Because our data suggested that covalent MNSFβ·Bcl-G complex affects ERK activation, it seemed likely that inhibition of MNSFβ expression would result in increased or decreased TNFα synthesis. Raw cells were transfected with scramble siRNA or siRNA directed against MNSFβ. After 72 h of siRNA transfection, Raw cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of LPS for 4 h. Then the concentration of TNFα in the supernatant was determined by ELISA. Production of the TNFα in LPS-stimulated Raw cells transfected with MNSFβ siRNA-437 was significantly (over 2-fold) up-regulated, compared with the cells with scramble siRNA (Fig. 3A). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that MNSFβ siRNA-437, but not control scramble siRNA, specifically reduced the expression of MNSFβ but not glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Fig. 3C). Western blot analysis demonstrated that MNSFβ siRNA-437 reduced complex formation of MNSFβ with Bcl-G (33.5-kDa MNSFβ adduct) (Fig. 3D, lane 3). Like MNSFβ siRNA, Bcl-G siRNA also inhibited the complex formation of MNSFβ with Bcl-G (Fig. 3D, lane 4). We also determined whether Bcl-G siRNA would affect TNFα production by LPS-stimulated Raw cells. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, Bcl-G siRNA caused a significantly increased TNFα production, although the effect was less than that seen with MNSFβ siRNA. We did not observe a synergistic effect of transfection with both siRNA. To explore the RNAi effect at the mRNA level, we performed RT-PCR on total RNA isolated from siRNA-transfected Raw cells. MNSFβ siRNA-437 up-regulated 60% TNFα expression (data not shown). We also investigated whether MNSFβ siRNA would affect RANTES, a member of C-C chemokine superfamily, production by LPS-stimulated Raw cells. MNSFβ siRNA-437 caused a significantly increased RANTES production (Fig. 3B), indicative of the involvement of MNSFβ in RANTES production by LPS-stimulated Raw cells.FIGURE 3MNSFβ siRNA increases LPS-induced TNFα production.

Upon stimulation by IGF-I, the Hdm2 oncoprotein is phosphorylated by AKT, leading to its rapid nuclear translocation and subsequent inhibition of p53. We now show that IGF-I stimulation regulates the nuclear export of Hdm2 and p53 via the MAP kinase pathway. Inhibition of p38 MAPK or MEK via pharmacological means or expression of dominant negative proteins inhibited the cytoplasmic accumulation of Hdm2 and increased Hdm2 and p53 protein levels, whereas constitutively active p90Rsk promoted the nuclear export of Hdm2. Expression of constitutively active p90Rsk with E1A, oncogenic H-Ras, and hTERT resulted in the anchorage-independent growth of normal human fibroblasts. Our findings link p90Rsk-mediated modulation of Hdm2 nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling with the diminished ability of p53 to regulate cell cycle checkpoints that ultimately leads to transformation.

Our findings link p90Rsk-mediated modulation of Hdm2 nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling with the diminished ability of p53 to regulate cell cycle checkpoints that ultimately leads to transformation. It is well accepted that loss of the p53 signaling pathway, either by mutation or loss of upstream or downstream signaling components, occurs in the vast majority of human cancers. Loss of p53 eliminates a number of barriers that prevent transformation and tumor progression, including protective apoptotic or arrest signals (depending upon cell type) and repression of genes involved in angiogenesis and metastasis (1Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5798) Google Scholar). The p53 protein is regulated in normal human cells by an autoregulatory feedback loop with Hdm2. The hdm2 gene is a transcriptional target of p53, and the subsequent p53-dependent increase in the levels of Hdm2 protein destabilizes p53 by conjugating ubiquitin to p53, leading to its proteasomal degradation (2Harris S.L. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2899-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). An ever increasing number of signaling events are being implicated in regulating the p53-Hdm2 autoregulatory feedback loop. First, Hdm2 must undergo nuclear translocation, a process mediated by the PI3K 2The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; dn-, dominant negative; ca-, constitutively active; kd-, kinase dead; MK2, MAPKAP kinase 2; hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase.2The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; MEK, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; dn-, dominant negative; ca-, constitutively active; kd-, kinase dead; MK2, MAPKAP kinase 2; hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase./Akt-dependent phosphorylation of the nuclear localization sequence of Hdm2 (3Ashcroft M.

Once phosphorylated by AKT, the entrance of Hdm2 into the nucleus occurs rapidly. Second, Hdm2 must be able to exit the nucleus, a process mediated by CRM1 (6Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 7Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Although the activity of CRM1 is necessary for Hdm2 export, the events regulating CRM1-mediated Hdm2 export remain unclear. Finally, in response to DNA damage, both p53 and Hdm2 become phosphorylated at numerous residues, leading to the disruption of the feedback loop, stabilization of p53, and execution of p53-dependent responses (8Haupt S. Louria-Hayon I. Haupt Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is estimated that 50% of human malignancies have inactivating or gain-of-function mutations in the p53 gene itself, leaving 50% that maintain wild-type p53, but a functionally inactive signaling pathway. In many cases, the Hdm2 protein is overexpressed, leading to an imbalance in the autoregulatory loop, increased p53 degradation, and decreased tumor suppression (9Onel K. Cordon-Cardo C. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, Hdm2 remains an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in tumors harboring wild-type p53, as inhibition of Hdm2 would increase p53-dependent tumor suppression activities. Similarly to p53, the aberrant activation of receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways also plays an integral role in the establishment and maintenance of many types of tumors. Hyperactive signaling is accomplished by the overexpression of growth factors or receptors that feed into the RAS pathway leading to hyperproliferation and a diminished ability to undergo apoptosis (10Shapiro P. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab Sci. 2002; 39: 285-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Increasing attention is being given to insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, as recent epidemiological studies indicate that increased circulating IGF-I levels put individuals at higher relative risk for developing numerous types of cancer including colon, prostate, breast, lung, and bladder cancer with enhanced growth and metastatic potential (11Chan J.M. Stampfer M.J. Giovannucci E. Gann P.H. Ma J. Wilkinson P. Hennekens C.H. Pollak M. Science. 1998; 279: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar, 12Wu Y. Cui K. Miyoshi K. Hennighausen L. Green J.E. Setser J. LeRoith D. Yakar S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4384-4388PubMed Google Scholar). Links between IGF-I signaling and p53 continue to emerge. For example, IGF-I-induced cell division correlates with the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of p53 (13Takahashi K. Suzuki K. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Importantly, activation of signaling molecules downstream of the IGF-I receptor regulate various aspects of the p53-Hdm2 axis. As described above, PI3K-AKT activation regulates Hdm2 nuclear import (3Ashcroft M. Ludwig R.L. Woods D.B. Copeland T.D. Weber H.O. MacRae E.J. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, activation of p38 MAPK disrupts the interaction between Mdm2, the murine form of Hdm2, and p19ARF leading to enhanced p53 degradation in response to DNA damage signaling (14Heron-Milhavet L. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15600-15606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recently, MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2) was also shown to contribute to the activation of Hdm2 (15Weber H.O. Ludwig R.L. Morrison D. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1965-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Hdm2 on serines 157 and 166 by MK2 increased the degradation of p53, making cell less susceptible to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Ras-mediated signaling has also been reported to control the transcription of p53, Mdm2, and p14ARF (16Palmero I. Pantoja C. Serrano M. Nature. 1998; 395: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 17Agarwal M.L. Ramana C.V. Hamilton M. Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Bean L.J. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.K. Wolfman A. Stark G.R.

Cell. 2000; 103: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). An imbalance in the opposing tumor suppression and oncogenic signaling cascades leads to incremental changes in the ability of a cell to respond to insults, leading to tumorigenesis when an oncogenic change is favored. We show here that IGF-I stimulation leads to the accumulation of cytoplasmic Hdm2. The redistribution of Hdm2 and p53 to the cytoplasm from the nucleus promotes p53 degradation and is dependent upon the activation of MAP kinases in primary and cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that the signal through the MAP kinase pathway converges on p90Rsk, a downstream mediator of ERK signaling. The expression of a constitutively active p90Rsk alone is sufficient to promote the nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling of both Hdm2 and p53. Furthermore, in conjunction with E1A, oncogenic H-Ras and hTERT, constitutively active p90Rsk, but not kinase dead p90Rsk, promotes the anchorage-independent growth of human fibroblasts. Thus, the IGF-I/MAPK/p90Rsk pathway, mediating Hdm2-p53 nuclear to cytoplasm shuttling, links p90Rsk activation with increased tumorigenic potential in cells with wild-type p53. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—U2OS and H1299 cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with antibiotics and 10% bovine growth serum (Hyclone, Logan UT).

Stampfer, personal communication. PD98059 and SB 203580 were purchased from LC laboratories (Woburn, MA) and used at final concentrations of 25 and 20 μm, respectively. Confocal Microscopy—MCF-7 Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Slides were blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS-Tween and incubated with a polyclonal antibody to Hdm2 (H-221, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by an anti-rabbit Cy5 secondary antibody (Jackson Labs). Slides were washed with PBS-T following primary antibody and secondary antibody, incubated with Syto 16 as described previously (4Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). For Fig. 4 confocal MCF7 cells were fixed as described above, and Hdm2 was detected by a mixture of monoclonal antibodies 2a10 and IF2 (oncogene sciences) and a secondary anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with Draq5 (Alexis Platform), and slides were mounted with non-fading gel-mount prior to visualization on a Zeiss multiphoton microscope. Transfections and Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts were prepared using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (octylphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol (IGEPAL), 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm sodium metavanadate). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were isolated by using Buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm sodium metavanadate) to isolate the cytoplasmic fraction and Buffer C (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm sodium metavanadate) to isolate the nuclear fraction. To examine Hdm2-mediated p53 degradation, H1299 cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation of p53 (0.5 μg), Hdm2 (5 μg), kd-p90Rsk or empty vector (7 μg). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and whole cell extracts were prepared as described above. To examine the affect of dn-Erk1, dn-p38, ca-p90Rsk, and kd-p90Rsk on endogenous Hdm2, H1299 cells were transiently transfected with 20 μg of each plasmid (empty vector used for control). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described above. Extracts containing equal quantities of proteins, determined by the Bradford method, were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8–12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Antibodies to p53 (DO-1), tubulin (TU-02), PARP (F-2), and anti-hemagglutinin (F-7) were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Hdm2 antibodies 2A10, IF2, and 4B11 were from Oncogene Research Products (La Jolla, CA), and anti-FLAG M2 was purchased from Sigma. Primary antibodies were detected with goat-anti-mouse or goat-anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Hoffman-La Roche), using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Amphotropic Retroviral Production and Anchorage-independent Growth Assays—To create stable lines of IMR90 fibroblasts expressing H-Ras-V12 (pBabe-Bleo), E1A (pLPCX), ca-p90Rsk, and/or kd-p90Rsk (cloned into pLNCX2), amphotropic retroviruses encoding the cDNA of interest were packaged in Phoenix-Ampho cells by Lipofectamine Plus-mediated transient transfection. Virus containing supernatants were collected at 36–48 h, supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene, and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The filtered supernatants were added to cells overnight. Uninfected cells were removed by selection with G418 (400 μg/ml), puromycin (1 μg/ml), or zeocin (200 μg/ml). Selected populations of infected cells were resuspended in 0.6% Type VII-agarose (Sigma) and plated onto agar on a bottom layer of 1.0% agar. 1 × 105 cells were used for each 60-mm dish. IGF-I Stimulation Promotes Hdm2-mediated p53 Export and Degradation, Dependent upon the MAP Kinase Pathway—Although recent studies have demonstrated that PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the phosphorylation and movement of Hdm2 into the nucleus, leading to the down-regulation of p53, little is known about the mechanisms that may regulate the export of Hdm2. To more closely examine the kinetics of Hdm2 nuclear-cytoplasmic regulation we treated serum-starved MCF7 cells with IGF-I and monitored Hdm2 localization by confocal microscopy either 5 or 30 min after IGF-I addition. As previously described, treatment with IGF-I induced the rapid nuclear accumulation of Hdm2 (4Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11598-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). In contrast, when Hdm2 was examined 30 min after IGF-I stimulation, cytoplasmic accumulation was observed in ∼20% of the cells (Fig. 1a). In agreement with the immunostaining data, IGF-I stimulation resulted in a time-dependent increase in cytoplasmic Hdm2 as measured by Western analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts isolated from normal human mammary epithelial cells immortalized by the hTERT subunit of telomerase (hTERT-HME1) and primary human foreskin fibroblasts (BJ; Fig. 1, b and c). Upon IGF-I stimulation, Hdm2 cytoplasmic localization increased within 30–60 min in both cell lines and began to decrease between 2 and 4 h (Fig. 1, b and c). Interestingly, the location of HdmX, a protein with significant homology to Hdm2, remains mostly cytoplasmic and relatively stable throughout the time course of IGF-I stimulation of BJ fibroblasts indicating that HdmX is not involved in the translocation of Hdm2 in response to IGF-I (Fig. 1c). We consistently observed that, after 4 h of IGF-I stimulation, cytoplasmic Hdm2 decreased to levels seen under normal growth conditions. The increase in cytoplasmic Hdm2 could result from either an increase in Hdm2 nuclear export or a decrease in import; we examined whether leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM-1-mediated nuclear export, could prevent the IGF-I-mediated cytoplasmic accumulation of Hdm2. We also assessed whether MAP kinase pathway inhibitors could prevent the cytoplasmic accumulation of Hdm2, because growth factor receptor activation leads to activation of Ras and its downstream effectors, including the MAPK pathway. Serum-starved U2OS cells were stimulated with IGF-1 alone or following pretreatment with SB 203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, or leptomycin B, which inhibits CRM1-mediated nuclear export. With both inhibitors, the localization of Hdm2 remained predominantly nuclear, indicating that Hdm2 nuclear export is dependent upon MAPK signaling and CRM1-dependent nuclear export (Fig. 2a). We confirmed this finding in hTERT-HME1 cells. Again, treatment of growth factor-depleted hTERT-HME1 cells with IGF-I for 60 min increased the amount of cytoplasmic Hdm2 (Fig. 2b). In contrast, movement of Hdm2 into the cytoplasm was inhibited when cells were pretreated with SB 203580 or PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, for 60 min prior to IGF-I stimulation. Importantly, Akt activation as measured by anti-phospho-473 remained robust in the cells treated with PD98059. The continued activation of Akt indicates that inhibitors of the MAP kinase pathway do not alter the signal known to induce Hdm2 nuclear import. In addition, treatment with a proteasome inhibitor further increased the fraction of cytoplasmic Hdm2 relative to IGF-I alone indicating that Hdm2 degradation occurs in the cytoplasm following IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 2a). Because PD98059 and SB 203580 could inhibit the cytoplasmic accumulation of Hdm2 following IGF-I stimulation, we examined whether dominant negative forms of the MAP kinase signaling proteins could affect Hdm2 localization and function. H1299 cells were transiently transfected with a dominant negative Erk1 (dn-Erk1) or dominant negative p38 (dn-p38), and nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared for Western analysis to examine endogenous Hdm2 levels. Following transfection of either dn-Erk1 or dn-p38, Hdm2 became disproportionately localized within the nucleus, suggesting that Hdm2 export is inhibited by disruption of MAPK signaling (Fig. 2c). Hdm2 Is Phosphorylated by MAP Kinases—One explanation for the ability of p38, Erk1, and Erk2 to alter Hdm2 nuclear export and inhibit p53 degradation is that a MAPK pathway-dependent phosphorylation event changes the conformation of Hdm2 and prevents efficient nuclear export. To test whether Hdm2 serves as a substrate for MAPKs, recombinant Hdm2 protein in which serines 166 and 186 adjacent to the nuclear localization signal were mutated to alanine (Hdm2-2xSA) was incubated with immunoprecipitated Erk1/2, p38, or MK2, together with p32ATP and physiologic buffer. Neither Erk1/2 nor p38 MAPK could directly phosphorylate Hdm2, only MK2 kinase, which is downstream of p38 and Erk1/2, phosphorylated Hdm2 in vitro (Fig. 2d). In agreement, MK2 was recently shown to phosphorylate Hdm2 at serines 157 and 166 in vitro (15Weber H.O. Ludwig R.L. Morrison D. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1965-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Additional studies examined Hdm2 phosphorylation by downstream effectors of Erk1/2 and p38 including p90Rsk, Msk, and MK3. Recombinant Abl was included as a positive control (19Goldberg Z. Vogt S.R. Berger M. Zwang Y. Perets R. Van Etten R.A. Oren M. Taya Y. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3715-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Again, each of the precipitated kinases efficiently phosphorylated recombinant Hdm2 in vitro (Fig. 2d). Having shown that Hdm2 was phosphorylated by members of the MAP kinase family, we set out to determine which MAPKAP kinase family member may be responsible for the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of Hdm2 in cells. To determine whether p90Rsk, Msk, and MK2 were activated, we used phospho-antibodies (Ser-363 p90Rsk, Ser-376, Thr-581 Msk1, Thr-334 MK2) to monitor activation following stimulation with IGF-I in both U2OS and hTERT-HME1 cells. p90Rsk phosphorylation occurred with similar kinetics to the cytoplasmic accumulation of Hdm2 (Fig. 3, a and c). The kinetics of Msk and MK2 phosphorylation did not change substantially during the time course, indicating that neither influences the translocation of Hdm2 from the nucleus (Fig. 3a and data not shown). In both cell systems, p90Rsk phosphorylation was inhibited by PD98059 and SB 203580 (Fig. 3, b and d). Furthermore, p90Rsk was coimmunoprecipitated from U2OS cell extracts with Hdm2-specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 3e). Taken together, these observations implicate p90Rsk as a candidate for regulating Hdm2 nuclear export. p90Rsk Activation Promotes Hdm2-mediated p53 Degradation and Cooperates to Promote Anchorage-independent Growth—To further assess the ability of p90Rsk to modulate the activity of Hdm2, hTERT-HME1 cells were infected with amphotropic retrovirus encoding the expression of a kinase dead p90Rsk (kd-p90Rsk) or constitutively active p90Rsk (ca-p90Rsk). Neomycin-selected cell populations were grown without growth factors, and Hdm2 was examined (Fig. 4, a and b). Comparison of endogenous Hdm2 distribution by confocal microscopy demonstrated that expression of constitutively active p90Rsk increased the cytoplasmic fraction of Hdm2 (Fig. 4a). In agreement with the immunostaining data, active-p90Rsk also increased cytoplasmic Hdm2 as measured by Western analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts (Fig. 4b). Endogenous Hdm2 also accumulated in the cytoplasm of ca-p90Rsk-transfected H1299 cells and in the nucleus of kd-p90Rsk-transfected cells, thus excluding the possibility that Hdm2 nuclear export requires p53 (Fig. 4c). To determine the consequence of inhibiting Hdm2 nuclear export on p53 levels, p53 degradation assays were performed by transient transfection of H1299 cells with combinations of plasmids encoding p53, Hdm2, and a series of dominant negative (dn) mutants involved in MAPK signaling. Expression of dn-p38, dn-Erk1, dn-Erk2, or kinase-dead p90Rsk all inhibited the Hdm2-mediated degradation of p53 (Fig. 5, a and b). In immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking both p53 and Mdm2, transient expression of p53 was not altered by the dominant negative proteins upon cotransfection, arguing that their effect requires Hdm2/Mdm2 (Fig. 5c). To understand better the biological consequence of p90Rsk-signaling to Hdm2, we examined whether constitutively active p90Rsk could cooperate to transform normal human fibroblasts. It was recently shown that coexpression of E1A, oncogenic H-Ras (V12), and Mdm2 resulted in anchorage-independent growth and Mdm2-dependent tumor formation in nude mice (20Seger Y.R. Garcia-Cao M. Piccinin S. Cunsolo C.L. Doglioni C. Blasco M.A. Hannon G.J. Maestro R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additional studies from our laboratory indicate that the oncogenic activity of Mdm2 in this model system in specifically because of inhibition of p53-dependent apoptosis (21Patton J.T. Mayo L.D. Singhi A.D. Gudkov A.V. Stark G.R. Jackson M.W. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3169-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To examine whether hyperactive p90Rsk signaling can enhance the activity of endogenous Hdm2, making it more potent at inhibiting p53 and thus more tumorigenic, we coexpressed ca-p90Rsk or kd-p90Rsk in IMR90 fibroblasts expressing E1A, H-ras-V12, and hTERT. Selected populations of cells were plated into soft agar and grown for 2 weeks. Only the constitutively active form of p90Rsk cooperated to permit anchorage-independent growth in this system (Fig. 6). This observation indicates that the endogenous Hdm2 is sufficient to inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis and drive tumorigenesis when inappropriate signaling events are activated. We have performed the same experiments using Mdm2 overexpression, finding that Mdm2 yields ∼10-fold more colonies of about twice the size as those described here with ca-p90Rsk. Thus, the balance of nuclear and cytoplasmic Hdm2 may well decide the fate of a cell on the verge of transformation and will probably be decided by signaling through the MAPK pathway. Tumorigenesis is a multistep process in which the checkpoints that regulate cellular division and survival become compromised or dismantled. The p53 pathway prevents the formation and proliferation of aberrant cells by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to various stress signals. Loss of p53 function can occur by mutation of the gene, inactivation of upstream activators, or overexpression or hyperactivation of negative regulators. In this study, we identified a novel function for the MAPK pathway, regulation of the nuclear export of Hdm2, and ultimately p53 inhibition. We showed that Hdm2 accumulates in the cytoplasm within 30 min of IGF-I stimulation and that pharmacological blockade or expression of certain dominant negative proteins prevents the accumulation of cytoplasmic Hdm2. Although it is possible that the regulation of Hdm2 could result from increased synthesis or decreased cytoplasmic degradation, the observations presented here using cells stably expressing Rsk as well as cells transiently treated with IGF-1 (for 30 min), very different treatments, make this explanation improbable. Our findings extend the observation that IGF-I signaling induces Hdm2 function, arguing that PI3K-AKT signaling is not sufficient to activate Hdm2 and that MAPK signaling is an additional requirement for Hdm2-mediated p53 inactivation. Understanding the mechanisms that govern the down-regulation of p53 in response to growth factor signaling will help identify possible targets of therapy in cells harboring wild-type p53 with hyperactive Hdm2 activities because of constitutive receptor signaling. We found that p38 and Erk1/2 were unable to phosphorylate Hdm2 directly, but that downstream kinases p90Rsk, Msk, and MK2 could. However, p90Rsk was the only kinase activated during the time course of IGF-I stimulation used in our studies. Indeed, we found that Hdm2 interacts with p90Rsk and that overexpression of constitutively active p90Rsk leads to greater Hdm2 nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling, whereas kinase-dead p90Rsk maintains a greater portion of Hdm2 within the nucleus. We extended the observation made using transient stimulation of serum-starved cells with purified growth factors to cells with stable expression of activated p90Rsk. Importantly, activated p90Rsk accentuated the functions of endogenous Hdm2, promoting the anchorage-independent growth of normal IMR90 fibroblasts expressing E1A, Ras, and hTERT, although less efficiently than Mdm2 overexpression itself. Our previously published results using this model system indicate that p53 is responsible for preventing anchorage-independent growth and that the transformation observed with Hdm2 can be inhibited upon treatment with Nutlin-3, an Hdm2 antagonist (21Patton J.T. Mayo L.D. Singhi A.D. Gudkov A.V. Stark G.R. Jackson M.W. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3169-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesize that changes in the activities of receptor-mediated signaling networks, such as those activated by IGF-I, directly influence the tumor suppression networks involving p53 and perhaps others, such as p73, Rb/E2F, and HIF1a via modulation of Hdm2 activities. It is important to note that our experiments uncovered three enzymes capable of phosphorylating Hdm2, including p90Rsk, Msk, and MK2. Although we have examined p90Rsk more closely because of its activation kinetics upon IGF-I stimulation, one can imagine that different stimuli may lead to alternative levels of activation for each of these kinases, with the ultimate outcome being down-regulation of p53 and predisposition to carcinogenesis. Indeed, a recent paper demonstrates that phosphorylation of Hdm2 by MAPKAP kinase 2 enhances p53 degradation, although the authors noted only a slight decrease in Hdm2 serine 166 phosphorylation upon treatment with SB 203580 (15Weber H.O. Ludwig R.L. Morrison D. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1965-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with this observation in that SB 203580 inhibits Hdm2 nuclear export rather than nuclear import. The diverse pathways that may modulate various molecules involved in MAP kinase signaling will undoubtedly have an effect on Hdm2 functions by regulating its subcellular localization. Recent work has also shown that the MAPK pathway mediates hdm2 gene expression via AP1-Ets factors and regulates the localization of hdm2 mRNA (22Phelps M. Darley M. Primrose J.N. Blaydes J.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2616-2623PubMed Google Scholar, 23Phelps M. Phillips A. Darley M. Blaydes J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16651-16658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This phenomenon requires a much longer time to develop and is not likely to impact the results presented here, which occur in a matter of hours. However, taken together these data illustrate the importance of MAPK signaling in regulating Hdm2 and p53 protein levels during normal cell cycle progression. Furthermore, Hdm2 has been shown to associate with components of the translational machinery and to bind to RNA. One can envision an integrated MAPK pathway in which cytoplasmic-to-nuclear shuttling of Hdm2 regulates the stability of p53, with an additional level of regulation relating to the translational machinery necessary to synthesize Hdm2 and other components. Further work will be needed to demonstrate such a mechanism. Studies have linked high circulating levels of IGF-I with an increased cancer incidence (11Chan J.M. Stampfer M.J. Giovannucci E. Gann P.H. Ma J. Wilkinson P. Hennekens C.H. Pollak M. Science. 1998; 279: 563-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar, 12Wu Y. Cui K. Miyoshi K. Hennighausen L. Green J.E. Setser J. LeRoith D. Yakar S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4384-4388PubMed Google Scholar), an observation likely because of the ability of IGF-I receptor activation to transduce signals through both the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways. Previous studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that PI3K signaling to Akt promotes the nuclear import of Hdm2 by phosphorylation of serines 166 and 186 within the nuclear localization signal (3Ashcroft M. Ludwig R.L. Woods D.B. Copeland T.D. Weber H.O. MacRae E.J. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Mayo L.D. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The results presented here argue that activation of the MAPK pathway by IGF-I plays an equally important role to promote Hdm2 nuclear export. We are currently working to decipher the sites affected by the downstream effectors of the MAPK pathway. Thus, the ultimate regulation of Hdm2 lies in the overall balance between PI3K/Akt activation and MAP kinase pathway activation. Recent evidence that a SNP within the Hdm2 promoter results in a modest increase in Hdm2 protein that correlates with significant increase in cancer incidence underlies the point that a small shift in the import/export pathway in favor of Hdm2 export may have drastic consequences on the ability of p53 to eliminate aberrant cells (24Bond G.L. Hu W. Bond E.E. Robins H. Lutzker S.G. Arva N.C. Bargonetti J. Bartel F. Taubert H. Wuerl P. Onel K. Yip L. Hwang S.J. Strong L.C. Lozano G. Levine A.J. Cell. 2004; 119: 591-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). This point was clear when we examined the anchorage-independent growth of normal human fibroblasts expressing E1A, Ras, and hTERT. When combined with E1A and Ras, Mdm2 promotes the anchorage-independent growth of normal diploid fibroblasts (20Seger Y.R. Garcia-Cao M. Piccinin S. Cunsolo C.L. Doglioni C. Blasco M.A. Hannon G.J. Maestro R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The contribution of Mdm2 to human transformation likely centers around its ability to inhibit p53 activity, although p53-independent functions for Mdm2 have been reported that likely also influence tumorigenesis. In our experiments, numerous small colonies were observed in cells expressing E1A, Ras, and hTERT only when active p90Rsk was present as well. Based on additional work with this transformation system, we know that anchorage-independent growth can also occur by specific inhibition of p53 by stable RNA interference, indicating that p53 alone is the final constraint preventing cells expressing E1A, Ras, and hTERT from growing in soft agar. Unfortunately, most human cells will not tolerate knock-down or ablation of Hdm2 without also inhibiting p53. For the cells described in Fig. 6, our recently published findings show that treatment with an Hdm2 antagonist (Nutlin-3) results in p53-dependent apoptosis when grown on plastic or in soft agar (21Patton J.T. Mayo L.D. Singhi A.D. Gudkov A.V. Stark G.R. Jackson M.W. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3169-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although indirect, this provides evidence that Hdm2 is a major component preventing p53-dependent apoptosis and argues, collectively with the other data presented; that constitutively active Rsk augments Hdm2 activity to permit anchorage-independent growth. Thus, our work provides a mechanism whereby elevated MAPK signaling will dramatically affect the p53-Hdm2 axis in favor of attenuating p53 activity, which contributes to the progression of tumor formation and may provide a novel point for therapeutic intervention.

In this study, we investigate the binding properties and functional consequences of the expression of a putative nucleotide binding fold (referred to as the ATPC site) unique to the S2- splice variant of the type-1 InsP3R (InsP3R-1), the predominant splice variant in peripheral tissue. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encompassing amino acids 1574-1765 of the S2- InsP3R-1 and including the glycine-rich motif Gly-Tyr-Gly-Glu-Lys-Gly bound ATP specifically as measured by fluorescent trinitrophenyl-ATP binding.

The ATP sensitivity of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, however, was not altered by the G1690A mutation when measured in permeabilized DT40-3KO cells, suggesting a unique role for the ATPC site. Ca2+ release was dramatically potentiated following activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in DT40-3KO cells transiently expressing wild type S2- InsP3R or Gly → Ala mutations in the ATPA and ATPB sites, but phosphorylation of the receptor and the potentiation of Ca2+ release were absent in cells expressing the G1690A mutation in S2- InsP3R. These data indicate that ATP binding specifically to the ATPC site in S2- InsP3R-1 controls the susceptibility of the receptor to protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation, contributes to the functional sensitivity of the S2- InsP3R-1 and ultimately the sensitivity of cells to agonist stimulation.

This observation indicated the importance of the three-dimensional structure of the binding pocket in coordinating the negatively charged phosphate groups of InsP3, a proposal that was recently supported by solving the crystal structure of the InsP3R binding core (18Bosanac I.

Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The ion-conducting pore of the InsP3R is toward the extreme C terminus of the protein. This region, termed the “channel domain,” is predicted to span the endoplasmic reticulum membrane six times (19Ramos-Franco J. Galvan D. Mignery G.A. Fill M. J. Gen.

Whereas the InsP3R binding core and channel domain are highly conserved between InsP3R family members, the intervening ∼1700-amino acid region is appreciably more variable and has been called the “modulatory” or “regulatory and coupling domain.” This designation is based on the presence of numerous loci for interaction with regulatory factors that influence the Ca2+ release properties of the receptor. Moreover, because of the variability in sequence in this region, modulation can potentially occur in an InsP3R-specific manner. The most important regulator of InsP3R activity is undoubtedly Ca2+ itself. Ca2+ acts as a co-agonist to facilitate Ca2+ release at low concentrations and inhibit channel activity at high concentrations (21Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E.

Numerous additional factors, such as the binding of proteins, interaction with adenine nucleotides, and phosphorylation by numerous kinases, can also significantly influence the activity of the receptor (for reviews, see Refs. 1Bezprozvanny I.

For example, our laboratory has recently demonstrated that phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases can greatly augment the activity of the InsP3R-1 (23Wagner L.E. II Li Yule W.

This event results in enhanced Ca2+ release and serves as a potentially important point of interaction between Ca2+ and cAMP-mediated signaling. Interestingly, whereas both the peripherally expressed S2- and neuronal S2+InsP3R-1 variant contain two identical consensus motifs for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (10Danoff S.K.

Specifically, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of only Ser-1755 led to enhanced Ca2+ release in the S2+ form, whereas phosphorylation of both sites was functionally relevant in the S2+ form was modulated following phosphorylation by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (23Wagner L.E.

Furthermore, only the S2+ InsP3R differs from the S2+ form by the excision of 39 amino acids (Glu-1693 to Arg-1731) between the two phosphorylation sites (see Fig. 1A). The structural or mechanistic grounds for this and other differences between the two splice variants, however, are presently unknown. Of interest, sequence analysis of the S2- InsP3R-1 indicates that the only striking difference from the S2+ InsP3R-1 is the presence of a glycinerich motif (Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly) at aa 1688-1732 (Fig. 1A) (31Ferris C.D.

This motif could potentially serve as a nucleotide binding fold and thus is suggestive of a role for S2 --specific effects mediated by the binding of adenine nucleotides. Indeed, adenine nucleotides, in particular ATP, have marked effects on InsP3R activity. Low concentrations of ATP have been shown to enhance the activity of both InsP3R-1 and InsP3R-3 but interestingly not InsP3R-2 (34Tu H. Wang Z. Nosyreva E. De Smedt H. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). High concentrations of ATP inhibit activity of all InsP3R. The latter observation reflects ATP competing with InsP3 for binding to the receptor (39Maeda N. Kawasaki T. Nakade S. Yokota N. Taguchi T. Kasai M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1109-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 681-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas the former is thought to occur by binding of ATP to specific sites in the receptor. The effect of ATP to enhance Ca2+ release has been proposed to occur by allosterically tuning the Ca2+ sensitivity of the receptor to favor activation (37Mak D.O. McBride S. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22231-22237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nucleotide binding folds, based on the Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Gly motif (41Wierenga R.K. Hol W.G. Nature. 1983; 302: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), have been identified in individual InsP3R. A site spanning aa 2016-2021 in S2+InsP3R-1 is present in all InsP3R types, whereas a site at aa 1773-1780 is unique to the InsP3R-1 (see Fig. 1B). Both of these sites, termed ATPB and ATPA, respectively (1Bezprozvanny I. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 2Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 437-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 32Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), have been shown to bind ATP in both the full-length receptor and when expressed individually as fusion proteins (42Maes K. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smet P. Sienaert I. Waelkens E. Callewaert G. De Smedt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3492-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is, however, not known whether ATP binds to the unique putative site in the S2- form (termed ATPC by Tu et al. (25Tu H. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Glouchankova L. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1995-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)) or what, if any, functional consequences for InsP3R-1 activity this may have. In this study, we have constructed a GST fusion protein encompassing the putative nucleotide binding site corresponding to the ATPC site and confirmed that the motif indeed binds ATP with high affinity. In addition, by constructing a mutation within this motif, which fails to bind ATP, we have investigated any role this unique site plays in the specific properties of the peripheral S2- InsP3R-1 splice variant. Our studies demonstrate that binding of ATP to this site results in enhanced sensitivity of the InsP3R to InsP3. Surprisingly, our studies also demonstrate that the ATPC site plays a crucial role in defining the susceptibility of the S2-InsP3R-1 to phosphorylation by PKA. Thus, binding of ATP to the ATPC site in S2-InsP3R-1 is important in defining the functional sensitivity of the receptor when the InsP3R pathway is activated concurrently with PKA activation. Mutagenesis—potential ATP binding sites of the rat InsP R-1 S1-3/S2- isoform were mutated by sequential PCR. All numbering is based on the S2+InsP3R-1. The addition of an amino acid with a side chain on the second Gly of the ATP binding recognition motif Gly-X-Gly-X-X-ly is predicted to prevent the pyrophosphate moiety of ATP from interacting with the binding site. Mutation of the ATPC site in S2- InsP3R-1 (amino acids 1688-1732) was created by mutation of Gly-1690 to Ala (construct ΔATPC). ATPA was altered by mutating both Gly-1775 and Gly-1777 to Ala (construct ΔATPA). The ATPB site in S2-InsP3R-1 (aa 2016-2021) was altered by mutating Gly-2018 to Ala (construct ΔATPB). Creation of GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins were created using the pFN2A (GST) Flexi Vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Nucleotides corresponding to amino acids 1574-1765 (ATPC), 1756-1850 (ATPA), and 1944-2040 (ATPB) of the rat InsP3 R-1 S2- splice variant were amplified by PCR. SgfI and PmeI restriction sites were incorporated into the oligonucleotides used for PCR amplification. The PCR products were restriction enzyme-digested and ligated into pFN2A at the SgfI and PmeI sites. This creates a fusion construct with GST at the N terminus of the InsP3R-1 and a TEV protease recognition sequence in between to allow cleavage and removal of GST. WT S2-InsP3R-1 and a construct with G1690A mutation in this region were created and were verified by sequencing. BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Promega, Madison, WI) were transformed with each DNA construct. Individual colonies were picked and grown overnight in 10 ml of Luria broth supplemented with ampicillin. The overnight cultures were added to 990 ml of Luria broth. The 1000-ml cultures were grown for 2 h at 37°C and200rpm. Protein production was induced by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1 m isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), and cultures were further incubated for 2 h. Cells were pelleted and lysed, and GST fusion protein was purified using a GST purification kit (BD Biosciences). This purified protein was then cleaved with TEV protease (Invitrogen), and GST was removed by running through a GST purification column. The GST fraction was bound to the glutathione column, whereas the InsP3R-1 protein immediately eluted off. Purified InsP3R-1 protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and brought up to a final con centration of 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris buffer. Purified proteins were separated on 15% polyacrylamide gels and were either detected by Bio-Safe Coomassie Blue staining (Bio-Rad) or by immunoblotting with a monoclonal α-GST (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) antibody or a polyclonal antibody directed against the nonphosphorylated sequence flanking Ser-1755 (43Pieper A.A.

Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. S. Snyder). ATP Binding Assay—The fluorescent ATP analogue TNP-ATP (Molecular Probes, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was used to measure binding of ATP to the purified InsP3R-1 protein fragments. TNP-ATP fluorescence increases upon binding to protein (44Hiratsuka T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3479-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 45Dong K. Tang L.Q. MacGregor G.G. Leng Q. Hebert S.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1318-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (excitation, 403 nm; emission, 546 nm). 1 mg of protein in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl was used for each assay. Increases in TNP-ATP fluorescence were detected using a PerkinElmer LS-5B luminescence spectrometer (Wellesley, MA). Increasing concentrations of TNP-ATP were added sequentially to cuvettes containing protein, and fluorescence was measured every second. Background fluorescence was determined by measuring TNP-ATP emission at various concentrations in Tris buffer alone. Net fluorescence for binding to protein was determined by subtracting background fluorescence. Normalized concentration-response relationships were created and fit with a logistic equation, and apparent EC50 values were calculated using OriginPro software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). ATP competition assays were performed identically to the standard TNP-ATP binding assay, except protein-induced fluorescence was measured in the presence of 10 mm Na-ATP. Creation of Stable Muscarinic M3 Receptor-expressing DT40-3KO Cells—3× HA-tagged human M3R cDNA in pCDNA3.1 was obtained from the UMR cDNA resource center (available on the World Wide Web at www.cdna.org). MfeI-digested plasmid was introduced into DT40 cells lacking expression of all InsP3R types (38Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M.

After nucleofection, the cells were incubated in growth medium for 24 h prior to dilution in selection medium containing 2 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Cells were then seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates at ∼1000 cells/well and incubated in selection medium for at least 7 days. Wells exhibiting growth after the selection period were picked for expansion. Transient Transfection of DT40-3KO Cells—For permeabilized cell studies, DT40-3KO cells were transfected by nucleofection, as described above. For concentration-response relationships in intact DT40-3KO-M3 cells, cells were transfected by electroporation at 350 V and 950 microfarads (4-mm gap cuvette). 2 × 107 cells were co-transfected with 25 μg of the InsP3R-1 cDNA, and 4 μg of the red fluorescent protein plasmid pHcRed1-N1 (BD Biosciences). For forskolin-induced PKA potentiation assays, DT40-3KO cells were co-transfected with 25 μg of the InsP3R-1 cDNA, 25 μg of the mouse type 3 muscarinic receptor, and 4 μg of the red fluorescent protein plasmid pHcRed1-N1 (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated with DNA in 500 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) on ice for 10 min. The cell/DNA mixture was electroporated, incubated on ice for 30 min, increased to 5 ml with Opti-MEM, and placed in a 5% CO2 incubator at 39 °C for 5 h. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 12 ml of complete RPMI medium (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was typically ∼20%. Experiments were performed within 32 h of transfection. Transfection of HEK-293 Cells and Assessment of Phosphorylation— HEK-293 cells were plated onto 25-cm2 culture flasks and allowed to grow to near confluence. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of each S2- InsP3R-1 DNA construct by using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The following day, batches of cells were treated in the presence or absence of 20 μm forskolin for 10 min, aspirated from flasks, lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton, and 1 mm Complete Protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) at pH 7.4. InsP3R were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal α-InsP3R-1 antibody that recognizes amino acids 2731-2749 of InsP3R-1 (α-InsP3R-1). Immunoprecipitates were separated on 5% SDS gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then probed with either a polyclonal antibody raised against the sequence flanking Ser-1755 of InsP3R-1 (α-S1755) or a polyclonal antibody raised against a similar region that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated state of Ser-1755 (α-S1755P). Blots that were probed with α-S1755P were stripped and reprobed with the α-S1755 antiserum to confirm the presence and relative quantity of the InsP3R-1. Digital Imaging of [Ca2+]i in Intact Cells—Transfected DT40-3KO cells were washed once in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HEPES-PSS) containing 5.5 mm glucose, 137 mm NaCl, 0.56 mm MgCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Cells were then resuspended in bovine serum albumin HEPES-PSS with 1 μm Fura-2 (AM) (Teflabs Inc., Austin, TX), placed on a 15-mm glass coverslip in a low volume perfusion chamber, and allowed to adhere for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were perfused continuously for 10 min with HEPES-PSS before experimentation to allow complete Fura-2 de-esterification. A field of cells for each experiment was chosen that contained a wide range of transfection efficiency based upon the intensity of red fluorescence emitted when excited at 560 nm. Individual cells that had emission gray levels between 1500 and 2500 were subsequently chosen to standardize expression levels. [Ca2+]i imaging was performed essentially as described previously, using an inverted epifluorescence Nikon microscope with a ×40 oil immersion objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.3). Cells were excited alternately with light at 340-nm and 380 ± 10-nm bandpass filters (Chroma, Rockingham, VT) using a monochrometer (TILL Photonics, Pleasanton, CA). Fluorescence images were captured and digitized with a digital camera driven by TILL Photonics software. Images were captured every 2 s withan exposure of 10 ms and 4 × 4 binning. 340/380 ratio images were calculated online and stored immediately to a hard disk. Permeabilized Cell Ca2+ Measurements—InsP3R expression constructs along with a nuclear targeted HcRed expression construct (pHcRed-nuc; BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) were introduced into DT40-3KO cells using nucleofector protocol B23 and solution T (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD). 8 μg of InsP3R DNA and 2 μg of pHcRed-nuc DNA were used in each nucleofection. Cells were loaded with 20 μm Furaptra-AM (Teflabs, Austin, TX) at 39 °C for1hin HEPES-PSS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin 16-20 h after nucleofection. Furaptra-loaded cells were permeabilized by superfusion for 1-2 min with 40 μm β-escin in intracellular medium (ICM) containing 125 mm KCl, 19 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mm CaCl2,10 mm HEPES, 3 mm ATP, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.3). The free [Ca2+] was estimated to be 50 nm (MaxChelator). Permeabilized cells were then washed in ICM without β-escin for 5 min to facilitate removal of cytosolic dye. Transfected cells were identified by the presence of nuclear localized red fluorescence. The cells were then superfused in ICM containing 0.650 mm CaCl2 (free [Ca2+] of 200 nm) to load the intracellular stores. The experimental recordings presented are taken after establishment of a new stable base line following loading of the stores. The free [Ca2+] was subsequently maintained at a constant 200 nm throughout all experimental mane"
https://openalex.org/W2058746466,"Transforming growth factor-β type 1 (TGF-β) has been implicated as both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter in many solid epithelial cancers. We have previously demonstrated that the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 acts as a molecular switch in determining a growth inhibitory versus growth proliferative response to TGF-β in the spontaneously immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. We now demonstrate that this proliferative effect of TGF-β is mediated through the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1α (IL-1α). Using gene expression array analysis, we identified IL-1α as a cytokine specifically upregulated only in cells lacking p21 and only upon TGF-β stimulation. Cell proliferation assays verified that recombinant IL-1α was capable of inducing a growth proliferative response in p21 null MCF-10A cells, while neutralizing antibodies against IL-1α prevented the growth proliferative effects of TGF-β. Mechanistically, both the CDK and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) inhibitory functions of p21 were responsible for preventing TGF-β induced cell proliferation, but only PCNA inhibition by p21 regulated IL-1α gene expression. These studies demonstrate a novel role for IL-1α in mediating a proliferative response to TGF-β signaling, and suggest that therapies directed against IL-1α could abate the growth proliferative effects of TGF-β without compromising its tumor suppressive function."

We characterized the kinetics of correct and incorrect incorporation for several Escherichia coli RNAPs with substitutions in the proposed NTP entry pore (secondary channel). Substitutions of the semi-conserved residue βAsp675, which is >10Å away from these sites, significantly reduce fidelity; however, substitutions of the totally conserved residues βArg678 and βAsp814 do not significantly alter the correct or incorrect incorporation kinetics, even though the corresponding residues in RNAPII crystal structures appear to be interacting with the NTP phosphate groups and coordinating the second magnesium ion in the active site, respectively. Structural analysis suggests that the lower fidelity of the βAsp675 mutants most likely results from reduction of the negative potential of a small pore between the E and PS sites and elimination of several structural interactions around the pore.

Multiple structures of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNAPs have revealed a funnel-shaped pore (termed the secondary channel) leading from the surface of the enzyme directly to the active site. This channel has been proposed to be the major, and perhaps only, pathway for entry of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) to the active site (1Zhang G. Campbell E.A. Minakhin L. Richter C. Severinov K.

Recent structures of the yeast RNAP II elongation complex revealed that binding of an incorrect NTP for synthesis was at a site (termed the E site) adjacent to the catalytic NTP binding site (termed the A site) with the position of the base in the E site inverted and pointing out into the secondary channel (6Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Comparison of structures with the correct and incorrect nucleotides led to the proposal of a two-step model of NTP binding, in which an incoming NTP first binds to the E site and then rotates through a narrow negatively charged pore (13Batada N.N. Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Levitt M. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17361-17364Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) into the A site where it pairs with the template base (6Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). An NTP bound in the E site was also suggested to inhibit backtracking (13Batada N.N. Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Levitt M. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17361-17364Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This two-step model, however, does not allow for direct base pairing between the incoming NTP and the template base until the incoming NTP is positioned in the active site. Cramer and co-workers (11Kettenberger H. Armache K.J. Cramer P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) observed an NTP analog in a third site in which the incoming NTP was base-paired with the DNA template base but not positioned for catalysis and suggested that this site was a preinsertion (PS) site. They proposed a mechanism similar to that proposed for T7 RNAP (14Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 16Landick R.

Cell. 2004; 116: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) in which the incoming NTP binds to the PS site with RNAP in an “open” conformation and then RNAP closes down on the correctly paired NTP to align the NTP in the active (A) site for catalysis (11Kettenberger H. Armache K.J. Cramer P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Temiakov et al. (9Temiakov D. Zenkin N. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Tahirov T.H. Kashkina E. Savkina M. Zorov S. Nikiforov V. Igarashi N. Matsugaki N. Wakatsuki S. Severinov K. Vassylyev D.G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 655-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) integrated these two models and proposed a three-step mechanism in which the NTP first binds to the E site and then rotates into the PS site, where hydrogen bonding between the bases is checked, before RNAP closes to bring the DNA template base and NTP pair into the A site. This model allows for a check of fidelity before the template strand base and incoming NTP are positioned such that catalysis can occur. Despite this large amount of structural information, there is no clear biochemical evidence for these proposed mechanisms of nucleotide binding and discrimination. Furthermore, some researchers have proposed that the primary pathway by which NTPs enter into the active site is through the main channel (18Burton Z.F. Feig M. Gong X.Q. Zhang C. Nedialkov Y.A.

To explore the potential role of residues near the active site, particularly those residues that are surface exposed at the junction of the secondary channel and the active site, in nucleotide binding, discrimination, and incorporation, we have investigated the effects of several amino acid substitutions in the β subunit of Escherichia coli RNAP on the kinetics of correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation. The particular substitutions were previously shown to disrupt Q-mediated antitermination both in vivo and in vitro, although the exact mechanism for such inhibition remains to be determined (22Santangelo T.J. Mooney R. Landick R. Roberts J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that one of these mutants (D675Y) dramatically reduces the fidelity of RNAP. Based on our kinetic data and previous studies (6Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Temiakov D. Zenkin N. Vassylyeva M.N. Perederina A. Tahirov T.H. Kashkina E. Savkina M. Zorov S.

Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we suggest a three-step NTP binding model that permits a “double check” of the identity of the NTP before incorporation. This model can be used to further understand the mechanism underlying nucleotide discrimination and fidelity for multisubunit RNAPs. Sources of Protein and DNA—His-tagged wild-type RNAP was purified from log phase cells of strain RL916 (gift of R. Landick) as described previously (24Uptain S.M. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13548-13553Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). β His6-C-terminal tagged wild-type and mutant RNAPs were purified from TOM100 as previously described (22Santangelo T.J. Mooney R. Landick R. Roberts J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The RNAP preps are greater than 95% pure (no other bands are visible on a SDS-PAGE gel). To test for nuclease contamination, the purified RNAPs were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with radiolabeled RNA and then assayed by gel electrophoresis. As a control the labeled RNA was incubated in buffer in the absence of RNAP. No significant degradation of the RNA was seen in either the control or the reaction containing RNAP (data not shown), indicating that there is no nuclease contamination. In addition, no GreA, GreB, or NTPase activity was detectable in preparations using this purification procedure. Finally, experiments with wild-type and the Asp675 mutant RNAPs were performed with at least two different RNAP preps. The DNA template was prepared from pDE13 (wild-type template) and amplified by PCR (23Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It is biotinylated, 540 nucleotides in length, contains the λPR promoter, and codes for a transcript in which the first cytosine is 25 nucleotides after the start site of transcription (position +25). In Vitro Transcription Reactions—For the correct incorporation experiments, RNAP (60 nm) and 5′-biotinylated DNA template (60 nm) bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were incubated 10 min at 37 °C in 1× transcription buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mm Mg2+ glutamate, 200 mm K+ glutamate, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) to form open complexes. Complexes stalled at +24 were formed by adding 15 μm UTP, 20 μm ATP, and 20 μm [α-32P]GTP (160 Ci/mmol) and incubating at room temperature for 1 min. The complexes were then washed 7-10 times with ice-cold 1× transcription buffer while holding the reaction tube next to a strong magnet to retain the complexes, and then the complexes were resuspended in ice cold 1× transcription buffer and kept on ice until used in the rapid kinetic experiments. The correct incorporation kinetic experiments were performed at room temperature (∼23 °C), using a KinTek Rapid Quench Flow apparatus. For each time point, 20 μl of the purified elongation complexes were injected into one reactant loop and 20 μl of CTP into the other reactant loop. The CTP concentrations reported are final concentrations after mixing in the quench flow. The reactants were mixed for the indicated times and subsequently quenched with 0.5 m EDTA. Each time point represents a separate experiment. To assure that the results were not dependent on the length of time the complexes remained on ice, time points were taken in different orders. For the correct incorporation experiments performed with ATP (incorporation at position +26 on the template), experiments were performed as described previously (26Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35597-35608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the misincorporation reactions, the DNA was not bound to beads and transcription was initiated with the addition of NTPs as described above; however, time points were taken starting immediately after the addition of NTPs and quenched at various times in 100% formamide. At designated times during both the misincorporation and correct incorporation reactions, a portion of the elongation complexes was removed and extended to full length by the addition of 1 mm of all four NTPs (chased) to establish that the complexes were still active. To resolve the products at each position on the template, all samples were run on 8 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gels. For the correct incorporation experiments, the EDTA was removed from the samples with the aid of a magnet as described above, and the products were resuspended in 100% formamide prior to running on the gels. Quantification of Rate Data—The amount of radioactivity in each lane of the gel was measured on a Amersham Biosciences Phosphor-Imager and analyzed with ImageQuant software. The percentage of complexes at each position on the template was calculated by dividing the amount of radioactivity in the indicated band by the total amount of radioactivity in all the bands 24 nucleotides in length and longer. Determination of Misincorporation Rate Constants—To determine the rate of misincorporation, the misincorporation data were fit to the mechanism described in the text (see Fig. 1) using the kinetics fitting program KinTekSim (27Anderson K.S. Sikorski J.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7395-7406Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These data were fit “manually”; that is, the data were simulated using many different combinations of rate constants until the best fits were obtained. The starting points for these values were obtained from the double exponential fits of the data. All experiments were performed on the DNA template from the plasmid pDE13, which contains the λPR promoter and initially transcribed sequence shown at the bottom of Fig. 1. On this template, the first cytosine to be incorporated is at position +25 (23Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). By omitting CTP from the initial transcription reaction, misincorporation at position +25 can be monitored (23Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Alternatively stable elongation complexes can be stalled at position +24 and purified, and then correct incorporation events can be observed as a function of time. Correct Incorporation Studies—We investigated the kinetics of correct incorporation of CMP at position +25 and AMP at position +26 (data not shown) for wild-type and four mutants of E. coli RNAP. All of the mutant RNAPs have single or double amino acid changes in the β subunit that are in or near the secondary channel. The variants are designated H673L, N620I/D814V, D675Y, and R678C according to the residue(s) that were substituted. The rates of CMP incorporation at low (5 μm) and high (100 μm) [CTP] were measured (Fig. 2). Despite the high degree of conservation among multisubunit RNAPs for several of these residues (Fig. 5A), none of the altered RNAPs show a significantly altered incorporation rate at low [CTP] (Fig. 2A), and only R678C shows a slightly decreased rate of incorporation at 100 μm CTP (Fig. 2B). The most significant difference between the wild-type and mutant RNAPs is that only 70-80% of the wild-type RNAP incorporates CMP within 1 s, whereas ∼90% of the variant RNAPs incorporate CMP within 1 s (Fig. 2A). We have consistently observed this reduced extent of incorporation with wild-type RNAP, and it is not specific to any particular enzyme preparation (data not shown). The population of complexes that does not go to completion appears to be in backtracked states because given sufficient time these complexes do go to completion (data not shown). This difference suggests that the mutant RNAPs are less prone to enter into backtracked states under these conditions.FIGURE 5Sequence and structural alignment of the β subunit. A, residues surrounding βAsp675 (shaded in yellow) in E. coli are shown. βAsp675 is completely conserved in prokaryotes and aligns structurally with a completely conserved glutamine in the eukaryotic RNAPs. The conserved arginine βArg678 that interacts with the phosphates of an NTP bound at the E, PS, and A sites is shaded in cyan. βHis673 is shaded in pink. The alignments are based on overlays of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNAP II and T. aquaticus RNAP structures and differ from published alignments generated using Blast (2Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). B, model of mutated region with NTPs in the A, PS, and E sites. The region containing three of the mutations investigated (E. coli β residues Arg678, His673, and Asp675) is overlaid with RNAP II structures containing a UTP in the A site, an ATP in the E site (6Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and a GTP analog, GMP-CPP in the PS site (11Kettenberger H. Armache K.J. Cramer P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The protein structure shown is T. aquaticus β residues 551-561,β′ residues 1037-1045, and the F helix of β′. The numbering is for T. aquaticus RNAP; the corresponding residues in E. coli for β residues His552, Asp554, and Arg557 are His673, Asp675, and Arg678, respectively (see Fig. 5A) and for β′ residues Gln1037 and Arg1042 are Gln739 and Arg744, respectively. The NTPs bound in the E, PS, and A sites are shown in magenta, gold, and blue, respectively. The potential salt bridges and hydrogen bonds being made by βAsp554 (βAsp675 in E. coli) are shown as dashed lines. The model was generated by superimposing yeast RNAP II Rpb2 residues 760-770 from three crystal structures: one containing a UTP in the active site (A site), one containing an incorrectly matched ATP in the E site (6Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and one containing GMP-CPP in the PS site (11Kettenberger H. Armache K.J. Cramer P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) onto T. aquaticus β residues 551-561 (E. coli β residues 672-682) (1Zhang G. Campbell E.A.

Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To investigate the fidelity of these mutants, we characterized the misincorporation kinetics for each of these variant RNAPs as well as for wild-type. Fig. 3 shows representative data and fits for the kinetics of misincorporation of UMP for CMP at position +25. The mutants H673L and N620I/D814V behave the same as wild-type, R678C exhibits a slight increase in misincorporation, and D675Y exhibits a dramatic increase in misincorporation (Fig. 3). Specifically, ∼80% of the D675Y mutant misincorporates to position +25 (and positions downstream) by 2 min versus ∼20% for the wild-type (Figs. 3 and 4). Because the rate and extent of misincorporation is increased (Figs. 3 and 4) and the rate of correct incorporation is relatively unchanged (Fig. 2), the fidelity of transcription is specifically reduced with the βD675Y substitution.FIGURE 4Misincorporation Kinetics of wild-type, D675Y and D675V RNAPs. Denaturing polyacrylamide gels showing 32-P labeled transcripts generated from each RNAP on DE13 templates (see “Materials and Methods”). Both D675Y and D675V misincorporate to a much higher extent than wild-type RNAP. The length of transcripts is noted to the right of each panel. Chase lanes had 1 mm NTPs added to establish that the complexes were still active. The corresponding RNA sequence is shown below the gels. Aliquots of each reaction were removed and quenched at 0.12, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 min. NTPs were added at time 0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mutation from an aspartic acid to a tyrosine at βAsp675 both removes a negative charge and inserts a relatively bulky group. To further elucidate the source of the lower fidelity, we investigated an additional mutant RNAP in which the aspartic acid at 675 was mutated to a valine (D675V), which is similar in size to the aspartic acid but lacks the charge. Like D675Y, D675V has a significantly increased rate and extent of misincorporation (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the charge on the aspartic acid is important for nucleotide discrimination. Additionally, our results show that the variant N620I/D814V has no defects with either correct incorporation (Fig. 2) or misincorporation (Fig. 3). βAsp814 is invariable, and the corresponding residue in yeast RNAP II (D836 in Rpb2) was observed to be close enough to assist in coordinating a second metal (metal B) in the active site of RNAP II in several crystal structures (2Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar, 6Westover K.D. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 28Cramer P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Asp814 does not appear to be essential for coordinating metal B in E. coli RNAP because no effect on transcription is observed in the D814V mutant (Figs. 2 and 3). These data are consistent with earlier studies on this mutant (22Santangelo T.J. Mooney R. Landick R. Roberts J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Sosunov V. Sosunova E. Mustaev A. Bass I. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2234-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To probe the role of the secondary channel in nucleotide binding and discrimination, we have examined the kinetics of correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation for several RNAP mutants with changes in conserved and semi-conserved residues (Fig. 5A). None of the mutant polymerases exhibit any significant defects in correct incorporation (Fig. 2; data not shown); and only the βAsp675 variants exhibit an increase in misincorporation (Figs. 3 and 4). These results indicate that the fidelity (defined as the ratio of rates of correct and incorrect incorporation) of the βAsp675 mutants is significantly reduced. Previous studies of misincorporation demonstrated that the fidelity of transcription is governed, at least in part, by a branched kinetic pathway in which RNAP can switch between two conformational states at each template position (Fig. 1) (23Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that during rapid synthesis, the RNAP ternary complex usually exists in a long lived (half-life of minutes) activated state and that this state decays into an unactivated state if the rate of incorporation is slowed by nucleotide depletion (23Erie D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2107073636,"Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is a multifaceted, allosteric enzyme involved in C4 acid metabolism in green plants/microalgae and prokaryotes. Before the elucidation of the three-dimensional structures of maize C4 leaf and Escherichia coli PEPC, our truncation analysis of the sorghum C4 homologue revealed important roles for the enzyme's C-terminal alpha-helix and its appended QNTG961 tetrapeptide in polypeptide stability and overall catalysis, respectively. Collectively, these functional and structural observations implicate the importance of the PEPC C-terminal tetrapeptide for both catalysis and negative allosteric regulation. We have now more finely dissected this element of PEPC structure-function by modification of the absolutely conserved C-terminal glycine of the sorghum C4 isoform by site-specific mutagenesis (G961(A/V/D)) and truncation (DeltaC1/C4). Although the C4 polypeptide failed to accumulate in a PEPC- strain (XH11) of E. coli transformed with the Asp mutant, the other variants were produced at wild-type levels. Although neither of these four mutants displayed an apparent destabilization of the purified PEPC homotetramer, all were compromised catalytically in vivo and in vitro. Functional complementation of XH11 cells under selective growth conditions was restricted progressively by the Ala, DeltaC1 and Val, and DeltaC4 modifications. Likewise, steady-state kinetic analysis of the purified mutant enzymes revealed corresponding negative trends in kcat and kcat/K0.5 (phosphoenolpyruvate) but not in K0.5 or the Hill coefficient. Homology modeling of these sorghum C-terminal variants against the structure of the closely related maize C4 isoform predicted perturbations in active-site molecular cavities and/or ion-pairing with essential, invariant Arg-638. These collective observations reveal that even a modest, neutral alteration of the PEPC C-terminal hydrogen atom side chain is detrimental to enzyme function."

The extracellular portion of DC-SIGNR consists of an extended neck region and a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that interacts with glycans on viral envelope glycoproteins (7Soilleux E.J. Barten R. Trowsdale J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2937-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The neck region of the predominant form of DC-SIGNR is comprised of 7.5 highly conserved repeats containing 23 amino acids. In different individuals, the number of repeats varies from 4.5 to 9.5 (Fig. 1) (8Lichterfeld M. Nischalke H.D. van Lunzen J. Söhne J. Schmeisser J.K. Spengler U. Clin.

The allele frequency for the 7.5-repeat form is over 50%, but the 6.5- and 5.5-repeat forms are also common, with frequencies in the ranges of 12–16 and 26–37%. At the cell surface, the neck region of the 7.5-repeat form of DC-SIGNR mediates homotetramer formation, which clusters the CRDs to facilitate high affinity binding to multiple high mannose oligosaccharides, such as those found on viral envelopes (10Feinberg H.

Recent genetic studies have provided evidence linking polymorphism in the neck of DC-SIGNR with susceptibility to HIV, HCV, and SARS-CoV infection. In some studies, certain genotypes have been found to be more common in HIV-infected individuals than in uninfected individuals, although correlation with susceptibility to HIV infection has not been observed in all studies (8Lichterfeld M.

The presence of the 4.5- and 9.5-repeat alleles has been correlated with decreased viral load in HCV infection (11Nattermann J. Ahlensetil G. Berg T. Feldmann G. Nischalke H.D. Müller T. Rockstroh J. Woitas R. Sauerbruch T. Spengler U. J. Viral. Hepatitis. 2006; 13: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Homozygosity for any of the different alleles has been associated with reduced rates of SARS-CoV infection (6Chan V.S.F. Chan K.Y.K. Chen Y. Poon L.L.M. Cheung A.N.Y. Zheng B. Chan K.-H. Mak W.

It has been suggested that such effects might result from inefficient formation of homo- or heterooligomers containing DC-SIGNR polypeptides with necks of different lengths, but the oligomeric states of short forms of DC-SIGNR have not been characterized and the formation of heterooligomers has not been tested. Contrary to previous speculation, we now provide evidence that only the shortest from of DC-SIGNR fails to form stable tetramers and that even when larger forms differ by 1 or 2 repeats they can associate into stable heterotetramers. These finding provide a basis for understanding the effects of the polymorphism on interactions with viruses.

Tagging of the 7.5-Repeat Extracellular Segment of DC-SIGNR with a Galactose-binding CRD—A double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide encoding the galactose-binding sequence was used to change the sequence in the CRD to encode QPDNWYGHGLGGG in place of EPNNSGN.

Material remaining soluble after dialysis was purified initially on mannose-Sepharose affinity columns.

Cells were washed and incubated with 100 mm glycine in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at 25 °C prior to sonication in lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100). Following centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 150 μl of a 50% suspension of avidin-conjugated beads (Immunopure immobilized avidin, Perbio) for 1 h at 25 °C. Biotinylated proteins were released by boiling in SDS sample buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Necks with at Least 5.5 Repeats Are Required to Generate DC-SIGNR Tetramers—The extracellular portion of the common 7.5-repeat form of DC-SIGNR was previously found to be a stable tetramer (12Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In similar experiments, cross-linked tetramers could be detected for the 6.5- and 5.5-repeat forms, but only monomers of the 4.5-repeat form were observed (Fig. 2). Analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that the 6.5- and 5.5-repeat forms are stable tetramers and confirmed that the 4.5-repeat form does not self-associate (Table 1).TABLE 1Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of DC-SIGNR homo-oligomersForm of DC-SIGNRMeasured molecular weightPredicted molecular weightOligomer sizekDakDa7.5-Repeat143150Tetramer6.5-Repeat133138Tetramer5.5-Repeat125129Tetramer4.5-Repeat2730Monomer7-Repeat137138Tetramer6-Repeat127128Tetramer5-RepeatNDaND, not determined.NDDimer-tetramer4-Repeat2927Monomera ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The shortest polymorphic form of DC-SIGNR could fail to assemble into tetramers because a minimum number of repeats are needed to stabilize tetramers or because the second repeat, present in the 5.5-repeat form but absent from the 4.5-repeat form, is critical for oligomerization. The sequence of repeat 2 differs from repeats 3 to 5 at a single amino acid residue (10Feinberg H. Guo Y. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1327-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). N-terminal truncation studies provide evidence to support both interpretations. The importance of repeat 2 is evident from comparison of the 5.5-repeat polymorphic form investigated here, which lacks repeats 5 and 6 and is a stable tetramer, with an artificially created 5.5-repeat version of DC-SIGNR lacking repeats 1 and 2, which was previously found to be partially dissociated (10Feinberg H. Guo Y. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1327-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The effect of differences in neck length was further evaluated by analyzing truncated versions of the polymorphic forms from which the first half repeat of the neck has been removed (Fig. 1). Cross-linking experiments showed that the resulting 6- and 5-repeat forms can assemble into tetramers, while the 4-repeat form remains monomeric (Fig. 2). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments confirmed that the 6-repeat form is a stable tetramer and the 4-repeat form is a single species corresponding to a monomer, but the 5-repeat form is partially dissociated at low protein concentrations (Table 1). In this case, a tetramer-dimer dissociation constant of 0.14 μm was measured. Thus, at least 5.5 neck repeats are required to stabilize the tetramer even when repeat 2 is present. Taken together, these experiments show that stable homo-tetramer formation requires a minimum neck length and that repeat 2 plays a significant role in stability of the oligomer. Because the natural 4.5-repeat form of DC-SIGNR is short and lacks repeat 2, it is particularly unstable. Extracellular Segments of DC-SIGNR with Different Neck Lengths Assemble into Heterotetramers—Because changes to either the N or C terminus of the DC-SIGNR polypeptide might perturb the formation of oligomers, an alternative stragey was developed to monitor the assembly of hetero-oligomers containing polypeptides with different neck lengths. A short sequence from the galactose-binding CRD of the asialoglycoprotein receptor can confer galactose-binding activity on serum mannose-binding protein (16Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 17Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so this sequence was introduced into the CRD of the 7.5-repeat form of DC-SIGNR. The resulting protein could be purified on galactose-Sepharose but not mannose-Sepharose. The specificity swap was confirmed in solid phase binding assays, which revealed that the ratio of the KI values for α-methylgalactoside and α-methylmannoside changed by more than five orders of magnitude for the galactose-binding version (Table 2). Heterotetramers containing both this modified polypeptide and a smaller form with a normal mannose-binding CRD should have affinity for both mannose- and galactose-Sepharose (Fig. 3A).TABLE 2Inhibition of neoglycoprotein binding to wild type and modified DC-SIGNRProteinKI,αMe-ManKI,αMe-GalKI,αMe-Gal|KI,αMe-ManmmmmWild type DC-SIGNR3.4 ± 0.3111 ± 833 ± 5Modified DC-SIGNR1100 ± 1010.8 ± 0.20.010 ± 0.001 Open table in a new tab Extracellular segments of mannose-binding 6.5-repeat and galactose-binding 7.5-repeat forms of DC-SIGNR were expressed separately in E. coli, and the guanidine-solubilized proteins were mixed and renatured by dialysis. Following initial chromatography on mannose-Sepharose, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of both 6.5- and 7.5-repeat polypeptides (Fig. 3B). Because the 7.5-repeat form does not bind to the mannose-Sepharose column on its own, the 7.5-repeat polypeptide must be associated with the mannose-binding 6.5-repeat polypeptide. Re-chromatography on a galactose-Sepharose column was used to remove homo-oligomers of the 6.5-repeat form, which do not bind this column. Thus the final double affinity-purified material, containing bands corresponding to both 6.5- and 7.5-repeat forms, represents hetero-oligomers of the two polypeptides. Binding of C-type CRDs to monosaccharide affinity columns generally requires clusters of two or more CRDs interacting with the resin, so it seemed likely that the purified hetero-oligomer consists predominantly of two of each type of polypeptide. The tetrameric structure of the hetero-oligomers was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 4A). The double affinity-purified hetero-oligomer elutes at the same position as the 7.5- and 6.5-repeat homo-tetramers, showing that it also consists of four polypeptides. Following incubation at 4 °C for 2 weeks, both polypeptides in the hetero-oligomers could be re-bound quantitatively to galactose-Sepharose (data not shown). Thus, the oligomer must be extremely stable, because the 6.5-repeat form that was no longer associated with the galactose-binding 7.5-repeat form as a result of dissociation and random re-association would have passed through the column. Reverse experiments, in which homotetramers of 6.5- and 7.5-repeat forms were mixed and incubated, also failed to show evidence of dissociation and re-association to form hetero-oligomers. All of the experiments were repeated for the 5.5-repeat form of DC-SIGNR in combination with a galactose-binding 7.5-repeat form, with comparable results (Figs. 3C and 4B). In analogous experiments in which the 4.5-repeat form was combined with the 7.5-repeat form, some hetero-oligomer was detected after the first affinity chromatography step, but it dissociated before the galactose-Sepharose chromatography (data not shown). The inability of the 4.5-repeat form to assemble into hetero-oligomers is consistent with the finding that this form also fails to assemble into stable homo-oligomers. Hetero-oligomers Are Expressed in Cells—Assembly of hetero-oligomers with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was investigated by introducing galactose-binding versions of the full-length 4.5-, 5.5-, and 6.5-repeat forms into fibroblasts expressing the mannose-binding 7.5-repeat form of DC-SIGNR. Following initial purification on galactose-Sepharose, bands corresponding to both forms were observed on Western blots of cell lines expressing 7.5- and 6.5-repeat forms (Fig. 5A) or 7.5- and 5.5-repeat forms (Fig. 5B). Both polypeptides were still present following rechromatography on galactose-Sepharose, demonstrating that heterotetramers were formed. Because both homo- and hetero-oligomeric DC-SIGNR proteins are very stable, heterotetramers could not result from re-assortment of homotetramers following solubilization, and they must have assembled in cells before purification. The presence of the hetero-oligomers at the cell surface was confirmed by cell-surface biotinylation followed by purification on avidin-conjugated beads (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Biotinylation of DC-SIGNR at the cell surface. Biotinylated proteins were isolated on avidin-coated beads. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The double bands result from heterogeneity in glycosylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells transfected with the 4.5-repeat form of DC-SIGNR and selected for co-expression with the 7.5-repeat form were studied using the same protocols. Following initial chromatography of cell extracts on galactose-Sepharose, faint bands were detected only after trichloroacetic acid precipitation so that the entire elution fraction could be run on the gel (data not shown). This result indicates that the 4.5-repeat form is present at ∼25-fold lower levels than the 5.5- and 6.5-repeat forms, so it must be inefficiently expressed or unstable. The demonstration that DC-SIGNR with 5.5 or more repeats in the neck region can assemble into stable homo-oligomers as well as into hetero-oligomers with the more common 7.5-repeat form rules out several of the possible ways that the more common DC-SIGNR polymorphisms could be linked to differences in susceptibility to viral infections. These results suggest that functional DC-SIGNR would be expressed in individuals who are homozygous for the 5.5-, 6.5-, or 7.7-repeat forms as well as in individuals who are heterozygotes with at least one of these alleles. However, our results demonstrate that the behavior of the 4.5-repeat form of DC-SIGNR is significantly different from the other forms. Instability of homo- and hetero-oligomers of the extracellular domain, combined with inefficient expression of the full-length protein in cells, suggest that DC-SIGNR function would be severely compromised in individuals who are homozygous for this form, while those who are heterozygous for this form along with a longer form would express largely homo-oligomers of the longer form. Although oligomers of most of the different forms of DC-SIGNR are stable, there are other ways that the neck length polymorphism could affect interaction with viruses. Shortening of the neck would significantly change the position of the CRDs relative to the cell surface, because hydrodynamic studies indicate that the neck is extended and each repeat projects the binding domains ∼25 Å from the surface of the membrane (10Feinberg H. Guo Y. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1327-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Evidence from other sugar-binding receptors suggests that projection of the binding domains above the glycocalyx may be necessary to prevent blocking of the binding sites with sugars on the host cell surface (18Crocker P.R. Hartnell A. Munday J. Nath D. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Crocker P.R. Cur. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although initial studies indicate that the 5.5-, 6.5-, and 7.5-repeat forms can all bind to HIV at the cell surface (20Gramberg T. Zhu T. Chaipan C. Marzi A. Liu H. Wegele A. Andrus T. Hofmann H. Pöhlman S. Virology. 2006; 347: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), longer forms could be more accessible for binding of other viruses. Given that hetero-oligomers of DC-SIGNR differing by at least two repeat lengths can assemble and remain stable, it is interesting to consider how hetero-oligomers of DC-SIGNR might be arranged. The membrane anchors ensure that the N-terminal ends of the extracellular domains will be in register. Based on structural and hydrodynamic evidence that the DC-SIGNR tetramer might be a dimer of dimers (10Feinberg H. Guo Y. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1327-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it is possible that the hetero-oligomers might consist of two homodimers that associate at their N termini but diverge further from the membrane. The double affinity chromatography approach favors isolation of such heterotetramers with two of each type of polypeptide. However, for the extracellular domains, the data provide evidence that a portion of each mixed protein binds to the galactose affinity column with reduced affinity and elutes in the wash fractions (Fig. 3, B and C). This is the behavior that would be expected for an oligomer that contains only a single galactose-binding subunit and three mannose-binding subunits, suggesting that a 2:2 stoichiometry is not obligatory. Although CRDs in a hetero-oligomer may project different distances from the membrane, the structural plasticity of the neck region observed in different crystal forms (10Feinberg H. Guo Y. Mitchell D.A. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1327-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) means that individual repeats might be able to loop-out from the main stalk of the molecule, allowing both the N termini and the CRDs at the C termini to remain in register. Further structural analysis of the neck region may provide a basis for modeling such alternative conformations. We thank Dawn Torgersen for help with the binding competition studies.

https://openalex.org/W2078169476,"Based on allosteric regulatory properties, NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is believed to control flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle in vivo. To distinguish growth phenotypes associated with regulatory dysfunction of this enzyme in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we analyzed strains expressing well defined mutant forms of IDH or a non-allosteric bacterial NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDHa). As previously reported, expression of mutant forms of IDH with severe catalytic defects but intact regulatory properties produced an inability to grow with acetate as the carbon source and a dramatic increase in the frequency of generation of petite colonies, phenotypes also exhibited by a strain (idh1Δidh2Δ) lacking IDH. Reduced growth rates on acetate medium were also observed with expression of enzymes with severe regulatory defects or of the bacterial IDHa enzyme, suggesting that allosteric regulation is also important for optimal growth on this carbon source. However, expression of IDHa produced no effect on petite frequency, suggesting that the intermediate petite frequencies observed for strains expressing regulatory mutant forms of IDH are likely to correlate with the slight reductions in catalytic efficiency observed for these enzymes. Finally, rates of increase in oxygen consumption were measured during culture shifts from medium with glucose to medium with ethanol as the carbon source. Strains expressing wild-type or catalytically deficient mutant forms of IDH exhibited rapid respiratory transitions, whereas strains expressing regulatory mutant forms of IDH or the bacterial IDHa enzyme exhibited much slower respiratory transitions. This suggests an important physiological role for allosteric activation of IDH during changes in environmental conditions.

Mitochondrial NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 2The abbreviations used are:IDH, isocitratedehydrogenase;ICD, E.coliNADP+-specificisocitrate dehydrogenase; IDHa, A. thiooxidans NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase; Idp1p, yeast mitochondrial NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase; Idp2p, yeast cytosolic NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase. 2The abbreviations used are:IDH, isocitratedehydrogenase;ICD, E.coliNADP+-specificisocitrate dehydrogenase; IDHa, A. thiooxidans NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase; Idp1p, yeast mitochondrial NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase; Idp2p, yeast cytosolic NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase. catalyzes an essentially irreversible, rate-limiting step in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (1Barnes L.D. McGuire J.J. Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4322-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). IDH is a complex oligomeric enzyme and is subject to kinetic control by multiple allosteric effectors. For example, allosteric activation of yeast IDH by AMP (2Hathaway J.A. Atkinson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2875-2881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or of mammalian IDH by ADP (3Chen R.F. Plaut G.W.E. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 1023-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) dramatically increases affinity of the enzyme for isocitrate. This kinetic response is believed to accelerate flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle in vivo in response to low energy charge, i.e. in response to concomitantly low levels of ATP (2Hathaway J.A. Atkinson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2875-2881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite extensive analyses of kinetic behavior and structural/functional studies, a direct correlation between allosteric control of IDH and cellular responses has not been demonstrated. Yeast IDH is an octamer composed of four IDH1 (Mr = 38,001) and four IDH2 (Mr = 37,755) subunits (4Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IDH1 and IDH2 share 42% primary sequence identity (5Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22199-22205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of each subunit have been analyzed by mutagenesis of analogous residues based on the well defined three-dimensional structure of the homodimeric Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD, 7, 8), which shares ∼32% sequence identity with both IDH subunits. Results suggest that the basic functional unit of the yeast enzyme is a heterodimer of a catalytic IDH2 subunit and a regulatory IDH1 subunit (9Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). IDH2 contributes most of the residues in the catalytic substrate (isocitrate/Mg2+) and cofactor (NAD+) binding sites, whereas the analogous sites in IDH1 have apparently evolved for cooperative binding of isocitrate and for allosteric binding of AMP (9Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 12864-12872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have further demonstrated that binding of isocitrate at the catalytic site of IDH2 is necessary for subsequent binding of NAD+ and, analogously, binding of isocitrate at the cooperative site of IDH1 is necessary for subsequent binding of and allosteric activation by AMP (12Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12864-12872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, while each of the major ligand-binding sites is primarily composed of residues from one subunit, each site also contains a few residues contributed by the other subunit, providing a mechanism for communication between regulatory and catalytic ligand-binding sites (13Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21811-21817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Panisko E. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1204-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These studies produced well characterized mutant forms of IDH, and expression of these mutant enzymes in a yeast strain lacking endogenous IDH provides an opportunity for correlating cellular growth phenotypes with specific defects in catalytic or regulatory functions. To date, loss or severe catalytic dysfunction of IDH has been shown to correlate with an inability to grow with acetate as a carbon source (6Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16417-16423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15McCammon M.T. Genetics. 1996; 144: 57-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a phenotype also observed with loss of several other tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes in yeast (16Kim K. Rosenkrantz M.S. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1936-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17McAlister-Henn L. Thompson L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and with an increase in the rate of production of respiratory-deficient (petite) segregants (10Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Specific phenotypes associated with regulatory dysfunction of IDH under these and other steady-state growth conditions have not been elucidated. Therefore, in the current study we sought to identify transient phenotypes associated with regulatory kinetic dysfunction using shifts between different permissive growth conditions. We also wished to express a heterologous non-allosteric enzyme in lieu of IDH in yeast. Most bacterial isocitrate dehydrogenases, including E. coli ICD (19Reeves H.C. Daumy G.O. Lin C.C. Houston M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 258: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), are non-allosteric, homodimeric, NADP+-specific enzymes. We have previously shown that, when ICD is expressed in a yeast mutant lacking IDH as well as the mitochondrial and cytosolic NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenases, the bacterial enzyme can complement the glutamate auxotrophy of this strain (20Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7873-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, while ICD can provide α-ketoglutarate in yeast, the difference in cofactor specificity limits complementation for other tricarboxylic acid cycle functions, including growth on acetate as a carbon source. Inoue et al. (21Inoue H. Tamura T. Ehara N. Nishito A. Nakayama Y. Maekawa M. Imada K. Tanaka H. Inagaki K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 214: 127-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported purification, kinetic characterization, and the gene sequence of a homodimeric NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (designated IDHa, subunit Mr = 46,218) from the chemolithotrophic bacterium Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans. This enzyme exhibits a 78-fold preference for NAD+ over NADP+, suggesting it might be an appropriate heterologous enzyme for provision of tricarboxylic acid cycle functions of IDH. We expressed and purified IDHa to ascertain the absence of pertinent allosteric regulatory properties prior to tests for complementation of IDH catalytic and regulatory functions. Yeast Strains and Cultivation Conditions—The parental yeast strain was MMY011 (MATα ade2–1 his3–11, 15 leu2–3, 112, trp1–1 can 1–100 (22McCammon M.T. Veenhuis M. Trapp S.B. Goodman J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5816-5827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Previously derived from this strain were an idh1Δidh2Δ mutant strain containing deletions/insertions of LEU2 and HIS3 genes in the chromosomal IDH1 and IDH2 loci, respectively (23Przybyla-Zawislak B. Gadde D.M. Ducharme K. McCammon M.T. Genetics. 1999; 152: 153-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and an idp1Δidp2Δidh2Δ mutant strain containing disruptions in genes encoding the major NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenases and the IDH2 subunit (18McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Strains were routinely maintained on rich YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone) with 2% glucose. Transformants were selected on defined minimal YNB medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base) containing 2% glucose and nutrients to satisfy auxotrophic requirements of the strain or to maintain selection for plasmids. Other carbon sources included 2% ethanol or 2% sodium acetate. Growth Phenotype Analyses—To measure steady-state growth rates, strains were grown overnight in YP medium to an optical density at A600 nm = 0.6–0.8, then diluted into YP medium with the same carbon source. Growth rates in liquid cultures were measured starting with A600 = 0.1. To analyze respiratory deficient petite [rho–] mutations, strains were precultivated in yeast synthetic drop-out medium lacking uracil (Sigma) for plasmid selection, and dilutions of the cultures were plated on YP glucose plates. The petite frequency was the number of small white (petite) colonies relative to large red colonies counted after growth for 3 days at 30°C. This assay is based on the red pigment produced as a result of the ade2 mutation in these strains and yields results comparable to the tetrazolium red overlay technique (24McCammon M.T. Epstein C.B. Przybyla-Zawislak B. McAlister-Henn L. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 958-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For plating assays, cells were pelleted from liquid cultures grown overnight in YP glucose medium, washed, and resuspended to 2 A600 per ml of H2O. Cell samples were serially diluted in 10-fold steps for plating onto YP acetate plates or 100-fold for plating onto YNB glucose plates lacking or containing 100 μg/ml glutamate. 5-μl samples of each dilution were spotted onto the agar plates. Respiratory rates were measured using a Clarke-type oxygen electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Inc.). Yeast strains were cultivated overnight in YP glucose medium. Cells were harvested, washed, diluted into H2O, and used to inoculate a YP ethanol culture (A600 ≅ 0.1) and a YP glucose culture (A600 ≅ 0.2). After 4 h, the YP ethanol culture was used to measure steady-state ethanol respiratory rates, and the YP glucose culture was harvested. Cells from the glucose culture were washed, resuspended in H2O, and used to inoculate a YP glucose culture (A600 ≅ 0.15) for determination of steady-state glucose respiratory rates and a YP ethanol culture (A600 ≅ 0.15) for determination of transitional respiratory rates. Rates of oxygen consumption and culture A600 values were measured every 30 min for 3 h. Expression of IDHa in Yeast—To express IDHa in yeast, the IDHa coding region was fused in-frame with the yeast IDH2 promoter and mitochondrial targeting sequence. The IDHa gene was obtained using PCR with A. thiooxidans genomic DNA (obtained from Dr. Cathrin Spröer, Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) as the template. The 5′-oligonucleotide (5′-ATCTTAGGATCCACCCATATTCAGAAACCCGCAAC) contained a BamHI site (underlined) for subsequent in-frame ligation with IDH2 sequences, and the 3′-oligonucleotide (5′-TAATTGAAGCTTTTAATGGTGGTGATGGTGATGAAAACGCCGGATCAGTGCTGCC) contained codons for six histidine residues (italics) prior to the stop codon and a HindIII site (underlined). To facilitate subcloning, a single-copy plasmid (pRS316IDH2) containing the promoter, coding region, and 3′-noncoding sequences of the yeast IDH2 gene on a ∼1.8-kbp SstII/HindIII DNA fragment (13Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21811-21817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was used for site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) to insert a BamHI site following codons for the 15-residue mitochondrial targeting sequence (25Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10347-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The BamHI/Hin-dIII IDHa PCR product was used to replace the BamHI/HindIII fragment in the pRS316IDH2 plasmid, placing the IDHa gene 3′ of the IDH2 promoter and in-frame with the IDH2 mitochondrial targeting codons. The resulting plasmid was designated pRS316IDHa. The sequence of the IDHa gene (21Inoue H. Tamura T. Ehara N. Nishito A. Nakayama Y. Maekawa M. Imada K. Tanaka H. Inagaki K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 214: 127-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the fusion with IDH2 sequences were verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. Subcloning was subsequently used to transfer the ∼1.8-kbp SstII/HindIII fragment from this plasmid to a 2μ pRS426 plasmid, generating a multicopy plasmid designated pRS426IDHa. The pRS316IDHa and pRS426IDHa plasmids were transformed into the idh1Δidh2Δ yeast strain for complementation analyses and for enzyme purification, respectively. Protein Analyses—For affinity purification, transformants of the idh1Δidh2Δ strain carrying multicopy plasmids for expression of IDHa with a carboxyl-terminal hexa-histidine tag (pRS426IDHa) or of IDH with a carboxyl-terminal penta-histidine tag on IDH1 (pRS426IDH1/IDH2 (13Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21811-21817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) were precultivated overnight in 150 ml of YNB glucose medium lacking uracil to select for plasmid retention. These cultures were used to inoculate 2.0-liter cultures in YP ethanol medium, a condition that maximizes expression of IDH gene promoters (20Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7873-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested after growth for 36 h at 30°C and lysed by glass-bead breakage. Affinity purification using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) was conducted as previously described (13Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21811-21817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Concentrations of purified enzymes were determined at A280 nm using molar extinction coefficients of 77,280 m –1cm–1 for IDHa and 168,820 m –1cm–1 for IDH (26Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). Kinetic properties of IDHa and IDH with respect to isocitrate were compared using assays containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NAD+, and dl-isocitrate concentrations ranging from 0 to 300 μm for IDHa and from 0 to 5.0 mm for IDH. Assays were conducted in the absence or presence of 100 μm AMP. To compare properties with respect to NAD+, assays were conducted with 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm MgCl2, a concentration of d-isocitrate (measured as 50% of the total concentration of dl-isocitrate) equal to 5-fold the determined S0.5 value, and NAD+ concentrations ranging from 0 to 3.0 mm. Kinetic properties of IDHa were also examined using a Tris-HCl buffer at pH 9.0 as previously described (21Inoue H. Tamura T. Ehara N. Nishito A. Nakayama Y. Maekawa M. Imada K. Tanaka H. Inagaki K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 214: 127-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A unit of activity is defined as production of 1 μmol of NADH/min at 24°C. Apparent Vmax values are the maximal rates per milligram of purified enzyme. For cellular fractionation, transformants of the idh1Δidh2Δ strain carrying single-copy plasmids for expression of IDHa or of IDH were precultivated overnight in 150 ml of YNB glucose medium lacking uracil to select for plasmid retention. These cultures (and control strains precultivated in YP glucose) were used to inoculate 2.0-liter cultures in YP ethanol medium to increase expression of IDH gene promoters (20Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7873-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested for fractionation to obtain mitochondrial pellets and post-mitochondrial supernatants as described by Daum et al. (27Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic assays for IDH or IDHa in cellular fractions were conducted as previously described for IDH (20Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7873-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215491) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein samples were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide/sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Immunoblot analyses were conducted using an antiserum against yeast IDH as previously described (4Keys D.A. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4280-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on a primary sequence identity of 59% (21Inoue H. Tamura T. Ehara N. Nishito A. Nakayama Y. Maekawa M. Imada K. Tanaka H. Inagaki K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 214: 127-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested an antiserum against E. coli ICD previously obtained from Dr. D. E. Koshland, Jr. (Berkeley, CA), and found it to interact well with IDHa in immunoblot analyses at a dilution of 1:300. An antiserum against yeast porin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was used at a dilution of 1:5000. The enhanced chemiluminescence method and autoradiography were used for detection. Effects of Residue Substitutions on Growth Phenotypes—To examine effects of specific defects in catalytic and regulatory properties of IDH on steady-state and transitional growth phenotypes, we chose well characterized mutant forms of IDH for expression in a yeast strain (idh1Δidh2Δ) containing chromosomal disruptions in both IDH1 and IDH2 loci. Mutant enzymes were expressed using a single-copy plasmid carrying one wild-type subunit gene and the other mutant subunit gene, each under control of its authentic promoter (13Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21811-21817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As summarized in Table 1, these enzymes included a pair of mutant enzymes with an alanine residue replacement for a critical serine residue in the isocitrate/Mg2+-binding site of IDH2 (IDH2S98A) or in the isocitrate-binding site of IDH1 (IDH1S92A). These replacements essentially eliminate isocitrate binding by each type of subunit (11Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22475-22483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but have very different kinetic consequences. The IDH2S98A enzyme exhibits a dramatic 160-fold decrease in apparent Vmax but no effect on cooperative binding of isocitrate or on AMP activation, whereas the IDH1S92A enzyme exhibits loss of cooperativity with respect to isocitrate and loss of AMP activation with a lesser effect on Vmax (9Cupp J.R. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9323-9328Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The other pair of mutant enzymes (Table 1) contains alanine replacements for adjacent aspartate/isoleucine pairs in the respective adenine nucleotide-binding sites of each subunit. The primary kinetic defect exhibited by the IDH2D286A,I287A mutant enzyme is a ∼300-fold decrease in apparent Vmax due to a dramatic decrease in affinity for the cofactor NAD+, whereas the primary kinetic defect exhibited by the IDH1D279A,I280A mutant enzyme is a loss of allosteric regulation by AMP (12Lin A.-P. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12864-12872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Zhao W.-N. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab As previously reported, an idh1Δidh2Δ strain is unable to grow with acetate as the carbon source. We compared culture doubling times on acetate and other carbon sources for an idh1Δidh2Δ strain expressing each of the mutant forms of IDH listed in Table 1. Control strains were the parental strain or the idh1Δidh2Δ strain expressing wild-type IDH using a single-copy plasmid. With acetate as the carbon source, no culture doubling was observed over a 36-h period for the idh1Δidh2Δ strain (data not shown) or for strains expressing the catalytically deficient IDH2S98A or IDH2D286A,I287A enzyme (Table 1). Strains expressing the regulatory mutant IDH1S92A or IDH1D279A,I280A enzyme exhibited doubling times of 12 and 8 h, respectively, relative to 4–5 h for control strains. Thus, YP acetate medium is non-permissive for growth of strains expressing IDH enzymes with severe catalytic defects. For strains expressing regulatory deficient forms of IDH, it is difficult to distinguish if reduced growth rates on acetate medium are due to the regulatory defects or to the relatively slight reductions in catalytic capacity for these mutant enzymes. Similar results were previously obtained in analyses of another phenotype, the frequency of generation of respiratory-deficient petite segregants (10Lin A.-P. McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14291-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18McCammon M.T. McAlister-Henn L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This frequency for the idh1Δidh2Δ strain was >10-fold that for control strains and was similarly elevated for strains expressing the IDH2S98A or IDH2D286A,I287A catalytic mutant enzyme (Table 1). This frequency was considerably lower for strains expressing the IDH1S92A or IDH1D279A,I280A regulatory mutant enzyme but was still 2- to 3-fold higher than frequencies for control strains. Thus, these steady-state phenotypes do not clearly distinguish growth defects due to dramatic regulatory defects or to moderate catalytic defects of the allosteric mutant enzymes. As shown in Table 1, all control and IDH mutant strains exhibited comparable doubling times in YP medium with either glucose or ethanol as the carbon source, suggesting that these carbon sources are permissive for growth of IDH mutants. We therefore attempted to identify phenotypes attributed to regulatory IDH defects by analyzing rates of culture adaptation during shifts from permissive YP glucose medium, a condition associated with rapid fermentation and slower respiratory rates, to YP ethanol medium, a condition associated with rapid respiratory metabolism. Culture growth rates were measured following a shift of cells from logarithmically growing YP glucose cultures (A600 = 0.6–0.8) to YP ethanol medium (starting A600 = 0.1–0.2). All control strains and strains expressing the mutant forms of IDH exhibited similar lags of 7–8 h prior to attaining logarithmic culture doubling times (5–7 h) in YP ethanol medium. Thus, there were no apparent differences in adaptation to growth in ethanol medium. We have also observed no differences in protein expression among these strains. For example, Fig. 1 illustrates immunochemical levels of IDH and of porin, a mitochondrial membrane protein, in these strains growing logarithmically in YP ethanol medium. IDH is absent in extracts from the idh1Δidh2Δ strain (lane 1), but levels are comparable in strains expressing IDH (lane 2) or mutant forms of IDH (lanes 3–6). (Note: this gel did not electrophoretically resolve IDH1 and IDH2 subunits, but some differences in mobility due to altered residues are apparent.) To examine more immediate responses during culture shifts from YP glucose to YP ethanol medium, we monitored oxygen consumption rates. During these shift experiments, steady-state rates of oxygen consumption in YP glucose and YP ethanol media were measured using parallel cultures of each strain. Representative results illustrated in Fig. 2 show that steady-state rates of oxygen consumption for each strain were higher on YP ethanol medium (upper dashed line) than on YP glucose medium (lower dashed line). These steady-state rates were found to vary among the strains and between different experiments for the same strain. Consistently, however, following a shift from YP glucose to YP ethanol medium, the idh1Δidh2Δ strain expressing wild-type IDH (Fig. 2, wt IDH) attained the higher steady-state rate of oxygen consumption within 2 h. For the idh1Δidh2Δ disruption mutant strain (Fig. 2, no IDH), adaptation to more rapid respiration occurred more slowly with rates of oxygen consumption reaching only ∼60% of the steady-state ethanol rate 3 h after the medium shift.
