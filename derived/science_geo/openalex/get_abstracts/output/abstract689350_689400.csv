https://openalex.org/W4206896921,"Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) represent an emerging global crisis. However, quantifiable risk factors for PASC and their biological associations are poorly resolved. We executed a deep multi-omic, longitudinal investigation of 309 COVID-19 patients from initial diagnosis to convalescence (2-3 months later), integrated with clinical data and patient-reported symptoms. We resolved four PASC-anticipating risk factors at the time of initial COVID-19 diagnosis: type 2 diabetes, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and specific auto-antibodies. In patients with gastrointestinal PASC, SARS-CoV-2-specific and CMV-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited unique dynamics during recovery from COVID-19. Analysis of symptom-associated immunological signatures revealed coordinated immunity polarization into four endotypes, exhibiting divergent acute severity and PASC. We find that immunological associations between PASC factors diminish over time, leading to distinct convalescent immune states. Detectability of most PASC factors at COVID-19 diagnosis emphasizes the importance of early disease measurements for understanding emergent chronic conditions and suggests PASC treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4220939068,"Treatment of severe COVID-19 is currently limited by clinical heterogeneity and incomplete description of specific immune biomarkers. We present here a comprehensive multi-omic blood atlas for patients with varying COVID-19 severity in an integrated comparison with influenza and sepsis patients versus healthy volunteers. We identify immune signatures and correlates of host response. Hallmarks of disease severity involved cells, their inflammatory mediators and networks, including progenitor cells and specific myeloid and lymphocyte subsets, features of the immune repertoire, acute phase response, metabolism, and coagulation. Persisting immune activation involving AP-1/p38MAPK was a specific feature of COVID-19. The plasma proteome enabled sub-phenotyping into patient clusters, predictive of severity and outcome. Systems-based integrative analyses including tensor and matrix decomposition of all modalities revealed feature groupings linked with severity and specificity compared to influenza and sepsis. Our approach and blood atlas will support future drug development, clinical trial design, and personalized medicine approaches for COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4225594780,"PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is a short-lived protein required for the removal of damaged mitochondria through Parkin translocation and mitophagy. Because the short half-life of PINK1 limits its ability to be trafficked into neurites, local translation is required for this mitophagy pathway to be active far from the soma. The Pink1 transcript is associated and cotransported with neuronal mitochondria. In concert with translation, the mitochondrial outer membrane proteins synaptojanin 2 binding protein (SYNJ2BP) and synaptojanin 2 (SYNJ2) are required for tethering Pink1 mRNA to mitochondria via an RNA-binding domain in SYNJ2. This neuron-specific adaptation for the local translation of PINK1 provides distal mitochondria with a continuous supply of PINK1 for the activation of mitophagy."
https://openalex.org/W4214640971,"The activation of the embryonic genome marks the first major wave of transcription in the developing organism. Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in mouse 2-cell embryos and 8-cell embryos in humans is crucial for development. Here, we report the discovery of human 8-cell-like cells (8CLCs) among naive embryonic stem cells, which transcriptionally resemble the 8-cell human embryo. They express ZGA markers, including ZSCAN4 and LEUTX, and transposable elements, such as HERVL and MLT2A1. 8CLCs show reduced SOX2 levels and can be identified using TPRX1 and H3.Y marker proteins in vitro. Overexpression of the transcription factor DUX4 and spliceosome inhibition increase human ZGA-like transcription. Excitingly, the 8CLC markers TPRX1 and H3.Y are also expressed in ZGA-stage 8-cell human embryos and may thus be relevant in vivo. 8CLCs provide a unique opportunity to characterize human ZGA-like transcription and might provide critical insights into early events in embryogenesis in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4214627663,"Recent deep learning methods for fruits classification resulted in promising performance. However, these methods are with heavy-weight architectures in nature, and hence require a higher storage and expensive training operations due to feeding a large number of training parameters. There is a necessity to explore lightweight deep learning models without compromising the classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and attention module. First, the convolution features are extracted to capture the high-level object-based information. Second, an attention module is used to capture the interesting semantic information. The convolution and attention modules are then combined together to fuse both the high-level object-based information and the interesting semantic information, which is followed by the fully connected layers and the softmax layer. Evaluation of our proposed method, which leverages transfer learning approach, on three public fruit-related benchmark datasets shows that our proposed method outperforms the four latest deep learning methods with a smaller number of trainable parameters and a superior classification accuracy. Our model has a great potential to be adopted by industries closely related to the fruit growing and retailing or processing chain for automatic fruit identification and classifications in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4214627203,"To investigate breast cancer-specific mortality by early breast cancer (EBC; Stages I-IIIC) subtype; incidence of high-risk indicators for recurrence (defined in monarchE trial); and mortality risk difference by those who did/did not meet these criteria.Analyses included patients with initial EBC diagnosis between 2010-2015 from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data (n = 342,149). Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier estimates examined mortality among 228,031 patients, by subtype (hormone receptor [HR]-positive [+], human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 [HER2] negative [-]; triple negative [TNBC]; HR+, HER2+; HR-, HER2+). Incidence and mortality among patients who did/did not meet monarchE clinicopathological high-risk criteria were examined.Among patients with HR+, HER2- EBC, histologic Grade 3 (vs. Grade 1) was the most influential factor on mortality (hazard ratio, 3.61; 95%CI, 3.27, 3.98). Among patients with TNBC, ≥4 ipsilateral axillary positive nodes (vs. node negative) was the most influential factor on mortality (hazard ratio, 3.46; 95%CI, 2.87, 4.17). For patients with HR-, HER2+ or HR+, HER2+ EBC, tumor size ≥5 cm (vs. <1 cm) and ≥4 ipsilateral axillary positive nodes were the most influential factors on mortality. The 60-month mortality rate for the 12% of patients within the HR+, HER2- EBC group meeting monarchE clinicopathological high-risk criteria was 16.5%, versus 7.0% (Stage II-III and node positive) and 2.8% (Stage I or node negative) for those not meeting criteria. The 60-month mortality rate for patients with TNBC was 18.5%.Mortality risk and the relative importance of risk factors varied by subtype. monarchE clinicopathological high-risk criteria were associated with increased mortality risk among patients with HR+, HER2- EBC. Patients with HR+, HER2- EBC, and monarchE clinicopathological high-risk criteria experienced risk of mortality similar to patients with early TNBC. These data highlight a high unmet need in this select patient population who may benefit most from therapy escalation."
https://openalex.org/W4214770584,"Systems mapping methods are increasingly used to study complex public health issues. Visualizing the causal relationships within a complex adaptive system allows for more than developing a holistic and multi-perspective overview of the situation. It is also a way of understanding the emergent, self-organizing dynamics of a system and how they can be influenced. This article describes a concrete approach for developing and analysing a systems map of a complex public health issue drawing on well-accepted methods from the field of social science while incorporating the principles of systems thinking and transdisciplinarity. Using our case study on HIV drug resistance in sub-Saharan Africa as an example, this article provides a practical guideline on how to map a public health problem as a complex adaptive system in order to uncover the drivers, feedback-loops and other dynamics behind the problem. Qualitative systems mapping can help researchers and policy makers to gain deeper insights in the root causes of the problem and identify complexity-informed intervention points."
https://openalex.org/W4226036482,"Bacterial spot, caused by Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni ( Xap ), is a serious peach disease with symptoms that traverse severe defoliation and black surface pitting, cracking or blemishes on peach fruit with global economic impacts. A management option for control and meeting consumer demand for chemical-free, environmentally friendly fruit production is the development of resistant or tolerant cultivars. We developed simple, accurate, and efficient DNA assays (Ppe.XapF) based on SNP genotyping with KASP technology to quickly test for bacterial spot resistance alleles in peach fruit that allows breeders to cull seedlings at the greenhouse stage. The objective of this research was to validate newly developed DNA tests that target the two major QTLs for fruit resistance in peach with diagnostic utility in predicting fruit response to bacterial spot infection. Our study confirms that with only two Ppe.XapF DNA tests, Ppe.XapF1-1 and Ppe.XapF6-2, individuals carrying susceptible alleles can be identified. Use of these efficient and accurate Ppe.XapF KASP tests resulted in 44% reduction in seedling planting rate in the Clemson University peach breeding program."
https://openalex.org/W4214757674,"Many urban residents in low- and middle-income countries live in unfavorable conditions with few healthcare facilities, calling to question the long-held view of urban advantage in health, healthcare access and utilization. We explore the patterns of healthcare utilization in these deprived neighborhoods by studying three such settlements in Nigeria.The study was conducted in three slums in Southwestern Nigeria, categorized as migrant, indigenous or cosmopolitan, based on their characteristics. Using observational data of those who needed healthcare and used in-patient or out-patient services in the 12 months preceding the survey, frequencies, percentages and odds-ratios were used to show the study participants' environmental and population characteristics, relative to their patterns of healthcare use.A total of 1,634 residents from the three slums participated, distributed as 763 (migrant), 459 (indigenous) and 412 (cosmopolitan). Residents from the migrant (OR = 0.70, 95%CI: 0.51 to 0.97) and indigenous (OR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.45 to 0.93) slums were less likely to have used formal healthcare facilities than those from the cosmopolitan slum. Slum residents were more likely to use formal healthcare facilities for maternal and perinatal conditions, and generalized pains, than for communicable (OR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.34 to 0.72) and non-communicable diseases (OR = 0.61, 95%CI: 0.41 to 0.91). The unemployed had higher odds (OR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.08 to 1.93) of using formal healthcare facilities than those currently employed.The cosmopolitan slum, situated in a major financial center and national economic hub, had a higher proportion of formal healthcare facility usage than the migrant and indigenous slums where about half of families were classified as poor. The urban advantage premise and Anderson behavioral model remain a practical explanatory framework, although they may not explain healthcare use in all possible slum types in Africa. A context-within-context approach is important for addressing healthcare utilization challenges in slums in sub-Saharan Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4214662793,"Many studies have predicted major depressive disorder (MDD) as the leading cause of global health by 2030 due to its high prevalence, disability, and illness. However, the actual pathophysiological mechanism behind depression is unknown. Scientists consider alterations in cytokines might be tools for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of MDD. Several past studies on several inflammatory cytokine expressions in MDD reveal that an inflammatory process is activated, although the precise causes of that changes in cytokine levels are unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate resistin and G-CSF in MDD patients and controls to explore their role in the pathogenesis and development of depression.We included 220 participants in this study. Among them, 108 MDD patients and 112 age-sex matched healthy control (HCs). We used DSM-5 to evaluate study participants. Also, we applied the Ham-D rating scale to assess the severity of patients. Serum resistin and G-CSF levels were measured using ELISA kits (BosterBio, USA).The present study observed increased serum resistin levels in MDD patients compared to HCs (13.82 ± 1.24ng/mL and 6.35 ± 0.51ng/mL, p <0.001). However, we did not find such changes for serum G-CSF levels between the groups. Ham-D scores showed a significant correlation with serum resistin levels but not G-CSF levels in the patient group. Furthermore, ROC analysis showed a fairly predictive performance of serum resistin levels in major depression (AUC = 0.746).The present study findings suggest higher serum resistin levels are associated with the pathophysiology of MDD. This elevated serum resistin level may serve as an early risk assessment indicator for MDD. However, the role of serum G-CSF in the development of MDD is still unclear despite its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects."
https://openalex.org/W4214751106,"The continuum of care for maternal and newborn health is a systematic approach for delivery of an integrated effective package of life-saving interventions throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum as well as across levels of service delivery to women and newborns. Nonetheless, in low-income countries, coverage of these interventions across the life cycle continuum is low. This study examined the predictors of utilization of maternal and newborn health care services along the continuum of care in Ethiopia.This was a cross-sectional population-based study. We measured maternal and newborn health care utilization practices among women who had live births in the last 12 months preceding the survey in Amhara, Oromia, SNNP, and Tigray regions of Ethiopia. We fitted multilevel random-effects logistic regression models to examine the predictors of the continuum of care accounting for the survey design, and individual, and contextual characteristics of the respondents.Our analysis revealed that only one-fifth of women utilized maternal and newborn health services across the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum continuum; most women discontinued at the postpartum stage. Continued use of services varied significantly across wealth, model family, prenatal stay at maternity waiting homes, antenatal care in the first trimester, complete antenatal care service, and the administrative region at all antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum stages. Moreover, family conversation during pregnancy [AOR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.56-2.88], delivery by cesarean [AOR: 2.70; 95% CI: 1.82-4.02] and birth notified to health extension workers [AOR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.56-2.43] were found to be predictors of the continuum of care at the postpartum stage.In Ethiopia, despite good access to antepartum care, compliance with continuity of care across the pathway decreased with significant inequitable distributions, the poorest segment of the population being at most disadvantage. The main modifiable program factors connected to the continued uptake of maternal health services include family conversation, pregnant women conference, complete antenatal care, antenatal care in the first trimester, and birth notification."
https://openalex.org/W4214576747,"This paper builds an evaluation index system, uses the entropy weight method (EWM) to decide the weights and, based on the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM), it systematically studies the coupling relationship between Chinese cold chain logistics and the Chinese economy from 2010 to 2019. It performs a grey relational analysis (GRE) to explore the main factors influencing the coordinated development of the two. The results show that the coupling coordination degree between the two presents a steady upward trend, and their coupling relationship has been upgraded from ‘coordination’ to ‘good coordination’. They also indicate that the added value in the tertiary industry, the per capita gross domestic product (GDP), and household consumption levels are the main factors affecting the development of cold chain logistics, while the per capita cold storage capacity, the turnover of road cold chain freight, and the volume of human-power employed in cold chain logistics are the main factors affecting economic development. This study makes suggestions to support the coordinated development of cold chain logistics and economy, and provides a scientific basis for further research."
https://openalex.org/W4214640574,"The pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) took the world by surprise. Following the first outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, several models have been developed to study and understand its transmission dynamics. Although the spread of COVID-19 is being slowed down by vaccination and other interventions, there is still a need to have a clear understanding of the evolution of the pandemic across countries, states and communities. To this end, there is a need to have a clearer picture of the initial spread of the disease in different regions. In this project, we used a simple SEIR model and a Bayesian inference framework to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across Africa. Our estimates vary between 1.98 (Sudan) and 9.66 (Mauritius), with a median of 3.67 (90% CrI: 3.31–4.12). The estimates provided in this paper will help to inform COVID-19 modeling in the respective countries/regions."
https://openalex.org/W4214503602,"Although high-dose IL-2 has clear antitumor effects, severe side effects like severe toxicity and activation of Tregs by binding of IL-2 to high-affinity IL-2R, hypotension, and vascular leak syndrome limit its applications as a therapeutic antitumor agent. Here in this study, a rational computational approach was employed to develop and design novel triple-mutant IL-2 variants with the aim of improving IL-2-based immunotherapy. The affinity of the mutants towards IL-2Rα was further computed with the aid of molecular dynamic simulations and umbrella sampling techniques and the obtained results were compared to those of wild-type IL-2. In vitro experiments by flow cytometry showed that the anti-CD25 mAb was able to bind to PBMC cells even after mutant 2 preincubation, however, the binding strength of the mutant to α-subunit was less than of wtIL-2. Additionally, reduction of IL-2Rα subunit affinity did not significantly disturb IL-2/IL2Rβγc subunits interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4214671823,"Shopping behaviour in response to extreme events is often characterized as ""panic buying"" which connotes irrationality and loss of control. However, ""panic buying"" has been criticized for attributing shopping behaviour to people's alleged psychological frailty while ignoring other psychological and structural factors that might be at play. We report a qualitative exploration of the experiences and understandings of shopping behaviour of members of the public at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 23 participants, we developed three themes. The first theme addresses people's understandings of ""panic buying"". When participants referred to ""panic buying"" they meant observed product shortages (rather than the underlying psychological processes that can lead to such behaviours), preparedness behaviours, or emotions such as fear and worry. The second theme focuses on the influence of the media and other people's behaviour in shaping subsequent shopping behaviours. The third theme addresses the meaningful motivations behind increased shopping, which participants described in terms of preparedness; some participants reported increased shopping behaviours as a response to other people stockpiling, to reduce their trips to supermarkets, or to prepare for product shortages and longer stays at home. Overall, despite frequently using the term 'panic', the irrationalist connotations of ""panic buying"" were largely absent from participants' accounts. Thus, ""panic buying"" is not a useful concept and should not be used as it constructs expected responses to threat as irrational or pathological. It can also facilitate such behaviours, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy."
https://openalex.org/W4214726762,"Bovine rotavirus (BRV) is considered the leading cause of calf diarrhea worldwide, including Bangladesh. In this study we aimed to identify risk factors for BRV infection and determine the G and P genotypes of BRV strains in diarrheic calves. Fecal samples were collected from 200 diarrheic calves in three districts between January 2014 and October 2015. These samples were screened to detect the presence of BRV using rapid test-strips BIO K 152 (RTSBK). The RTSBK positive samples were further tested by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the silver staining technique to detect rotavirus dsRNA. Risk factors were identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The G and P genotypes of BRV were determined by RT-PCR and sequencing. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the neighbor-joining method using CLC sequence viewer 8.0. About 23% of the diarrheic calves were BRV positive. The odds of BRV infection were 3.8- (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.0–14.7) and 3.9-times (95% CI:1.1–14.2) higher in Barisal and Madaripur districts, respectively, than Sirrajganj. The risk of BRV infection was 3.1-times (95% CI: 1.5–6.5) higher in calves aged ≤ 5 weeks than those aged &gt;5 weeks. Moreover, the risk of BRV infection was 2.6-times (95% CI:1.1–5.8) higher in crossbred (Holstein Friesian, Shahiwal) than indigenous calves. G6P[11] was the predominant genotype (94.4%), followed by G10P[11] (5.6%). The BRV G6 strains were found to be closest (98.9–99.9%) to Indian strains, and BRV G10 strains showed 99.9% identities with Indian strain. The VP4 gene of all P[11] strains showed &gt;90% identities to each other and also with Indian strains. The most frequently identified BRV genotype was G6P[11]. About 23% of calf diarrhea cases were associated with BRV. To control disease, high-risk areas and younger crossbred calves should be targeted for surveillance and management. The predominant genotype could be utilized as the future vaccine candidate or vaccines with the dominant genotype should be used to control BRV diarrhea in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4214771895,"It is argued that ports are playing a crucial role in developing nations' economy. Still, solutions to improving port service quality (PSQ) to boost ports' competitive capacity is questionable. Hence, this study aims to investigate port service quality (PSQ) by using integration of the extension Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) from port users' perspectives. From the relevant literature and expert interview, the hierarchical structure of PSQ embracing six dimensions with 29 criteria was first established. To test the research model, the Dong Nai port joint stock company (DNPC) and their port-service users were empirically investigated. It is found that: (1) the importance degree of dimensions is ranked as follow: empathy (21.07%), tangibles (20.15%), assurance (15.97%), reliability (15.54%), responsiveness (12.53%), diversity (14.74%); (2) for criteria of PSQ, top five criteria concerned by shipping companies and ocean freight forwarders comprise: ""proactive provision of vessel schedules"", ""cargo handling facilities and equipment"", ""detailed schedule"", ""accuracy and consistency of schedules"", and ""geographical location""; (3) there are four service attributes (SAs) needing to prioritize for improvement, including ""perfect transportation of cargos"", ""ability in dealing with cargo damage"", ""willingness in helping customers"", ""provision of special cargo-related services"". The practical policy is that port authorities should transfer the limited resources from SAs in Quadrant IV to Quadrant II to enhance the PSQ."
https://openalex.org/W4214537005,"In this paper, we wanted to verify the hypothesis that extruding cartographic symbols on tactile maps to different heights might allow reducing the minimum (suggested in the literature) horizontal distances between them, without impacting the overall map's legibility. This approach might allow preparing tactile maps in smaller scales and thus, reducing production cost, or putting additional spatial information on the same map sheet that would not fit otherwise. To verify the hypothesis we have prepared 6 different stimuli variants with or without height differentiation applied and different horizontal distances between tactile symbols adopted (1 mm, 2 mm and 3 mm). In the controlled study sessions with 30 participants with visual impairments we have measured the times required for solving 3 different spatial tasks on 3D printed tactile stimuli. We have also performed qualitative analysis to learn participants' opinions about the proposed design and materials used. It turns out that applying height differentiation not only results in shorter times required for solving spatial tasks but is also considered by blind individuals as a convenient improvement in terms of use comfort and allows reduction of recommended minimum horizontal distances between symbols on tactile maps."
https://openalex.org/W4214658519,"Background and objective Most Asian patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) receive only dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) without oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists [VKA] or non-VKA oral anticoagulants [NOAC]). However, it has not been fully investigated whether the DAPT results in better clinical outcomes in the early period after PCI than the standard triple therapy with VKA or NOAC. Methods We analyzed the claims records of 11,039 Korean AF population who had PCI between 2013 and 2018. Patients were categorized according to the post-PCI antithrombotic therapy as VKA-based triple therapy (VKA-TT), NOAC-based triple therapy (NOAC-TT), and DAPT groups. After baseline adjustment using inverse probability weighting, we compared the risks of ischemic endpoints (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality) and major bleeding at 3 months post-PCI. Results Ischemic stroke, MI, and all-cause mortality occurred in 105, 423, and 379 patients, respectively, and 138 patients experienced major bleeding. The DAPT group was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke and major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37–0.84) compared to the VKA-TT group, despite no significant differences in the risks of MI and all-cause mortality. In contrast, the DAPT group demonstrated no significant difference in the risks for ischemic endpoints compared to the NOAC-TT group. Additionally, the DAPT group had a numerically lower risk of major bleeding than the NOAC-TT group but this was not statistically significant (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.45–1.07). Conclusions An outcome benefit of DAPT was observed in the early period after PCI compared to the VKA-TT, but not against NOAC-TT users among the Asian AF population. Given the potential long-term benefits of NOACs, greater efforts should be made to increase compliance in clinical practice with proper combination therapy with NOAC after PCI."
https://openalex.org/W4214764902,"Background Serious invasive infections in newborns are a major cause of death. Lack of data on etiological causes hampers progress towards reduction of mortality. This study aimed to identify pathogens responsible for such infections in young infants in sub-Saharan Africa and to describe their antibiotics resistance profile. Methods Between September 2016 and April 2018 we implemented an observational study in two rural sites in Burkina Faso and Tanzania enrolling young infants aged 0–59 days old with serious invasive infection. Blood samples underwent blood culture and molecular biology. Results In total 634 infants with clinical diagnosis of serious invasive infection were enrolled and 4.2% of the infants had a positive blood culture. The most frequent pathogens identified by blood culture were Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus , followed by Escherichia coli . Gram-negative isolates were only partially susceptible to first line WHO recommended treatment for neonatal sepsis at community level. A total of 18.6% of the infants were PCR positive for at least one pathogen and Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common bacteria detected. Among infants enrolled, 60/634 (9.5%) died. Positive blood culture but not positive PCR was associated with risk of death. For most deaths, no pathogen was identified either by blood culture or molecular testing, and hence a causal agent remained unclear. Mortality was associated with low body temperature, tachycardia, respiratory symptoms, convulsions, history of difficult feeding, movement only when stimulated or reduced level of consciousness, diarrhea and/or vomiting. Conclusion While Klebsiella pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus , as well as Escherichia coli were pathogens most frequently identified in infants with clinical suspicion of serious invasive infections, most cases remain without definite diagnosis, making more accurate diagnostic tools urgently needed. Antibiotics resistance to first line antibiotics is an increasing challenge even in rural Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4214560258,"Background We aimed to clarify the sex differences in various cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular outcomes, and to investigate whether sex differences in outcomes are affected by age in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Methods A cohort of 835 patients with HCM initially evaluated during 2007–2019 were followed for a median of 6.4 years. Study outcomes were all-cause death, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular death, sudden cardiac death (SCD)/SCD equivalent events, heart failure (HF) events, and the composite cardiovascular outcome including cardiovascular death, SCD/SCD equivalent events, admission for HF, and heart transplantation. Results Women were 5 years older (women 59.9±13.5 vs. men 54.9±11.4 years), had worse dyspnea, and greater left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and obstructive physiology at presentation. Women compared to men had higher all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event rates, driven by more cardiovascular deaths and heart failure (HF) events. Conversely, non-cardiovascular mortality was not different between the sexes. Female sex was independently associated with all-cause death (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.11–3.20) and composite cardiovascular events (HR 3.60, 95% CI 2.00–6.49), independent of age, body mass index, New York Heart Association class, SCD risk score, and LV ejection fraction. When stratified by the age of 60, sex differences were not significant at &lt;60 years; however, at ≥60 years, women had worse LV diastolic function, greater obstructive physiology, as well as worse survival and composite cardiovascular outcomes. Sex differences in outcomes remained consistent after propensity score matching for age and other clinical characteristics. Conclusions Women with HCM have worse cardiovascular prognosis than men, driven by higher cardiovascular mortality and HF events. The negative impact of female sex on cardiac function and cardiovascular outcome became prominent at age ≥60 years, suggesting age-related sex differences in the prognosis of HCM."
https://openalex.org/W4214606478,"The complement system plays an important role in pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and might be involved in accelerated atherogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The role of complement activation in response to treatment, and in development of premature CVD in RA, is limited. Therefore, we examined the effects of methotrexate (MTX) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) on complement activation using soluble terminal complement complex (TCC) levels in RA; and assessed associations between TCC and inflammatory and cardiovascular biomarkers.We assessed 64 RA patients starting with MTX monotherapy (n = 34) or TNFi with or without MTX co-medication (TNFi±MTX, n = 30). ELISA was used to measure TCC in EDTA plasma. The patients were examined at baseline, after 6 weeks and 6 months of treatment.Median TCC was 1.10 CAU/mL, and 57 (89%) patients had TCC above the estimated upper reference limit (<0.70). Compared to baseline, TCC levels were significantly lower at 6-week visit (0.85 CAU/mL, p<0.0001), without significant differences between the two treatment regimens. Notably, sustained reduction in TCC was only achieved after 6 months on TNFi±MTX (0.80 CAU/mL, p = 0.006). Reductions in TCC after treatment were related to decreased C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and interleukin 6, and increased levels of total, high and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Similarly, baseline TCC was significantly related to baseline CRP, ESR and interleukin 6. Patients with endothelial dysfunction had higher baseline TCC than those without (median 1.4 versus 1.0 CAU/mL, p = 0.023).Patients with active RA had elevated TCC, indicating increased complement activation. TCC decreased with antirheumatic treatment already after 6 weeks. However, only treatment with TNFi±MTX led to sustained reduction in TCC during the 6-month follow-up period. RA patients with endothelial dysfunction had higher baseline TCC compared to those without, possibly reflecting involvement of complement in the atherosclerotic process in RA."

We investigated the relationship between SIBO and LC, and the difference between hydrogen-producing and methane-producing SIBO (H-SIBO and M-SIBO, respectively). This is a prospective cohort study of 107 cases. Breath measurements of hydrogen and methane concentrations were performed for the diagnosis of SIBO. The study cohort included 81 males with a median age of 70 (40-86) years, and SIBO was detected in 31 cases (29.0%). There were no significant differences between the SIBO positive and SIBO negative groups. Reclassification into H-SIBO (16 cases) and others (91 cases) was performed, and the Child-Pugh score was only derived in the multivariate logistic analysis (P = 0.028, odds ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.85). Furthermore, H-SIBO was significantly associated with covert HE in chi-square test (50.0% vs. 24.2%, P = 0.034). In addition, we evaluated the therapeutic response on SIBO of rifaximin in eight covert HE patients. 20% patients with M-SIBO and 67% patients with H-SIBO showed an improvement of the breath test. In conclusion, H-SIBO, but not M-SIBO, is significantly associated with liver function, and rifaximin might be more effective for covert HE with H-SIBO. Therefore, the diagnosis of SIBO, including the classification as H-SIBO and M-SIBO, might help to determine the choice of treatment for HE."
https://openalex.org/W4214507993,"Topiramate (TPM) was an antiepileptic agent commonly used in clinical. Studies showed that an oral preparation of TPM with extended-release manner could bring some benefits for epileptics. In this paper, controlled release push-pull osmotic pump (PPOP) tablets of sparingly water-soluble TPM were successfully prepared. This bi-layer tablet core mainly consisted of sodium chloride as osmotic promoting agent and polyethylene oxide as suspending and pushing agents. The influences of osmotic agents, pushing agents and the compositions of coating membrane on TPM release profiles were evaluated. An optimal formulation of TPM-PPOP was obtained through single-factor experiments. In vitro release tests showed that the optimum formulation could release TPM at an approximate zero-order rate up to 8 h. Pharmacokinetic behaviors of TPM-PPOP tablets were evaluated and compared with the immediate release capsules after an oral single dose in beagle dogs. Pharmacokinetics results demonstrated that the TPM-PPOP tablet was able to provide a prolonged release of TPM with longer t max and mean residence time. Lower fluctuations of drug plasma levels could also be achieved with TPM-PPOP tablets. These results suggested that sparely water-soluble drugs as TPM can be designed to PPOP for efficacy and safety use."
https://openalex.org/W4214638193,"Soon after SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019, Belgium was confronted with a first COVID-19 wave in March-April 2020. SARS-CoV-2 circulation declined in the summer months (late May to early July 2020). Following a successfully trumped late July-August peak, COVID-19 incidence fell slightly, to then enter two successive phases of rapid incline: in the first half of September, and then again in October 2020. The first of these coincided with the peak period of returning summer travelers; the second one coincided with the start of higher education's academic year. The largest observed COVID-19 incidence occurred in the period 16-31 October, particularly in the Walloon Region, the southern, French-speaking part of Belgium. We examine the potential association of the higher education population with spatio-temporal spread of COVID-19, using Bayesian spatial Poisson models for confirmed test cases, accounting for socio-demographic heterogeneity in the population. We find a significant association between the number of COVID-19 cases in the age groups 18-29 years and 30-39 years and the size of the higher education student population at the municipality level. These results can be useful towards COVID-19 mitigation strategies, particularly in areas where virus transmission from higher education students into the broader community could exacerbate morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 among populations with prevalent underlying conditions associated with more severe outcomes following infection."
https://openalex.org/W4214745074,"Both chronic pain and sleep disorders are associated with a reduction in the quality of life. They can be both a cause and a consequence of each other, and should therefore be simultaneously treated. However, optimal treatments for chronic pain-related sleep disorders are not well established. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of suvorexant, a novel sleep drug, and mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, on pain-related changes in sleep parameters in a preclinical chronic pain mice model, by partial sciatic nerve ligation. We evaluated the quantity, duration, and depth of sleep by analyzing the electroencephalogram and voluntary activity by counting the number of wheel rotations to determine various symptoms of sleep disorders, including reduced total sleep time, fragmentation, low quality, and impaired activity in the daytime. Suvorexant and mirtazapine normalized the reduction in sleep time and fragmented sleep, further regaining the sleep depth at sleep onset in the chronic pain state in nerve-ligated mice. Mirtazapine also increased the percentage of rapid eye movement sleep in mice. Suvorexant decreased voluntary activity, which was prolonged after administration; however, mirtazapine did not decrease it. Although the effects of suvorexant and mirtazapine on sleep and activity are different, both suvorexant and mirtazapine could be potential therapeutic agents for chronic pain-related sleep disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4214513311,"In 2014, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS set an 'ambitious' 90-90-90 target for 2020. By 2016, there were disparities observed among countries in their progress towards the targets and some believed the targets were not achievable. In this report, we present the results of data from the Ethiopia Population-based HIV Impact Assessment survey analyzed to assess progress with the targets and associated factors.We conducted a nationally representative survey in urban areas of Ethiopia. Socio-demographic and behavioural data were collected from consenting participants using a structured interview. HIV testing was done following the national HIV rapid testing algorithm and seropositivity confirmed using a supplemental laboratory assay. HIV viral suppression was considered if the viral load was <1,000 RNA copies/ml. Screening antiretroviral drugs was done for efavirenz, lopinavir, and tenofovir, which were in use during the survey period. In this analysis, we generated weighted descriptive statistics and used bivariate and logistic regression analysis to examine for associations. The 95% confidence interval was used to measure the precision of estimates and the significance level set at p<0.05.Of 19,136 eligible participants aged 15-64 years, 614 (3% [95% CI: 0.8-3.3]) were HIV-positive, of which 79.0% (95% CI: 4.7-82.7) were aware of their HIV status, and 97.1% (95% CI: 95.0-98.3 were on antiretroviral therapy, of which 87.6% (95% CI: 83.9-90.5) achieved viral load suppression. Awareness about HIV-positive status was significantly higher among females (aOR = 2.8 [95% CI: 1.38-5.51]), significantly increased with age, the odds being highest for those aged 55-64 years (aOR = 11.4 [95% CI: 2.52-51.79]) compared to those 15-24 years, and was significantly higher among those who used condom at last sex in the past 12 months (aOR = 5.1 [95% CI: 1.68-15.25]). Individuals with secondary education and above were more likely to have achieved viral suppression (aOR = 8.2 [95% CI: 1.82-37.07]) compared with those with no education.Ethiopia made encouraging progress towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. The country needs to intensify its efforts to achieve the targets. A particular focus is required to fill the gaps in knowledge of HIV-positive status to increase case identification among population groups such as males, the youth, and those with low education."
https://openalex.org/W4214515630,"This study aims to identify government influence in the adoption of e-government by citizens (AEC) through a case study analyzing actions in Antioquia, Colombia, to increase AEC in annual vehicle tax filing and payment services. We classified these actions employing institutional theory, institutional interventions, and legitimation strategies. An analysis correlating AEC actions (including the COVID-19 containment measures) with over 16 million transactions in these two services during 2015–2020 found a strong government influence on AEC. We established coercive pressure and conformance to the environment as important predictors of AEC, but the COVID-19 containment measures only influenced electronic tax payments. Service type was also an essential predictor for these services; however, mobilization was not. Increasing AEC should be considered a necessary objective for public administrations, especially in developing countries that face shortages of resources and facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4214563689,"In healthcare settings, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) populations often experience discrimination, leading to decreased healthcare services utilization. In this study we have tried to identify oral healthcare providers (OHP)'s perceptions toward LGBTQ+ patients, perceived barriers for LGBTQ+ patients in accessing oral health services, and whether they were open to inclusive oral healthcare practices. In addition, the experiences of LGBTQ+ patients in oral healthcare settings including their oral healthcare seeking behaviors and beliefs were also explored.Descriptive, quantitative surveys were administered to OHPs and LGBTQ+ patients within Indiana and Michigan. Surveys contained questions about participant demographics, including gender and sexual minority status, and the presence of inclusive healthcare practices within the oral healthcare settings. Descriptive analyses and regression modeling were used to explore the distribution of participant responses and to identify predictors associated with patient comfort and OHP's attitudes toward LGBTQ+ patients.Overall, 71% of LGBTQ+ patients reported regularly attending dental appointments; however, 43% reported feeling uncomfortable going to appointments and 34% reported being treated unfairly during appointments because of sexual orientation. Among OHPs, 84% reported that the healthcare settings where they practiced were welcoming for LGBTQ+ populations and 84% reported willingness to improve LGBTQ+ care. The presence of inclusive healthcare practices predicted comfort for LGBTQ+ patients (P < 0.10). Additionally, OHPs who either identified as an ally or as having a family member or close friend in the LGBTQ+ community had higher odds of feeling responsible to treat LGBTQ+ patients.Many LGBTQ+ patients often experience discomfort in oral healthcare settings. While OHPs were largely unaware of this, evidence suggests the need for cultural competency training for OHPs."

In this study, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm is used to distinguish 1.4-second segment shockable signals from non-shockable signals promptly. The proposed technique is frequency-independent and is trained with signals from diverse patients extracted from MIT-BIH, MIT-BIH Malignant Ventricular Ectopy Database (VFDB), and a database for ventricular tachyarrhythmia signals from Creighton University (CUDB) resulting, in an accuracy of 99.1%. Finally, the raspberry pi minicomputer is used to load the optimized version of the model on it. Testing the implemented model on the processor by unseen ECG signals resulted in an average latency of 0.845 seconds meeting the IEC 60601-2-4 requirements. According to the evaluated results, the proposed technique could be used by AED’s."
https://openalex.org/W4214580077,"UNAIDS' HIV treatment targets require that 90% of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) achieve viral suppression and 90% of people with viral suppression have good health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study aimed to examine the association of depression and antidepressant therapy with ART adherence and HRQOL in HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM). From 2018 through 2020, HIV-infected MSMs were consecutively recruited (N = 565) for the evaluation of ART adherence and HRQOL at Taipei City Hospital HIV clinics. Non-adherence to ART was defined as a Medication Adherence Report Scale score of < 23. HRQOL in PLWHHA was evaluated using WHOQOL-BREF, Taiwan version. Overall, 14.0% had depression and 12.4% exhibited non-adherence to ART. The nonadherence proportion was 21.8% and 10.5% in depressed and nondepressed HIV-infected MSM, respectively. After adjusting for other covariates, depression was associated with a higher risk of nonadherence to ART (adjusted odds ratio = 2.02; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-4.00). Physical, psychological, social, and environmental HRQOL were significantly negatively associated with depression. Considering antidepressant therapy, ART nonadherence was significantly associated with depression without antidepressant therapy but not with antidepressant therapy. The depressed HIV-infected MSM without antidepressant therapy had worse psychological, social, and environmental HRQOL than those with antidepressant therapy. Our study suggests that depression is associated with poor ART adherence and HRQOL, particularly in those without antidepressant therapy. Adequate diagnosis and treatment of depression should be provided for PLWHA to improve their ART adherence and HRQOL."
https://openalex.org/W4214585667,"Manual proteomic sample preparation methods limit sample throughput and often lead to poor data quality when thousands of samples must be analyzed. Automated liquid handler systems are increasingly used to overcome these issues for many of the sample preparation steps. Here, we detail a step-by-step protocol to prepare samples for bottom-up proteomic analysis for Gram-negative bacterial and fungal cells. The full modular protocol consists of three optimized protocols to: (A) lyse Gram-negative bacteria and fungal cells; (B) quantify the amount of protein extracted; and (C) normalize the amount of protein and set up tryptic digestion. These protocols have been developed to facilitate rapid, low variance sample preparation of hundreds of samples, be easily implemented on widely-available Beckman-Coulter Biomek automated liquid handlers, and allow flexibility for future protocol development. By using this workflow 50 micrograms of protein from 96 samples can be prepared for tryptic digestion in under an hour. We validate these protocols by analyzing 47 Pseudomonas putida and Rhodosporidium toruloides samples and show that this modular workflow provides robust, reproducible proteomic samples for high-throughput applications. The expected results from these protocols are 94 peptide samples from Gram-negative bacterial and fungal cells prepared for bottom-up quantitative proteomic analysis without the need for desalting column cleanup and with protein relative quantity variance (CV%) below 15%."
https://openalex.org/W4214722161,"The Sustainable Development Goal 3.8.2 is an indicator to track a country's progress toward universal health coverage on the financial protection against catastrophic health expenditure (CHE). The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of households with catastrophic health expenditure, and its associated factors among Malaysian households. A secondary data analysis was performed using the Household Expenditure Survey 2015/2016. The inclusion criterion was Malaysian households with some health spending in the past 12 months before the date of the survey. Catastrophic health expenditure was defined as out-of-pocket health expenditures exceeding 10% of the total household consumption. The study included a total of 13015 households. The proportion of households with CHE in the sample was 2.8%. Female-led households (AdjOR 1.6; CI 1.25, 2.03; p-value <0.001), households in rural areas (AdjOR 1.29; 95% CI 1.04, 1.61; p-value = 0.022), small household size (AdjOR 2.4; 95% CI 1.81, 3.18; p-value <0.001) and heads of household under 60 years old (AdjOR2.34; 95% CI 1.81, 3.18; p-value <0.001) were significantly associated with CHE. Although the proportion of Malaysian households affected by CHE is small, it is increasing in comparison to previous findings. This is concerning because it may jeopardise efforts to achieve universal health coverage by 2030. To ensure financial protection and access to care, a health financing policy that includes safety net measures for households at risk of CHE is required."
https://openalex.org/W4214729796,"In many systems, patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes experience delays in transport to thrombectomy-capable centers. This pilot study examined use of a novel emergency medical services (EMS) protocol to expedite transfer of patients with LVOs to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC). From October 1, 2020 to February 22, 2021, Indianapolis EMS piloted a protocol, in which paramedics, after transporting a patient with a possible stroke remained at the patient's bedside until released by the emergency department or neurology physician. In patients with possible LVO, EMS providers remained at the bedside until the clinical assessment and CT angiography (CTA) were complete. If indicated, the paramedics at bedside transferred the patient, via the same ambulance, to a nearby thrombectomy-capable CSC with which an automatic transfer agreement had been arranged. This five-month mixed methods study included case-control assessment of use of the protocol, number of transfers, safety during transport, and time saved in transfer compared to emergent transfers via conventional interfacility transfer agencies. In qualitative analysis EMS providers, and ED physicians and neurologists at both sending and receiving institutions, completed e-mail surveys on the process, and offered suggestions for process improvement. Responses were coded with an inductive content analysis approach. The protocol was used 42 times during the study period; four patients were found to have LVOs and were transferred to the CSC. There were no adverse events. Median time from decision-to-transfer to arrival at the CSC was 27.5 minutes (IQR 24.5-29.0), compared to 314.5 minutes (IQR 204.0-459.3) for acute non-stroke transfers during the same period. Major themes of provider impressions included: incomplete awareness of the protocol, smooth process, challenges when a stroke alert was activated after EMS left the hospital, greater involvement of EMS in patient care, and comments on communication and efficiency. This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and efficiency of a novel approach to expedite endovascular therapy for patients with LVOs."
https://openalex.org/W4214494259,"Chronic inflammation causes dysregulated expression of microRNAs. Aberrant microRNA expression is associated with endothelial dysfunction. In this study we determined whether TNF-α inhibition impacted the expression of miRNA-146a-5p and miRNA-155-5p, and whether changes in the expression of these miRNAs were related to inflammation-induced changes in endothelial function in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Sixty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control (n = 24), CIA (n = 24) and CIA+etanercept (n = 16) groups. CIA and CIA+etanercept groups were immunized with bovine type-II collagen, emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Upon signs of arthritis, the CIA+etanercept group received 10mg/kg of etanercept intraperitoneally, every three days. After six weeks of treatment, mesenteric artery vascular reactivity was assessed using wire-myography. Serum concentrations of TNF-α, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and pentraxin-3 (PTX-3) were measured by ELISA. Relative expression of circulating miRNA-146a-5p and miRNA-155-5p were determined using RT-qPCR. Compared to controls, circulating miRNA-155-5p, VCAM-1 and PTX-3 concentrations were increased, and vessel relaxation was impaired in the CIA (all p<0.05), but not in the CIA+etanercept (all p<0.05) groups. The CIA group had greater miRNA-146a-5p expression compared to the CIA+etanercept group (p = 0.005). Independent of blood pressure, miRNA-146a-5p expression was associated with increased PTX-3 concentrations (p = 0.03), while miRNA-155-5p expression was associated with impaired vessel relaxation (p = 0.01). In conclusion, blocking circulating TNF-α impacted systemic inflammation-induced increased expression of miRNA-146a-5p and miRNA-155-5p, which were associated with endothelial inflammation and impaired endothelial dependent vasorelaxation, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W4214494775,"The economic, environmental and social sustainability of Dutch dairy farms have attracted increasing societal concern in the past decades. In this paper, we propose a recently developed dynamic Luenberger indicator based on the by-production model to measure dynamic productivity growth in the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability of Dutch dairy farms. Subsequently, we investigate the statistical associations between productivity growth and socio-economic factors using the OLS bootstrap regression model. We find that dairy farms have suffered a decline in dynamic sustainable productivity growth, especially in the environmental dimension where it is more pronounced than in the economic and social dimensions. Furthermore, we find that both technical and scale inefficiency change contribute to the decline of environmental productivity growth. Specialization and government support are associated with a higher economic and environmental sustainability productivity growth, and with, a decreased growth of social sustainable productivity. We found no significant association between the age of the oldest entrepreneur, financial structure, farm size or cost of advisory service and dynamic productivity growth in the three sustainability dimensions. The results provide insights into potential pathways towards improving the three pillars of sustainability."

https://openalex.org/W4214638710,"In older adults, kidney function declines with age. People with advanced kidney diseases may have poor olfaction. However, it is unclear whether poor olfaction is a marker for declining renal function or future risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We therefore investigated olfaction in relation to kidney function and risk of CKD.These secondary data analyses were limited to participants of the year 3 clinical visit of the Health Aging and Body Composition Study. The analytic sample size varied between 1427 to 2531, depending on participant eligibility and data availability for each analysis. Olfaction was tested using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), defined as anosmia (score≤6), hyposmia (7-8), moderate (9-10), and good function (10-11) at baseline. We estimated glomerular filter rate (eGFR) at baseline and seven years later using the CKD-EPI creatinine-cystatin C equation, and defined incident CKD as eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73m2 and eGFR decline ≥1 ml/min/1.73m2/year. Further, we identified CKD hospitalization events from hospitalization and death records. We used inverse probability weighting and weighted multivariable regressions to account for censoring in the prospective analyses and used absolute risk regression to account for competing risk of death.At baseline, compared to participants with good olfaction, the multivariable-adjusted mean eGFR was 3.00 ml/min/1.73m2 lower (95% confidence interval (CI): -5.25, -0.75) for those with anosmia and 1.87 lower (95% CI: -3.94, 0.21) for those with hyposmia with a P for linear trend < 0.001. Those with anosmia at baseline was had a significantly lower eGFR seven years later (-5.31, 95% CI: -8.58, -2.04, P for trend = 0.002), but the association was attenuated after further accounting for baseline eGFR (-2.37, 95%CI: -4.91, 0.16, P for linear trend = 0.147). Olfactory function was not associated with incident CKD or CKD hospitalization.In older adults > age 70 years, poor olfaction is associated with lower kidney function, but not future CKD risk. These associations should be further investigated in relatively younger population."
https://openalex.org/W4214660987,"Following boom-and-bust economic cycles provoked by Brazilian governmental attempts to integrate Indigenous peoples into national society, it is approximately since the beginning of the 2000s that Brazilian Indigenous peoples came to be viewed officially as ""poor"" and victims of ""hunger."" Consequently, the national indigenist agency and other State entities started to conceive and implement diverse initiatives that ultimately injected money and resources into Indigenous communities. In 2019 we undertook an ethnographic study in three A'uwẽ (Xavante) communities in the Pimentel Barbosa Indigenous Reserve, Central Brazil, with the objective of analyzing how people understand and pursue food security. We propose that in the studied communities the complex network of A'uwẽ food reciprocity is a fundamental strategy for mitigating hunger and acute lack of food. We show that among the A'uwẽ, the hybrid economy that developed since the 1970s has proved resilient to dramatic transformations and uncertainty in the availability and characteristics of external government inputs."
https://openalex.org/W4214711476,"Nordic hamstring exercise is performed to prevent knee flexor muscle strain injuries and used to assess their injury risks. However, what exactly Nordic hamstring strength indicates is not clear. We investigated the relationship between Nordic hamstring strength and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque of the knee flexors measured by an isokinetic dynamometer. Sixteen healthy young men who had not experienced hamstring strain injuries participated in the study. In Nordic hamstring, each participant was instructed to lean forward as far as possible in 3 s (approximately 30°/s), and force at the ankle joint of the dominant leg was measured during the movement. The force was multiplied by lower leg length and converted into torque. MVC torque of the knee flexors was measured isometrically at 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90° knee flexion joint angles, and concentrically and eccentrically at 30°/s and 60°/s in 10°-90° knee flexion for the dominant leg in a prone position. Correlations among the dependent variables were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficients. Peak Nordic hamstring torque ranged 96.8-163.5 Nm, and peak MVC eccentric torque ranged 50.7-109.4 Nm at 30°/s and 59.2-121.2 Nm at 60°/s. No significant correlations were evident between the peak Nordic hamstring torque and peak eccentric knee flexion torque (r = 0.24-0.3, p = 0.26-0.4). This was also the case for the Nordic hamstring torque and MVC torque of isometric (r = -0.03-0.1, p = 0.71-0.92) and concentric contractions (r = 0.28-0.49, p = 0.053-0.29). These results show that Nordic hamstring strength is not associated with the knee flexor torque measured by an isokinetic dynamometer. It may be that other factors than static and dynamic hamstring strengths affect Nordic hamstring strength."
https://openalex.org/W4214726916,"Controlling the manganese (Mn2+) concentration is important to product quality in the electrolytic manganese industry. Conventional methods for detecting Mn2+ are complex and reagent-consuming, which makes them slow and polluting. It is of great significance to develop a new fast and environmentally friendly method to quantify Mn2+ in electrolyte. The characteristic ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorbance at 401 nm of Mn2+ will vary linearly with the Mn2+ concentration after data correction. Adjusting the pH, calibrating the spectral bandwidth (SBW) and optical path length (OPL), and subtracting the interference from coexisting substances by linear interpolation improve the measuring accuracy. Mn2+ concentration can be determined by direct fast UV-vis absorbance measurement at characteristic peaks without using harmful reagents which facilitates such measurement to be applicated as on-line detection method for electrolytic manganese industry. The method developed in this study will help achieve the goal of improving the detection speed while cutting back on pollutant discharge from concentration analysis process in electrolytic manganese industry."

FAF images on Heidelberg Retina Angiogram Digital Angiography System (HRA) or HRA2 were classified into eight patterns based on the International Fundus Autofluorescence Classification Group system. The patients in which the fellow eyes progressed to advanced nAMD, including those who did not develop nAMD, were assessed based on the following factors: baseline FAF patterns, age, sex, visual acuity, drusen, retinal pigmentation, baseline retinal sensitivity, family history, smoking, supplement intake, hypertension, body mass index, and hematological parameters.Of the 66 patients, 20 dropped out of the study. Of the remaining 46 patients, 14 (30.42%, male: 9, female: 5) progressed to nAMD during the 5-year follow-up. The most common (50% eyes) FAF pattern in the fellow eyes was the patchy pattern. According to the univariate analysis, CNV development was significantly associated with age, supplement intake, and low-density lipoprotein levels (p<0.05). Multivariable analysis revealed that patients who showed non-compliance with the supplement intake were more likely to develop nAMD (p<0.05). No significant association was found between the patchy pattern and CNV development (p = 0.86).The fellow eyes (with abnormal FAF) of patients with unilateral nAMD may progress from early to advanced nAMD. However, no FAF pattern was found that predicted progression in nAMD."
https://openalex.org/W4214553200,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is heterogeneous in terms of proteinuria. Patients with DKD who present with low-grade proteinuria are more likely to have nephrosclerosis rather than traditional diabetic nephropathy. The amount of proteinuria might reflect the underlying pathology of renal failure and influence the prognosis after dialysis initiation. Clinical implications of proteinuria at the start of dialysis have not been confirmed, while greater proteinuria is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the predialysis stages of chronic kidney disease. We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study enrolling incident hemodialysis patients with diabetes. Patients were stratified using proteinuria quartiles. We examined the association of proteinuria quartiles with types of subsequent CVD. Among the enrolled 361 patients, the estimated mean glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria was 5.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 6.3 g/gCr, respectively. Lower quartile of proteinuria (cut-offs: 3.0, 5.4, and 8.8 g/gCr) was significantly associated with male, older age, and history of atherosclerotic CVD including coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, and cerebral infarction (Ptrend<0.05). Kidney size was smaller in patients with lower levels of proteinuria. Patients with higher levels of proteinuria were more likely to have proliferative diabetic retinopathy (Ptrend<0.05). Multivariate competing risk analysis revealed that the first quartile of proteinuria was associated with a greater risk of atherosclerotic CVD than the third quartile (subhazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 2.04 [1.00-4.14]). This association was attenuated after additional adjustments for history of atherosclerotic CVD. Furthermore, patients with lower quartiles of proteinuria were more likely to die of atherosclerotic CVD than those with non-atherosclerotic CVD (Ptrend = 0.01). Diabetic patients with lower proteinuria at dialysis initiation were characterized by severer macroangiopathy, as shown by a more atrophic kidney and higher prevalence of past atherosclerotic CVD. Hence, they are at a high risk of developing atherosclerotic CVD."

Food security, the outcome, was measured using the Household Hunger Scale (HHS) in three categories: little to no hunger (food secure), moderate hunger, and severe hunger. Membership in the USAID Kizazi Kipya-supported economic strengthening intervention (i.e. WORTH Yetu) was the main independent variable. Data analysis involved generalized estimating equation (GEE) for multivariate analysis. With mean age of 50.3 years at baseline, the study analyzed 132,583 caregivers, 72.2% of whom were female. At midline, 7.6% of all caregivers enrolled at baseline were members in WORTH Yetu. Membership in WORTH Yetu was significantly effective in reducing household hunger among the caregivers: severe hunger dropped from 9.4% at baseline to 4.1% at midline; moderate hunger dropped from 65.9% at baseline to 62.8% at midline; and food security (i.e., little to no hunger households) increased from 25.2% at baseline to 33.1% at midline. In the multivariate analysis, membership in WORTH Yetu reduced the likelihood of severe hunger by 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.48-0.59), and moderate hunger by 21% (OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.76-0.83), but increased the likelihood of food security by 45% (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.39-1.51). The USAID Kizazi Kipya's model of household economic strengthening for OVC caregivers was effective in improving food security and reducing household hunger in Tanzania. This underscores the need to expand WORTH Yetu coverage. Meanwhile, these results indicate a potential of applying the intervention in similar settings to address household hunger."

This situation is further exacerbated by a dearth of new antibiotic development, the focus of pharmaceutical companies having shifted to more lucrative treatments for chronic conditions such as elevated blood pressure. To conserve the efficacy of the current crop of antibiotics, it is vital that they are used appropriately by individuals. Effective education may be a means to achieve such appropriate use. This paper reports on a large-scale, mixed methods study, which employed a survey and oral questionnaires, undertaken with senior secondary Omani students. The study explored students' understanding of antibiotic resistance as well as their attitudes to the issue of antibiotic resistance. The study findings indicated that, although some students had a reasonably clear understanding of antibiotic resistance, many had serious misconceptions that could result in misuse of antibiotics. The article concludes with suggestions for amending secondary school pedagogy in Oman to address the misconceptions."
https://openalex.org/W4214650971,"It is generally thought that the anterior border of the opisthosoma of acariform mites is delineated by the disjugal furrow, but there is no evidence to support this other than the superficial appearance of tagmosis in some oribatids. It is proposed herein that the disjugal furrow is an apomorphic feature that does not correspond with any segmental borders. Although the disjugal furrow is absent from Proteonematalycus wagneri Kethley, the visible body segments of this species indicate that this furrow, when present, intersects the metapodosoma. Therefore, the disjugal furrow does not delineate the anterior border of the opisthosoma. Instead, this border is between segments D and E (segments VI and VII for all arachnids). This hypothesis can be accommodated by a new model in which the proterosoma warps upwards relative to the main body axis. This model, which is applicable to all Acariformes, if not all arachnids, explains the following phenomena: 1) the location of the gnathosomal neuromeres within the idiosoma; 2) the relatively posterior position of the paired eyes; 3) the shape of the synganglion; 4) the uneven distribution of legs in most species of acariform mites with elongate bodies."
https://openalex.org/W4214710098,"Routine health information system (RHIS) has been repeatedly updated to provide quality information. However, its timeliness has rarely been tracked. This study investigated the reporting status and the timeliness of quarterly reports of the national RHIS in the Philippines, based on its 19 years-operation in Palawan.We analyzed the timeliness of 94.7% (1568/1656) of the quarterly reports that we obtained the date of receipt submitted by 22 health centers in Palawan from 1996 to 2014. The RHIS update in 2008 increased the number of reporting items and extended the submission due date since 2009 while computerized 15 health centers since 2011. We performed Fisher's exact test to examine changing the proportion of timely reports and multiple comparisons with permutation tests for changing the mean of the quarterly median lead times, median delays and interquartile ranges (IQR), for four periods of different operational requirements in the RHIS.The update increased the timely reports from 6.7% (70/1045) to 22.4% (117/523) (p<0.001). The delay remained stable from 14.2 days to 16.1 days (p = 0.654). However, the IQR widened 2.31 times (p = 0.004) compared to 15.7. Despite the increased burden, the continued manual data processing decreased the delay by 7.1 days (p = 0.023) and remained the IQR stable at 1.19 times (p = 0.670), while 15 health centers were computerized, it increased the delay by 6.4 days (p = 0.037) and widened the IQR by 2.87 times (p = 0).More attention must be paid to controlling the timeliness of RHIS when we introduce new interventions and perform daily management. Extending the due date increased timely reports. However, introducing unfamiliar tasks increased delay and uncertainty in timeliness. In a low-resource setting, an effective intervention needs to consider modest operating procedure changes that extend the existing routines to which the staff in charge has already accustomed."
https://openalex.org/W4214750098,"To explore differences in the use of lipid lowering therapy and/or achievement of lipid guideline targets in patients with and without prior depression and influence of sex in very high-risk coronary patients.A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted using individual-level linked electronic health record data in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (2012-2017) in Wales. The cohort comprised of 13,781 patients (27.4% female), with 26.1% having prior depression. Lipid levels were recorded in 10,050 patients of whom 25% had depression. History of depression was independently associated with not having lipids checked (OR 0.79 95%CI 0.72-0.87 p<0.001). Patients with prior depression were less likely to achieve targets for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C <1.8mmol/l), non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C <2.6mmol/l) and triglycerides (<2.3mmol/l) than patients without depression (OR 0.86 95%CI 0.78-0.96 p = 0.007, OR 0.80 95%CI 0.69-0.92 p = 0.003 & OR 0.69 95CI% 0.61-0.79 p<0.001 respectively). Females were less likely to achieve targets for LDL-C and non-HDL-C than males (OR 0.55 95%CI 0.50-0.61 p<0.001 & OR 0.63 95%CI 0.55-0.73 p<0.001). There was an additive effect of depression and sex; females with depression were not only least likely to be tested (OR 0.74 95%CI 0.65-0.84 p<0.001) but also (where levels were known) less likely to achieve LDL-C (OR 0.47 95%CI 0.41-0.55 p<0.001) and non-HDL-C targets (OR 0.50 95%CI 0.41-0.60 p<0.001). It was not possible to look at the influence of medication adherence on achievement of lipid targets due to limitations of the use of anonymised routinely-held clinical care data.Patients with prior depression were less likely to have their lipids monitored and achieve guideline targets within 1-year. Females with depression are the least likely to be tested and achieve lipid targets, suggesting not only a greater risk of future events, but also an opportunity to improve care."
https://openalex.org/W4214753509,"The proximal humerus fracture is a common injury, but the optimal management is much debated. The decision for operative or nonoperative treatment is strongly influenced by patient specific factors, regional and cultural differences and the preference of the patient and treating surgeon. The aim of this study is to compare operative and nonoperative treatment of proximal humerus fractures for those patients for whom there is disagreement about optimal management.This protocol describes an international multicenter prospective cohort study, in which all patients of 18 years and older presenting within three weeks after injury with a radiographically diagnosed displaced proximal humerus fracture can be included. Based on patient characteristics and radiographic images several clinical experts advise on the preferred treatment option. In case of disagreement among the experts, the patient can be included in the study. The actual treatment that will be delivered is at the discretion of the treating physician. The primary outcome is the QuickDash score at 12 months. Propensity score matching will be used to control for potential confounding of the relation between treatment modality and QuickDash scores.The LADON study is an international multicenter prospective cohort study with a relatively new methodological study design. This study is a ""natural experiment"" meaning patients receive standard local treatment and surgeons perform standard local procedures, therefore high participation rates of patients and surgeons are expected. Patients are only included after expert panel evaluation, when there is proven disagreement between experts, which makes this a unique study design. Through this inclusion process, we create two comparable groups whom received different treatments and where expert disagree about the already initiated treatment. Since we are zooming in on this particular patient group, confounding will be largely mitigated. Internationally the treatment of proximal humerus fractures are still much debated and differs much per country and hospital. This observational study with a natural experiment design will create insight into which treatment modality is to be preferred for patients in whom there is disagreement about the optimal treatment strategy.Registered in Netherlands trial register NL9357 and Swiss trial register CH 2020-00961; https://clinicaltrials.gov/."
https://openalex.org/W4214772914,"We investigated human performance in speed and precision of detecting a deviating visual target embedded in one of two otherwise identical non-figurative Perlin-noise images (i.e. a spot-the-difference task). The image-pairs were presented in four different presentation formats: spatially separated in horizontal or vertical direction while simultaneously presented, or sequentially separated on the same location with a brief delay or without any delay. In the two spatial conditions failure to detect the target within 30 sec (change blindness) occurred in about 6–7% of the trials, and with the brief delay 2.4% of the trials. Fast error-free detection (i.e. pop out) was obtained using the sequential format with no delay. Average detection time when target was detected was about 9 sec for the two spatial formats. Detection time was faster, about 6 sec, for the brief delay condition. In trials where detection was reported, the precision of locating the target was equal in the horizontal and brief delay conditions, and better than in the vertical condition. Misses obtained in the horizontal and brief delay conditions were also more strongly correlated than correlations between misses in the vertical and horizontal, and between the vertical and brief delay conditions. Some individuals’ performances when comparing images in the vertical direction were at chance level. This suggests influences of known poorer precision when making saccades in the vertical compared to horizontal direction. The results may have applications for radiologists since the stimuli and task is similar to radiologists’ task when detecting deviations between radiological images."
