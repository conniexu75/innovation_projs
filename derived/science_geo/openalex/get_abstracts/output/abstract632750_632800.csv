https://openalex.org/W2944421815,"Plant specialized metabolites have ecological functions, yet the presence of numerous uncharacterized biosynthetic genes in plant genomes suggests that many molecules remain unknown. We discovered a triterpene biosynthetic network in the roots of the small mustard plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Collectively, we have elucidated and reconstituted three divergent pathways for the biosynthesis of root triterpenes, namely thalianin (seven steps), thalianyl medium-chain fatty acid esters (three steps), and arabidin (five steps). A. thaliana mutants disrupted in the biosynthesis of these compounds have altered root microbiota. In vitro bioassays with purified compounds reveal selective growth modulation activities of pathway metabolites toward root microbiota members and their biochemical transformation and utilization by bacteria, supporting a role for this biosynthetic network in shaping an Arabidopsis-specific root microbial community."
https://openalex.org/W2944137180,"During corticogenesis, distinct subtypes of neurons are sequentially born from ventricular zone progenitors. How these cells are molecularly temporally patterned is poorly understood. We used single-cell RNA sequencing at high temporal resolution to trace the lineage of the molecular identities of successive generations of apical progenitors (APs) and their daughter neurons in mouse embryos. We identified a core set of evolutionarily conserved, temporally patterned genes that drive APs from internally driven to more exteroceptive states. We found that the Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) epigenetically regulates AP temporal progression. Embryonic age-dependent AP molecular states are transmitted to their progeny as successive ground states, onto which essentially conserved early postmitotic differentiation programs are applied, and are complemented by later-occurring environment-dependent signals. Thus, epigenetically regulated temporal molecular birthmarks present in progenitors act in their postmitotic progeny to seed adult neuronal diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2944271771,"Superoscillatory displacement metrology The resolving power of light (or other waveforms, for that matter) is typically limited to about half the wavelength. However, multiple interference of waves gives rise to subwavelength “hotspots” in the phase owing to what is termed superoscillation of the wave field. Yuan and Zheludev used a specially designed metasurface to interfere laser light (wavelength λ = 800 nm) and created a superoscillatory ruler comprising these hotspots. They demonstrated the ability to measure displacements of around λ/800 while operating at a wavelength of 800 nm. They then showed theoretically that resolving powers of around λ/4000, i.e., atomic-scale displacements, may be possible. The technique should prove useful to metrology applications requiring precision measurements. Science , this issue p. 771"

Warne et al. describe four crystal structures of complexes of a GPCR—the β1-adrenergic receptor—in its active state. They used nanobodies (recombinant variable domains of heavy-chain antibodies) and engineered G protein to stabilize the β1-adrenergic receptor bound to a full agonist, two partial agonists, and a weak partial agonist. Comparison of these structures to the inactive state elucidates how agonist binding is altered in the active conformation. Science , this issue p. 775"
https://openalex.org/W2944226209,"So far, the large and expanding body of research on meditation has mostly focussed on the putative benefits of meditation on health and well-being. However, a growing number of reports indicate that psychologically unpleasant experiences can occur in the context of meditation practice. Very little is known about the prevalence and potential causes of these experiences. The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of particularly unpleasant meditation-related experiences in a large international sample of regular meditators, and to explore the association of these experiences with demographic characteristics, meditation practice, repetitive negative thinking, mindfulness, and self-compassion. Using a cross-sectional online survey, 1,232 regular meditators with at least two months of meditation experience (mean age = 44.8 years ± 13.8, 53.6% female) responded to one question about particularly unpleasant meditation-related experiences. A total of 315 participants (25.6%, 95% CI: 23.1 to 28.0) reported having had particularly unpleasant meditation-related experiences, which they thought may have been caused by their meditation practice. Logistic regression models indicated that unpleasant meditation-related experiences were less likely to occur in female participants and religious participants. Participants with higher levels of repetitive negative thinking, those who only engaged in deconstructive types of meditation (e.g., vipassana/insight meditation), and those who had attended a meditation retreat at any point in their life were more likely to report unpleasant meditation-related experiences. The high prevalence of particularly unpleasant meditation-related experiences reported here points to the importance of expanding the scientific conception of meditation beyond that of a (mental) health-promoting and self-regulating technique. We propose that understanding when these experiences are constitutive elements of meditative practice rather than merely negative effects could advance the field and, to that end, we conclude with an overview of methodological and conceptual considerations that could be used to inform future research."
https://openalex.org/W2944102243,"Camellia is an economically, ecologically and phylogenetically valuable genus in the family Theaceae. The frequent interspecific hybridization and polyploidization makes this genus phylogenetically and taxonomically under controversial and require detailed investigation. Chloroplast (cp) genome sequences have been used for cpDNA marker development and genetic diversity evaluation. Our research newly sequenced the chloroplast genome of Camellia japonica using Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform, and retrieved five other chloroplast genomes of Camellia previously published for comparative analyses, thereby shedding lights on a deeper understanding of the applicability of chloroplast information. The chloroplast genome sizes ranged in length from 156,607 to 157,166 bp, and their gene structure resembled those of other higher plants. There were four categories of SSRs detected in six Camellia cpDNA sequences, with the lengths ranging from 10 to 17bp. The Camellia species exhibited different evolutionary routes that lhbA and orf188, followed by orf42 and psbZ, were readily lost during evolution. Obvious codon preferences were also shown in almost all protein-coding cpDNA and amino acid sequences. Selection pressure analysis revealed the influence of different environmental pressures on different Camellia chloroplast genomes during long-term evolution. All Camellia species, except C. crapnelliana, presented the identical rate of amplification in the IR region. The datasets obtained from the chloroplast genomes are highly supportive in inferring the phylogenetic relationships of the Camellia taxa, indicating that chloroplast genome can be used for classifying interspecific relationships in this genus."
https://openalex.org/W2944759052,"Satellite telemetry is an increasingly utilized technology in wildlife research, and current devices can track individual animal movements at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. However, as we enter the golden age of satellite telemetry, we need an in-depth understanding of the main technological, species-specific and environmental factors that determine the success and failure of satellite tracking devices across species and habitats. Here, we assess the relative influence of such factors on the ability of satellite telemetry units to provide the expected amount and quality of data by analyzing data from over 3,000 devices deployed on 62 terrestrial species in 167 projects worldwide. We evaluate the success rate in obtaining GPS fixes as well as in transferring these fixes to the user and we evaluate failure rates. Average fix success and data transfer rates were high and were generally better predicted by species and unit characteristics, while environmental characteristics influenced the variability of performance. However, 48% of the unit deployments ended prematurely, half of them due to technical failure. Nonetheless, this study shows that the performance of satellite telemetry applications has shown improvements over time, and based on our findings, we provide further recommendations for both users and manufacturers."
https://openalex.org/W2943980771,"Female behavior changes profoundly after mating. In Drosophila, the mechanisms underlying the long-term changes led by seminal products have been extensively studied. However, the effect of the sensory component of copulation on the female’s internal state and behavior remains elusive. We pursued this question by dissociating the effect of coital sensory inputs from those of male ejaculate. We found that the sensory inputs of copulation cause a reduction of post-coital receptivity in females, referred to as the “copulation effect.” We identified three layers of a neural circuit underlying this phenomenon. Abdominal neurons expressing the mechanosensory channel Piezo convey the signal of copulation to female-specific ascending neurons, LSANs, in the ventral nerve cord. LSANs relay this information to neurons expressing myoinhibitory peptides in the brain. We hereby provide a neural mechanism by which the experience of copulation facilitates females encoding their mating status, thus adjusting behavior to optimize reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2944679601,"Antimicrobial peptides have been evaluated as possible alternatives to traditional antibiotics. The translational potential of the antimicrobial peptide DGL13K was tested with focus on peptide toxicity and in vivo activity in two animal models. DGL13K was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with minimal bactericidal concentrations similar to the minimal inhibitory concentration. The peptide showed low toxicity to human red blood cells and HEK cells with median lethal dose around 1 mg/ml. The median lethal dose in greater wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella) was about 125mg/kg while the peptide caused no skin toxicity in a mouse model. A novel high-throughput luminescence assay was used to test peptide activity in infected G. mellonella, thus reducing vertebrate animal use. DGL13K killed P. aeruginosa in both the G. mellonella model and a mouse burn wound infection model, with bacterial viability 3-10-fold lower than in untreated controls. Future experiments will focus on optimizing peptide delivery, dose and frequency to further improve the antibacterial effect."
https://openalex.org/W2944171256,"Precise control of Wnt signaling is necessary for immune system development. In this study, we detected severely impaired development of all lymphoid lineages in mice, resulting from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutation in the limb region 1-like gene (Lmbr1l), which encodes a membrane-spanning protein with no previously described function in immunity. The interaction of LMBR1L with glycoprotein 78 (GP78) and ubiquitin-associated domain-containing protein 2 (UBAC2) attenuated Wnt signaling in lymphocytes by preventing the maturation of FZD6 and LRP6 through ubiquitination within the endoplasmic reticulum and by stabilizing ""destruction complex"" proteins. LMBR1L-deficient T cells exhibited hallmarks of Wnt/β-catenin activation and underwent apoptotic cell death in response to proliferative stimuli. LMBR1L has an essential function during lymphopoiesis and lymphoid activation, acting as a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2944767593,"Cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) enzymes are the major catalysts involved in the oxidation of steroids as well as many other compounds. Their versatility has been explained in part by flexibility of the proteins and complexity of the binding mechanisms. However, whether these proteins bind their substrates via induced fit or conformational selection is not understood. P450 17A1 has a major role in steroidogenesis, catalyzing the two-step oxidations of progesterone and pregnenolone to androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone, respectively, via 17α-hydroxy (OH) intermediates. We examined the interaction of P450 17A1 with its steroid substrates by analyzing progress curves (UV-visible spectroscopy), revealing that the rates of binding of any of these substrates decreased with increasing substrate concentration, a hallmark of conformational selection. Further, when the concentration of 17α-OH pregnenolone was held constant and the P450 concentration increased, the binding rate increased, and such opposite patterns are also diagnostic of conformational selection. Kinetic simulation modeling was also more consistent with conformational selection than with an induced-fit mechanism. Cytochrome b5 partially enhances P450 17A1 lyase activity by altering the P450 17A1 conformation but did not measurably alter the binding of 17α-OH pregnenolone or 17α-OH progesterone, as judged by the apparent Kd and binding kinetics. The P450 17A1 inhibitor abiraterone also bound to P450 17A1 in a multistep manner, and modeling indicated that the selective inhibition of the two P450 17A1 steps by the drug orteronel can be rationalized only by a multiple-conformation model. In conclusion, P450 17A1 binds its steroid substrates via conformational selection."
https://openalex.org/W2944532305,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Tel1 protein kinase, the ortholog of human ataxia telangiectasia–mutated (ATM), is activated in response to DNA double-strand breaks. Biochemical studies with human ATM and genetic studies in yeast suggest that recruitment and activation of Tel1ATM depends on the heterotrimeric MRXMRN complex, composed of Mre11, Rad50, and Xrs2 (human Nbs1). However, the mechanism of activation of Tel1 by MRX remains unclear, as does the role of effector DNA. Here we demonstrate that dsDNA and MRX activate Tel1 synergistically. Although minimal activation was observed with 80-mer duplex DNA, the optimal effector for Tel1 activation is long, nucleosome-free DNA. However, there is no requirement for DNA double-stranded termini. The ATPase activity of Rad50 is critical for activation. In addition to DNA and Rad50, either Mre11 or Xrs2, but not both, is also required. Each of the three MRX subunits shows a physical association with Tel1.

JA-Ile metabolism has been studied intensively, but its catabolism as a potentially important mechanism for the regulation of JA-Ile–mediated signaling is not well-understood. Especially the enzyme(s) responsible for specifically glycosylating 12-hydroxy-jasmonic acid (12-OH-JA) and thereby producing 12-O-glucopyranosyl-jasmonic acid (12-O-Glc-JA) is still elusive. Here, we used co-expression analyses of available Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptomic data, identifying four UDP-dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT) genes as wound-induced and 12-OH-JA–related, namely, UGT76E1, UGT76E2, UGT76E11, and UGT76E12. We heterologously expressed and purified the corresponding proteins to determine their individual substrate specificities and kinetic parameters. We then used an ex vivo metabolite-fingerprinting approach to investigate these proteins in conditions as close as possible to their natural environment, with an emphasis on greatly extending the range of potential substrates. As expected, we found that UGT76E1 and UGT76E2 are 12-OH-JA-UGTs, with UGT76E1 contributing a major in vivo UGT activity, as deduced from Arabidopsis mutants with abolished or increased UGT gene expression. In contrast, recombinant UGT76E11 acted on an unidentified compound and also glycosylated two other oxylipins, 11-hydroxy-7,9,13-hexadecatrienoic acid (11-HHT) and 13-hydroxy-9,11,15-octadecatrienoic acid (13-HOT), which were also accepted by recombinant UGT76E1, UGT76E2, and UGT76E12 enzymes. UGT76E12 glycosylated 12-OH-JA only to a low extent, but also accepted an artificial hydroxylated fatty acid and low amounts of kaempferol.

https://openalex.org/W2944511835,"Individuals with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) are prone to insulin resistance, whereas the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated if the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in skeletal muscle tissues involves insulin resistance in IUGR offsprings, particularly ones with catch-up growth. An IUGR rat model was established by feeding rats an isocaloric (30.50 Kcal/g) diet containing 8% protein (low-protein diet) from day 1 of pregnancy until the birth of their pups. Glucometabolic parameters were measured and compared. Quantitative PCR and western blot were performed to assess mRNA and protein expression changes of the PI3K/Akt related signals in skeletal muscle tissues. Pearson analysis was used to assess the correlation of the PI3K/Akt signaling level and catch-up growth with the insulin resistance index (IRI). The values of fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin and IRI were significantly higher, whereas insulin sensitivity index was significantly lower in IUGR offsprings than those in the controls. The PI3K mRNA and protein levels as well as the phospho-AktSer473 levels were significantly lower in IUGR offsprings compared to the controls. Reductions of GLUT4 as well as increases of PTEN and nuclear fractional PPARγ were detected in IUGR offsprings. Catch-up growth IUGR rats were positively correlated with insulin resistance and underwent more remarkable alterations of the PI3K, PTEN and GLUT4 expressions. Our results demonstrated that rats born IUGR developed insulin resistance later in life, which was likely mediated by reductions of the PI3K/Akt related signaling activities, particularly in those with excess catch-up growth."
https://openalex.org/W2944647323,"Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a strategy used worldwide for managing hypertension. In addition to converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, ACE also converts neurotoxic β-amyloid protein 42 (Aβ42) to Aβ40. Because of its neurotoxicity, Aβ42 is believed to play a causative role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas Aβ40 has neuroprotective effects against Aβ42 aggregation and also against metal-induced oxidative damage. Whether ACE inhibition enhances Aβ42 aggregation or impairs human cognitive ability are very important issues for preventing AD onset and for optimal hypertension management. In an 8-year longitudinal study, we found here that the mean intelligence quotient of male, but not female, hypertensive patients taking ACE inhibitors declined more rapidly than that of others taking no ACE inhibitors. Moreover, the sera of all AD patients exhibited a decrease in Aβ42-to-Aβ40–converting activity compared with sera from age-matched healthy individuals. Using human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice, we found that a clinical dose of an ACE inhibitor was sufficient to increase brain amyloid deposition. We also generated human amyloid precursor protein/ACE+/− mice and found that a decrease in ACE levels promoted Aβ42 deposition and increased the number of apoptotic neurons. These results suggest that inhibition of ACE activity is a risk factor for impaired human cognition and for triggering AD onset."
https://openalex.org/W2944728655,"Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is primarily synthesized in and secreted from the liver; however, estrogen (E2), through E2 receptor α (ERα), increases uterine Igf1 mRNA levels. Previous ChIP-seq analyses of the murine uterus have revealed a potential enhancer region distal from the Igf1 transcription start site (TSS) with multiple E2-dependent ERα-binding regions. Here, we show E2-dependent super enhancer-associated characteristics and suggest contact between the distal enhancer and the Igf1 TSS. We hypothesized that this distal super-enhancer region controls E2-responsive induction of uterine Igf1 transcripts. We deleted 430 bp, encompassing one of the ERα-binding sites, thereby disrupting interactions of the enhancer with gene-regulatory factors. As a result, E2-mediated induction of mouse uterine Igf1 mRNA is completely eliminated, whereas hepatic Igf1 expression remains unaffected. This highlights the central role of a distal enhancer in the assembly of the factors necessary for E2-dependent interaction with the Igf1 TSS and induction of uterus-specific Igf1 transcription. Of note, loss of the enhancer did not affect fertility or uterine growth responses. Deletion of uterine Igf1 in a PgrCre;Igf1f/f model decreased female fertility but did not impact the E2-induced uterine growth response. Moreover, E2-dependent activation of uterine IGF1 signaling was not impaired by disrupting the distal enhancer or by deleting the coding transcript. This indicated a role for systemic IGF1, suggested that other growth mediators drive uterine response to E2, and suggested that uterine-derived IGF1 is essential for reproductive success.

https://openalex.org/W2944321379,"Fusarium graminearum is responsible for production of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) on maize and wheat in Ontario, Canada. It has been understood since the early 1980s that in most parts of Canada, the predominant chemotype of F. graminearum is 15ADON, and not the 3ADON chemotype mainly found in Europe and Asia. The discovery of F. graminearum strains that did not produce DON but the structurally related 7-α hydroxy, 15-deacetylcalonectrin (3ANX) and its hydrolysis product 7-α hydroxy, 3,15-dideacetylcalonectrin to (NX) demonstrated that we still have a lot to learn about this well studied but complicated fungus. We conducted a survey of maize and wheat samples from Ontario farms. In the 2015 crop year, we isolated 86 strains and tested a representative subset of 20 using the published genetic probes for assessing genotype. We also developed a targeted LC-MS/MS method for the identification and quantitation of known toxins from this species to determine chemotype. The results showed that 80% of our strains produced some 3ANX in addition to 15ADON and one strain produced 3ANX and no 15ADON. Comparison of chemical data with genotyping revealed that in more than 50% of the cases there was no clear agreement. These data demonstrate the importance of chemical analysis for understanding the toxigenic potential of strains, especially using a LC-MS method that is capable of differentiating 3ADON and 15ADON. For this collection, genotyping of isolates did not produce reliable information on the chemotype. This is the first report of 3ANX toxin production concurrently with 15ADON and suggests that the 3ANX producers in North America likely originated from the 15ADON background."

Herein, we report the crystal structure of VvPlpA to 1.4-Å resolution, revealing that VvPlpA contains an N-terminal domain of unknown function and a C-terminal phospholipase domain and that these two domains are packed closely together. The phospholipase domain adopts a typical SGNH hydrolase fold, containing the four conserved catalytic residues Ser, Gly, Asn, and His. Interestingly, the structure also disclosed that the phospholipase domain accommodates a chloride ion near the catalytic His residue. The chloride is five-coordinated in a distorted bipyramid geometry, accepting hydrogen bonds from a water molecule and the amino groups of surrounding residues. This chloride substitutes for the most common Asp/Glu residue and forms an unusual Ser–His–chloride catalytic triad in VvPlpA. The chloride may orient the catalytic His and stabilize the charge on its imidazole ring during catalysis. Indeed, VvPlpA activity depended on chloride concentration, confirming the important role of chloride in catalysis.

The bacterium secretes a phospholipase, VvPlpA, 3The abbreviations used are: VvV. vulnificusOECoxygen-evolving complexP6Ghexaethylene glycolTLHthermolabile hemolysinPDBProtein Data Bank. by a type II secretion system. VvPlpA shows phospholipase A2 activity, with a substrate preference toward phosphatidylcholine (a major component of lecithin). VvPlpA is significantly induced in a host environment. It can disrupt the phospholipid membrane and thus lead to host cell lysis, contributing to systemic infection (6Jang K.K. Lee Z.W. Kim B. Jung Y.H. Han H.J. Kim M.H. Kim B.S. Choi S.H.

Therefore, VvPlpA is an essential virulence factor of V. vulnificus and may serve as a promising antivirulence drug target. V. vulnificus oxygen-evolving complex hexaethylene glycol thermolabile hemolysin Protein Data Bank. Sequence analysis has revealed that mature VvPlpA is composed of an N-terminal domain with unknown function and a C-terminal phospholipase A2 domain, which belongs to the SGNH hydrolase superfamily (Fig. 1a). The SGNH hydrolase superfamily is characterized by containing four invariant catalytic residues (Ser, Gly, Asn, and His, which indeed give the name SGNH) in four conserved blocks (I, II, III, and V) (7Mølgaard A. Kauppinen S. Larsen S. Rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase elucidates the structure and function of a new family of hydrolases.Structure. 2000; 8 (10801485): 373-38310.1016/S0969-2126(00)00118-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Ser is in Block I and acts as the nucleophile. The Ser residue, Gly residue (in Block II), and Asn residue (in Block III) function together as proton donors to the oxyanion hole. Block V contains a His that acts as a base to polarize the Ser nucleophile by deprotonating the hydroxyl group. In addition, Block V can contain an acid, such as Asp or Glu, at the third residue preceding the catalytic His, thus forming a Ser–His–Asp/Glu catalytic triad. However, the Asp/Glu at this position is not conserved and thus it is not included in the name. Residues other than Asp/Glu often make the catalytic triad degrade to a catalytic dyad (8Leščić Ašler I. Štefanić Z. Maršavelski A. Vianello R. Kojić-Prodić B. Catalytic dyad in the SGNH hydrolase superfamily: in-depth insight into structural parameters tuning the catalytic process of extracellular lipase from Streptomyces rimosus.ACS Chem.

The influence of this kind of residue variation on catalytic site composition has not been reported previously. Based on sequence analysis, VvPlpA homologs are widely distributed in Vibrio (see Fig. 1a), such as VHH in Vibrio harveyi (9Zhong Y. Zhang X.H. Chen J. Chi Z. Sun B. Li Y. Austin B.

These proteins are also annotated as thermolabile hemolysins (TLHs) or lecithin-dependent hemolysins in terms of their ability to hydrolyze erythrocyte membranes. Some of these proteins have been proposed to be important virulence factors. Structural information of this protein family would be greatly helpful for understanding their functions and for developing inhibitors targeting them. Herein, we report the crystal structure of VvPlpA, which represents the first characterized structure of the TLH family. The results reveal an unusual catalytic triad as well as substrate-binding pocket information, shedding light on the catalytic mechanism of VvPlpA and other TLH family members. The structure of VvPlpA was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method, with one monomer per asymmetric unit. Although the signal peptide of VvPlpA was included to facilitate soluble expression of the protein, this part is disordered and shows no electron density. Based on electron density, residues 24–83 and 87–417 of VvPlpA and five His residues from the fusion tag were built into the final structural model. Three residues (Gly-157, Leu-175, and Val-211) are marked as outliers on the Ramachandran plot; however, they were correctly modeled, as confirmed by electron density inspection. Consistent with sequence analysis, the VvPlpA structure can be divided into two domains (Fig. 1b). The N-terminal domain (residues 24–133) is a functionally unknown domain and mainly comprises β strands. In the middle of this domain is β1, which is a rather long β strand. At one side of β1, two short β strands (β2 and β5) together with β1 form a small three-stranded antiparallel sheet in the order of β2–β1–β5, whereas at the other side three short β strands (β3, β4, and β6) along with β1 form a four-stranded antiparallel sheet in the order of β1–β3–β4–β6. This domain also contains helices, including the 310 helix η1, α1 preceding β1, and α2 between β4 and β5. The C-terminal domain (residues 134–417) is a phospholipase domain belonging to the SGNH hydrolase superfamily and adopts an α/β/α architecture. In the middle of the C-terminal domain lies a parallel β sheet composed of five strands in the order of β8–β7–β9–β10–β11. One side of this β sheet is flanked by helices α5 and α7–8, and the other side is flanked by helices α4 and α11. Remarkably, between these secondary structures are unusually long curly loops in which a couple of small secondary structural elements, including 310 and α helices and β strands, are sparsely distributed. Notably, the N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain of VvPlpA are closely packed against each other. The interface is estimated to be ∼1700 Å2 for the buried solvent-accessible surface, with extensive hydrogen bonding, salt bridge, and hydrophobic interactions between the two domains. Generally, structurally and functionally important residues are evolutionarily conserved among homologs. Hence, we marked the conserved residues of the TLH family on the VvPlpA structure for the sake of uncovering functionally important regions (Fig. 1, a and c). The conserved residues are mainly distributed in the interior part of the phospholipase domain of VvPlpA. This conserved part contains residues of Blocks I, II, III, and V and represents the putative active site. In addition, β1 of the N-terminal domain is also rather conserved, which implies a potential role of β1 in protein function. At the region where Block V residues His-392 and Gly-389 are located, an autoassigned water molecule drew our attention. We observed significant positive peaks on the difference electron-density map (Fig. S1a). Due to the excellent quality of the diffraction data, we were able to calculate an anomalous map, which showed weak anomalous peaks for the sulfur atoms of some cysteine and methionine residues. Remarkably, a clear anomalous peak occurs at this position as well. Therefore, a heavier ion instead of a water molecule should be modeled here. Then we intended to model this peak with a metal ion, which is commonly seen in protein structures (14Zheng H. Chordia M.D. Cooper D.R. Chruszcz M. Müller P. Sheldrick G.M. Minor W. Validation of metal-binding sites in macromolecular structures with the CheckMyMetal web server.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 (24356774): 156-17010.1038/nprot.2013.172Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, modeling a metal is not sufficient for interpreting the electron density. Modeling a Mg2+ showed a positive peak, whereas modeling a Ca2+ or K+ showed a significant negative peak on the Fourier difference map (Fig. S1). Furthermore, the coordinating distance to this ion is longer than 3.17 Å (Fig. S1), deviating significantly from metal–protein interaction geometry (15Harding M.M. Geometry of metal-ligand interactions in proteins.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57 (11223517): 401-41110.1107/S0907444900019168Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16Harding M.M. Metal-ligand geometry relevant to proteins and in proteins: sodium and potassium.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58 (11976508): 872-87410.1107/S0907444902003712Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). More importantly, the chemical groups around this ion are mainly NH groups, which are unlikely to donate lone electron pairs to coordinate a metal ion at the current geometric setting. Therefore, we excluded the possibility of modeling a metal ion at this position. Indeed, supplementing a metal ion, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, or K+, did not enhance the enzymatic activity of VvPlpA (Fig. S2). Moreover, adding EDTA to remove possible bound metal ions from the enzyme only slightly affected enzymatic activity (Fig. S2). These results suggest that VvPlpA activity is independent of metal ions, supporting our structural analysis. Subsequently, we modeled this peak as a chloride ion (Cl−) based on three aspects. First, Cl− is able to show a weak anomalous signal even at the wavelength that was used for our data collection (f‴ = ∼0.3 electron at 0.978-Å wavelength) (Fig. 2a). Second, Cl− can well interpret the electron density with good refinement behavior (Figs. 2b and S3a). Third, the coordination chemistry is reasonable (Fig. 2b). Cl− is five-coordinated with a distorted trigonal-bipyramid geometry, accepting hydrogen bonds from the main-chain NH groups of Gly-389 and His-392, the NH groups of the imidazole ring of His-392 and the indole ring of Trp-173, and a water molecule. The hydrogen-bonding distances are in a range of 3.19–3.41 Å, which is in good agreement with chloride chemistry identified from known structures (17Carugo O. Buried chloride stereochemistry in the Protein Data Bank.BMC Struct. Biol. 2014; 14 (25928393): 1910.1186/s12900-014-0019-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Finding a Cl− in an enzyme is unusual, particularly at a position that is close to catalytically relevant residues. To confirm the correctness of our modeling, we performed a bromide (Br−) substitution experiment (18Kawakami K. Umena Y. Kamiya N. Shen J.R. Location of chloride and its possible functions in oxygen-evolving photosystem II revealed by X-ray crystallography.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106 (19433803): 8567-857210.1073/pnas.0812797106Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Generally, Cl− should be substituted by Br−, which has similar chemistry, with the advantage of being much heavier and thus easily distinguishable on the electron-density map. Furthermore, Br− can show a strong anomalous signal at its absorption edge (0.920 Å) that is easily tuned on a synchrotron. We expressed, purified, and crystallized VvPlpA in solutions containing Br− in place of Cl−. The diffraction data were collected at 0.916 Å (the higher-energy side of the absorption edge of bromine). As expected, a very strong anomalous signal peak with a height of ∼44 σ was found at the position where Cl− was located (Fig. 2c). Additionally, a significant peak with a height of ∼15 σ at the same position showed up on the isomorphous difference Fourier map calculated with the diffraction data of Cl−-bound and Br−-bound VvPlpA (Fig. 2c). Moreover, Br− fits the electron density well, and the coordinating geometry is similar to that of Cl− (Figs. 2d and S3b). Therefore, the Cl− was successfully replaced by a Br−, confirming the correctness of modeling a Cl− in the VvPlpA structure. Because VvPlpA belongs to the SGNH hydrolase superfamily, the active-site residues are easily identified from sequence analysis (Figs. 1, a and b, and 3). The nucleophile Ser-152 is located at the loop region following β7; the base His-392 is located at the loop between α11 and β13, with the Nε2 atom of its imidazole ring forming a short hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Ser-152. The third acid component, Asp/Glu, commonly seen in the SGNH hydrolase superfamily is missing in VvPlpA, and it is substituted with a Gly residue (Fig. 1a). Instead, a Cl− sits at the position where the carboxyl group of conventional Asp is located (Figs. 2b and 3). This Cl− accepts a hydrogen bond from the Nε2 atom of catalytic His-392, with the role of maintaining the proper orientation and tautomeric state of the imidazole ring of His-392. In addition, the negative charge of Cl− can potentially stabilize the positive charge of the imidazole ring of His-392 that develops during catalysis. Therefore, this Cl− may functionally subrogate Asp to be the third component of the catalytic triad of VvPlpA. Tyr-367 is also close to His-392 but only forms a very weak hydrogen bond with His-392, which implies a trivial role of Tyr-367 in orientating His-392. Residues Ser-152, Gly-203, and Asn-247 are supposed to constitute the oxyanion hole in VvPlpA. Interestingly, although the main-chain NH groups of Ser-152 and Gly-203 are in the positions for donating hydrogen bonds to the oxyanion hole, the carboxamide group of Asn-247 seems to occupy the position of the oxyanion hole, forming hydrogen bonds with Ser-152 and Gly-203 (Fig. 3). Therefore, the oxyanion hole observed here is in an inactive state, and a conformational change at this site, probably induced by substrate binding, is expected for constructing a functional oxyanion hole. We tested the roles of individual residues at the catalytic site by mutagenesis and enzymatic experiments. The mutants of the nucleophile Ser-152 (S152G), the base His-392 (H392N), and the oxyanion hole residue Asn-247 (N247D) all exhibited negligible enzymatic activity, which confirmed their key roles in catalysis, as expected for an SGNH enzyme. To understand the contribution of Tyr-367 to catalysis, we mutated it to a Phe. Compared with the wildtype (WT) enzyme, Y367F exhibited a significantly higher Km and a slightly decreased kcat (Table 1), indicating that Tyr-367 primarily contributes to substrate binding and that the hydrogen bonding to His-392 is not essential for the catalytic power.Table 1Kinetics data of VvPlpA and its mutantskcatKmkcat/KmRelative activitys−1μmm−1 × s−1%WT0.051 ± 0.00720.99 ± 5.412.43 × 103100.00G389D0.028 ± 0.00420.98 ± 5.151.34 × 10355.14G389N0.015 ± 0.0027.26 ± 2.522.07 × 10385.19Y367F0.048 ± 0.00350.99 ± 5.240.94 × 10338.68 Open table in a new tab The importance of Cl− was tested by monitoring the chloride dependence of enzymatic activity. The Cl−-depleted VvPlpA was prepared by the gel-filtration method (19Feller G. Bussy O. Houssier C. Gerday C. Structural and functional aspects of chloride binding to Alteromonas haloplanctis α-amylase.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (8798613): 23836-2384110.1074/jbc.271.39.23836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and subsequently a certain amount of NaCl was added to the sample for the enzymatic activity assay. VvPlpA activity increased with increasing Cl− concentration in a specific manner (Fig. 4). Depletion of Cl− led to a loss of more than 90% of enzymatic activity. In contrast, the activity of G389D, in which the Cl− was replaced by the Asp-389 side chain (Fig. S4a), was not dependent on Cl−. Therefore, specific binding of a Cl− at this position is required for the full catalytic power of VvPlpA. By fitting the activity curve, the binding affinity for Cl− was estimated with an apparent Kd of 6.6 ± 1.2 mm. As expected, Br− could also enhance enzymatic activity of the Cl−-depleted VvPlpA and was specifically bound to the enzyme with an apparent Kd of 5.9 ± 1.3 mm (Fig. S5). Combining the structural and enzymatic evidence, we propose that this Cl− acts as an essential component of the catalytic site. To probe the catalytic roles of Cl−, we compared the activity of WT with that of the G389D and G389N mutants, which were supposed to replace Cl− to form a catalytic triad and a catalytic dyad, respectively. In the G389D structure, the mutated Asp-389, which is generally seen as the third component in the classic catalytic triad, successfully substituted for the Cl− (Fig. S4a), in agreement with the fact that activity of G389D is independent of Cl− (Fig. 4). Except for the mutated residue, the local structure at the active site of G389D is essentially similar to that of WT. In the G389D mutant, Asp-389 forms a hydrogen bond with catalytic His-392 and seemingly pulls His-392 away from the catalytic Ser-152, with the hydrogen bond between Ser-152 and His-392 being longer than that in WT (Fig. S4a). G389D showed a lower kcat and similar Km compared with those of WT (Table 1), suggesting that Cl− can functionally subrogate Asp with an even better catalytic power. Concerning the G389N mutant, the mutated Asn-389 was supposed to occupy a position similar to that of Asp-389 and thus replace the Cl−. Because Asn lacks the negative charge that can be provided by Cl− or Asp, the catalytic activity of the G389N mutant was expected to decrease dramatically, as reported for the D102N mutant of trypsin where the catalytic power was decreased by 10,000-fold (20Craik C.S. Roczniak S. Largman C. Rutter W.J. The catalytic role of the active site aspartic acid in serine proteases.Science. 1987; 237 (3303334): 909-91310.1126/science.3303334Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Interestingly, G389N was crystallized in a different space group, even under a crystallization condition similar to that of G389D. Asn-389 indeed replaces the Cl−. However, unlike the mutated Asp-389, the mutated Asn-389 has no interaction with His-392 because the carboxamide group of Asn-389 points away from the coordination position (Fig. S4b). Instead, His-392 is hydrogen-bonded to Tyr-367, with the imidazole ring rotated about 30° compared with that of WT (Fig. S4b). Nevertheless, the Nδ1 atom of His-392 and the Oγ atom of Ser-152 stay in positions as seen in WT and thus form a hydrogen bond with a length almost identical to that of WT. Therefore, His-392 in the G389N mutant is well-orientated in an alternative but still catalytically competent conformation. Enzymatic kinetics showed a decreased kcat for the G389N mutant (Table 1), indicating a weakened catalytic rate. This may reflect the loss of the charge-stabilization effect on the protonated His-392 in this mutant. Surprisingly, the G389N mutant maintained a relatively high activity, showing a stronger substrate binding affinity than that of WT (reflected by a decreased Km), which may relate to the structural changes in the mutant, including alternative conformations of residues 211–215, 288–299, 360–367, and 389–392 and the flipping of the side chain of Trp-173 (Fig. S6). Taken together, we conclude that Cl− can functionally subrogate Asp as the third component to form an unusual Ser–His–chloride catalytic triad, with possible roles of orientating the catalytic His via hydrogen bonding and stabilizing the positive charge on the imidazole ring of the catalytic His that develops along the catalysis process via electrostatic interaction. The crystal structure of G389N contains three monomers in one asymmetric unit, and each monomer contains extra nonprotein electron density. Considering the shape of the molecule and the crystallization composition, we modeled this electron density with a hexaethylene glycol (P6G) molecule. P6G is located in an elongated pocket of the phospholipase domain of VvPlpA, with an extended “S”-like conformation (Figs. 5, a and b, and S7). Based on the structural knowledge of SGNH hydrolases, this pocket is supposed to be the substrate-binding pocket, and P6G would mimic the aliphatic chain of the fatty acid at the sn-2 position of a phospholipid substrate. The bottom and wall of this pocket are mainly formed by hydrophobic residues, whereas its entrance part contains both hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues (Fig. 5b). The catalytic Ser-152 is at a position close to the pocket entrance. Remarkably, the residues forming the substrate-binding pocket are highly conserved among TLH proteins (Figs. 1, a and c, and 5b), indicating that TLHs may share significant similarity in the sn-2 acyl moiety of substrates. Estimated from the size of P6G, the aliphatic chain up to ∼16 carbons can be accommodated in the pocket (Fig. 5b). In contrast, we also noticed that the P6G molecule is not close to the catalytic Ser-152, and the oxyanion hole is still occupied by the side chain of Asn-247 and is thus in an inactive state. Therefore, the binding mode of P6G could be different from that of the substrate. An enzyme–substrate complex structure is still required to understand the true substrate-binding mode. A Dali search identified a couple of SGNH hydrolase superfamily proteins that share a similar fold with the C-terminal domain of VvPlpA, whereas no significant homologs of the N-terminal domain were found. The top two hits, the lipase EstJ15 from Photobacterium (PDB code 5XTU) and the esterase EstA from P. aeruginosa (PDB code 3KVN), were superimposed to VvPlpA with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.51 and 1.96 Å2 for the aligned Cα atoms, respectively. VvPlpA shares a conserved core SGNH hydrolase fold (corresponding to α4–9, α11, β7, and β9–11 in VvPlpA) with EstJ15 and EstA, whereas it exhibits obvious variations in the parts outside the core fold, including the long loops and additional secondary structural elements (Fig. 6a). Alignment of their catalytic sites showed that the catalytic residues His and Ser are well-superimposed. The catalytic Cl− of VvPlpA occupies the position that corresponds to the carboxyl moiety of Asp residues in the other two enzymes. The oxyanion hole–forming residues, Asn-247 and Gly-203, of VvPlpA sit in positions different from those of corresponding residues of EstA and EstJ15 in which the oxyanion holes are well-formed (Fig. 6b). Although VvPlpA G389N contains a P6G molecule in the substrate-binding pocket, EstA also contains a detergent molecule, tetraethylene mono-octylether, in its substrate-binding pocket. When G389N and EstA structures were superimposed, P6G and tetraethylene mono-octylether are located in similar positions but not well-overlapped (Fig. S8), supporting that the substrate-binding pockets of VvPlpA and EstA share similarities in their hydrophobic nature but show significant variations in terms of shape and the property to accommodate specific substrates. Apparently, VvPlpA is evolutionally close to other known SGNH"

However, its role in Wnt signaling remains to be explored. In this study, we report that USP9X physically interacts with and functionally deubiquitinates BCL9. We showed that USP9X augments the interaction of BCL9 with β-catenin and PYGO1, thereby promoting transcriptional activation of Wnt/β-catenin–responsive genes and the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. To further understand how Wnt/β-catenin signaling is regulated, we employed affinity purification and MS to identify proteins that are associated with BCL9, an essential co-activator of β-catenin–mediated transcription, in vivo. Specifically, we generated HeLa cells with doxycycline (Dox)-inducible expression of stably integrated FLAG–BCL9. Whole-cell extracts from these cells were prepared and subjected to affinity purification using an anti-FLAG affinity column. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with excess FLAG peptides, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and visualized by silver staining. The protein bands on the gel were recovered by trypsinization and analyzed by MS. The results revealed that BCL9 was co-purified with a number of proteins, including β-catenin, PYGO1, and PYGO2, all known components of the Wnt-signaling pathway (Fig. 1A and Table S1). Interestingly, USP9X, a member of the protein deubiquitinases, was also identified in the BCL9-containing protein complex (Fig. 1A). The presence of these proteins in the BCL9-associated protein complex was confirmed by Western blotting of the column eluates (Fig. 1B). To confirm the in vivo association of BCL9 with USP9X, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with HeLa cell extracts. Immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibodies against BCL9 followed by immunoblotting (IB) with antibodies against USP9X demonstrated that USP9X was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with BCL9 (Fig. 1C). Reciprocally, IP with antibodies against USP9X and IB with antibodies against BCL9 also revealed that BCL9 was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with USP9X. The association between BCL9 and USP9X was also detected in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1C) and HCT116 cells (Fig. S1) by co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, co-IP analysis also showed that β-catenin was physically associated with USP9X (Fig. 1C). To gain further support of the physical interaction between BCL9 and USP9X, protein fractionation experiments were carried out by fast protein LC (FPLC) with Superose 6 columns and a size-exclusion approach. The results indicated that the elution pattern of USP9X largely overlapped with that of BCL9, β-catenin, and PYGO1 (Fig. 1D). To further support the interaction between BCL9 and USP9X and to gain a molecular insight into this interaction, His-tagged domain deletion mutants of USP9X were generated and expressed in Sf9 cells. In vitro pulldown analysis with these mutants and in vitro transcribed/translated FLAG-tagged full-length BCL9 revealed that a sub-middle region spanning amino acids 1,101 to 1,553 of USP9X is responsible for the direct interaction of USP9X with BCL9 (Fig. 1, E and F). To address the functional significance of the physical interaction between BCL9 and USP9X, we next investigated whether or not USP9X could target BCL9 for deubiquitination. To this end, HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG–BCL9 were co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA–Ub) and control siRNA or USP9X siRNAs. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of cellular lysates with anti-FLAG followed by IB with anti-HA showed that knockdown of USP9X resulted in evident increases in ubiquitinated BCL9 species (Fig. 2A), suggesting that USP9X acts to oppose BCL9 ubiquitination. To support this notion, cellular extracts from HeLa cells expressing FLAG–BCL9 and HA–Ub were collected and sequentially purified with anti-FLAG and anti-HA affinity gels to enrich HA–Ub-conjugated BCL9. After trypsinization, the retrieved peptides were subjected to MS analysis. The results showed that three lysine residues, Lys-23, Lys-212, and Lys-906, carry di-glycine remnants (Fig. 2B), indicating that these residues were subjected to ubiquitination. We thus generated BCL9 mutants with each of the lysine residues at 23, 212, and 906 individually replaced by arginine (K23R, K212R, and K906R), and we examined the polyubiquitination levels of these mutants in USP9X-depleted cells. In vivo deubiquitination assays showed that although the association of USP9X with all BCL9 mutants was comparable with that of USP9X with WT BCL9 (BCL9/WT) (Fig. S2), increased poly-ubiquitination level was only observed for K23R and K906R but not K212R in USP9X-deficient cells (Fig. 2C), suggesting that USP9X targets BCL9/Lys-212 for deubiquitination. To differentiate the ubiquitin moieties of polyubiquitinated BCL9 that are cleaved by USP9X, we generated HA-tagged ubiquitin mutants with all lysine residues replaced by arginine except Lys-48 (Lys-48–only) or Lys-63 (Lys-63–only). These ubiquitin mutants were then co-transfected with USP9X siRNAs into FLAG–BCL9-expressing HeLa cells. In vivo deubiquitination assays demonstrated that USP9X depletion was associated with a dramatic increase in the level of Lys-63–linked, but not Lys-48–linked, polyubiquitin moieties of BCL9 (Fig. 2D). In addition, we showed that USP9X depletion had no effect on the Lys-63–linked polyubiquitination level of FLAG–BCL9/K212R (Fig. 2E). Together, these observations support a notion that USP9X targets BCL9/Lys-212 for Lys-63–conjugated ubiquitin removal. We also examined the effect of USP9X on the expression of BCL9. Western blot analysis revealed that, although the level of CEP131 markedly decreased as reported previously (41Li X. Song N. Liu L. Liu X.H. Ding X. Song X. Yang S.D. Shan L. Zhou X. Su D.X. Wang Y. Zhang Q. Cao C. Ma S. Yu N. et al.USP9X regulates centrosome duplication and promotes breast carcinogenesis.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 (28361952): 1486610.1038/ncomms14866Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the expression of BCL9 was essentially unchanged upon USP9X depletion by distinct siRNAs in MCF-7 and HeLa cells (Fig. S3, A and B). These findings are consistent with the observation that USP9X prefers to cleave Lys-63–linked, but not Lys-48–linked, ubiquitin moieties on BCL9. In addition, although it has been reported that β-catenin is stabilized in human cells (42Ouyang W. Zhang S. Yang B. Yang C. Zhang J. Zhou F.

Cell Biol. 2016; 18 (27230526): 579-58610.1038/ncb3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). To understand the functional significance of USP9X-targeted removal of Lys-63–conjugated ubiquitin of BCL9/Lys-212, we next asked the question whether USP9X-targeted BCL9 deubiquitination affects in any way the formation of the β-catenin/BCL9/PYGO1 complex. To test this, HeLa cells stably expressing different sets of USP9X shRNAs and FLAG–BCL9/WT (WT) or FLAG–BCL9/K212R were established. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis in these cells showed that USP9X knockdown was associated with an overt reduction of the interaction between β-catenin and BCL9/WT, whereas the impact of USP9X depletion on the interaction between β-catenin and BCL9/K212R was marginal (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the K212R mutation enhanced, although modestly, the binding of BCL9 to β-catenin (Fig. 3A). Additionally, USP9X knockdown impaired the interaction of PYGO1 with endogenous BCL9 (Fig. 3B) but not with BCL9/K212R (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the efficient binding between PYGO1 and β-catenin also requires the presence of USP9X, whereas overexpression of BCL9/K212R overcomes, to certain extent, this requirement (Fig. 3, B and C). Collectively, these results indicate that BCL9/Lys-212 ubiquitination inhibits the formation of the β-catenin/BCL9/PYGO1 complex and that BCL9 deubiquitination by USP9X, in contrast, promotes the formation of this complex. It has also been proposed that Lys-63–linked ubiquitination may affect the cellular distribution of targeted proteins (29Yau R. Rape M. The increasing complexity of the ubiquitin code.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18 (27230526): 579-58610.1038/ncb3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined the influence of USP9X on the subcellular localization of BCL9. Immunostaining followed by confocal microscopy analysis revealed that BCL9 predominantly resides in the nucleus even in the absence of USP9X (Fig. 3D), and the cellular localization of BCL9/WT and BCL9/K212R was similar (Fig. 3D). These observations argue against the possibility that impaired β-catenin/BCL9/PYGO1 complex formation upon USP9X depletion might be due to subcellular redistribution of BCL9. To further explore the functional significance of USP9X-targeted BCL9 deubiquitination, we then tested whether USP9X is involved in the transcriptional response to Wnt signaling. To this end, pGL3–TopFlash reporter containing eight tandem repeats of TCF/LEF-binding elements or its counterpart pGL3–FopFlash reporter containing mutated TCF/LEF-binding elements (Fig. 4A) was co-transfected into HEK293T cells together with USP9X siRNA and Renilla luciferase vector. Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of LiCl, which inhibits GSK3β and thus stabilizes β-catenin to activate the canonical Wnt pathway (7Klaus A. Birchmeier W.

However, these MPN have distinct symptoms, morphology, and natural histories, including different tendencies to progress to fibrosis. Although the role of inflammation in tissue fibrosis is well recognized, inflammatory gene expression in bone marrows involved by MPN has been understudied. We analyzed the expression of inflammatory genes by directly measuring RNA transcript abundance in bone marrow biopsies of 108 MPN patients. Unsupervised analyses identified gene expression patterns that distinguish prefibrotic (grade 1–2) MPN from overtly fibrotic (grade 2–3) MPN with high sensitivity and specificity in two independent cohorts. Furthermore, prefibrotic and overtly fibrotic MPN are separable into subsets with different activities in biological pathways linked to inflammation, including cytokines, chemokines, interferon response, and toll-like receptor signaling. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MPN with overt fibrosis is associated with significant inflammatory gene upregulation in the bone marrow, revealing potential roles for multiple pro-inflammatory signaling networks in the development of myelofibrosis and suggesting potential therapeutic mechanisms to alleviate this process in the bone marrow microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2944442777,"The present study evaluated the soil-moisture deficit stress tolerance of AtDREB1A transgenic peanut lines during reproductive stages using lysimetric system under controlled glasshouse conditions. The antioxidant activities of AtDREB1A transgenic lines were measured by biochemical assays. The transgenic peanut lines recorded significantly lower accumulation of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide than the wild-type. Whereas, specific activity of catalase, guaiacol peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase and ascorbic acid were found to be significantly higher in transgenic lines than in the wild-type line under drought stress. The results showed that the transgenic lines expressed lower oxidative damage than wild-type and could protect themselves from the elevated levels of reactive oxygen species under drought stress. This could be attributed to the regulation of various stress-inducible genes by AtDREB1A transcription factor. Improved photosynthetic and growth parameters were also recorded in transgenic lines over wild-type under drought stress. Improved physio-biochemical mechanisms in transgenic peanut lines might have resulted in improved growth-related traits as significant correlations were observed between physio-biochemical parameters and growth-related traits under drought stress. The potential target genes of AtDREB1A transcription factor in transgenic peanut lines during drought stress were identified, which helped in understanding the molecular mechanisms of DREB-regulated stress responses. The transgenic line D6 reported the best physio-biochemical mechanisms and growth-related parameters under drought stress over other transgenic lines and wild-type, suggesting it may be used to develop high yielding and terminal drought-tolerant peanut varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2944625085,"Although the Plasmodium falciparum hexose transporter PfHT has emerged as a promising target for anti-malarial therapy, previously identified small-molecule inhibitors have lacked promising drug-like structural features necessary for development as clinical therapeutics. Taking advantage of emerging insight into structure/function relationships in homologous facilitative hexose transporters and our novel high throughput screening platform, we investigated the ability of compounds satisfying Lipinksi rules for drug likeness to directly interact and inhibit PfHT. The Maybridge HitFinder chemical library was interrogated by searching for compounds that reduce intracellular glucose by >40% at 10 μM. Testing of initial hits via measurement of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in PfHT over-expressing cell lines identified 6 structurally unique glucose transport inhibitors. WU-1 (3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-methyl-N-[2-(4-methylbenzenesulfonyl)ethyl]-1,2-oxazole-4-carboxamide) blocked 2-DG uptake (IC50 = 5.8 ± 0.6 μM) with minimal effect on the human orthologue class I (GLUTs 1–4), class II (GLUT8) and class III (GLUT5) facilitative glucose transporters. WU-1 showed comparable potency in blocking 2-DG uptake in freed parasites and inhibiting parasite growth, with an IC50 of 6.1 ± 0.8 μM and EC50 of 5.5 ± 0.6 μM, respectively. WU-1 also directly competed for N-[2-[2-[2-[(N-biotinylcaproylamino)ethoxy)ethoxyl]-4-[2-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]benzoyl]-1,3-bis(mannopyranosyl-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine (ATB-BMPA) binding and inhibited the transport of D-glucose with an IC50 of 5.9 ± 0.8 μM in liposomes containing purified PfHT. Kinetic analysis revealed that WU-1 acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of zero-trans D-fructose uptake. Decreased potency for WU-1 and the known endofacial ligand cytochalasin B was observed when PfHT was engineered to contain an N-terminal FLAG tag. This modification resulted in a concomitant increase in affinity for 4,6-O-ethylidene-α-D-glucose, an exofacially directed transport antagonist, but did not alter the Km for 2-DG. Taken together, these data are consistent with a model in which WU-1 binds preferentially to the transporter in an inward open conformation and support the feasibility of developing potent and selective PfHT antagonists as a novel class of anti-malarial drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2943849543,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a leading cause of morbidity and attributable mortality in oncohematologic patients. Timely diagnosis is essential but challenging. Herein we retrospectively describe 221 cases of antifungal treatments (AFT) administered in a monocentric real-life cohort of hematological malignancies. Between January 2010 and July 2017, 196 oncohematologic patients were treated with AFT at our Hematology Department. Diagnosis of IFIs was carried out according to EORTC/MSG-2008 guidelines.The most represented disease was acute myeloid leukemia (104 patients). Median age was 61 years; at fever onset 177 (80%) patients had a neutrophil count<0.5x109/L. Twenty-nine (13%) patients were receiving antifungal prophylaxis (26 posaconazole, 2 fluconazole, 1 itraconazole). The incidence of AFT was 13%. Serum galactomannan antigen (GM) was positive in 20% of the tested cases, while 85% of the patients had a CT scan suggestive for IFI. Twenty-one percent of these cases had a GM positive. Sixty-five out of 196 patients (33%) showed positive culture results, in particular Candida spp. were identified in 45 isolates, while Aspergillus spp. in 16 cases. Fourteen patients presented multiple positivity. Twenty-two (10%) cases were classified as proven IFIs, 61 (28%) as probable and 81 (37%) as possible, but 57 (26%) cases could not be classified. Fifty-nine percent of the patients received single agent AFT, 37% sequential AFT, 8% a combination regimen. Liposomal-amphotericin-B was the most used AFT. IFIs attributable mortality was 20%. This epidemiologic survey underlined a persistent significant use of AFT and a high mortality rate of IFIs. We suggest that further powerful diagnostic approaches should be investigated to improve the diagnostic accuracy and potential therapeutic implication."
https://openalex.org/W2944024252,"Objectives Every day, an average of 3,400 deaths and tens of millions of injuries occur as a result of traffic accidents. This study aims to model and validate road traffic injury (RTI) times series, specifically considering gender. Study design Time trend studies of monthly road traffic injuries (RTI) in Iran from March 2005 to February 2016, as well as those of males and females from March 2009 to February 2016 were performed. Methods The seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average method (SARIMA) was employed to predict RTI time series. The final model was selected from various SARIMA models based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). To examine whether the residuals were white noise, the Ljung-Box (LB) test and residuals plots were used for un-correlation, and the zero mean and stationarity, respectively. Additionally, smoothing methods were utilized to validate the SARIMA models for fitting and out-of-range prediction of the time series models under study. The sample auto-correlation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) with 20 lags were employed to determine the order of models and to ascertain if the residuals of the model were uncorrelated. Results Based on the obtained results, SARIMA (2,1,0)(0,1,1)12, SARIMA (0,1,1)(0,1,1)12, SARIMA (1,1,1)(0,0,1)12, and SARIMA (2,0,0)(1,0,0)12 were chosen for the time series including incidence rates of total road traffic injuries (IRTI), IRTI of males, females, and males-to-females, respectively. The AIC values were -87.57, 413.38, -732.91, and -85.32, respectively. The LB test for the residuals of the time series models of (0.539) IRTI, (0.3) IRTI of males, (0.23) females, and (0.237) males-to-females indicated that residuals were uncorrelated. Furthermore, prediction values for the next 24 months (2016 to 2018) showed no decline in the incidence rate of male and female traffic injuries. Results of the predictions using exponential smoothing methods indicated out-of-range prediction validity of the SARIMA models. Conclusion This study exemplified the high efficiency of SARIMA models in predicting road traffic injuries (RTIs). Based on observations, the IRTI mean in Iran was 35.57 in 2016. The predicted values of the IRTI for 2016–2018 by the SARIMA model showed no decreasing trend. During the studied period, the observed values of IRTI for males were two to three times the female values. Thus, prediction of RTI can provide a useful tool for traffic safety policymaking by simulating interrupted time series when applying new traffic enforcement interventions and regulations in the future. Additionally, IRTI analysis of males and females showed that men had a non-increasing trend but higher incidence of traffic injuries, whereas the IRTI for women revealed an increasing trend from 2009 to 2012 with a lower incidence of injuries. This growth could be attributed to the impact of increased outdoor activities of women and the increased number of issued driving licenses in the period of 2009–2012."
https://openalex.org/W2944128808,"Using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to derive chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cells has great industrial potential. A previous study used αβ T cell-derived CAR-modified iPSCs to produce CAR-T cells. However, these αβ T cells are restricted to autologous use and only recognize single cancer antigen. To make CAR-T alternative for allogeneic use, we reprogrammed γδ T cell into iPSCs (γδ T-iPSCs) to circumvent the risk of graft-versus-host disease. To target multiple cancer-associated antigens, we used an “NK cell-promoting” protocol to differentiate γδ T-iPSCs and to induce expression of natural killer receptors (NKRs). Through such two-step strategy, mimetic γδ T cells endowed with an array of NKRs and thus designated as “γδ natural killer T (γδ NKT) cells” were derived. With no/low-level expression of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and immune checkpoint receptors, γδ NKT cells may provide a potent “off-the-shelf” cytotoxic cell source to recognize multiple ubiquitous antigens in a broad spectrum of cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2944564630,"The mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) is a forest insect pest that attacks several different pine (Pinus) species in its native range of distribution in western North America. MPB are exposed for most of their life cycle to the chemical defenses of their hosts. These defenses are dominated by oleoresin secretions containing mostly various monoterpenes and diterpene resin acids (DRAs). Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) of the MPB are thought to be involved in the metabolism of at least some of these defense compounds. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of three MPB P450s, CYP6DJ1, CYP6BW1 and CYP6BW3, and their functions in the oxidation of various monoterpenes and diterpene resin acids. CYP6DJ1 oxidizes the monoterpenes (+)-(4R)-limonene, (–)-(4S)-limonene and terpinolene and produces (4R,8R)-limonene-8,9-epoxide, (4R,8S)-limonene-8,9-epoxide, (4S,8S)-limonene-8,9-epoxide, (4S,8R)-limonene-8,9-epoxide, perilla alcohol and several unidentified oxidized compounds. These products of CYP6DJ1 were also identified in extracts of MPB treated with the same monoterpenes. CYP6BW1 and CYP6BW3 both oxidize the DRAs abietic acid, dehydroabietic acid, neoabietic acid, levopimaric acid, palustric acid, and isopimaric acid, producing hydroxylated and epoxidized DRAs. CYP6DJ1, CYP6BW1 and CYP6BW3 appear to contribute to the metabolism of oleoresin terpenes as part of the MPB’s ability to cope with host defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2914232643,"CRISPR/Cas9 allows the generation of knockout cell lines and null zygotes by inducing site-specific double-stranded breaks. In most cases the DSB is repaired by non-homologous end joining, resulting in small nucleotide insertions or deletions that can be used to construct knockout alleles. However, these mutations do not produce the desired null result in all cases, but instead generate a similar, functionally active protein. This effect could limit the therapeutic efficiency of gene therapy strategies based on abrogating oncogene expression, and therefore needs to be considered carefully. If there is an acceptable degree of efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 delivery to cells, the key step for success lies in the effectiveness of a specific sgRNA at knocking out the oncogene, when only one sgRNA can be used. This study shows that the null effect could be increased with an sgRNA targeting the splice donor site (SDS) of the chosen exon. Following this strategy, the generation of null alleles would be facilitated in two independent ways: the probability of producing a frameshift mutation and the probability of interrupting the canonical mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing. In these contexts, we propose to improve the loss-of-function yield driving the CRISPR system at the SDS of critical exons."
https://openalex.org/W2943910731,"Although the slit diaphragm proteins in podocytes are uniquely organized to maintain glomerular filtration assembly and function, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that participate in trafficking these proteins to the correct location for development and homeostasis. Identifying these mechanisms will likely provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention to preserve podocyte function following glomerular injury. Analysis of structural variation in cases of human nephrotic syndrome identified rare heterozygous deletions of EXOC4 in two patients. This suggested that disruption of the highly-conserved eight-protein exocyst trafficking complex could have a role in podocyte dysfunction. Indeed, mRNA profiling of injured podocytes identified significant exocyst down-regulation. To test the hypothesis that the exocyst is centrally involved in podocyte development/function, we generated homozygous podocyte-specific Exoc5 (a central exocyst component that interacts with Exoc4) knockout mice that showed massive proteinuria and died within 4 weeks of birth. Histological and ultrastructural analysis of these mice showed severe glomerular defects with increased fibrosis, proteinaceous casts, effaced podocytes, and loss of the slit diaphragm. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Neph1 and Nephrin, major slit diaphragm constituents, were mislocalized and/or lost. mRNA profiling of Exoc5 knockdown podocytes showed that vesicular trafficking was the most affected cellular event. Mapping of signaling pathways and Western blot analysis revealed significant up-regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and transforming growth factor-β pathways in Exoc5 knockdown podocytes and in the glomeruli of podocyte-specific Exoc5 KO mice. Based on these data, we propose that exocyst-based mechanisms regulate Neph1 and Nephrin signaling and trafficking, and thus podocyte development and function."
https://openalex.org/W2944804443,"The role of glutathione (GSH) in eukaryotic cells is well known. The biosynthesis of this γ-glutamine tripeptide is well studied. However, other γ-glutamyl peptides were found in various sources, and the pathways of their formation were not always clear. The aim of the present study was to determine whether Saccharomyces cerevisiae can produce γ-glutamyl tripeptides other than GSH and to identify the pathways associated with the formation of these peptides. The tripeptide γ-Glu-Val-Gly (γ-EVG) was used as a model. Wild-type yeast cells were shown to produce this peptide during cultivation in minimal synthetic medium. Two different biosynthetic pathways for this peptide were identified. The first pathway consisted of two steps. In the first step, γ-Glu-Val (γ-EV) was produced from glutamate and valine by the glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) Gsh1p or by the transfer of the γ-glutamyl group from GSH to valine by the γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) Ecm38p or by the (Dug2p-Dug3p)2 complex. In the next step, γ-EV was combined with glycine by the glutathione synthetase (GS) Gsh2p. The second pathway consisted of transfer of the γ-glutamyl residue from GSH to the dipeptide Val-Gly (VG). This reaction was carried out mainly by the (Dug2p-Dug3p)2 complex, whereas the GGT Ecm38p did not participate in this reaction. The contribution of each of these two pathways to the intracellular pool of γ-EVG was dependent on cultivation conditions. In this work, we also found that Dug1p, previously identified as a Cys-Gly dipeptidase, played an essential role in the hydrolysis of the dipeptide VG in yeast cells. It was also demonstrated that γ-EV and γ-EVG could be effectively imported from the medium and that γ-EVG was imported by Opt1p, known to be a GSH importer. Our results demonstrated that γ-glutamyl peptides, particularly γ-EVG, are produced in yeast as products of several physiologically important reactions and are therefore natural components of yeast cells."

Previously, we found that decreased histone expression induces mitochondrial respiration, raising the question whether the DDR also stimulates respiration.

We observed that this induction is conferred by reduced transcription of histone genes and globally decreased DNA nucleosome occupancy. This globally altered chromatin structure increased the expression of genes encoding enzymes of tricarboxylic acid cycle, electron transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation, elevated oxygen consumption, and ATP synthesis. The elevated ATP levels resulting from DDR-stimulated respiration drove enlargement of dNTP pools; cells with a defect in respiration failed to increase dNTP synthesis and exhibited reduced fitness in the presence of DNA damage. Together, our results reveal an unexpected connection between respiration and the DDR and indicate that the benefit of increased dNTP synthesis in the face of DNA damage outweighs possible cellular damage due to increased oxygen metabolism.

We performed a nationwide survey and obtained histological specimens from 1053 individuals in 19 cities across the country. We examined the gastric mucosa, the topography, the atrophic gastritis risk factors, and the gastric cancer risk scores. Almost half (46.1%) of the patients with dyspeptic symptoms had histological abnormalities; chronic (36.3%) and atrophic gastritis (28.9%) being the most frequent. Individuals of the Timor ethnicity had the highest prevalence of acute (52.6%) and chronic gastritis (68.4%), even those negative for H. pylori. Our topographic analysis showed the majority of patients had predominantly antral acute and chronic gastritis. A multivariate logistic regression model showed age (Odds ratio [OR], 1.107), Timor ethnicity (OR, 8.531), and H. pylori infection (OR, 22.643) as independent risk factors for presence of atrophic gastritis. In addition, the gastric cancer risk score was highest in those from Timor, Papuan, and Bugis ethnic populations. Overall, Indonesia is a low-risk gastric cancer country. However, several ethnic groups displayed severe gastric mucosa symptoms suggesting policy makers should focus on those ethnic groups to perform gastric cancer screenings and to eradicate H. pylori."
https://openalex.org/W2944684874,"Phytogenic additives such as thymol are encountering growing interest in the poultry industry. However, there are still questions concerning dynamics of their bioavailability, biological action, optimal dosage and duration of supplementation needed to achieve meaningful effects, as well as persistence of induced changes after supplement withdrawal. We studied the link between the dynamics of free thymol concentration and the changes in fatty acids composition in quail egg yolk, both during a month-long chronic dietary supplementation and after 3 weeks of supplement withdrawal (post-supplementation). Fifty, 85 days-old, female quail of homogeneous body weights (251±1g) in egg-laying peak were used. To evaluate potential dose-dependent effects, three increasing doses 2, 4, and 6.25 g of thymol/kg of feed (THY2, THY4 and THY6, respectively) and two controls were evaluated (n = 10). In parallel, we assessed the concomitant changes in free thymol excretion, potential liver histopathological changes, and birds´ performance traits. Egg yolk and droppings show a dose-dependent increase in THY concentration after 9 days of supplementation and a decrease after post-supplementation. In egg yolk, these changes were accompanied by reduced saturated fatty acid concentrations achieved by 28 days of supplementation in THY2 and 14 days of supplementation in THY4 and THY6. However, after post-supplementation the aforementioned effect disappeared in THY2 but not in THY4 and THY6. While THY2 failed to increase polyunsaturated fatty acids, THY4 and THY6 increased polyunsaturated fatty acids by day 14 of supplementation and remained increased after post-supplementation. Fatty acids changes induced by thymol are consistent with improved nutritional quality of eggs. No treatment effects were observed in liver histopathology and female performance. Findings suggest that both dose of thymol and duration of supplementation modulate thymol and fatty acids concentrations in egg yolk and thymol concentration in droppings. Furthermore, the persistence of those effects after post-supplementation period is also a dose-dependent phenomenon."

In this study, we developed a novel automatic 3-D approach for volumetric segmentation and quantitative assessment of thigh Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) volumes in individuals with chronic SCI as well as non-disabled individuals. In this framework, subcutaneous adipose tissue, inter-muscular adipose tissue and total muscle tissue are segmented using linear combination of discrete Gaussians algorithm. Also, three thigh muscle groups were segmented utilizing the proposed 3-D Joint Markov Gibbs Random Field model that integrates first order appearance model, spatial information, and shape model to localize the muscle groups. The accuracy of the automatic segmentation method was tested both on SCI (N = 16) and on non-disabled (N = 14) individuals, showing an overall 0.93±0.06 accuracy for adipose tissue and muscle compartments segmentation based on Dice Similarity Coefficient. The proposed framework for muscle compartment segmentation showed an overall higher accuracy compared to ANTs and STAPLE, two previously validated atlas-based segmentation methods. Also, the framework proposed in this study showed similar Dice accuracy and better Hausdorff distance measure to that obtained using DeepMedic Convolutional Neural Network structure, a well-known deep learning network for 3-D medical image segmentation. The automatic segmentation method proposed in this study can provide fast and accurate quantification of adipose and muscle tissues, which have important health and functional implications in the SCI population."
https://openalex.org/W2944553406,"Head collisions in sport can result in catastrophic injuries to the cervical spine. Musculoskeletal modelling can help analyse the relationship between motion, external forces and internal loads that lead to injury. However, impact specific musculoskeletal models are lacking as current viscoelastic values used to describe cervical spine joint dynamics have been obtained from unrepresentative quasi-static or static experiments. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a cervical spine musculoskeletal model for use in axial impacts. Cervical spine specimens (C2-C6) were tested under measured sub-catastrophic loads and the resulting 3D motion of the vertebrae was measured. Specimen specific musculoskeletal models were then created and used to estimate the axial and shear viscoelastic (stiffness and damping) properties of the joints through an optimisation algorithm that minimised tracking errors between measured and simulated kinematics. A five-fold cross validation and a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis were conducted to assess the performance of the newly estimated parameters. The impact-specific parameters were integrated in a population specific musculoskeletal model and used to assess cervical spine loads measured from Rugby union impacts compared to available models. Results of the optimisation showed a larger increase of axial joint stiffness compared to axial damping and shear viscoelastic parameters for all models. The sensitivity analysis revealed that lower values of axial stiffness and shear damping reduced the models performance considerably compared to other degrees of freedom. The impact-specific parameters integrated in the population specific model estimated more appropriate joint displacements for axial head impacts compared to available models and are therefore more suited for injury mechanism analysis."

This screen identified the Moz, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2, Tip60 histone acetyl transferase complex, NF-κB signaling, purine synthesis, and linear ubiquitination pathways; and MDM2 proto-oncogene as NPC dependence factors/pathways. Using gene knock out, complementary DNA rescue, and inhibitor assays, we found that perturbation of these pathways greatly reduces the growth of NPC cell lines but does not affect growth of SV40-immortalized normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. These results suggest that targeting these pathways/proteins may hold promise for achieving better treatment of patients with NPC.

https://openalex.org/W2944201025,"The retinoid cycle is a metabolic process in the vertebrate retina that continuously regenerates 11-cis-retinal (11-cisRAL) from the all-trans-retinal (atRAL) isomer. atRAL accumulation can cause photoreceptor degeneration and irreversible visual dysfunction associated with incurable blinding retinal diseases, such as Stargardt disease, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The underlying cellular mechanisms leading to retinal degeneration remain uncertain, although previous studies have shown that atRAL promotes calcium influx associated with cell apoptosis. To identify compounds that mitigate the effects of atRAL toxicity, here we developed an unbiased and robust image-based assay that can detect changes in intracellular calcium levels in U2OS cells. Using our assay in a high-throughput screen of 2,400 compounds, we noted that selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) potently stabilize intracellular calcium and thereby counteract atRAL-induced toxicity. In a light-induced retinal degeneration mouse model (Abca4−/−Rdh8−/−), raloxifene (a benzothiophene-type scaffold SERM) prevented the onset of photoreceptor apoptosis and thus protected the retina from degeneration. The minor structural differences between raloxifene and one of its derivatives (Y 134) had a major impact on calcium homeostasis after atRAL exposure in vitro, and we verified this differential impact in vivo. In summary, the SERM raloxifene has structural and functional neuroprotective effects in the retina. We propose that the highly sensitive image-based assay developed here could be applied for the discovery of additional drug candidates preventing photoreceptor degeneration."

The study is intended to find an economically viable finfish culture during the fallow period of shrimp farms. The Silver pompano, Trachinotus blochi iintercropped with Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei culture in coastal shrimp ponds was assessed for growth, survival, and economic viability. During the grow-out period of 100 days, fishes grew from 40.23 ± 1.40 g to 256.56 ± 1.08 g in weight and 12.83 ± 0.19 cm to 25.11 ± 0.09 cm in length. The daily weight gain (DWG) and daily length gain (DLG) were 2.16 g/day and 0.12 cm/day, respectively. Relative growth rate (RGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) recorded for weight was 537.80% in 100 days and 1.85% per day, respectively. Pompano has exhibited its sturdiness and adaptability to the land-based culture system as evidenced by an overall survival percentage of 89.8% including nursery and grow-out phases. The realized feed conversion ratio was 1.94. The culture period of 100 days is found to be enough to attain a desirable harvest size of 250 g. The projected production potential of the experimental demonstration farm of 4500 m2 water spread area for culture was 16.2 tonnes/cycle with a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 1.34 over operational cost. The present participatory trial empirically proved the viability of Silver pompano as an intercrop in coastal shrimp ponds. Thus, the introduction of Pompano in shrimp ponds is recommended and can be promoted for sustainable intercropping with shrimp farming along the Indian coast for improving people's livelihoods."
https://openalex.org/W2944482225,"Background Internal migration has been an integral part of socioeconomic transformation in a country. Migrants are a vulnerable group for access to the reproductive and maternal health services. Very little is known regarding the role of internal migration on the use of reproductive and maternal health services in Nepal. This study examines the effect of internal migration on the use of reproductive and maternal health services in Nepal. Methods The data for this study were extracted from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (2016 NDHS). The study population is women age 15–49. The sample population is different for modern contraceptive use than for Antenatal care (ANC) visits and place of delivery. The sample population for modern contraceptive use is restricted to the 8,811 (weighted) women who are currently married. The total analytic sampled population for ANC visits and place of delivery is 3,220 (weighted) women. The study used descriptive and logistic regression analysis, with three outcome measures: current use of modern contraception; at least four ANC visits; and place of delivery. Results Sixty-eight percent women were internal migrants. Forty-four percent of eligible women reported current use of modern contraception, 71% of women made at least four ANC visits, about 9% of women made 8 or more ANC visits and 58% of women delivered in a health facility. Our findings show that modern contraceptive use is significantly higher among urban non-migrant women and urban-to-urban migrants. Urban-to-urban migrant women and rural-to-urban migrant women have significantly higher odds of attending at least four ANC visits for the most recent birth compared with rural-to-rural migrant women. Women who moved between urban areas, women who moved from an urban to a rural area, women who moved from a rural area to an urban area and urban non-migrants are significantly more likely to deliver in a health facility compared with women who moved between rural areas. Conclusion The differentials of use of reproductive and maternal health services by migration status may need consideration during program planning to improve women's reproductive and maternal health services in Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W2944048651,"Background Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis worldwide. We aimed to estimate the current burden of neonatal invasive GBS disease in the Netherlands, as a first step in providing an evidence base for policy makers on the potential benefits of a future maternal GBS vaccine. Methods Surveillance of neonatal invasive GBS occurs at the National Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis, where culture isolates from cerebrospinal fluid and blood are sent by diagnostic laboratories. From the number of cultures we estimated the incidence of neonatal (age 0–90 days) GBS meningitis and sepsis. We constructed a disease progression model informed by literature and expert consultation to estimate the disease burden of neonatal invasive GBS infection. As many neonates with a probable GBS sepsis are never confirmed by blood culture, we further estimated the disease burden of unconfirmed cases of probable GBS sepsis in sensitivity analyses. Results An estimated 97 cases and 6.5 deaths occurred in the Netherlands in 2017 due to culture positive neonatal invasive GBS infection. This incidence comprised 15 cases of meningitis and 42 cases of sepsis per 100.000 births, with an estimated mortality of 3.8 per 100.000 live births. A disease burden of 780 disability-adjusted life years (DALY) (95% CI 650–910) or 460 DALY per 100.000 live births was attributed to neonatal invasive GBS infection. In the sensitivity analysis including probable neonatal GBS sepsis the disease burden increased to 71 cases and 550 DALY (95% CI 460–650) per 100.000 live births. Conclusion In conclusion, neonatal invasive GBS infection currently causes a substantial disease burden in the Netherlands. However, important evidence gaps are yet to be filled. Furthermore, cases of GBS sepsis lacking a positive blood culture may contribute considerably to this burden potentially preventable by a future GBS vaccine."

This study aimed to examine the seropositivities of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against those three pathogens among pregnant women with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and to explore the associated factors.A cross-sectional study was conducted in southern Thailand, where goat production is common. A total of 105 pregnant Thai women who had adverse pregnancy outcomes and serum samples collected at first antenatal care visit before their 28th gestational week from June 2015 to June 2016 were included. The seropositivities of IgG anti-Brucella abortus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Coxiella burnetii antibodies were tested by using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Associated factors with seropositivity were analyzed using multiple logistic regression.Most women were Muslim aged 20-34 years and 32.4% had a prior history of one or more adverse pregnancy outcomes. One-third of the women had been exposed to goats or raw goat products. Of the 105 serum samples, the seropositivity of anti-T. gondii IgG was highest (33/105, 31.4%), followed by anti-C. burnetii IgG (2/105, 1.9%), and anti-B. abortus IgG (1/105, 1.0%), respectively. None of the pregnant women were found to be co-seropositive for those three pathogens.One-third of women with adverse pregnancy outcomes showed positive antibodies for toxoplasmosis, coxiellosis and brucellosis. A dose-response relationship between seropositivity of anti-T. gondii IgG and age was noticed."
https://openalex.org/W2944649251,"Virus discovery based on high-throughput sequencing relies on enrichment for virus sequences prior to library preparation to achieve a sufficient number of viral reads. In general, preparations of double-stranded RNA or total RNA preparations treated to remove rRNA are used for sequence enrichment. We used virus-specific antibodies to immunocapture virions from plant sap to conduct cDNA synthesis, followed by library preparation and HTS. For the four potato viruses PLRV, PVY, PVA and PYV, template preparation by virion immunocapture provided a simpler and less expensive method than the enrichment of total RNA by ribosomal depletion. Specific enrichment of viral sequences without an intermediate amplification step was achieved, and this high coverage of sequences across the viral genomes was important to identify rare sequence variations. Using this approach, the first complete genome sequence of a potato yellowing virus isolate (PYV, DSMZ PV-0706) was determined in this study. PYV can be confidently assigned as a distinct species in the genus Ilarvirus."
https://openalex.org/W2943991720,"Microstructural asymmetry of the brain can provide more direct causal explanations of functional lateralization than can macrostructural asymmetry. We performed a cross-sectional diffusion imaging study of 314 patients treated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at a single institution and 92 healthy controls. An asymmetry index based on diffusion metrics was computed to quantify brain microstructural asymmetry. The effects of age and the asymmetry metrics of the two cohorts were examined with t-tests and linear models. We discovered two new types of microstructural asymmetry. Myelin-related asymmetry in controls was prominent in the back brain (89% right), whereas axon-related asymmetry occurred in the front brain (67% left) and back brain (88% right). These asymmetries indicate that white matter is more mature and more myelinated in the left back brain, potentially explaining the leftward lateralization of language and visual functions. The asymmetries increase throughout childhood and adolescence (P = 0.04) but were significantly less in patients treated for ALL (P<0.01), especially in younger patients. Our results indicate that atypical brain development may appear long before patients treated with chemotherapy become symptomatic."
https://openalex.org/W2944541431,"Objectives This study aimed at investigating the molecular mechanism underlying PKM2-mediated cancer invasion. Materials & methods To optimize the investigation of PKM2-specific effects, we used two immortalized oral cell lines. The two cell lines drastically differed in PKM2 expression level, particularly in the level of nuclear PKM2, and subsequently in glucose metabolism and tumorigenicity. Results Knockdown of PKM2 reduced not only the glucose metabolism but also the invasive activity by curtailing the expressions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP): PKM2 could modulate MMP-9 expression by regulating ETS-1 inside the nucleus. These results were further confirmed in an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line. In correspondence with in vitro findings, clinicopathological data from OSCC patients indicated strong association between PKM2 expression and poor survival rate. Additionally, upon analysis of public database, significant positive correlation was found between PKM2 and ETS-1 in OSCC. Conclusion Collectively, this study unveiled the molecular mechanism underlying PKM2-mediated cancer invasion, thereby providing novel targets for therapeutics development against invasive OSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2944003681,"Non-natural amino acids (nnAA) contain unique functional moieties that greatly expand the available tool set for protein engineering. But incorporation of nnAAs requires the function of an orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. Stable cell lines expressing these components have been shown capable of producing gram per liter levels of antibodies with nnAAs. However, little has been reported on the genetic makeup of these cells. To gain a better understanding of the minimal requirements for efficient nnAA incorporation we developed qPCR methods for the quantitation of the key components. Here we describe the development of qPCR assays for the quantification of tRNApyl and pylRS. qPCR was chosen because it provides a large dynamic range, has high specificity for its target, and is a non-radioactive method used routinely for cell line characterization. Designing assays for tRNAs present challenges due to their short length (~72 nucleotides) and high secondary structure. These tRNA assays have a ≥ 5 log dynamic range with the tRNApyl assays being able to discern the mature and unprocessed forms of the tRNApyl. Cell line analysis showed tRNApyl was expressed at higher levels than the CHO-K1 endogenous Met and Phe tRNAs and that >88% of tRNApyl was the mature form."
https://openalex.org/W2944228708,"The transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) family plays an important role in many developmental processes and when mutated often contributes to various diseases. Marfan syndrome is a genetic disease with an occurrence of approximately 1 in 5,000. The disease is caused by mutations in fibrillin, which lead to an increase in TGFβ ligand activity, resulting in abnormalities of connective tissues which can be life-threatening. Mutations in other components of TGFβ signaling (receptors, Smads, Schnurri) lead to similar diseases with attenuated phenotypes relative to Marfan syndrome. In particular, mutations in TGFβ receptors, most of which are clustered at the C-terminal end, result in Marfan-like (MFS-like) syndromes. Even though it was assumed that many of these receptor mutations would reduce or eliminate signaling, in many cases signaling is active. From our previous studies on receptor trafficking in C. elegans, we noticed that many of these receptor mutations that lead to Marfan-like syndromes overlap with mutations that cause mis-trafficking of the receptor, suggesting a link between Marfan-like syndromes and TGFβ receptor trafficking. To test this hypothesis, we introduced three of these key MFS and MFS-like mutations into the C. elegans TGFβ receptor and asked if receptor trafficking is altered. We find that in every case studied, mutated receptors mislocalize to the apical surface rather than basolateral surface of the polarized intestinal cells. Further, we find that these mutations result in longer animals, a phenotype due to over-stimulation of the nematode TGFβ pathway and, importantly, indicating that function of the receptor is not abrogated in these mutants. Our nematode models of Marfan syndrome suggest that MFS and MFS-like mutations in the type II receptor lead to mis-trafficking of the receptor and possibly provides an explanation for the disease, a phenomenon which might also occur in some cancers that possess the same mutations within the type II receptor (e.g. colon cancer)."

Treating hyperglycaemia during pregnancy reduces the risk of complications, the effect of interventions is however limited due to the late diagnosis. It is thus important to identify biomarkers reaching a high precision for GDM development in early pregnancy. Here we aim to investigate soluble CD163 (sCD163) and soluble tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) in early pregnancy GDM and their association to the development of later glucose intolerance. In this case-control study, women diagnosed with GDM in early pregnancy (n = 70) at Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden in 2011-2015 were age- and BMI matched to pregnant volunteers without diabetes (n = 70) recruited in early pregnancy from maternal health care centres in 2014-2015. Plasma levels of sCD163 and sTWEAK were analysed using commercial ELISA. Plasma levels of sCD163 did not differ between patients with and without GDM in early pregnancy (p = 0.86), plasma levels of sTWEAK however was decreased in women with GDM (0.71 [0.4-1.75] ng/ml) compared to controls (1.38 [0.63-4.86] ng/ml; p = 0.003). Women with sTWEAK levels in the lowest tertile had an increased risk of GDM in early pregnancy (p = 0.014). Neither sCD163 nor sTWEAK were associated with later glucose intolerance in women with GDM. This study reports decreased levels of sTWEAK in women with early pregnancy GDM, independent of age and BMI. Neither sCD163 nor sTWEAK were found to be associated to later glucose intolerance."

These proteins are C-terminally anchored to Golgi membranes and are primarily composed of coiled-coils, suggesting the N termini of a golgin could extend hundreds of nanometers away from the Golgi membrane.

Less is known about how a tethered vesicle traverses the distance from the N terminus of a golgin to the Golgi membrane. One model proposes that vesicles selectively diffuse toward the Golgi membrane through interactions with distinct Rab-binding sites distributed across the length of each golgin (19Sinka R.

Subsequently, Warren and co-workers (23Malsam J. Satoh A. Pelletier L. Warren G. Golgin tethers define subpopulations of COPI vesicles.Science. 2005; 307 (15718469): 1095-109810.1126/science.1108061Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) reported that the mammalian homolog of Coy1, CASP, specifically captured vesicles laden with recycled Golgi enzymes in vitro. However, Wong and Munro (7Wong M. Munro S. Membrane trafficking. The specificity of vesicle traffic to the Golgi is encoded in the golgin coiled-coil proteins.Science. 2014; 346 (25359980): 125689810.1126/science.1256898Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) later reported that CASP did not nucleate capture of any vesicle populations in their in vivo mitochondrial localization assay, calling into question this protein’s capacity to function as a vesicle tether and its role in Golgi transport. We reported that cells lacking COY1 display a defect in the retention of the cis-Golgi mannosyltransferase Och1 and that combining coy1Δ with other golgin mutations results in growth and glycosylation defects, consistent with a role for Coy1 in maintaining Golgi homeostasis. Coy1 physically interacts with all three Golgi retrograde Q-SNAREs and with the COG complex, an MTC required for retrograde transport on the Golgi (2Fisher P. Ungar D.

Cell. 2017; 28 (28794270): 2686-270010.1091/mbc.e17-03-0137Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this golgin in vesicle docking and/or SNAREpin assembly. To better understand Coy1's contribution to retrograde Golgi transport, we mapped the functionally essential regions of the protein. Here, we report that a conserved C-terminal region adjacent to Coy1's integral membrane domain is necessary and sufficient to bind both the SNARE Sed5 and the COG complex. Immediately N-terminal to this binding domain is a coiled-coil domain that is required for stable integration of Coy1 into a megadalton-sized complex. Mutation of conserved motifs within the minimal binding domain disrupts Coy1 interactions and in vivo function. These consequences are also observed when conserved arginine residues within the C-terminal coiled-coil domain are mutated. These arginine mutations also reduce the assembly of Coy1 into a larger complex, suggesting that the interactions and function of Coy1 depend on stable oligomerization. Based on these findings, we propose that Coy1 assembles into a docking platform that links COG-bound vesicles to a cognate set of fusogens on Golgi membranes. Previously, we reported that the golgin Coy1 elutes in the void volume of a Superose 6 gel-filtration column, which has an exclusion limit of 4 MDa (24Anderson N.S. Mukherjee I. Bentivoglio C.M. Barlowe C. The golgin protein Coy1 functions in intra-Golgi retrograde transport and interacts with the COG complex and Golgi SNAREs.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 (28794270): 2686-270010.1091/mbc.e17-03-0137Crossref Google Scholar). Two possibilities could explain this elution pattern: either Coy1 is incorporated into a large complex or it forms a smaller but highly extended assembly, as has been reported for other coiled-coil proteins of the Golgi complex (25Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. A novel 115-kD peripheral membrane protein is required for intercisternal transport in the Golgi stack.J.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we sedimented detergent-solubilized membrane proteins from semi-intact cells through a 5–45% sucrose gradient. We monitored the distribution of Coy1 alongside other protein complexes of known size. The α-subunit of coatomer, Cop1, and a COPII coat subunit, Sec13, were detected in the middle and earlier sections of the gradient, consistent with their reported sedimentation coefficients of 13 S and 7.8 S, respectively (26Waters M.G. Serafini T. Rothman J.E. Coatomer: a cytosolic protein complex containing subunits of non-clathrin-coated Golgi transport vesicles.Nature. 1991; 349 (1898986): 248-25110.1038/349248a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 27Duden R.

The integral membrane protein Erv46, which assembles into a complex of ∼300 kDa (29Welsh L.M. Tong A.H. Boone C. Jensen O.N. Otte S. Genetic and molecular interactions of the Erv41p–Erv46p complex involved in transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex.J.

The Coy1-enriched fractions were well-resolved from the COG and COPI complexes, both of which interact transiently with Coy1 (Fig. 1A) (24Anderson N.S. Mukherjee I. Bentivoglio C.M. Barlowe C. The golgin protein Coy1 functions in intra-Golgi retrograde transport and interacts with the COG complex and Golgi SNAREs.Mol. Biol.

The integral membrane domain of Coy1 did not contribute to this sedimentation pattern, as Coy1ΔTM was similarly enriched at the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 1B). In combination with our gel-filtration data (24Anderson N.S. Mukherjee I. Bentivoglio C.M. Barlowe C. The golgin protein Coy1 functions in intra-Golgi retrograde transport and interacts with the COG complex and Golgi SNAREs.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 (28794270): 2686-270010.1091/mbc.e17-03-0137Crossref Google Scholar), we conclude that the cytosolic domain of Coy1 assembles into a megadalton-sized complex. To better understand how oligomerization of Coy1 affects its role in retrograde Golgi transport and interactions with the COG complex and SNAREs, we developed a mapping approach to identify the functionally essential regions of this protein. First, we examined the contribution of Coy1’s predicted coiled-coil domains (32Delorenzi M. Speed T. An HMM model for coiled-coil domains and a comparison with PSSM-based predictions.Bioinformatics. 2002; 18 (12016059): 617-62510.1093/bioinformatics/18.4.617Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 33Zimmermann L. Stephens A. Nam S.Z. Rau D. Kübler J. Lozajic M. Gabler F. Söding J. Lupas A.N. Alva V. A completely reimplemented MPI bioinformatics toolkit with a new HHpred server at its core.J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 (29258817): 2237-224310.1016/j.jmb.2017.12.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) by individually deleting them from a 2-μm plasmid that expresses COY1 under the strong constitutive PHO5 promoter (Fig. 2A). After verifying expression of these constructs (Fig. 2B), we tested their ability to induce a growth defect in the gos1Δ strain. As reported previously (22Gillingham A.K. Pfeifer A.C. Munro S. CASP, the alternatively spliced product of the gene encoding the CCAAT-displacement protein transcription factor, is a Golgi membrane protein related to giantin.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13 (12429822): 3761-377410.1091/mbc.e02-06-0349Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), overexpression of COY1 induced a strong growth defect in gos1Δ cells. This growth defect was still apparent in cells overexpressing Coy1 ΔCC1, ΔCC2, or ΔCC3, but it was ameliorated in cells bearing the ΔCC4, ΔCC5, and ΔCC6 constructs (Fig. 2C). At elevated temperatures, a graded phenotype was apparent, with truncations closer to the C terminus of Coy1 eliciting a less severe phenotype than those near the N terminus. These results reveal that the middle and C-terminal coiled-coils are required for Coy1 toxicity in gos1Δ cells. In a reciprocal approach, we examined whether these constructs could rescue the coy1Δ rud3Δ sgm1Δ strain, which cannot grow at high temperatures without plasmid-borne COY1 (24Anderson N.S. Mukherjee I. Bentivoglio C.M. Barlowe C. The golgin protein Coy1 functions in intra-Golgi retrograde transport and interacts with the COG complex and Golgi SNAREs.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 (28794270): 2686-270010.1091/mbc.e17-03-0137Crossref Google Scholar). Each transformant grew at a similar rate at lower temperatures, whereas cells bearing an empty vector were inviable at the restrictive temperature. Growth was rescued by the WT, ΔCC2, and ΔCC3 constructs. Some growth was apparent in cells carrying the Coy1ΔCC1 plasmid, but not to the same level as the former constructs, suggesting Coy1 function had been partially compromised. Cells bearing the ΔCC4, ΔCC5, and ΔCC6 plasmids were completely inviable (Fig. 2D). Thus, both the toxicity and rescue assays pinpointed these coiled-coils as essential for Coy1 function. To analyze the contribution of these coiled-coils to oligomerization of Coy1, we resolved solubilized yeast membranes expressing these constructs as their sole copy of Coy1 on sucrose gradients. Notably, although these constructs were all highly overexpressed, the sedimentation pattern of plasmid-borne Coy1 remained comparable with that of the endogenously expressed protein (Fig. 2E). Smaller assemblies of Coy1 do not accumulate upon overexpression, which suggests that Coy1 assembles into a megadalton-sized complex on its own. Five of the six Coy1ΔCC constructs exhibited a similar sedimentation pattern, with a majority of each protein peaking after Cop1 (Fig. 2F). In contrast, Coy1ΔCC6 exhibited a broad distribution with one peak at the top of the gradient and a second minor peak at the same position as WT Coy1 (Fig. 2, E and F), suggesting that formation of this complex was strongly reduced but not abolished. This result indicates that the C-terminal coiled-coil of Coy1 is required for the stable incorporation of this protein into a higher-order oligomer. We next analyzed whether these coiled-coil truncations affected binding of Coy1 to either Sed5 or the COG complex in bead-based pulldown assays. However, we were unable to identify a single coiled-coil domain that, when deleted, abolished these interactions. 3N. S. Anderson and C. Barlowe, unpublished observations. We instead tested whether truncation of the three functionally nonessential N-terminal coiled-coils (amino acids 1–210) or the entire coiled-coil region (1–535) affected these interactions (Fig. 3A). WT Coy1 was specifically recovered with GST–Sed5 and lobe A of the COG complex, which consists of Cog1, Cog2, Cog3, and Cog4 (24Anderson N.S. Mukherjee I. Bentivoglio C.M. Barlowe C. The golgin protein Coy1 functions in intra-Golgi retrograde transport and interacts with the COG complex and Golgi SNAREs.Mol. Biol.

Mol. Biol. 2010; 17 (20972446): 1292-129710.1038/nsmb.1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, these interactions were not as robust as observed previously (24Anderson N.S. Mukherjee I. Bentivoglio C.M. Barlowe C. The golgin protein Coy1 functions in intra-Golgi retrograde transport and interacts with the COG complex and Golgi SNAREs.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 (28794270): 2686-270010.1091/mbc.e17-03-0137Crossref Google Scholar). This difference is likely attributable to the inclusion of the transmembrane domain in these N-terminal truncations, suggesting that Coy1’s integral membrane domain may limit these interactions or that some binding activity is lost following detergent solubilization. The first truncation, spanning residues 211–679, bound to Sed5 and COG to a similar extent as the full-length protein. Surprisingly, specific interactions with Sed5 and COG were not only preserved in the 536–679 truncation, these interactions appeared far more robust than in the other constructs (Fig. 3, B and D). Relative to WT Coy1, recovery of this C-terminal fragment was on average nearly three times higher with Sed5 and 15-fold higher with COG (Fig. 3, C and E). These interactions were abolished when Coy1 was C-terminally truncated at residue 535 (Fig. 3, F–I), indicating that Coy1(536–679) is both necessary and sufficient to interact with Sed5 and the COG complex. To complement these in vitro binding assays, we tested whether the cytosolic portion of Coy1’s C-terminal binding domain (CBD) localized to Golgi membranes. We constructed plasmids encoding this domain sandwiched between an N-terminal superfolder GFP variant (35Slubowski C.J. Funk A.D. Roesner J.M. Paulissen S.M. Huang L.S. Plasmids for C-terminal tagging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that contain improved GFP proteins, Envy and Ivy.Yeast. 2015; 32 (25612242): 379-38710.1002/yea.3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal 3xHA tag with the intent of visualizing its localization in vivo (Fig. 4A). However, we were unable to detect expression of this fusion protein when encoded on a centromeric plasmid. Overexpression of this construct from a 2-μm vector yielded a detectable signal, although the abundance of this fusion protein was reduced relative to the other Coy1 truncations (Fig. 4B). We elected to examine the distribution of this fusion protein through bulk fractionation assays instead of live-cell imaging. We first asked whether the CBD was important for Coy1ΔTM to remain membrane-associated. Membranes derived from coy1Δ cells carrying plasmids encoding various Coy1 truncations or GFP were centrifuged at a high speed to generate a cytosol-enriched supernatant and a membrane pellet fraction. The integral membrane protein Yet3 was exclusively detected in the membrane pellet fractions, whereas Sec19, the yeast homolog of GDP-dissociation inhibitor, remained largely enriched in the supernatant fraction in each assay (36Garrett M.D. Zahner J.E. Cheney C.M. Novick P.J. GDI1 encodes a GDP dissociation inhibitor that plays an essential role in the yeast secretory pathway.EMBO J. 1994; 13 (8157010): 1718-172810.1002/j.1460-2075.1994.tb06436.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 37Wilson J.D.

As expected, GFP was largely detected in the cytosolic fraction, although ∼18% could be detected in the pellet, reflecting some carryover with membrane proteins. Full-length Coy1 was also exclusively detected in the pellet, whereas 91% of Coy1ΔTM was also found in the membrane fraction, as reported previously (24Anderson N.S. Mukherjee I. Bentivoglio C.M. Barlowe C. The golgin protein Coy1 functions in intra-Golgi retrograde transport and interacts with the COG complex and Golgi SNAREs.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2017; 28 (28794270): 2686-270010.1091/mbc.e17-03-0137Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, the Coy1(1–535) construct that lacks the CBD exhibited a primarily cytosolic distribution, with only 26% remaining in the membrane pellet (Fig. 4, C and D). Despite low levels of expression (Fig. 4B), over 60% of the GFP–CBD construct was detected in the membrane pellet (Fig. 4, C and D). This construct was not as strongly associated with membranes as Coy1ΔTM, suggesting that other cytosolic regions of Coy1 may stabilize interactions with membranes. Regardless, these data support a role for Coy1’s C-terminal domain in engaging with other membrane-associated factors. Next, we examined whether the CBD specifically associated with Golgi membranes by resolving organelles from lysed semi-intact coy1Δ cells expressing the cytosolic Coy1 constructs on sucrose gradients. In each experiment, Golgi membranes marked by Och1 were enriched in the middle of the gradient, whereas denser ER membranes marked by Yet3 pelleted at the bottom of the tube. Although Coy1ΔTM exhibited a broad sedimentation profile, most of this protein co-fractionated with Golgi membranes, as repo"

The aim of this study was to investigate how ACE may impact electromyography (EMG) activity of the trapezius muscle in a novel experimental stress paradigm, in a sample of 120 healthy participants. The stress paradigm consisted of a memory task, in which participants were asked to memorize and recall as many words as possible, displayed on a screen. The study protocol included 2 identical experimental sessions (T0 = 0 and T1 = 6 months). EMG activity was analyzed using multilevel regression analysis. EMG activity was higher during the memory task compared to baseline, supporting the validity of the experimental EMG-stress paradigm. In addition, the EMG increase was attenuated during the second session. Analyses were indicative for a moderating effect of ACE on stress-induced EMG activity: higher ACE scores resulted in greater EMG reactivity. These associations were apparent for early ACE exposure (0-11 years) as well as for later exposure (12-17 years). The association between ACE and EMG reactivity remained significant but was much weaker at T1 in comparison to T0, likely because of reduced unpredictability and uncertainty related to the experiment. In conclusion, this study showed that enduring liabilities occasioned by ACE in a non-clinical population can be studied using an experimental paradigm of EMG stress reactivity, contingent on the level of predictability of the stressor."
https://openalex.org/W2944603767,"HIV spread in injecting drug users (IDU) occurs efficiently between individuals within their social networks. While methadone maintenance treatment has long known to be effective in combating HIV transmission in IDU, the impacts of one's social connections and HIV status have not been well characterised. A study was conducted with the objective of differentiating the pattern of treatment participation between HIV-positive and negative methadone users and to understand its association with social connections with peers.Attendance data in one calendar year were extracted from a territory-wide electronic clinical record database of over 8000 methadone users attending 19 clinics in Hong Kong, a city with a relatively low HIV prevalence in injecting drug users. A case-control design was used by matching HIV positive methadone users with HIV negative controls. A temporal-social co-occurrence approach was adopted to construct a social network. Multiple logistic regression and network-based analyses were conducted.In 2016, a total of 8332 methadone users had attended a clinic at least once, giving 1694016 attendance records that were included in the study. Some 432 methadone, 54 of whom HIV positive, were included in the case-control analyses. Multivariable logistic regression model showed that HIV-positive status was associated with drug injection history (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.28, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.19-4.38), not working fulltime (aOR 3.34, 95% CI 1.15-9.72), ethnic minority (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.33-5.02) and minimum daily dose of at least 20mg (aOR 3.64, 95% CI 1.08-12.26). Those having connections with other peers were older (aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.04), had a higher mode dose (aOR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.04) and had been admitted to methadone programme for longer time (aOR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.13). Among those with connections, HIV-negative users did not have more connections (median degree centrality 21.00 vs 34.50, p = 0.26) but the network structure was stronger (clustering coefficient 0.65 vs 0.53, p = 0.03).The weak and sparse linkages may explain the generally low HIV prevalence and incidence in opioid-dependent persons in Hong Kong. Social support could play a constructive role in harm reduction and ethnic minority community-based organisations could help and reinforce treatment adherence."
