https://openalex.org/W1960735897,"Mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene produce an animal model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder. To test a new therapeutic strategy for ALS, we examined the effect of caspase inhibition in transgenic mice expressing mutant human SOD1 with a substitution of glycine to alanine in position 93 (mSOD1(G93A)). Intracerebroventricular administration of zVAD-fmk, a broad caspase inhibitor, delays disease onset and mortality. Moreover, zVAD-fmk inhibits caspase-1 activity as well as caspase-1 and caspase-3 mRNA up-regulation, providing evidence for a non-cell-autonomous pathway regulating caspase expression. Caspases play an instrumental role in neurodegeneration in transgenic mSOD1(G93A) mice, which suggests that caspase inhibition may have a protective role in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W1967679856,"The contribution of extrinsic and genetic mechanisms in determining areas of the mammalian neocortex has been a contested issue. This study analyzes the roles of the regulatory genes Emx2 and Pax6, which are expressed in opposing gradients in the neocortical ventricular zone, in specifying areas. Changes in the patterning of molecular markers and area-specific connections between the cortex and thalamus suggest that arealization of the neocortex is disproportionately altered in Emx2 and Pax6 mutant mice in opposing manners predicted from their countergradients of expression: rostral areas expand and caudal areas contract in Emx2 mutants, whereas the opposite effect is seen in Pax6 mutants. These findings suggest that Emx2 and Pax6 cooperate to regulate arealization of the neocortex and to confer area identity to cortical cells."
https://openalex.org/W2075767644,"The hierarchical nature of phylogenies means that random extinction of species affects a smaller fraction of higher taxa, and so the total amount of evolutionary history lost may be comparatively slight. However, current extinction risk is not phylogenetically random. We show the potentially severe implications of the clumped nature of threat for the loss of biodiversity. An additional 120 avian and mammalian genera are at risk compared with the number predicted under random extinction. We estimate that the prospective extra loss of mammalian evolutionary history alone would be equivalent to losing a monotypic phylum."
https://openalex.org/W2086142693,"A variety of molecular chaperones and folding enzymes assist the folding of newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we investigated why some glycoproteins interact with the molecular chaperone BiP, and others with the calnexin/calreticulin pathway. The folding of Semliki forest virus glycoproteins and influenza hemagglutinin was studied in living cells. The initial choice of chaperone depended on the location of N-linked glycans in the growing nascent chain. Direct interaction with calnexin and calreticulin without prior interaction with BiP occurred if glycans were present within about 50 residues of the protein's NH2-terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2084488755,"Many cases of early-onset inherited Alzheimer's disease (AD) are caused by mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS1) gene. PS1 mutations may perturb cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and thereby render neurons vulnerable to excitotoxicity and apoptosis. We now report that PC12 cells expressing PS1 mutations and primary hippocampal neurons from PS1 mutant knockin mice exhibit greatly increased levels of ryanodine receptors (RyR) and enhanced Ca2+ release following stimulation with caffeine. Double-labeling immunostaining and co-immunoprecipitation analyses indicate that PS1 and RyR are colocalized and interact physically. Caffeine treatment sensitizes neurons expressing mutant PS1 to apoptosis induced by amyloid β-peptide, a neurotic peptide linked to the pathogenesis of AD. When taken together with recent evidence for alterations in RyR in brains of AD patients, our data suggest that PS1 mutations may promote neuronal degeneration in AD by increasing transcription and translation of RyR and altering functional properties of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ pools.

Alzheimer's disease presenilin endoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription analysis of variance Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that is a leading cause of death and disability (1.Small G.W.

Although the mechanisms of neuronal degeneration in AD are not clear, they appear to involve increased oxidative stress and disruption of cellular calcium homeostasis (2.Mattson M.P. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1081-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Whereas most cases of AD are not caused by a specific genetic defect and have a late age of onset, some cases are characterized by an early age of onset and a dominant inheritance pattern. Mutations in the gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1) on chromosome 14 are responsible for many such cases of inherited AD (3.Hardy J.

PS1 is an integral membrane protein that is expressed in neurons throughout the brain wherein it is localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Two pathogenic mechanisms for PS1 mutations have been proposed. One mechanism involves altered proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein, resulting in increased production of neurotoxic forms of amyloid β-peptide (A) and decreased levels of the neuroprotective secreted form of amyloid precursor protein (5.Mattson M.P.

A second mechanism involves perturbed Ca2+ regulation, which results in enhanced elevations of intracellular Ca2+ levels under conditions of oxidative and excitotoxic stress (11.Guo Q. Furukawa K.

Hippocampal neurons from PS1 mutant knockin mice exhibit increased vulnerability to excitotoxicity, which is associated with enhanced elevations of intracellular Ca2+ levels (13.Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ca2+ imaging analyses (15.Begley J.G. Duan W. Duff K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1030-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and electrophysiological studies (16.Parent A. Linden D.J. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reveal excessive synaptic Ca2+ responses in transgenic mice expressing mutant PS1. ER contains two main types of Ca2+ release channels, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R, ∼300 kDa) and the ryanodine receptors (RyR,∼565 kDa), each represented by three different isoforms with similar structural properties (17.Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). These tetrameric channels display distinct but overlapping tissue distribution and may co-exist in the same cell in which they are modulated by different second messengers. IP3Rs (types I, II, and III) are activated upon binding of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, generated by phospholipase C-mediated polyphosphoinostide breakdown following cell surface receptor activation. In neuronal cells, RyR are activated via the classical Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism following Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane through voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. Three RyR subtypes, encoded by different genes, were originally identified in skeletal muscle (type 1 RyR), heart (type 2 RyR), and brain (type 3 RyR). Within the brain, levels of IP3R are highest in cerebellar Purkinje cells and CA1 hippocampal neurons, whereas RyRs are present at particularly high levels in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (18.Sharp A.H. McPherson P.S. Dawson T.M. Aoki C. Campbell K.P. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3051-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Padua R.A. Nagy J.I. Geiger J.D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 298: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). IP3Rs and RyRs have been extensively studied for their roles in the generation of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and Ca2+ waves that convey information required for many vital cellular functions (20.Friel D.D. Ciba Found. Symp. 1995; 188: 210-223PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports implicate IP3R- and RyR-mediated Ca2+release from ER in apoptotic signaling and induction in lymphocytes (21.Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M. Li S.H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 22.Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ca2+ release from ER can promote neuronal excitotoxicity and apoptosis, as indicated by the ability of blockers of ER Ca2+ release to protect neurons against cell death induced by glutamate (24.Frandsen A. Schousboe A. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1075-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and amyloid β-peptide (12.Guo G. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined possible mechanisms by which FAD-linked mutations in PS1 disrupt cellular calcium homeostasis and endanger neurons. We show that levels of type 3 RyR mRNA and protein are increased in PC12 cell clones stably expressing mutant PS1 and in brain tissue from PS1 knockin mice expressing mutant PS1 at normal levels. The increased level of RyR is associated with enhanced Ca2+ responses to caffeine and increased neuronal vulnerability to excitotoxicity and apoptosis. The targeting strategy used to generate PS1 mutant knockin mice is detailed elsewhere (13.Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 × 129/Sv background. Previous studies have characterized these mice, showing that the knockin mice express mutant PS1 at normal levels. PS1 mutant mice have no overt developmental abnormalities, but do exhibit increased levels of Aβ1–42 in brain tissue and increased vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to apoptosis and excitotoxicity (13.Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 14.Guo Q. Sebastian L. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Glazner G.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4125-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cultures of dissociated cortical cells were prepared from embryonic day 18 wild-type and homozygous PS1M146V knockin mouse pups using methods similar to those described previously (13.Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices were removed and incubated for 15 min in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced saline solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.2% trypsin. Cells were dissociated by trituration and plated into polyethyleneimine-coated plastic or glass-bottom culture dishes containing minimum essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 20 mm KCl, 10 mmsodium bicarbonate, and 1 mm Hepes (pH 7.2). Following cell attachment (3–6 h after plating), the culture medium was replaced with neurobasal medium with B27 supplements (Life Technologies, Inc.). Experiments were performed in 6–8-day-old cultures; greater than 90% of the cells in the cultures were neurons, and the remaining cells were astroctyes as judged by cell morphology and immunostaining with antibodies against neurofilaments and glial fibrillary acidic protein. PC12 cell lines stably overexpressing human wild-type PS1 or mutant PS1 (L286V or M146V mutations), and a control clone transfected with empty vector were established using methods described in our previous studies (11.Guo Q. Furukawa K. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Xie J. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. NeuroReport. 1996; 8: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 12.Guo G. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2 atmosphere) in RPMI medium supplemented 10% with heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For experiments, cells were subcultured into 35- or 60-mm polyethyleneimine-coated culture dishes. Amyloid β-peptide 25–35 (Bachem, Torrance, CA) was prepared as a 1 mm stock in water 2 h prior to use. Caffeine was prepared as a concentrated stock in Locke's buffer. The methods for quantification of neuron survival (apoptosis and necrosis) were described previously (25.Mattson M.P. Barger S.W. Begley J.G. Mark R.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 187-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26.Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For assessment of cell death by apoptosis, cells were fixed and stained with the fluorescent DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Neurons with condensed and fragmented nuclear DNA were considered apoptotic. For assessment of secondary necrosis, live cells were stained with trypan blue (Sigma); neurons that took up the dye were considered necrotic. For morphological evaluation of cell survival in primary hippocampal neurons, the same microscope fields of neurons were photographed prior to, and at designated time points following, exposure to treatments. Neurons with fragmented neurites and a crenated cell body were considered nonviable. Total RNA was purified from approximately 10 × 106 cells from transfected PC12 cell lines or approximately 50 mg (wet weight) of hippocampus or cerebellum dissected from wild type and PS1M146V knockin mice using a SNAP isolation protocol (Invitrogen, CA). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA according to the procedures outlined by the manufacturer (First Strand Synthesis Kit; PharMingen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Hot-start PCR amplification of 2 μl of cDNA was performed using hot wax beads (Invitrogen) and specific primers for the RyR3 receptor (forward 5′-GGC GCT GCG GAA GAC CTG CAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCC GGG CCG AAG CAC TC-3′) that yielded a 699-base pair product or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific primers that yielded a 343-base pair product (27.Anderson C.M. Xiong W. Geiger J.D. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Parkinson F.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). PCR conditions were 25 cycles at 95 °C for denaturation (60 s), 53 °C for annealing (60 s), and 72 °C for extension (60 s). Linear amplification of PCR products was determined as described previously (28.Mayne M. Shepel P.N. Jiang Y. Geiger J.D. Power C. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 633-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (1.3%), transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane under alkaline conditions, and probed using a randomly labeled [32P]dCTP nested RyR3 PCR product generated from the RyR3 PCR product described above (forward 5′-AAT CCG CTC CCT CCT CAG TGT CAG-3′ and reverse 5′-AAC GGC AGC AGC TAG CAA CCA TC-3′ that yielded a 218-base pair product using identical PCR conditions outlined above) or human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (28.Mayne M. Shepel P.N. Jiang Y. Geiger J.D. Power C. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 45: 633-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Densitometric analyses of RT-PCR products were performed using NIH Image software (version 1.60). Aliquots of cell lysates or brain homogenates containing 300 μg of protein were incubated with rabbit anti-PS1 (12.Guo G. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or mouse monoclonal anti-RyR (Affinity Bioreagents) antibodies in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6). Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated with immobilized protein A (for anti-PS1 antibody) or G (for anti-RyR antibody), washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer, and solubilized by heating in Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 4 min. The solubilized proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 4–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. After blocking with 5% milk and a 1-h incubation in the presence of primary anti-PS1 and anti-RyR antibodies, the nitrocellulose sheet was further processed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and a chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PS1 antibody was an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody, which was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the loop region (amino acids 331–345) of human PS1. This antibody has been shown in immunoblotting analysis to recognize both the full length wild-type and mutant PS1 proteins, as well as their N- and C-terminal derivatives (PS1-NTF and -CTF) in neural cell lysates (12.Guo G. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, membranes permeabilized by exposure for 5 min to 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and placed in blocking serum (5% horse or goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline). Cells were then exposed to primary antibodies (1:100 dilution of rabbit polyclonal PS1 antibody and 1:1000 dilution of RyR antibody) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation for 1 h with a mixture of Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit and fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Vector). Images of immunofluorescence were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (dual wavelength scan) with a 60× oil immersion objective. Anaglyphs showing sites of colocalization of immunoreactivities were generated using Imagespace software (Molecular Dynamics). Intracellular free calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) were quantified by fluorescence ratio imaging of the Ca2+ indicator dye fura-2 using methods described previously (13.Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 25.Mattson M.P. Barger S.W. Begley J.G. Mark R.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 187-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with the acetoxymethylester form of fura-2 (30-min incubation in the presence of 10 μm fura-2) and imaged using a Zeiss AttoFluor system with a 40× oil objective. The average [Ca2+]i in individual neuronal cell bodies was determined from the ratio of the fluorescence emissions obtained using two different excitation wavelengths (334 and 380 nm). The system was calibrated with solutions containing either no Ca2+ or a saturating level of Ca2+ (1 mm) using the formula: [Ca2+]i =K d[(R −R min)/(R max −R)](Fo /Fs). Because PS1 is localized primarily in ER and ER Ca2+ homeostasis is altered in PC12 cells overexpressing mutant PS1 (11.Guo Q. Furukawa K. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Xie J. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. NeuroReport. 1996; 8: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether neurons expressing mutant PS1 exhibit alterations in levels of proteins that regulate ER Ca2+ release. Levels of mRNA encoding the type 3 RyR, assessed using RT-PCR analysis, were increased 2–3-fold in PC12 cell clones overexpressing either the L286V mutation or the M146V mutation compared with clones overexpressing wild-type PS1 and untransfected and vector-transfected control clones (Fig.1 A). We next measured levels of RyR type 3 mRNA in tissue from hippocampus and cerebellum of PS1 mutant knockin and wild-type mice. Levels of type 3 RyR mRNA were increased 4-fold in hippocampus of PS1 mutant knockin mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 1 B). A similar overall increase in RyR type 3 mRNA level was observed in cerebellar tissue from PS1 mutant mice, although there was considerable variability in levels of RyR3 mRNA among mice (Fig. 1 B). Western blot analysis showed that levels of RyR type 3 protein were increased 7–10-fold in PC12 cell clones overexpressing mutant PS1 compared with clones overexpressing wild-type PS1 and vector-transfected control clones (Fig. 1 C). Similarly, RyR type 3 protein levels were increased approximately 5–8-fold in hippocampal tissue from PS1 mutant knockin mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 1 C). As expected, levels of RyR were increased in microsomes from PS1 mutant knockin mice compared with microsomes from wild-type mice (Fig. 1 C). Although PS1 has been localized to ER in several different cell types including neurons, it is not known whether PS1 and RyR are co-localized in the same ER pools. Double-labeling confocal analysis of PC12 cells (Fig.2 A) and cultured cortical neurons (data not shown) using a polyclonal antibody against PS1 and a monoclonal antibody against the RyR revealed that essentially all detectable RyR-positive compartments were also PS1-positive. However, PS1 immunoreactivity was not limited to RyR-containing ER, as considerable PS1 immunoreactivity was present elsewhere in the cells. Co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed on homogenates of PC12 clones overexpressing mutant or wild-type PS1 and control clones, and on homogenates of brain tissue from wild-type and homozygous PS1 mutant mice. When immunoprecipitation was performed using a RyR antibody, three PS1 immunoreactive bands were detected on the immunoblot with molecular sizes consistent with full-length (46 kDa) and N- and C-terminal fragments of PS1 (Fig. 2 B). The relative amounts of PS1 protein present in the RyR immunoprecipitates were greater in the PC12 cell clones overexpressing either wild-type or mutant PS1 compared with the control PC12 clones, and were not different in brain tissue from PS1 mutant mice and wild-type mice, suggesting that AD-linked mutations do not alter the interaction of PS1 with RyR. Immunoprecipitation of PC12 cell lysates using the PS1 antibody identified a high molecular mass protein (>500 kDa) that immunoreacted with the RyR antibody and, again, there was no obvious difference in samples from cells expressing wild-type and mutant PS1 (Fig.2 B). In order to determine the functional consequences of increased levels of RyR in neurons expressing mutant PS1, we measured intracellular Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) following exposure to caffeine, an agent that induces Ca2+release from ryanodine-sensitive stores, in PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons expressing mutant or wild-type PS1. The elevation of [Ca2+] following exposure to caffeine was markedly increased in PC12 cells overexpressing either the L286V or M146V mutations (Fig. 3, A andC). Calcium responses to caffeine were also significantly increased in PC12 clones overexpressing wild-type PS1, but the magnitude of the increase was less than in clones overexpressing mutant PS1. In order to determine whether PS1 mutations had similar effects on Ca2+ release from caffeine-sensitive stores in primary neurons, we established primary cortical cultures from embryonic PS1 mutant knockin mice and wild-type mice. The Ca2+ response to caffeine was significantly greater in cortical neurons expressing mutant PS1 compared with neurons expressing wild-type PS1 (Fig. 3,B and D). Because PS1 protein is expressed at normal levels in the PS1 mutant knockin mice (13.Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 14.Guo Q. Sebastian L. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Glazner G.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4125-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the present findings directly demonstrate that increased levels of RyR and enhanced Ca2+ release are a consequence of PS1 mutations under physiological conditions. As reported previously (11.Guo Q. Furukawa K. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Xie J. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. NeuroReport. 1996; 8: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), we found that PC12 cells overexpressing mutant PS1 were more vulnerable to apoptosis induced by Aβ25–35 compared with cells overexpressing wild-type PS1 and vector-transfected cells (Fig.4 A). Exposure of vector-transfected PC12 cells to 30 mm caffeine resulted in little or no apoptosis during 12- and 24-h exposure periods (Fig.4 A). In contrast, PC12 cells overexpressing mutant PS1, and to a lesser extent cells overexpressing wild-type PS1, exhibited greatly increased sensitivity to caffeine-induced apoptosis. Moreover, caffeine cotreatment greatly exacerbated Aβ25–35-induced apoptosis, which was particularly pronounced in cells expressing mutant PS1 (Fig. 4 A). As another measure of cell death, we exposed cultures to caffeine and Aβ25–35 alone, or in combination, and then stained cells 24 h later (a time point when many apoptotic cells have undergone secondary necrosis) with trypan blue. We found that significantly more cells were unable to exclude the dye trypan blue in cultures of cells expressing mutant PS1 compared with vector-transfected control cells and cells overexpressing wild-type PS1 (Fig. 4 B). We next exposed primary cortical neurons from wild-type and PS1 mutant knockin mice to caffeine, Aβ25–35, or the combination of caffeine and Aβ25–35. Neuron survival in each culture, assessed by morphological criteria, was quantified 2, 4, 8, and 12 h later. Additional cultures were stained with Hoechst dye at the 4- and 8-h post-treatment time points, and neurons with apoptotic nuclei were quantified. Neurons expressing mutant PS1 were significantly more vulnerable to apoptosis induced by caffeine alone, Aβ25–35 alone, and the combination of caffeine plus Aβ25–35 compared with wild-type neurons (Fig. 4, C and D). We found that levels of type 3 RyR are greatly increased in PC12 cells overexpressing mutant human PS1, and in brain tissue in knockin mice that express mutant PS1 at normal levels. Calcium imaging studies showed that PC12 cells and cortical neurons expressing mutant PS1 exhibit increased calcium responses to caffeine compared with cells expressing wild-type PS1. These findings suggest that one consequence of PS1 mutations is to increase levels of RyR in neurons resulting in increased Ca2+ release following cell stimulation. We had previously shown that cells expressing mutant PS1 also release more Ca2+ in response to thapsigargin, an agent that should deplete essentially all ER Ca2+ pools (11.Guo Q. Furukawa K. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Xie J. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. NeuroReport. 1996; 8: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 12.Guo G. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that there may also be an increase in the total pool of Ca2+ available for release. The enhanced release of Ca2+ from caffeine-sensitive stores in PC12 cells and cortical neurons expressing mutant PS1 was associated with greatly increased vulnerability of the cells to Aβ25–35- and caffeine-induced cell death. Increased levels of RyR may therefore explain previous findings showing that neurons expressing mutant PS1 are more vulnerable to excitotoxicity (13.Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (14.Guo Q. Sebastian L. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Glazner G.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4125-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The ability of dantrolene, a drug known to block RyR, to protect cells expressing mutant PS1 against apoptosis (12.Guo G. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is consistent with a pivotal role for Ca2+ release through RyR in the pathogenic mechanism of PS1 mutations. Consistent with the latter interpretation, previous studies have shown that dantrolene can protect cultured neurons against metabolic and excitotoxic insults (24.Frandsen A. Schousboe A. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1075-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Administration of dantrolene to neonatal brain slice immediately following an ischemia-like insult significantly enhanced cellular recovery as indicated by reduced energy depletion and suppression of poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase activation (29.Tasker R.C. Sahota S.K. Cotter F.E. Williams S.R. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1998; 18: 1346-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Wei and Perry (30.Wei H. Perry D.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2390-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) showed that intravenous administration of dantrolene to gerbils immediately following transient global forebrain ischemia resulted in a significant decrease in loss of CA1 hippocampal neurons. In the same model Zhanget al. (31.Zhang L. Andou Y. Masuda S. Mitani A. Kataoka K. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 158: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) reported a significant decrease in damage to CA1 neurons in gerbils receiving an intraventricular bolus of dantrolene 30 min following reperfusion. Release of Ca2+ through RyR may play a general role in apoptosis in many different cell types including non-neuronal cells. As evidence, caffeine sensitizes Chinese hamster cells to apoptosis induced by ultraviolet irradiation (32.Hagan M.P. Hopcia K.L. Sylvester F.C. Held K.D. Radiat. Res. 1997; 147: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and potentiates apoptosis of HeLa cells induced by the DNA-damaging agent etoposide (33.Lock R.B. Galperina O.V. Feldhoff R.C. Rhodes L.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4933-4939PubMed Google Scholar). Our co-immunoprecipitation studies using PS1 and RyR antibodies suggest that PS1 and RyR protein(s) directly interact. The colocalization of PS1 and RyR, documented in our double-label confocal analysis are consistent with PS1 and RyR being present in the same ER population. Although there were no obvious differences in the abilities of wild-type and mutant PS1 to bind to RyR protein, the immunoprecipitation-Western blot analyses employed in the present study did not allow a quantitative determination as to whether the PS1 mutation affects binding to RyR. Further work will be needed to determine whether wild-type and mutant PS1 differentially modulate RyR function or whether this interaction plays a role in increasing levels of RyR. The possibility that alterations in RyR and calcium signaling similar to those documented in neurons from PS1 mutant mice may also occur in AD patients is suggested by the recent work of Kelliher and co-workers (34.Kelliher M. Fastbom J. Cowburn R.F. Bonkale W. Ohm T.G. Ravid R. Sorrentino V. O'Neill C. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). They showed that levels of radiolabeled ryanodine binding were significantly increased in subiculum and region CA1 of hippocampus in brain sections from AD patients in cases with early stage neurofibrillary pathology compared with brain sections from neurologically normal age-matched control patients. On the other hand, levels of ryanodine binding were significantly decreased in subiculum and region CA1 of hippocampus from late stage AD patients. The latter findings therefore suggest that increases in levels of RyR may precede neuronal degeneration in vulnerable neuronal populations in AD. Neurodegenerative disorders other than AD may also involve perturbed regulation of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Gaucher disease is a glyocosphingolipid lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficit of glucocerebrosidase and is characterized by severe loss of neurons in the central nervous system (35.Erikson A. Bembi B. Schiffmann R. Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1997; 10: 711-723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with an inhibitor of glucocerebrosidase results in an increase in the caffeine-sensitive ER Ca2+ pool and increased Ca2+ responses to glutamate (36.Korkotian E.

The molecular mechanism by which mutations in PS1 increase RyR expression remains to be determined. One possibility is that increased reactive oxygen species and calcium, which are key consequences of PS1 mutation (12.Guo G. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J.

Further studies will be needed to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms involved in the expression and function of RyR calcium release channel in neurons and how these can be therapeutically modulated in order to ameliorate the adverse action of mutant PS1 on calcium homeostasis.

We show that these episodes were caused by large forest fires in Canada. Over a period of 2 weeks, these natural emissions increased CO concentrations in the southeastern United States as well as along the eastern seaboard, a region with one of the world's highest rates of anthropogenic emissions. Within the forest fire plumes, there were also high concentrations of ozone, volatile organic compounds, and aerosols. These results suggest that the impact of boreal forest fire emissions on air quality in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, where anthropogenic pollutant sources have been considered predominant, needs to be reevaluated."

Several of these mechanisms result from the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that form a substantial fraction of these genomes (1.Charlesworth B. Sniegowski P. Stephan W. Nature. 1994; 371: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar), as well as from the existence, in the great majority of genes coding for proteins, of exonic and intronic sequences (2.Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Such a genomic organization accounts for several kinds of DNA rearrangements (1.Charlesworth B. Sniegowski P. Stephan W. Nature. 1994; 371: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 3.Kazazian Jr., H.H. Moran J.V. Nat.

The latter corresponds to the precise excision of introns from nascent transcripts followed by the ligation of exons. Alternative splicing of primary transcripts represents a critical step in the regulation of gene expression, generating different mature mRNAs and thus different proteins from one gene (5.Maniatis T. Science. 1991; 251: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This mechanism can be controlled in a cell type-specific manner, so that, depending on the nature and/or the developmental stages of the tissues examined, different mature mRNA species can be expressed; other alternative splice events appear to be constitutive, with different mRNA isoforms coexisting at constant ratios within the same cells (4.Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar).The description of two different mature growth hormone receptor (GHR)1 transcripts is a particularly attractive example of an unusual phenomenon described as the result of an alternative splice event that, in humans, has been documented as being either constitutive or controlled in a cell type-specific manner (6.Godowski P.J.

The GHR protein is an integral cell membrane molecule that, in humans, contains 638 residues (including a membrane signal peptide of 18 residues); it consists of an extracellular hormone-binding domain of 246 amino acids, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain of 350 residues (13.Leung D.W.

The critical importance of the receptor in the control of body growth was clearly demonstrated by the description of numerous GHR mutations in patients with Laron syndrome, a severe growth hormone-resistant short stature condition transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait (17.Amselem S. Sobrier M.L. Dastot F. Duquesnoy P. Duriez B. Goossens M. Baillieres Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 10: 353-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The human GHR gene is a single copy gene that spans 90 kb of the 5p13-p12 chromosomal region (6.Godowski P.J. Leung D.W. Meacham L.R. Galgani J.P. Hellmiss R. Keret R. Rotwein P.S. Parks J.S. Laron Z. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cytogenet Cell Genet. 1989; 50: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It contains nine coding exons (numbered 2–10) and several untranslated exons: exon 2 codes for the signal peptide, exons 3–7 encode the extracellular domain, exon 8 codes the transmembrane domain, and exons 9 and 10 code the cytoplasmic domain (6.Godowski P.J. Leung D.W. Meacham L.R. Galgani J.P. Hellmiss R. Keret R. Rotwein P.S. Parks J.S. Laron Z. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8083-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The existence of several GHR cDNA clones that diverge within the coding region was first reported by Godowski et al. (6.Godowski P.J. Leung D.W. Meacham L.R. Galgani J.P. Hellmiss R. Keret R. Rotwein P.S. Parks J.S. Laron Z. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8083-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In one of these clones, the exon 3 sequence (consisting of 66 nucleotides) was missing, in keeping with an alternative splice event leading to either the retention or the exclusion of exon 3, corresponding to the full-length GHR isoform (GHRfl) or the exon 3-deleted isoform (GHRd3), respectively. Subsequent investigations have yielded contradictory results. Both isoforms have been detected in several human tissues, expressed either independently or simultaneously. In the very first studies, a tissue-specific expression pattern of GHRfl and GHRd3 was documented (7.Urbanek M. MacLeod J.N. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8.Sobrier M.L. Duquesnoy P. Duriez B. Amselem S. Goossens M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), with GHRd3 mainly expressed in the placental villi (7.Urbanek M. MacLeod J.N. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, other studies rather indicated that the expression of these two GHR isoforms was specific for each individual; different tissues obtained from the same individual showed the same expression pattern (10.Wickelgren R.B. Landin K.L. Ohlsson C. Carlsson L.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2154-2157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Zogopoulos G. Figueiredo R. Jenab A. Ali Z. Lefebvre Y. Goodyer C.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 775-782PubMed Google Scholar). This individual-specific expression pattern of GHRfl and GHRd3 was found to be maintained in long term cultures of fetal dermal fibroblasts (11.Zogopoulos G. Figueiredo R. Jenab A. Ali Z. Lefebvre Y. Goodyer C.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 775-782PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a cross-sectional study of a large number of human fetal and postnatal tissues also suggested that the expression pattern of GHRfl and GHRd3 may be developmentally regulated (11.Zogopoulos G. Figueiredo R. Jenab A. Ali Z. Lefebvre Y. Goodyer C.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 775-782PubMed Google Scholar). Another study showed that this alternative splice event resulted from an unusual genetic polymorphism that is transmitted as a Mendelian trait and that significantly alters splicing (12.Stallings-Mann M.L. Ludwiczak R.L. Klinger K.W. Rottman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12394-12399Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally, the splicing of exon 3, whose functional consequences are poorly understood (8.Sobrier M.L. Duquesnoy P. Duriez B. Amselem S. Goossens M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19.Urbanek M. Russell J.E. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19025-19032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also suggested to be species-specific, because in mice the GHRfl transcript is the only isoform detected (20.Barnard R. Southard J.N. Edens A. Talamantes F. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1474-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).To decipher the molecular basis of this unusual trait in humans, the GHR genomic sequences surrounding exon 3 were studied in individuals expressing GHRfl, GHRd3, or both isoforms. In addition, in an attempt to provide an explanation for such species differences in the expression of GHRd3 and GHRfl, similar studies were performed in various species.DISCUSSIONWe have described a new molecular mechanism to account for the physiological expression, in humans, of two transcripts that differ by the skipping of a coding exon. This phenomenon, which mimics alternative splicing, results from a homologous recombination event between retroviral sequences that flank the skipped exon. To our knowledge, retroelement-induced effects of this kind have not been reported before. As shown in this study focused on the analysis of the GHR locus, the species specificity of these retroelements most likely accounts for the documented species differences in the expression pattern of GHR isoforms.It is well established that in humans GHR transcripts are present in two isoforms that differ by the retention or exclusion of exon 3, whereas in mice the GHRfl isoform is solely expressed. We have demonstrated that in humans the GHRd3 isoform is actually transcribed from a GHR allele that carries a 2.7-kb genomic deletion spanning exon 3, as compared with GHR alleles expressing GHRfl isoforms. More precisely, we observed the association of exon 3 with two flanking retroelements in the genomic DNA samples from individuals who solely express GHRfl, whereas DNA samples from individuals who express GHRd3 contain only a single retroelement without exon 3. These observations led us to assume that the 2.7-kb size difference documented between the GHRd3 and GHRfl alleles is due to a deletion that occurred on an ancestral GHRfl allele. As shown in the model depicted in Fig.3, an intrachromosomal recombination event most likely accounts for the generation of a GHRd3 allele from a GHRfl template. Interchromosomal recombination between misaligned GHRfl alleles was put aside as the basis for the exon 3 deletion; indeed, such an event would also generate a reciprocal chromosome with an exon 3 duplication, this gene rearrangement having never been detected in the population tested. Sequence analysis of 24 deleted alleles supports the existence of a unique recombination breakpoint located within the first 13 bases of the 251-bp repeated element (Fig. 3). In this model, the excision of exon 3 and its flanking sequences results from a homologous recombination event between the two retroelements located on the same GHRfl allele.The identification of such an alternative splice mimicry clears up several as yet unexplained phenomena. First, depending on the different studies performed in humans since 1992 (7.Urbanek M. MacLeod J.N. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8.Sobrier M.L. Duquesnoy P. Duriez B. Amselem S. Goossens M.

A. 1996; 93: 12394-12399Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the expression pattern of GHRfl and GHRd3 has been considered to be tissue-, developmentally, and/or individual-specific; in the light of the above-described mechanism underlying GHRfl and GHRd3 expression, such conflicting results are now easily reconcilable. Second, our results provide a rational explanation for the Mendelian mode of inheritance of GHRfl and GHRd3 expression patterns (12.Stallings-Mann M.L. Ludwiczak R.L. Klinger K.W. Rottman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12394-12399Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Third, these findings also provide a clear-cut explanation for the deletion of nonconsecutive exons involving exons 3, 5, and 6 in patients with Laron syndrome (6.Godowski P.J. Leung D.W. Meacham L.R. Galgani J.P. Hellmiss R. Keret R. Rotwein P.S. Parks J.S. Laron Z. Wood W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8083-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar); in fact, the latter would rather be the product of a deletion of the consecutive exons 5 and 6 on a GHRd3 allele. However, the amplification of exon 3 in DNA samples from human tissues expressing the GHRd3 transcripts only (11.Zogopoulos G. Figueiredo R. Jenab A. Ali Z. Lefebvre Y. Goodyer C.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 775-782PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Stallings-Mann M.L. Ludwiczak R.L. Klinger K.W. Rottman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12394-12399Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) appears not to be consistent with the discovery of such a frequent genomic deletion of this exon found in 75 of the 300 GHR alleles of our population sample.To determine the extent to which other species are able to generate GHRd3 transcripts by means of a mechanism identical to that identified in humans, we investigated the presence of these sequences at the GHR-exon 3 locus from various primates. Because seven species from hominoid to Old World monkeys carry the same solo LTR at the GHR locus upstream from exon 3, we conclude that this LTR sequence derives from a HERV-P proviral insertion that occurred in the germ line of a common ancestor of the Old World lineages; in addition, because New World monkeys and prosimii do not possess this solo LTR, we were able to accurately date this insertion after thePlatyrrhini/Catarrhini split, thus about 25 million years ago (26.Johnson W.E. Coffin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10254-10260Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27.Goodman M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 31-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the retroelement located downstream of exon 3 in the human species (i.e. the 251-bp-long 3′ repeat) is present at the same locus only in gorillas and chimpanzees, thereby demonstrating the recent origin of this integration event that occurred after the divergence of Pongina and Hominina(about 7 million years ago) (27.Goodman M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 31-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the 3′ repeat derives from the 5′ repeat by means of a duplication event. First, these highly homologous sequences share identical 5′ direct and inverted repeats. In addition, not only is the 3′ repeat composed of a fragment of the HERV-P retroviral sequence, but it also contains a perfect 40-bp-long copy of the MER4-type sequence belonging to the 5′ repeat that, by itself, is incapable of autonomous retrotransposition. Furthermore, the low percentage of sequence change between the 5′ and 3′ repeats within each species of the hominina subtribe (1.2–2.0%) is consistent with the reference date of the divergence of Pongina and Hominina (27.Goodman M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 31-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is noteworthy that the 3′ end of the repeated elements contains a 8-bp-long sequence that is also present in the GHR gene of all primate species studied so far (data not shown); it is therefore tempting to speculate that this 8-bp-long cellular sequence, which is located downstream of exon 3 at a position corresponding precisely to the insertion site of the 3′ repeat, may have favored the partial duplication of the 5′ repeat. Examination of GHRd3 alleles in the human species led to the identification of a single retroelement that is 100% identical to the 3′ repeat found on GHRfl alleles (Fig. 3); this result, which indicates the absence of de novo mutation, is consistent with a homologous recombination event that occurred very recently during primate evolution. Taken together, these data are consistent with the existence of the sole GHRfl allele in all primate species except Hominina. Because the three species of theHominina subtribe carry both the 5′ and 3′ repeats, one cannot rule out the possibility that in gorillas and chimpanzees, GHRd3 alleles could occur by means of a similar homologous recombination event; this could be addressed by the analysis of DNA samples from a large number of unrelated gorillas and chimpanzees.A model that accounts for this sequence of events during molecular evolution of the GHR locus is presented in Fig.4. The proposed events include proviral insertions leading to the MER49 and MaLR sequences prior to the HERV-P proviral insertion upstream from exon 3, which occurred after the emergence of New World monkeys. In this model, the latter event is followed by (i) the generation of a HERV-P solo LTR through a homologous recombination event between the 5′ and 3′ LTRs of the proviral sequence, (ii) the partial duplication of the solo LTR within the 3′-flanking region of exon 3, after the divergence ofPongina and Hominina, and (iii) the homologous recombination between the two repeated elements, which occurred recently, at least in the human species, and led to the GHRd3 allele. The GHR gene exists in species from distinct orders, such asPrimates, Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla,Scandentia and Rodentia (28.Rand-Weaver M. Kaweauchi H. Ono M. Schreibman M. Scanes C. Pang P. Title. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 13-42Google Scholar). In mice, the GHRfl transcript is the only isoform detected (20.Barnard R. Southard J.N. Edens A. Talamantes F. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1474-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and remarkably, genomic DNA does not hybridize to HERV-P sequences, as judged by Southern blotting experiments (Ref. 24.Harada F. Tsukada N. Kato N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9153-9162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, and data not shown); this latter finding therefore further supports our molecular model inferring a key role of these sequences of retroviral origin in the genesis of GHRd3 transcripts. Such a species-specific GHR structural difference, which underlies the existence of the sole GHRfl allele in several species, relates to the evolutionary differences of the mechanisms by which the GHR gene gives rise to a soluble growth hormone-binding protein (29.Dastot F. Sobrier M.L. Duquesnoy P. Duriez B. Goossens M. Amselem S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,30.Dastot F. Duquesnoy P. Sobrier M.L. Goossens M. Amselem S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 137: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), thereby making this gene a particularly interesting model to investigate its encoded isoforms through evolution.Figure 4Schematic representation of the proposed phylogenetic model accounting for the structure of the GHR-exon 3 locus in various primate species.

Wong C. Youssoufian H. Scott A.F. Phillips D.G. Antonarakis S.E. Nature. 1988; 332: 164-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), whereas it was generally believed that insertions into noncoding regions would have little or no effect on gene expression. This view, however, has been challenged by the identification of mammalian sequences of retroviral origin that are associated with a promoter activity (32.Ting C.N. Rosenberg M.P. Snow C.M. Samuelson L.C. Meisler M.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 33.Schulte A.M. Lai S. Kurtz A. Czubayko F. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

S. A. 1994; 91: 7717-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In contrast with these situations, the present study reveals the existence of a retrovirus-mediated mechanism underlying the physiological expression, in humans, of two transcripts that differ by the skipping of a single coding exon. This as yet unknown phenomenon, which mimics alternative splicing and accounts for protein diversity between and within species, may represent one of the mechanisms underlying the expression of structurally related isoforms at other loci. There is a variety of well documented mechanisms underlying the complexity and the diversity of the structure and regulation of eukaryotic nuclear genes during evolution. Several of these mechanisms result from the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that form a substantial fraction of these genomes (1.Charlesworth B. Sniegowski P. Stephan W. Nature. 1994; 371: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar), as well as from the existence, in the great majority of genes coding for proteins, of exonic and intronic sequences (2.Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Such a genomic organization accounts for several kinds of DNA rearrangements (1.Charlesworth B. Sniegowski P. Stephan W. Nature. 1994; 371: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 3.Kazazian Jr., H.H. Moran J.V. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and for mRNA splicing (4.Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The latter corresponds to the precise excision of introns from nascent transcripts followed by the ligation of exons. Alternative splicing of primary transcripts represents a critical step in the regulation of gene expression, generating different mature mRNAs and thus different proteins from one gene (5.Maniatis T. Science. 1991; 251: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This mechanism can be controlled in a cell type-specific manner, so that, depending on the nature and/or the developmental stages of the tissues examined, different mature mRNA species can be expressed; other alternative splice events appear to be constitutive, with different mRNA isoforms coexisting at constant ratios within the same cells (4.Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The description of two different mature growth hormone receptor (GHR)1 transcripts is a particularly attractive example of an unusual phenomenon described as the result of an alternative splice event that, in humans, has been documented as being either constitutive or controlled in a cell type-specific manner (6.Godowski P.J.

The GHR protein is an integral cell membrane molecule that, in humans, contains 638 residues (including a membrane signal peptide of 18 residues); it consists of an extracellular hormone-binding domain of 246 amino acids, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain of 350 residues (13.Leung D.W.

To elucidate p75NTR-mediated signal transduction, we screened p75NTR-associated proteins by a yeast two-hybrid system. We identified one positive clone and named NADE (p75NTR-associated cell deathexecutor). Mouse NADE has marked homology to the human HGR74 protein. NADE specifically binds to the cell-death domain of p75NTR. Co-expression of NADE and p75NTR induced caspase-2 and caspase-3 activities and the fragmentation of nuclear DNA in 293T cells. However, in the absence of p75NTR, NADE failed to induce apoptosis, suggesting that NADE expression is necessary but insufficient for p75NTR-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, p75NTR/NADE-induced cell death was dependent on NGF but not BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4/5, and the recruitment of NADE to p75NTR (intracellular domain) was dose-dependent. We obtained similar results from PC12 cells, nnr5 cells, and oligodendrocytes.

However, none of them had a direct effect on NGF-dependent apoptosis. To further identify p75NTR (ICD)-binding proteins, we used rat p75NTR (ICD) as a target to screen mouse cDNA libraries by a yeast two-hybrid system. Here we report the identification of the p75NTR-associated cell deathexecutor, NADE. mNADE was isolated by using a yeast two-hybrid system as described previously (13.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar); the cytosolic domain of p75NTR cDNA (amino acids 338–396) was used as a target. Briefly, we introduced mouse embryo pVP16 cDNA libraries into the LexA/p75NTR-expressing cells by using a high efficiency LiOAc transformation method (14.Gietz D. Jean A.S. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). From a screen of 5 × 107transformants, we identified an initial set of 672 His+colonies. Using a β-galactosidase colorimetric assay (15.Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), we selected 181 clones as candidates for further analysis. One clone, which specifically reacted with the LexA/p75NTR, was selected and was named NADE. A full-length mNADE cDNA was cloned into pBluescript II KS(+) by inserting the partial NADE cDNA (nucleotides 7–524) and the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA end product. PCR was used to replace the stop codon and to add 5′ XhoI and 3′BamHI sites into the full-length NADE cDNA. pcDNA3.1/myc-His(−)A/mNADE was constructed by inserting a full-length mNADE cDNA into XhoI-BamHI-digested pcDNA3.1/myc-His(−)A (Invitrogen). Human NADE cDNA was amplified from a Jurkat T cell cDNA library; the product was then cloned into XhoI-BamHI-digested pcDNA3.1/myc-His(−)A. Expression plasmids for green fluorescence protein (GFP)-fused mNADE proteins were made as follows: GFP cDNA was PCR-amplified from pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH) by using the primer pair 5′-CTAGCTAGCATCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT-3′. The product was cloned intoNheI-XhoI-digested pcDNA 3.1/myc-His(−)A/mNADE.

PC12 and nnr5 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% calf serum. 293T cells (1.5 × 106 /per 100-mm dish) were transiently transfected with 20 μg of plasmid according to the calcium phosphate method in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. PC12 and nnr5 cells (4 × 106per 100-mm dish) were transiently transfected with 12 μg of plasmid by using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free DMEM containing 100 ng/ml NGF.

The supernatants were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 8 h by using 1 mg of anti-Myc antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose 4B. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-p75NTR polyclonal antibody or the anti-α-NADE polyclonal antibody. For PC12 cells, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF in serum-free DMEM, lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer at 4 °C for 15 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated by using 0.8 mg of anti-rat p75NTR monoclonal antibody (Chemicon) or anti-α-NADE polyclonal antibody, which were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-rat p75NTR polyclonal antibody or the anti-α-NADE polyclonal antibody. TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to isolate 5 μg of total RNA from oligodendrocytes after treatment of 10 to 100 ng/ml NGF for 3 h. NADE mRNA was amplified by using the primer pair 5′-CATTCCCAACAGGCAGATG-3′ and 5′-GGCATAAGGCAGAATTCATC-3′. β-Actin was used as a control. The transfected cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and stained with 50 μg/ml DAPI. By using a fluorescence microscopy, the number of cells that had the nuclear morphology typical of apoptosis among at least 400 cells were counted in each sample. The MEBSTAIN Apoptosis Kit Direct (Medical & Biological Laboratories) was used for TUNEL assay (17.McGahon A.J. Martin S.J. Bissonnette R.P. Mahboubi A. Shi Y. Mogil R.J. Nishioka W.K. Green D.R.

Western blotting analysis detected the active forms of caspase-2, caspase-3, and PARP. For PC12 cells and nnr5, the caspase-3 assay was performed with a CPP32/caspase-3 Fluorometric Protease Assay Kit (Medical & Biological Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligodendrocytes were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 12 h. After incubation with the anti-O1 mouse monoclonal antibody, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 60 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% sodium citrate containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min on ice, and incubated with the anti-α-NADE antibody in PBS containing 0.5 m NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1% normal goat serum (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h. After several rinses with PBS, cells were incubated with the anti-rabbit IgG-FITC conjugate (Medical & Biological Laboratories) and anti-mouse IgG-Cy-5 conjugate in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. For the TUNEL assay, after incubation with the anti-O1 monoclonal antibody, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and processed by using the in situ detection kit for apoptosis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Medical & Biological Laboratory). After several rinses with PBS, cells were incubated with the anti-mouse IgG-Cy-5 conjugate in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. Glass coverslips were mounted in glycerin jelly, and the images of representative fields were captured on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Mouse NADE (mNADE) comprises 124 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 14,532 Da; this factor seems to be a hydrophilic and acidic protein (estimated pI = 5.97). Previously uncharacterized human gene HGR74 (18.Rapp G. Freudenstein J. Klaudiny J. Mucha J. Wempe F. Zimmer M. Scheit K.H. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed significant identity to mNADE (92.8%, except the histidine-asparagine-rich stretch (amino acid residues 36–48; Fig. 1 A)), being an obvious human homolog of NADE. NADE proteins in mouse, rat, and human have two consensus motifs, the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) (19.Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and two boxes for ubiquitination sequences (20.Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). Expression of mNADE mRNA (1.3 kilobases) was found highest in brain, heart, and lung, with lesser amounts in stomach, small intestine, and muscle and no expression in liver (data not shown). Interestingly, NADE protein was detected in PCNA and PC12 cells only after treatment with proteasome inhibitors ALLN, PSI, and MG132 for 3 h (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). These data imply that native NADE is modified by the ubiquitin conjugating system, thereby leading to subsequent protein degradation by proteasome. To investigate whether the NES sequence (19.Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) in NADE is used for protein transportation from nucleus to cytosol, subcellular localization analyses of GFP-NADE and GFP-NADE NES mutants (Leu-94 → Ala and Leu-97 → Ala) were performed in 293T cells. Wild type with intact NES localizes to cytoplasm (Fig. 1 C, middle left panel), but the NES mutants remain in nucleus (Fig. 1 C, bottom left panel). These data suggested that NADE protein can be exported from nucleus to cytosol and that a NADE associating protein may promote and regulate the functional interaction of NADE with p75NTR. To assess the interaction between mNADE and p75NTR, we first performedin vitro binding assays using GST fusion proteins (Fig.2 A and B). The mapping studies demonstrated that mNADE strongly binds to the cell death domain of p75NTR (ICD) (amino acids 338–396) which is identical among mouse, rat, and human sequence (Fig. 2 A). In addition, C-terminal portion of NADE (amino acids 81–106) is necessary for the interaction with p75NTR (ICD) (Fig. 2 B). To confirm in vivo interaction of NADE with p75NTR and its ligand dependence, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments withmyc-tagged mNADE/p75NTR co-transfected 293T cells. The results clearly showed that the recruitment of mNADE to p75NTR (ICD) was increased dose-dependently by NGF (Fig. 2 C). In addition, the co-immunoprecipitation assays under physiological conditions in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 and the human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cell lines confirmed the interaction of NADE with p75NTR (Fig.2 D and data not shown). Interestingly, two NADE bands (22 and 44 kDa) were detected in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. To investigate the functional role of mNADE, we tested ligand-dependent apoptosis by the interaction of mNADE with p75NTR in 293T cells. Using TUNEL assay, we detected ligand-dependent cell death in the presence of NGF, but not BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4/5 in co-transfected 293T cells (Fig.3 A). In addition, NGF-treated 293T and COS7 cells transfected with mNADE and p75NTR showed morphological changes and DNA fragmentation typical for apoptosis (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that NADE has an important role in NGF-induced cell death by transducing the signal downstream of p75NTR. Next, we evaluated NGF-dependent caspase activation in transfected 293T cells. By Western blotting analysis, we showed that caspase-2 and caspase-3 were processed to active forms only in 293T cells that were co-transfected with mNADE and p75NTR and treated with 100 ng/ml NGF (Fig. 3 B). Also under the same conditions, PARP was degraded (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that caspase-2 and caspase-3 are involved in NGF-induced cell death by p75NTR/NADE signal transduction pathway. We used PC12 cells (p75NTR+++, TrkA+) (21,22), PC12 nnr5 cells (p75NTR++, TrkA−; these cells lack the TrkA receptor) (23.Green S.H. Rydel R.E. Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and mature oligodendrocytes (p75NTR+++, TrkA−) (24.Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) to further study the physiological functions of NADE. Transiently transfected PC12 and nnr5 cells expressed NADE protein in the presence of NGF (Fig. 4 A, top panel). Both TUNEL assay and DAPI staining clearly showed that the transient transfection of mNADE to PC12 and nnr5 cells caused their NGF-dependent cell death (Fig. 4 A, middle paneland data not shown). In addition, caspase-3 was activated in both cell types (Fig. 4 A, bottom panel), suggesting that TrkA receptor does not markedly modulate p75NTR/NADE-mediated apoptosis. RT-PCR was used to examine the NGF-dependent induction of NADE expression in mature oligodendrocytes. The results clearly showed that NADE mRNA is induced in the presence but not in the absence of NGF (Fig. 4 B, top panel). Furthermore, NGF induced caspase-3 activation (Ref. 16.Gu C. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Srinivasan A. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 3043-3049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), implying a role for NADE in NGF-dependent p75NTR-mediated apoptosis (24.Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). To further characterize the NGF-dependent cell death of mature oligodendrocytes, confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used to detect the cells undergoing apoptosis. In NGF-treated cultures, 60% of mature oligodendrocytes were TUNEL-positive, but in control cultures, only 10% or less were TUNEL-positive. In addition, 70% of mature oligodendrocytes were stained by NADE antibodies in NGF-treated cultures, compared with 5% or less in control cultures. After NGF treatment for 12 h, both nuclear TUNEL-positive staining and NADE-positive staining could be observed in more than 50% of O1-positive mature oligodendrocytes by immunocytochemistry (Fig.4 B, bottom panels and data not shown). The signal cascade mediated by p75NTR has been enigmatic for a long time. Recent evidence suggest that p75NTR bifunctionally mediates signals to induce as well as inhibit apoptosis (25.Soilu-Hänninen M. Ekert P. Bucci T. Syroid D. Bartlett P.F. Kilpatrick T.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4828-4838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Bunone G. Mariotti A. Compagni A. Morandi E. Della Valle G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our results strongly support the hypothesis that NADE is a putative signal transducer for p75NTR-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, co-induction of p75NTR and NADE triggers zinc-induced neuronal cell death in the model of rat hippocampus following ischemia. 2J. A. Park, J.-Y. Lee, T.-A. Sato, and J.-Y. Koh, submitted for publication. Importantly, since NADE contains NES as well as ubiquitination sequences, its protein levels and localization might be under tight control in normal cells. Taken together, our data showed that the functional interaction of NADE with p75NTR plays an important role in p75NTR-mediated signal transduction under physiological conditions. We thank Michael L.

https://openalex.org/W2091275711,"Abstract Members of the AGC subfamily of protein kinases including protein kinase B, p70 S6 kinase, and protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms are activated and/or stabilized by phosphorylation of two residues, one that resides in the T-loop of the kinase domain and the other that is located C-terminal to the kinase domain in a region known as the hydrophobic motif. Atypical PKC isoforms, such as PKCζ, and the PKC-related kinases, like PRK2, are also activated by phosphorylation of their T-loop site but, instead of possessing a phosphorylatable Ser/Thr in their hydrophobic motif, contain an acidic residue. The 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK1) activates many members of the AGC subfamily of kinases in vitro, including PKCζ and PRK2 by phosphorylating the T-loop residue. In the present study we demonstrate that the hydrophobic motifs of PKCζ and PKCι, as well as PRK1 and PRK2, interact with the kinase domain of PDK1. Mutation of the conserved residues of the hydrophobic motif of full-length PKCζ, full-length PRK2, or PRK2 lacking its N-terminal regulatory domain abolishes or significantly reduces the ability of these kinases to interact with PDK1 and to become phosphorylated at their T-loop sites in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of the hydrophobic motif of PRK2 in cells prevents the T-loop phosphorylation and thus inhibits the activation of PRK2 and PKCζ. These findings indicate that the hydrophobic motif of PRK2 and PKCζ acts as a “docking site” enabling the recruitment of PDK1 to these substrates. This is essential for their phosphorylation by PDK1 in cells."

A key physiological partner of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Atx1 is Ccc2, a cation transporting P-type ATPase located in secretory vesicles. Here, we show that Atx1 donates its metal ion cargo to the first N-terminal Atx1-like domain of Ccc2 in a direct and reversible manner. The thermodynamic gradient for metal transfer is shallow (K exchange = 1.4 ± 0.2), establishing that vectorial delivery of copper by Atx1 is not based on a higher copper affinity of the target domain. Instead, Atx1 allows rapid metal transfer to its partner. This equilibrium is unaffected by a 50-fold excess of the Cu(I) competitor, glutathione, indicating that Atx1 also protects Cu(I) from nonspecific reactions. Mechanistically, we propose that a low activation barrier for transfer between partners results from complementary electrostatic forces that ultimately orient the metal-binding loops of Atx1 and Ccc2 for formation of copper-bridged intermediates. These thermodynamic and kinetic considerations suggest that copper trafficking proteins overcome the extraordinary copper chelation capacity of the eukaryotic cytoplasm by catalyzing the rate of copper transfer between physiological partners.

Once inside the cell, a portion of the copper is delivered to P-type ATPases, which pump this metal ion into vesicles for ultimate incorporation into multicopper oxidases.

Until recently, copper was thought to be delivered to target proteins as glutathione complexes; however, the Atx1 metallochaperone protein, a cytosolic Cu(I) receptor, is required downstream of CTR1 and upstream of Ccc2 and related ATPases (11.Lin S.-J.

Recent structural studies provide insights into the intracellular chemistry of copper transfer (28.Rosenzweig A.C. O'Halloran T.V. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of Atx1 indicate that the metal-binding motif is housed in a surface-exposed loop, with the cysteines located in the first loop and the first α-helix (29.Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure. 1999; 7: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This fold is conserved in other eukaryotic copper-trafficking proteins including Menkes' ATPase domain 4, MNK4 (30.Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and the CCS metallochaperone domain I (31.Lamb A.L. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The two N-terminal domains of Ccc2 are predicted to possess this same βαββαβ-fold, albeit with multiple negatively charged surface residues like MNK4, its human counterpart. In contrast, Atx1 possesses multiple positively charged lysines on its surface (29.Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure. 1999; 7: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Mutation of conserved lysines on the surface of Atx1 greatly reduces the copper-dependent interaction of Atx1 and Ccc2 in vivo (12.Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 32.Portnoy M.E. Rosenzweig A.C. Rae T. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15041-15045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic free Cu(I) is notably unavailable to the high affinity copper enzymes such as SOD1 (superoxide dismutase) (14.Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). In fact, the results are consistent with the presence of a vast excess of specific and nonspecific copper chelation sites relative to the total number of copper atoms per cell. Furthermore, copper exchange rates are generally thought to be slow because of the strength of the Cu(I) ligand bonds (33.Frausto da Silva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements. Clarendon, Oxford1991: 396Google Scholar). These considerations raise the dilemma of how a copper trafficking protein can bind its cargo tightly enough to prevent loss to inappropriate binding sites and yet allow facile release at specific destinations. To address these issues, the energetics of copper transfer between Atx1 and Ccc2 were probed using a direct assay of metal occupancy. The gene encoding the 72-residue N-terminal Atx1-like domain of Ccc2, Ccc2a, was cloned into pET11d (Novagen) and resequenced. The resultant plasmid,pDLHV021, was transformed into Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in M9 supplemented with cas-amino acids. The protein was extracted from the cell pellet by freeze-thaw extraction in 20 mm MES/Na, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm DTT. After batch treatment with CM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), filtrate was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column, pre-equilibrated with 20 mm MES/Na, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, pH 6.0 and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. Ccc2a-containing fractions were combined, concentrated, and loaded onto a Superdex 75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and eluted with 20 mmMES/Na, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT. Approximately 3 mg of pure protein was obtained per liter of culture. Electrospray mass spectroscopy revealed a mass of 7882.1 daltons, consistent with the processing of the N-terminal Met in the expression strain. The cloning procedure introduced an Ala after the N-terminal Met; therefore, the recombinant protein begins with Ala at position 1 and ends with Ser at position 72. The concentration of a Ccc2a stock solution was determined by hydrolysis (Harvard Microchem) giving ε = 2750m−1 cm−1 (at 280 nm) in 20 mm MES/Na, pH 6. The hydrolysis results indicate that the Bradford method (34.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using IgG as a standard underestimates the concentration of Ccc2 that can be accounted for if multiplication factor of 2.9 is applied to the IgG-based value. Atx1 was purified as described previously (12.Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and the concentration was determined as described for Ccc2a. Total amino acid hydrolysis (Harvard Microchem, ε = 4950 m−1 cm−1 in 50 mm Tris/MES, pH 8) data indicate that the Bradford assay (34.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using IgG standards leads to an overestimate of the concentration of Atx1. In this case, a multiplication factor of 0.54 was applied to the IgG standard curve. Frozen protein stocks were treated with excess DTT, washed, and exchanged into the metal insertion buffer immediately prior to loading with copper. Cu(I)-Atx1 and Cu(I)-Ccc2a were prepared in an N2atmosphere chamber (Vacuum Atmospheres) at 12 °C by adding 1 equivalent of [Cu(I)-(CH3CN)4]PF6in CH3CN to a solution of apoprotein in 50 mmTris/MES, pH 8, with stirring. Unbound metal was removed by washing with at least 3 volumes of buffer in an ultrafiltration device. The metal to protein stoichiometries for Atx1 and Ccc2a are typically ∼1, even when the proteins are incubated with excess Cu(I) in the presence of glutathione (GSH) or DTT. The protein samples used for metal transfer were: Cu(I)-Atx1, 760 μm, Cu/protein ratio 1.0; Cu(I)-Atx1, 2000 μm, Cu/protein ratio 0.94; Cu(I)-Ccc2a, 1890 μm, Cu/protein ratio 0.62;apoAtx1, 770 μm; apoCcc2a, 520 μm; apoCcc2a, 2030 μm. Metal concentration was determined by ICP-AES. All samples were stored at 4 °C or −20 °C in an N2 atmosphere prior to use. Metal ion transfer experiments were performed by combining Cu(I)-Atx1 or Cu-Ccc2a with apoCcc2a or apoAtx1 in an inert atmosphere maintained at 18 °C at pH 6 in 20 mm MES/Na or at pH 7.2 in 4 mmNaPi. After incubation, the mixture was separated using the same buffer (pH 6 or pH 7.2 as indicated) with a linear gradient (0–0.5 m NaCl) on a Bio-Scale Q2 (Biologic) or a RESOURCE Q (1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Column fractions were analyzed for protein and metal content by the Bradford assay (34.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and ICP-AES, respectively. Control experiments indicate routine protein recovery rates of more than 95%. The equilibrium expressions for Cu(I) exchange are shown in Equations 1 and 2.

When CuAtx1 is incubated with apoCcc2a, the metal partitions between the two proteins (Fig. 1). Control experiments demonstrate that Atx1 is not retained on the Q2 strong anion column (Fig.1 b), whereas Ccc2a binds strongly. These experiments also provide a quantitative insight into the thermodynamics and kinetics of metal transfer. To test the equilibrium assumption, the reverse reaction of CuCcc2a with apoAtx1 was conducted. As shown in Table I, CuCcc2a can transfer metal to apoAtx1. The reverse reaction gives the same product distribution as the forward reaction, establishing that the system reaches equilibrium in the time frame of the experiments. Furthermore, the product distribution was independent of the incubation time, indicating that copper exchange is complete even at the shortest possible incubation times (1 min).Table IInitial Cu(I) donorIncubationCompetitor[Atx1]totalaProtein concentrations are normalized to total reaction volume at point of mixing.[Cu-Atx1]0aProtein concentrations are normalized to total reaction volume at point of mixing.[Ccc2a]totalaProtein concentrations are normalized to total reaction volume at point of mixing.[Cu-Ccc2a]0bCopper concentration determined by ICP-AES of protein stock solutions; concentrations are normalized to total volume at point of mixing.[Cu(I)-Atx1]eqcTotal copper concentration determined from recovery of copper in respective protein-containing fractions after chromatography.[Cu(I)-Ccc2a]eqcTotal copper concentration determined from recovery of copper in respective protein-containing fractions after chromatography.K exchangeminmmμmμmμmμmμmμm 1.

Open table in a new tab The copper exchange constant (K exchange) was obtained from a linear least squares fit of the data in Table I to the modified form of the equilibrium expression shown in Equation 5. Total moles of loaded and recovered copper were routinely found in the 90%+ range, and runs with less than 86% recovery were not used. The linear least squares fit of the data (corresponding to experiments 1–14) over a range of protein concentrations supports the equilibrium assumption implicit in Equation 5(Fig. 2), revealing a slope (K exchange) = 1.4 and standard deviations m = 0.1 (correlation coefficient, r, of 0.95). Data for both the forward and reverse reactions fit equally well, further indicating that the system is at equilibrium. The averages of the K exchange values at pH 6.0, 1.5(ς = 0.2), and at pH 7.2, 1.2(ς = 0.3), are the same within experimental error indicating no effect of pH in this range (Fig. 2). To determine whether copper competitors can interfere with the transfer or remove the copper ion from these proteins, we conducted the metal transfer experiment in the presence of a physiologically relevant Cu(I) binding agent, GSH. GSH avidly binds Cu(I) to form Cu(GSH)2with a stability constant of β2 = 1038.8(35.Osterberg R. Ligaarden R. Persson D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1979; 10: 341-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The addition of physiological levels of GSH (1–5 mm) does not effect the final equilibrium position (Table I, experiments 15–17). The copper transfer reaction is unaffected by the presence of even a 50-fold molar excess of GSH over the Cu(I) concentration (experiment 17, Table I), indicating that low molecular weight thiols do not participate in this equilibrium. We also tested whether Cu-Atx1 could transfer copper to another copper-binding protein by incubating 190 μm CuAtx1 anaerobically with 167 μmbovine serum albumin at pH 6 for 5 min. No copper is transferred from Cu-Atx1 to bovine serum albumin in four separate determinations. Thus, the strong Cu(I) thiolate bonds in Atx1 not only protect Cu(I) from disproportionation and air oxidation (12.Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) but may also prevent loss of the metal ion to adventitious binding sites within the cell. When the copper-bound form of the chaperone is directly incubated with apoCcc2a, Cu(I) equilibrates between the two proteins, and it does so rapidly. A stepwise mechanism for direct and rapid metal transfer is proposed. In the first step, CuAtx1 docksapoCcc2a. A specific orientation between CuAtx1 andapoCcc2a could poise the Cu(I) center for nucleophilic attack by thiol from the adjacent protein, forming a Cu(S-Cys)3 intermediate. In the next step, the copper rapidly partitions between the two metal-binding sites within the protein-protein complex via the formation and decay of two- and three-coordinate copper thiolate intermediates. In the final step, the complex dissociates to provide apoAtx1 and Cu-Ccc2a. The metal exchange results shown herein demonstrate that the thermodynamic gradient for copper transfer between this copper chaperone and its target domains is ∼0.2 kcal/mol and is thus quite shallow (K exchange = 1.4 ± 0.2). Thus, the thermodynamics of vectorial copper delivery from the copper chaperone to targets involves small differences in the Cu(I) binding constants of each protein or domain. If the subsequent Cu(I) transfer step to another site in Ccc2, such as the CXC motif (36.Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), is rapid, then each of the copper transfer steps in Fig. 3would be coupled with the driving force ultimately being provided by ATP hydrolysis. Because the initial Cu(I) transfer between Atx1 and Ccc2 proceeds rapidly to equilibrium, this step in the cellular trafficking pathway is best considered to be under thermodynamic control. However, the recently established boundary conditions, which indicate an extraordinarily limited cytosolic free copper concentration, need to be considered as the copper chaperone hypothesis is extended. Rae et al. (14.Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar) have shown that intracellular free copper concentration is negligible and further suggested that the cytoplasm has a significant overcapacity for copper chelation. This leads to the dilemma of how the copper chaperone can retain Cu(I) in the face of a significant thermodynamic sink if the reaction is under thermodynamic control. Our current data suggest a solution. Copper transfer from chaperone to target is not driven by thermodynamics of the copper-binding sites in these proteins. Rather, Atx1 appears to function as an enzyme; it lowers the kinetic barrier for copper transfer along specific reaction coordinates. In this model, Atx1 catalyzes equilibration of copper between yet to be identified copper donor sites and specific targets such as Ccc2. ATP hydrolysis then drives the compartmentalization of the cytosolic copper available to Atx1. Finally, Atx1 may prevent adventitious copper release by deterring ligand exchange reactions with non-partner proteins, although additional transfer reactions with the latter are required to test this proposal. Given the rapid transfer, we anticipate that a low activation barrier results when the metal-loaded chaperone adopts a preferred orientation with respect to the metal-binding site in the acceptor. In this model, specific intermolecular forces guide the docking interactions and position the metal binding loop in the Cu-donor protein proximal to the unoccupied metal loop in the partner domain. Based on our modeling of both of the ∼72-residue N-terminal metal-binding domains of Ccc2 utilizing the coordinates of the NMR structure of Menkes' domain 4 (30.Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), we propose that electrostatic complementation between surfaces on the donor (29.Rosenzweig A.C. Huffman D.L. Hou M.Y. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. O'Halloran T.V. Structure. 1999; 7: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,32.Portnoy M.E. Rosenzweig A.C. Rae T. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15041-15045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and acceptor proteins will play an important role in achieving the orientation favored for facile metal transfer. The electrostatic properties of the second N-terminal copper-binding domain suggest that it may also serve as a docking site for Atx1. This possibility could increase the likelihood of an encounter between the metallochaperone and its target in vivo and may increase the overall efficiency of copper transport. Once Cu(I) is transferred to either domain of Ccc2, ATP hydrolysis then provides conformational changes that displace the Cu(I) into a vesicle, which is thermodynamically distinct from the cytosol. As shown by Camakaris and colleagues (37.Voskoboinik I. Strausak D. Greenough M. Brooks H. Petris M. Smith S. Mercer J.F. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22008-22012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), Cu(I) ions are actively transported through the membrane in an ATP-dependent manner by the Menkes' disease protein, the human homologue of Ccc2. The requirement for active transport is consistent with a vesicular compartment in which the availability of copper (i.e.[Cu(I)]free) is significantly higher than in the cytosol (Fig. 3). This leads to a further extension of the metallochaperone hypothesis; active transport is required to maintain the gradient of high copper inside the vesicle and low copper in the cytosol. If this is the case, then another copper chaperone may not be required to insert copper into Fet3 within the vesicle; the apo-enzyme could acquire copper by diffusion and collision. A recent report showing that the GEF1 chloride/proton antiporter co-localizes with Fet3 and is required for Fet3 activity (38.Davis-Kaplan S.R. Askwith C.C. Bengtzen A.C. Radisky D. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13641-13645Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) raises the interesting possibility that elevated chloride concentrations within these vesicles lead to formation of copper(I) chloride complexes, which can stabilize Cu(I) against disproportionation. This observation is consistent with a compartment that contains elevated levels of free Cu(I) relative to the cytosol. The facile and reversible nature of the Cu trafficking pathway raises the possibility that the Ccc2-containing secretory vesicles can also serve as a source of copper for cytosolic enzymes. The reverse reaction, copper egress from the vesicle into the cytosol and into Atx1, is allowed by the chemistry, but it remains to be seen whether it is part of the physiology of copper trafficking.

https://openalex.org/W1992711212,"The H,K-ATPase of the gastric parietal cell is the most critical component of the ion transport system mediating acid secretion in the stomach. To study the requirement of this enzyme in the development, maintenance, and function of the gastric mucosa, we used gene targeting to prepare mice lacking the α-subunit. Homozygous mutant (Atp4a −/−) mice appeared healthy and exhibited normal systemic electrolyte and acid-base status but were achlorhydric and hypergastrinemic. Immunocytochemical, histological, and ultrastructural analyses of Atp4a −/−stomachs revealed the presence of chief cells, demonstrating that the lack of acid secretion does not interfere with their differentiation. Parietal cells were also present in normal numbers, and despite the absence of α-subunit mRNA and protein, the β-subunit was expressed. However, Atp4a −/− parietal cells had dilated canaliculi and lacked typical canalicular microvilli and tubulovesicles, and subsets of these cells contained abnormal mitochondria and/or massive glycogen stores. Stomachs of adultAtp4a −/− mice exhibited metaplasia, which included the presence of ciliated cells. We conclude that ablation of the H,K-ATPase α-subunit causes achlorhydria and hypergastrinemia, severe perturbations in the secretory membranes of the parietal cell, and metaplasia of the gastric mucosa; however, the absence of the pump appears not to perturb parietal cell viability or chief cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2139843511,"A system of five purified proteins that assembles stable glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-hsp90 heterocomplexes has been reconstituted from reticulocyte lysate.

Here we demonstrate that the first step in assembly is the ATP-dependent and hsp40 (YDJ-1)-dependent binding of hsp70 to the GR. After elimination of free hsp70, these preformed GR·hsp70 complexes can be activated to the steroid binding state by the hsp70 free assembly system in a second ATP-dependent step. hsp90 is required for opening of the steroid binding pocket and is converted to its ATP-dependent conformation during this second step. We predict that hsp70 in its ATP-dependent conformation binds initially to the folded receptor and is then converted to the ADP-dependent form with high affinity for hydrophobic substrate. This conversion initiates the opening of the hydrophobic steroid binding pocket such that it can now accept the hydrophobic binding form of hsp90, which in turn must be converted to its ATP-dependent conformation for the pocket to be accessible by steroid.

Preincubation of the GR with hsp70, YDJ-1 (hsp40), and ATP results in a GR·hsp70 complex. After elimination of free hsp70, the GR·hsp70 complex will bind Hop, and the resulting GR·hsp70·Hop complex will bind hsp90. In a second ATP-dependent step, hsp90 is converted to its ATP-dependent conformation, and the receptor acquires steroid binding activity. [6,7-3H]Triamcinolone acetonide (38 Ci/mmol) and125I-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Untreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI). Protein A-Sepharose and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugates were from Sigma, and donkey anti-rabbit IgG was from Pierce. The BuGR2 monoclonal IgG antibody against the GR was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). The AC88 monoclonal IgG against hsp90 and the N27F3–4 anti-72/73-kDa hsp monoclonal IgG (anti-hsp70) were from StressGen (Victoria, BC, Canada). The JJ3 monoclonal IgG against p23 and Escherichia coliexpressing human p23 were gifts from Dr. David Toft (The Mayo Clinic).E. coli expressing YDJ-1 was a gift from Dr. Avrom Caplan (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). The DS14F5 monoclonal IgG against Hop and E. coli-expressing Hop were kindly provided by Dr. David F. Smith (University of Nebraska Medical School). Hybridoma cells producing the FiGR monoclonal IgG against the GR were generously provided by Dr. Jack Bodwell (Dartmouth Medical School). Overexpression of mouse GR in Sf9 cells was achieved according to the Bac-N-Blue transfection kit protocol of Invitrogen Corp. Briefly, mouse GR cDNA was excised from the pSV2Wrec plasmid (24.Danielsen M. Northrup J.P. Ringold G.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) as a 2.67-kilobase fragment. This fragment was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the p2Bac transfer vector to make the recombinant transfer vector p2Bac-mGR. The p2Bac-mGR and Bac-N-Blue DNA were then cotransfected into Sf9 cells to make recombinant baculovirus, followed by plaque purification. Sf9 cells were grown in SFM900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with Cytomax (Kemp Biotechnology, Rockville, MD) in suspension cultures maintained at 27 °C with continuous shaking (150 rpm). Cultures were infected in log phase of growth with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 3.0. Cultures were supplemented with 0.1% glucose at infection and 24-h post-infection as described by Srinivasanet al. (25.Srinivasan G. Post J.F.M. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed in Hanks' buffered saline solution, resuspended in 1.5 volumes of buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmmolybdate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected, divided into aliquots, flash-frozen, and stored at −70 °C. Receptors were immunoadsorbed from 50-μl aliquots of Sf9 cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 14 μl of protein A-Sepharose precoupled to 7 μl of FiGR ascites suspended in 200 μl of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Before incubation with reticulocyte lysate or various mixtures of purified proteins as noted, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 300 μl of 0.5 m KCl in TEG. The pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG followed by a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). FiGR immunopellets containing GR stripped of chaperones were incubated with 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate or with various mixtures of proteins (20 μg of purified hsp90, 15 μg of purified hsp70, 0.6 μg of purified human Hop, 6 μg of purified p23, 0.4 μg of purified YDJ-1) and adjusted to 50 μl with HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.35) containing 20 mm sodium molybdate and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mmcreatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG with 20 mmsodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity and, in some experiments, for receptor-associated proteins. Immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 μl of HEM (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm molybdate) buffer plus 50 nm[3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide bound/FiGR immunopellet prepared from 50 μl of Sf9 cytosol. The amount of GR immunoadsorbed from 50 μl of Sf9 cytosol has been measured using an in-gel assay with a bovine albumin standard. From the specific activity of the [3H]triamcinolone acetonide, we calculate that 40,000 cpm bound/GR immunopellet from 50 μl of Sf9 cytosol represents ∼0.13 mol of steroid bound/mol of GR. To assay GR and associated proteins, immune pellets were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.25 μg/ml BuGR for GR, 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90, 1 μg/ml N27F3–4 for hsp70, 0.1% DS14F5 mouse ascites for Hop, or 0.1% JJ3 mouse ascites for p23. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counter-antibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. hsp90 and hsp70 were purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate by sequential chromatography on DE52, hydroxylapatite, and ATP-agarose as described previously (10.Dittmar K.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was purified from 10 ml of bacterial lysate by chromatography on DE52, followed by hydroxylapatite chromatography (13.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For purification of YDJ-1, bacterial sonicates were cleared by centrifugation, and YDJ-1 was purified by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxylapatite as described previously (13.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The bacterial expression of YDJ-1 has been described previously (27.Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P.J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 35: 14889-14898Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) as has the expression of human Hop (10.Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Purification of human Hop was carried out in a similar manner by sequential chromatography on DE52 and hydroxylapatite. In all cases the protein-containing fractions were identified by immunoblotting, and fractions from the final purification step were pooled, concentrated by Amicon filtration, dialyzed against HKD buffer, flash frozen, and stored at −70 °C. It has not been determined which of the two essential chaperones, hsp70 or hsp90, first contacts the receptor. The three laboratories studying this receptor·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system have speculated that hsp70 binds initially (11.Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14.Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C. McMahon N. Toft D. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 420-431PubMed Google Scholar), and we wanted to find appropriate conditions for prebinding hsp70 to the GR before incubating the GR·hsp70 complex with the other components of the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system. One limitation to such an approach is shown in Fig. 1 A. In this experiment, GR immune pellets stripped of insect hsp90 were incubated at 30 °C under the buffer conditions required for heterocomplex assembly. After various times of preincubation, the immune pellets were washed and incubated with reticulocyte lysate to reactivate steroid binding activity. It can be seen that preincubation of the stripped GR results in a time-dependent loss in its ability to be reactivated. As shown by the Western blot in the inset to Fig. 1 A, the loss is not due to receptor proteolysis, and the reason for the loss is not known. As indicated in Fig.1 B, the GR is inactivated in the absence of ATP (solid bars), but inactivation is faster in the presence of the ATP-regenerating system (open bars) that we use for heterocomplex assembly. Because of this inactivation, all of the subsequent preincubations of GR with hsp70 will be limited to 5 min. In the experiment of Fig. 2, stripped GR immune pellets were preincubated for 5 min at 30 °C with hsp70, the ATP-regenerating system, and YDJ-1. The immune pellets were then washed and immunoblotted for the GR and hsp70. As shown in the Western blot at the top of Fig. 2, both ATP and YDJ-1 were required for a high level of hsp70 binding to the GR (lane 8). The bars in Fig. 2 show the steroid binding activity that is achieved when the washed hsp70-bound GR pellets were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with the purified heterocomplex assembly system without hsp70. Preincubation of the GR with hsp70 in the presence of ATP and YDJ-1 (lane 8) was required to obtain substantial reactivation of steroid binding activity during the second incubation with the hsp70-free assembly system (hsp90, Hop, YDJ-1, p23). hsp70 has the ability to bind to a wide variety of proteins, and it is possible that it binds to antibody and/or protein A-Sepharose in the GR immune pellet. The experiment of Fig. 3was performed to demonstrate that it is the hsp70 that is prebound to the GR and not nonspecifically retained hsp70 that is responsible for subsequent activation of steroid binding activity by the hsp70-free assembly system. Antibody pellets with or without bound GR were preincubated with or without hsp70 in the presence of YDJ-1 and the ATP-regenerating system. After washing, the preincubated pellets were combined and incubated with the purified assembly system with or without hsp70. It can be seen that combining an antibody pellet preincubated with hsp70 and a GR pellet preincubated in the absence of hsp70 does not yield steroid binding activity (lane 3), whereas combining a GR pellet preincubated with hsp70 with an antibody pellet preincubated in the absence of hsp70 does yield steroid binding activity (lane 5). Thus, it is clear that it is receptor-bound hsp70 that is responsible for the subsequent generation of steroid binding sites by the rest of the assembly system. As shown in Fig.4 A, hsp70 that is prebound to the GR dissociates during subsequent incubation at 30 °C with the ATP-regenerating system alone (lane 2) or with the hsp70-free assembly system (lane 3). As shown in Fig.4 B, about 50% of the hsp70 dissociates when the GR·hsp70 complexes are incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with the ATP-regenerating system (lane 2) or ATP alone (lane 3). Srinivasan et al. (30.Srinivasan G. Patel N.T. Thompson E.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) note that human GR expressed in the baculovirus system is associated with some insect hsp70 that does not dissociate upon incubation with ATP. As shown by Western blot with an antibody that detects insect hsp70 (Fig. 1 A,inset) and by staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig.4 C), the overexpressed mouse GR is associated with a small amount of Sf9 cell-derived hsp70 that does not dissociate during subsequent incubation with the ATP-regenerating system. The ratios of Fig. 4 B have been corrected for the small contribution (<10%) by this insect hsp70. In the experiment of Fig. 5 A the GR·hsp70·Hop·hsp90 heterocomplex was assembled in stepwise fashion. Stripped GR immune pellets (lane 1) were first incubated at 30 °C with the ATP-regenerating system and YDJ-1 in the absence (lane 2) or presence (lane 3) of hsp70. After washing, the immune pellets were incubated on ice with Hop and washed again. Hop bound only to the GR·hsp70 complex (lane 3). GR·hsp70 complexes (lane 4) or GR·hsp70·Hop complexes (lane 5) were then incubated on ice with hsp90 and washed. Although more hsp90 was bound to GR·hsp70·Hop complexes (lane 5) than to GR·hsp70 complexes (lane 4), the GR·hsp70 complexes nevertheless bound some hsp90. In Fig.5 B, GR·hsp70 complexes (lane 4) or GR·hsp70·Hop complexes (lane 5) were prepared as above and then incubated at 30 °C with hsp90, p23, molybdate, and the ATP-regenerating system. About half the steroid binding activity was generated in the absence of Hop (lane 4) as in the presence of Hop (lane 5), consistent with the observation that hsp70 and hsp90 together are sufficient for generating some steroid binding activity (17.Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Silverstein A.M. Dittmar K.D. Estrada L. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, we showed that ATP was required during the 5-min preincubation with hsp70 to produce a GR·hsp70 complex that could be activated to the steroid binding state by a second incubation with the hsp70-free assembly system. This second incubation involves a second ATP-dependent process leading to steroid binding activity. In Fig. 6 A, the GR·hsp70·Hop·hsp90 heterocomplex was assembled as in Fig.5 A (lane 5). These complexes were then incubated at 30 °C with p23 and molybdate in the absence (lane 2) or presence (lane 3) of the ATP-regenerating system. It is clear that steroid binding activity is generated only when ATP is present. The Toft laboratory has shown that receptor-bound hsp90 must be in its ATP-dependent conformation for the receptor to have steroid binding activity (22.Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and that p23 binds to purified hsp90 when hsp90 is in its ATP-dependent conformation (20.Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig. 6 B, GR·hsp70 complexes were incubated at 30 °C with hsp90, Hop, p23, and molybdate in the presence (lane 3) or absence (lane 2) of the ATP-generating system. The composition of the immune pellets was assayed by immunoblotting. The sample that had ATP present during the incubation with hsp90 (lane 3) contains more p23 than a similarly treated sample that did not contain GR (lane 4) or the GR·hsp70 sample that went through the second incubation in the absence of ATP (lane 2). Perhaps because of its high negative charge, nonspecific binding of p23 to immune pellets is high (e.g. lane 4), and the pellets must be washed at least four times with TEGM to reduce the nonspecific binding to this level. GR-bound hsp90 in its ATP-dependent conformation remains bound to the receptor under these wash conditions, but hsp90 that is not in its ATP-dependent conformation (lane 2) is eliminated. Nevertheless, the increased presence of p23 in the GR·hsp90 heterocomplex in lane 3 is consistent with the notion that hsp90 has been converted to its ATP-dependent conformation during the second incubation. The experiments shown in Fig. 7 were carried out in the absence of Hop to demonstrate the sequential requirements for an initial ATP-dependent step mediated by hsp70 followed by a second ATP-dependent step mediated by hsp90. In the experiment of Fig. 7 A, stripped GR immune pellets were preincubated with hsp70 and YDJ-1 in the presence or absence of ATP. These pellets were then washed and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with hsp90, p23, and molybdate in the presence or absence of ATP. Because receptor heterocomplexes formed with a purified chaperone system lacking one or more of the co-chaperones can be less stable, [3H]triamcinolone acetonide was present during this second incubation at 30 °C to permit steroid binding to GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes as soon as they are formed and before they disassemble. As shown in lane 5, substantial steroid binding activity is achieved when ATP is present during the preincubation with hsp70 and the second incubation with hsp90. Receptors preincubated with hsp70 in the presence of ATP and then with hsp90 in the absence of ATP do not have steroid binding activity (lane 4). Receptors preincubated with hsp70 in the absence of ATP and then with hsp90 in the presence of ATP (lane 3) have a low steroid binding activity. We have chromatographed the nucleotide in our purified hsp70 preparation by the method of Minami et al. (31.Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and determined that the hsp70 is bound by ATP (data not shown). We also know that some hsp70 binds to the GR in the absence of added ATP (Fig.2, lane 3). Thus, it is not surprising that a low level of steroid binding activity is generated in the absence of added ATP during the preincubation with hsp70. The experiment of Fig. 7 B shows that the sequence cannot be reversed, with hsp90 being present in the first incubation and hsp70 in the second (lane 2). When hsp90 is not present in the second incubation with ATP, no steroid binding activity is generated (lane 4). In sum, all of the data support a model in which there is an initial ATP-dependent event mediated by hsp70, and this event is required for a second ATP-dependent event mediated by hsp90. This study of GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly has been greatly facilitated by the use of GR expressed in the baculovirus system. This overexpressed mouse GR is somewhat different from mouse GR in immune pellets prepared from L cell cytosol. Essentially all of the receptors in L cell cytosol are bound to hsp90, and 75–100% of the stripped receptors are reactivated by reticulocyte lysate to the steroid binding state (23.Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27894-27899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, only about 12% of the GR immunoadsorbed from Sf9 cell cytosol is bound to insect hsp90, and about 15% of the total GR in stripped immune pellets is converted to the steroid binding state by reticulocyte lysate or by the purified assembly system (17.Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Silverstein A.M. Dittmar K.D. Estrada L. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because the overexpressed GR is further inactivated by incubation at 30 °C (Fig. 1), we have limited the time of preincubation with hsp70 to 5 min. During the second incubation with the hsp70-free assembly system, about 50% of the prebound hsp70 dissociates from the GR immune pellet (Fig. 4, A and B). Despite these limitations and losses, we are able to generate more steroid binding activity with two-step reactivation of the Sf9-expressed GR by the purified five protein assembly system (Fig. 2, lane 8) than we generate under the best of conditions with reticulocyte lysate and GR immune pellets prepared from L cell cytosol (10.Dittmar K.D.

The abundance of baculovirus-expressed GR has permitted us for the first time to assemble in stepwise fashion a functional multiprotein hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system on the receptor. Our previous studies have led us to a model of assembly in reticulocyte lysate in which a preformed hsp90·Hop·hsp70·hsp40 complex associated as a unit with the GR to open the steroid binding pocket, with the co-chaperone p23 being a dynamic participant in the GR·hsp90 assembly mechanism (10.Dittmar K.D.

In deriving such a model, we have shown that immunoadsorbed preformed hsp90·Hop·hsp70·hsp40 complexes convert the GR to its steroid binding form (11.Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13.Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is clear that all of the Hop in reticulocyte lysate is bound to hsp90 (32.Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J-M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and that the presence of Hop in the purified assembly system accelerates the rate of formation of steroid binding sites (17.Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Silverstein A.M. Dittmar K.D. Estrada L. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6894-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with a model in which the hsp90·Hop·hsp70·hsp40 complex acts as a machine for heterocomplex assembly. In the model of Toft and co-workers (14.Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M.C. McMahon N. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), receptor association with hsp70 and then hsp40-promoted conversion of hsp70 to the ADP-bound conformation are viewed as independent steps that are followed by attachment of an hsp90·Hop unit. Thus, the machinery is viewed as assembling on the receptor rather than being preassembled. It seems likely to us that both models apply, and the data of Figs. 5 and 6 show that a functional machinery can be formed on the receptor in stepwise fashion. The stepwise assembly approach has allowed us to identify two separate ATP-dependent events that we had previously predicted (16.Pratt W.B. Dittmar K.D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 244-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but had not been able to demonstrate. The model of Fig.8 summarizes our current view of how hsp70 and hsp90 may interact to open the steroid binding pocket on the receptor. It has been established that hsp70 binds directly to the ligand binding domain of the receptor (1.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). The first ATP-dependent step involves hsp70 only, and binding of hsp70 to the GR in a manner that is productive for subsequent activation of steroid binding activity by the hsp70-free assembly system requires both ATP and YDJ-1 (Fig. 2). Thus, we predict that hsp70 binds to the GR in its ATP-bound form and undergoes an hsp40-enhanced conversion to its ADP-bound conformation. In Fig. 8, the hydrophobic steroid binding pocket in the GR is in the folded state when the ATP-dependent form of hsp70 binds. Upon ATP hydrolysis, the hsp70 undergoes a conformational change to a form with a high affinity for hydrophobic amino acids. We suggest that this conformational change in hsp70 may induce a conformational change in the GR LBD that begins the opening of the steroid binding pocket and brings hydrophobic residues in the interior of the pocket into contact with the substrate binding region of hsp70. It is possible that this initial ATP-dependent step really consists of multiple substeps in which the GR-bound hsp70 ratchets back and forth between ATP- and ADP-dependent conformations. The second ATP-dependent step in generating steroid binding activity requires hsp90 (Fig. 7 B). In the model of Fig. 8, hsp90 is pictured as being in the ADP-bound conformation when it binds to the GR·hsp70 complex, but it is possible that purified hsp90 without bound nucleotide can bind to GR·hsp70. The Toft laboratory has demonstrated that receptor-bound hsp90 must assume its ATP-dependent conformation (22.Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) for the receptor to have steroid binding activity. Thus, the second ATP-dependent event must involve conversion of hsp90 to its ATP-dependent conformation. The Toft laboratory has also shown that p23 binds to the ATP-dependent conformation of hsp90 (20.Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and the data of Fig. 6 B suggest that GR·hsp70 complexes that are converted to the steroid binding state by incubation with ATP, hsp90, and p23 contain p23. Thus, we predict that in the second ATP-dependent step, hsp90 is converted to its ATP-dependent conformation. As indicated in Fig. 8, we do not know if hsp70 is also converted to its ATP-dependent conformation during the second step of assembly.

Following tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT proteins dimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and activate specific target genes. Activation is transient, and down-regulation of STAT signaling occurs within a few hours. In the present study, we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 inhibits STAT3 transcriptional activation. Following leukemia inhibitory factor stimulation, p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 was found to associate with STAT3 proteins in coimmunoprecipitation and pull down assays. In vivo, overexpression of p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 reduced transcriptional activation by STAT3 proteins but did not modify DNA binding activity. Interestingly, pull down experiments showed that p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 could interact with the CREB-binding coactivator protein, and inhibition of STAT3 activity by p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 did not occur when CREB-binding protein was overexpressed. These results suggest a model by which p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 functions as an inhibitor of STAT3 signaling and highlight a new activity for this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.

Based on their structural similarities and shared use of gp1301 receptor subunit, interleukin (IL) 6, the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, interleukin 11 (IL-11), and cardiotrophin-1 define the IL-6-type cytokine family (1.Hirano T. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 249-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). These cytokines exert multiple functions on cell growth and differentiation, such as activation of hepatocyte transcription, activation of neural proliferation and differentiation, and regulation of hematopoiesis. Moreover, LIF, ciliary neurotrophic factor, cardiotrophin-1, and oncostatin M display biological properties in the early stages of embryonic development (2.Conover J. Ip N. Poueymirou W. Bates B. Goldfarb M. DeChiara T. Yancopoulos G. Development. 1993; 119: 559-565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Pennica D. Shaw K. Swanson T.A. Moore M.W. Shelton D.L. Zioncheck K.A. Rosenthal A. Taga T. Paoni N.F. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10915-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Binding of these cytokines to their receptors activates the JAK protein tyrosine kinases, followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors. This leads to activation and homo- or heterodimerization of the STAT1/3 transcription factors, translocation into the nucleus, and activation of target genes (4.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 5.Ihle J. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). This activation is transient, and activated transcription factors disappear from the nucleus within 1–6 h after ligand stimulation (4.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 6.Hoey T. Schindler U. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This suggests that inhibitory mechanisms should exist, and several pathways leading to the inhibition of receptor signaling and STAT function have been recently described. Suppressor of cytokine signaling and CIS/JAB proteins were originally discovered on the basis of their ability to interact with and inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of the JAK tyrosine kinase and to compete with STAT proteins for binding to phosphotyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of cytokine receptors (7.Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A. Nature. 1997; 387: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 8.Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). Similarly, the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 has been shown to be recruited to cytokine receptor to attenuate gp130-mediated signaling by modulating JAK activation (9.Kim H. Hawley T.S. Hawley R.G. Baumann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1525-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Removal of activated STAT proteins from the nucleus has been shown to require phosphatase action, with reappearance of the STAT in the cytoplasm in a dephosphorylated state (10.Haspel R. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 11.Haspel R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Others experiments have also indicated an important role for proteolytic degradation in this inhibitory pathway (12.Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated STAT proteins have been detected in association with ubiquitin, whereas proteasome inhibitors prolong the activation of these transcription factors (12.Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Association with inhibitory molecules has also been recently described; the PIAS family of proteins was identified as negative regulators of STAT activity (13.Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Association between PIAS and STAT proteins occurs after cytokine stimulation and requires tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor. PIAS proteins have been shown to inhibit DNA binding, but the precise mechanism of STAT down-modulation remains to be clarified. Interestingly, these experiments have suggested the involvement of specific PIAS protein in the STAT1 and STAT3 signaling pathways (14.Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Additional stimuli can also block the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, suggesting that there are several ways for limiting the strength and duration of cytokine signaling (15.Sengupta T. Talbot E. Scherle P. Ivashkiv L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Mitogenic stimulation leads to the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle through the synthesis of proteins termed cyclins (16.Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 547-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). This progression is thought to be regulated by the periodic activation of complexes of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). Cdks are activated by cyclin association, phosphorylation by cdk-activating kinase, and association with cdk inhibitors such as p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 (17.Dynlacht B. Nature. 1997; 389: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 19.Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1996; 6: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 was originally isolated as a transcriptional target of p53 (20.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar), and it is now known that this protein is a component of a complex containing cyclins, CDKs, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (21.Zhang H. Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 22.Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). An increased amount of p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 in this quaternary complex leads to an inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell cycle arrest (23.Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar), which finally facilitate DNA repair processes. Consequently, expression of the p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 protein is induced by several proteins that inhibit cell cycle progression, including p53, transforming growth factor β, MyoD, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (20.El-Deiry W.S.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). However, the biological role of the p21-cyclin-cdk association remains to be clarified. p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 expression is induced when quiescent cells are stimulated to proliferate (27.Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M. Massague J. Crabtree G. Roberts J. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), whereas the majority of cdk complexes in proliferating cells have been reported to interact with p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 (28.Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Recent results have shown that p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 promotes the assembly of active cyclin D·cdk4 complexes, suggesting a new role for this inhibitor as an adapter protein (29.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). Several observations raised the possibility that p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 has roles at other stages of the cell cycle or during cell differentiation. p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 accumulates near the G2/M boundary and contributes to the onset of mitosis by facilitating the implementation of G2/M checkpoint controls (30.Dulic V. Stein G. Far D. Reed S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 546-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 was also shown to play a positive role in the commitment to differentiate, as this protein is up-regulated in the early stage of differentiation (25.Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 31.Liu M. Lee M.H. Cohen M. Bommakanti M. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). However, this level is decreased at the late stages, and forced expression of p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 inhibits the differentiation of keratinocytes (32.Di Cunto F. Topley G. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Seth P. Dotto G.P. Science. 1998; 280: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), suggesting that p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 may also play inhibitory roles in this program. Finally, other results indicate new biochemical activities for this protein. p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 was shown to serve as an inhibitor of stress-activated protein kinases, and it binds to stress-activated protein kinase and inhibits their activation and enzymatic activity (33.Shim J. Lee H. Park J. Kim H. Choi E.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 has also been shown to interact with and stimulate NF-κB-dependent gene expression through inhibition of CBP/p300-associated cyclin E-Cdk2 activity (34.Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data indicate that p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 could be considered as a bridge between signaling complexes involved in cell cycle, tumor suppression, senescence, and cellular stress. STAT proteins can recognize a conserved element in the promoter of p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 and increase the expression of this gene (35.Bellido T. O'Brien C.A. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21137-21144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 36.Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Thus, p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 may be one of the target genes activated by the JAK-STAT cascade; however, the potential role of this protein in this signaling pathway remains to be determined. In this study, we show that following LIF stimulation, p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 interacts with STAT3 proteins and inhibits the transcriptional activity of these factors. These results reveal that p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 is part of a feedback network controlling the down-modulation of STAT activity. The TF1 erythroleukemia, HepG2 hepatoma, and COS cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum or in RPMI 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 1 ng/ml GM-CSF for TF1 cells. When required, cells were serum-starved for 1–3 days to obtain cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Purified recombinant cytokines were obtained from Dr. K. Turner (Genetics Institute, Boston). Vectors expressing p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1, CBP, and GST-p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 were kind gifts of Dr. M. Roussel, Dr. X. Y. Yang, and Dr. R. Fotedar, respectively. Plasmids expressing the gp130 and LIF receptor β-transducing unit have been described previously (37.Robledo O. Auguste P. Coupey L. Praloran V. Chevalier S. Pouplard A. Gascan H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1391-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies recognizing STAT3 (C20), STAT5b (C17), CBP (A22), p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 (C19), and monoclonal antibodies directed against p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 (F5) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies directed against phospho-STAT3-Tyr705 were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). HepG2 were plated in 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection at a density of 3 × 104 per well. Unless indicated, all transfection experiments were done using the calcium phosphate precipitation method and were repeated at least three times. The amount of transfected DNA was kept constant (1.5 μg) by addition of appropriate amounts of the parental empty expression vector. Cells were serum-starved for 1–3 days, and after 2 washings with cold phosphate-buffered saline, nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Battey et al. (38.Battey J. Moulding C. Taub R. Murphy W. Stewart T. Potter H. Lenoir G. Leder P. Cell. 1983; 34: 779-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of ice-cold extraction buffer was added to the plates (10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). After three cycles of freeze-thaw, cytoplasmic extracts were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 min, and pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Brij 96). Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, nuclear extracts were spun down at 12,000 rpm for 5 mn. Extracts were either used immediately or frozen and stored at −80 °C. For total cell extracts, 200 μl of extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmdithiothreitol) was added to the plates. After 15 min incubation on ice, total extracts were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 mn, and extracts were either used immediately or frozen and stored at −80 °C. Nuclear extracts prepared as described above were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature in 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor. Where indicated, extracts were preincubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of polyclonal antibodies (C20) directed against STAT3 in the presence of 1% Brij 96. A double-stranded nucleotide containing a Stat3-consensus binding site derived from the c-fos gene (sis-inducible element siem, 5′-CATTTCCCGTAAATCTTGTCG-3′) was end-labeled using the T4 kinase, and 10 pg of probe (20,000 cpm) was then added to the protein mixture for 15 min. Samples were then loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (30:1) and separated by electrophoresis in 50 mm Tris, 0.38m glycine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5. Gels were then dried and visualized by autoradiography. Nuclear cell extracts (1–5 mg) were recovered as described above, and immunoprecipitations were then performed in the presence of 1% Brij 96 with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C on a rotator, followed by the addition of 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 45 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min, and loaded on polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then electrotransferred to nylon membranes for 2 h; blots were washed five times and incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) containing 6% bovine serum albumin. Blots were then incubated with the indicated antibodies in TBS, 6% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween, washed five times, and further incubated with antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Proteins were then visualized using the ECL system according to the instructions of the manufacturer, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and 150 μl of lysis buffer was added to the wells (0.1 m KHPO4, pH 7.8, 0.1% Triton). Extracts were then used to measure directly luciferase activity by integrating total light emission over a 10-s period using a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. Luciferase activity was normalized based on protein concentrations. To assess the ability of p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 to interact with the STAT-signaling pathway, experiments were carried out on the human HepG2 hepatoma cell line expressing the LIF receptor transducing complex. STAT3 DNA binding activity was induced by LIF stimulation in this cell line, reached its maximum after 1 h, and then gradually decreased (Fig. 1,lane 2). EMSA experiments were conducted in the presence of antibodies against STAT3 to prove that the binding was specific for this protein (Fig. 1, lane 8). Following LIF stimulation, STAT3 was phosphorylated on Tyr705, and maximal phosphorylation was observed after 1 h, but the signal persisted after 6 h of stimulation (Fig. 1, lanes 9–13). Taken together, these results suggest that STAT3 activity is down-modulated in HepG2 after 2 h of LIF stimulation. To determine whether p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 might be involved in the regulation of STAT3 activation, we first asked whether it could bind specifically to STAT3 proteins. Following LIF stimulation, nuclear extracts were recovered from HepG2 cells, and coimmunoprecipitations were performed alternatively with monoclonal antibodies directed against p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 or polyclonal antibodies directed against STAT3, and proteins present in the immunoprecipitates were revealed by immunoblotting with the reciprocal antibodies. In both cases, p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 and STAT3 were found to coimmunoprecipitate (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4 and 5–8). The interaction peaked after 2 h, and the signal decreased after reaching its maximal level (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 3 and 4, andlanes 7 and 8). Importantly, these coimmunoprecipitations were carried out using nuclear extracts from nontransfected cells; therefore, the association between p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 and STAT3 does not require that these proteins be overexpressed. Pull down experiments showed that STAT3 could be specifically retained by a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-p21 fusion protein but not by GST alone (see Fig. 5). Similar effects were observed in additional cell lines that also express the LIF receptor transducing complex, the 293 human fibroblast, the SK-NMC human neuroblastoma (data not shown), and the human erythroleukemia TF1 cell line (Fig. 2 B). In control experiments, LIF did not induce association between p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 and STAT5b (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and2), whereas no interaction between p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 and STAT3 was detected upon stimulation with GM-CSF (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3 and 4), demonstrating the specificity of the observed interactions.Figure 2In vivo association between p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 and STAT3 proteins. A, HepG2 cells were serum-starved for 48 h and then stimulated with LIF (20 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Nuclear cell extracts (5 mg) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with monoclonal antibodies directed against p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 proteins, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and probed with polyclonal antibodies directed against STAT3 proteins (lanes 1–4). Reciprocal immunoprecipitations were performed with polyclonal antibodies directed against STAT3 proteins followed by membranes blotting with polyclonal antibodies directed against p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 proteins (lanes 5–8).B, TF1 cells were serum-starved for 24–48 h and then stimulated with LIF (20 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described in A. C, TF1 cells were stimulated for 4 h with LIF (20 ng/ml, lanes 2 and 5) and GM-CSF (10 ng/ml,lane 4), and nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies directed against p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 proteins and probed with polyclonal antibodies directed against STAT5b (lanes 1 and 2) or STAT3 (lanes 3–5) proteins. D, HepG2 cells were serum-starved for 48 h and then stimulated with LIF (20 ng/ml) for 2 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and extracts (1 mg) were either left untreated (lane 2) or sequentially depleted by three rounds of immunoprecipitation with either polyclonal antibodies directed against the CBP (lane 1), STAT3 proteins (lane 5), or monoclonal antibodies directed against the IL-6 receptor gp130 (lane 3) or p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 (lane 6). A nonimmune mouse serum was used as a negative control (lane 4).

Nuclear extracts (1 mg) were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with GST alone (lane 1) or GST-p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 (lane 2) on glutathione beads. Samples were washed three times and separated by SDS-PAGE on 6% polyacrylamide gels. Membranes were then blotted with polyclonal antibodies directed against CBP (top) or STAT3 proteins (bottom). B,HepG2 cells were serum-starved for 48 h and then stimulated with LIF (20 ng/ml) for 2 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and extracts (1 mg) were either left untreated (lane 2) or subjected to three rounds of immunodepletion with either polyclonal antibodies directed against STAT3 proteins (lane 1) or CBP (lane 5), or monoclonal antibodies directed against the IL-6 receptor gp130 (lane 3) or p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 (lane 6). A nonimmune mouse serum was used as a negative control (lane 3). Following depletion, supernatants were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies directed against CBP proteins, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and probed with polyclonal antibodies directed against CBP.C, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid gene and a vector expressing STAT3, together with vectors encoding p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 (lanes 3 and 4) or CBP (lane 4). Following transfection, cells were serum-starved for 36 h and stimulated overnight with LIF (20 ng/ml, lanes 2–4). Cytoplasmic extracts were then prepared and processed to measure luciferase activity.

Depleted lysates were then precipitated and blotted with anti-STAT3 antibodies, in order to estimate the STAT3 residual level that remained unassociated with p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 proteins (Fig. 2 D). Three rounds of immunodepletion with p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 antibodies removed the majority of STAT3 proteins from lysates of induced HepG2 cells, indicating that a substantial fraction of STAT3 proteins is associated with p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 following LIF stimulation (Fig.2 D, compare lanes 2–4 and 6). As described previously, STAT3 proteins also coprecipitated with the CREB-binding protein (CBP) (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 1 and 2), with antibodies to STAT3 (Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 2 and 5), but no depletion was observed when a nonimmune mouse serum or antibodies directed against the gp130 cytokine receptor were used (Fig. 2 D, lanes 2–4). Altogether, these results indicate that STAT3 signaling proteins interact with p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1. Given the general inhibitory activities of p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1, we then hypothesized that its interaction with STAT3 proteins might affect STAT3 DNA binding activity. HepG2 cells were transfected with a vector expressing p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1, and following transfection, cells were serum-starved and stimulated with LIF for 1 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared and tested in EMSA analysis. Following stimulation, one retarded band corresponding to STAT3 proteins was detected (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and2), but no effect was observed on STAT3 DNA binding when p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 was overexpressed (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 2 and 3). To obtain a high transfection efficiency (>80%), this result was confirmed using COS7 cells transfected with vectors expressing gp130 and the LIF receptor β-transduction complex, together with plasmids expressing STAT3 and p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1. Under these experimental conditions, p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 did not modify STAT3 DNA binding (Fig.3 B, compare lanes 5 and 6), although p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 was clearly overexpressed (Fig. 3 B, lanes 9–11) and did interact with STAT3 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7 and 8). As previously reported (35.Bellido T. O'Brien C.A. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21137-21144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), LIF stimulation leads to an increased expression of p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 (Fig.3 B, compare lanes 9 and 10). Importantly, overexpression of p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 had no effect on the expression of STAT3 and gp130 proteins (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and 2). Thus, although p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 is able to interact with STAT3, we concluded from these results that DNA binding is not modified by p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1. We then hypothesized that p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1 could inhibit the transcriptional activity of STAT3. To verify this, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct containing three STAT3 consensus binding sites upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter, together with vectors expressing STAT3 and p21 WAF1/CIP1/SDI1. Following transfection, cells were serum-starved for 15 h and stimulated with LIF, and luciferase activity was measured after 15 h on cytoplasmic extracts. Inclusion of a STAT3-expressing vector in the transfection mix led to a 6-fold increase in expression following cell stimulation (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1and 2). Activation by STAT3 was completely abolished in the pre"

Characterization of Lewy body proteins that interact with α-synuclein may provide insight into the mechanism of Lewy body formation. Double immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy revealed approximately 80% of cortical Lewy bodies contained microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP-1B) that overlapped with α-synuclein. Lewy bodies were isolated using an immunomagnetic technique from brain tissue of patients dying with dementia with Lewy bodies. Lewy body proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of MAP-1B and α-synuclein in purified Lewy bodies. Direct binding studies revealed a high affinity interaction (IC50 ∼20 nm) between MAP-1B and α-synuclein. The MAP-1B-binding sites were mapped to the last 45 amino acids of the α-synuclein C terminus. MAP-1B also bound in vitro assembled α-synuclein fibrils. Thus, MAP-1B may be involved in the pathogenesis of Lewy bodies via its interaction with monomeric and fibrillar α-synuclein.

Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These inclusion bodies often contain filamentous components that are dominated by a single protein whose gene may harbor mutations linked to heritable forms of the disease, e.g. tau protein in frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, huntingtin in Huntington's disease (1.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The dominating protein component normally behaves as a monomeric protein, and factors causing the transition from monomeric to fibrillar states are under intense investigation. Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (2.McKeith I.G. Perry E.K. Perry R.H. Neurology. 1999; 53: 902-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are intraneuronal inclusions comprising α-synuclein-containing filaments as the major component (3.Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.

The N-terminal part has 7 imperfect repeats containing the consensus core sequence Lys-Thr-Lys-Glu-Gly-Val. The C-terminal part has no recognized structural elements but has a strong negative charge (7.Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). The precise function of α-synuclein is not known, but it can bind various ligands, e.g. brain vesicles and the microtubule-associated protein tau. Through such interactions α-synuclein may affect ligand phosphorylation (8.Jensen P.H. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Højrup P. Gliemann J. Jakes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25481-25489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), inhibit phospholipase D2 (9.Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and act as a negative regulator of dopamine release (10.Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H.

Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 12.Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. de Silva H.A. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar) via several rate components of axonal transport (13.Jensen P.H. Li J.Y. Dahlström A. Dotti C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A change in its cellular location occurs in disorders designated as α-synucleinopathies, where α-synuclein accumulates in cell bodies and proximal neurites as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (1.Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). α-Synucleinopathies include Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, all featuring similar filamentous neural inclusions. Except for rare forms of familial Parkinson's disease, the vast majority of sporadic Lewy body cases do not have α-synuclein gene mutations, indicating that dysfunctions of other gene products may impact on the normal metabolism of α-synuclein, so that a similar pathological phenotype is produced. Hence, investigation of α-synuclein-interacting components may reveal novel pathogenic pathways. α-Synuclein-containing filaments display a peripheral distribution in brainstem Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease. This is in contrast to their even distribution in cortical Lewy bodies in dementia with Lewy bodies (3.Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6178) Google Scholar). This difference indicates that cell-specific factors may affect the ordering of the filaments and points to the possible importance of putative α-synuclein filament-binding proteins in the process of Lewy body formation. Such proteins might also give information about differences in the neurodegenerative processes of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, respectively. The microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP-1B),1 formerly MAP-5, is a component of brainstem Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (14.Gai W.P. Blumbergs P.C. Blessing W.W. Acta Neuropathol. 1996; 91: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). High levels of MAP-1B are expressed during brain development, whereas in adults its expression is confined to brain regions with significant neuronal morphogenesis e.g. the olfactory bulb (15.Viereck C. Tucker R.P. Matus A. J. Neurosci. 1989; 10: 3547-3557Crossref Google Scholar, 16.Ohyu J. Yamanouchi H. Takashima S. Brain Dev. 1997; 19: 541-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The increased level of MAP-1B in brainstem Lewy bodies suggest that the inclusion may perturb MAP-1B metabolism in affected neurons. Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of dementia next to Alzheimer's disease (2.McKeith I.G. Perry E.K. Perry R.H. Neurology. 1999; 53: 902-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the pathognomonic cortical Lewy bodies are common neuronal lesions, but they have been less intensely studied as compared with brainstem Lewy bodies. Here we have investigated whether MAP-1B is present in cortical Lewy bodies and whether it interacts with α-synuclein filaments. For this purpose we adopted a broad experimental approach, including in situlocalization in brain tissue, biochemical studies of purified cortical Lewy bodies, and direct binding assays for interactions between MAP-1B and α-synuclein monomers or α-synuclein filaments. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were of analytical grade unless otherwise stated. Human full-length α-synuclein was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified as described previously (11.Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), except that anion exchange chromatography was performed on a Poros HQ resin at a flow rate of 4 ml/min (Perseptive Biosystems, Allerød, Denmark). The truncated recombinant peptide α-synuclein-(55–140) has been previously characterized (17.Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The peptide α-synuclein-(1–95) and peptide α-synuclein-(Δ57–94), which was internally truncated for amino acid residues 57–94, were new constructs made by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (17.Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Peptide α-synuclein-(1–95) was purified on a Poros HS cation exchanger (Perseptive Biosystems), whereas peptide α-synuclein-(Δ57–94) was purified using a Poros HQ resin. The identities of recombinant peptides were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry as described (17.Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). MAP-1B was purified as described (18.Pedrotti B. Islam K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4–6-month-old calf brains were homogenized in PIPES buffer and centrifuged at 30,000 × g, 4 °C, for 45 min. The supernatant was collected, adjusted to 1 mm GTP, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min to promote microtubule polymerization. Polymerized microtubules were removed by pelleting at 30,000 ×g, 30 °C, for 45 min. Following further centrifugation for 12 h, 80,000 × g, 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded onto a Mono-Q column pre-equilibrated in MES buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. Fractions eluted at 0.4m NaCl were pooled, dialyzed against MES buffer, and loaded on a Mono-S column. MAP-1B (>95% pure) was eluted at 0.33m NaCl, dialyzed against MES buffer, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. The composition of the purified MAP-1B, its phosphorylation status, and microtubule-binding properties have been described in detail (19.Pedrotti B. Ulloa L. Avila J. Islam K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3016-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Purified MAP-1B was iodinated to a specific activity of 1 Ci/mg using chloramine T as oxidizing agent as described previously for tau protein (8.Jensen P.H. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Højrup P. Gliemann J. Jakes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25481-25489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Sheep IgG was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a C-terminal portion of human α-synuclein (residues 116–131) and affinity purified using the peptide bound to thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specificity for α-synuclein was confirmed by absorption of the antibody using the peptide or recombinant human α-synuclein (data not shown). This antibody gave strong labeling of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in brain sections from Parkinson's disease (20.Braak H. Sandmann-Keil D. Gai W. Braak E. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 265: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Antibody AB97/8 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal amino acid residues 116–131 of human α-synuclein. Antibody ASY-1 was raised against full-length human recombinant α-synuclein. Antibody ASY-3 was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 1–31 of α-synuclein. The latter two antibodies were affinity purified using immobilized recombinant α-synuclein. The specificity of AB97/8 was confirmed by absorption using corresponding peptides (21.Culvenor J.G. McLean C.A. Cutt S. Campbell B.C. Maher F. Jakala P. Hartmann T. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Li Q.X. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1173-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). ASY-1 recognized epitopes within the last 45 amino acids as determined by immunoblotting on truncated α-synuclein peptides (data not shown). Mouse anti-MAP-1B AA6 was from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-donkey anti-sheep, Cy3-donkey anti-mouse, biotin-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG, and Cy3-conjugated streptavidin were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG was from Dakopatt (Glostrup, Denmark), and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 15 nm diameter gold particles was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Brain tissue used in the present study was obtained from the South Australian Brain Bank. Frontal, temporal, and parietal cortical gray matters were dissected from four cases of pathologically verified dementia with Lewy bodies. Sex and age of death of the cases are as follows: male, 67 years; female, 81 years; male 69 years, and male, 68 years. The brains were removed at autopsy within 24 h after death, bisected at midsagittal plane, with one-half snap-frozen and stored at −70 °C until use. The other half was aldehyde-fixed, blocked, and embedded in paraffin. Neuropathological assessment was conducted on paraffin-embedded sections by a neuropathologist. Numerous Lewy bodies were demonstrated by α-synuclein immunostaining in the brainstem, frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices in all four cases. There were no or only occasional neurofibrillary tangles. Control tissues were from three patients dying with non-neurological diseases, with similar age at death and postmortem delay as the patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. There were no significant neuropathologies in the control cases as determined by histological staining (silver, hematoxylin and eosin, and myelin stains) and immunostaining for β-amyloid protein, tau, ubiquitin, or α-synuclein. The procedure was modified from the method for isolating α-synuclein-containing glial inclusions from multiple system atrophy brains (22.Gai W.P. Power J.H. Blumbergs P.C. Culvenor J.G. Jensen P.H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2093-2100PubMed Google Scholar). Centrifugation was carried out with a Beckman J2-MC centrifuge, JA-21 rotor, and Beckman 13.5-ml thick wall polyallomer centrifuge tubes (Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Procedures were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Cortical gray matter was dissected from the brains, mixed with 4 volumes of homogenization buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 50 mmTris-HCl at pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, leupeptin 1 μg/ml, pepstatin 1 μg/ml, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride 17.4 μg/ml), and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, NJ), 10 strokes with a loose pestle and 10 strokes with a tight pestle. Sixty milliliters of homogenate (equivalent to 12 g of tissue) were processed in each preparation. The homogenate was filtered through glass wool, diluted 2.5 times with homogenization buffer, and pelleted at 1,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was washed two times more in homogenization buffer. The pellet of each tube was adjusted to 6 ml with homogenization buffer and Percoll, to a Percoll concentration of 14% (v/v). The sample was overlaid on 2.4 ml of 35% Percoll (v/v in homogenization buffer) and centrifuged at 35,000 × gfor 30 min. After centrifugation, myelin material formed a defined band at the top one-third level of the centrifuge tube. Material between the myelin layer and the sample, 35% Percoll interface, was collected and washed three times by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl-buffered saline at pH 7.4 containing protease inhibitors. The pellet, approximately 0.5 ml, was suspended in 30 ml of 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors, and homogenized at room temperature by 10 strokes in a 50-ml Wheaton glass homogenizer (Wheaton, NJ) fitted with a motor-driven plastic pestle at 250 rpm. The homogenate was filtered through 20-μm nylon mesh (Small Parts Inc., Miami Lakes, FL) and washed three times by 4,000 × g for 10 min in 0.32m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease inhibitors. The resulting pellet was brought to 24 ml of 12% Percoll (v/v) in the sucrose Tris buffer and overlaid (6 ml each tube) on 2.4 ml of 35% Percoll (v/v in the sucrose Tris buffer). After centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min, the material banding just below the sample, 35% Percoll interface, was collected, approximately 1.5–2 ml from each tube. The Percoll-fractionated material was pooled, and normal horse serum was added and adjusted to 10% of total volume. Following 30 min of gentle rotation at room temperature, affinity purified sheep anti-α-synuclein antibody was added at a final concentration of 1.3 μg/ml and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Following 3 washes in Tris-buffered saline, the sample was resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer and incubated with biotin-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (1.3 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Following 3 washes in Tris-buffered saline, the pellet was brought to 3 ml in the same buffer. A sample was taken, labeled with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (1:800), and the number of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites counted. The suspension was then adjusted to approximately 106 Lewy bodies and neurites/ml with Tris-buffered saline. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (M-280, Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were added, in a ratio of 30 beads per Lewy body or neurite (or 45 μl of magnetic bead suspension per 106 Lewy bodies and neurites). Following incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the magnetic beads were washed 6 times with Tris-buffered saline by using a magnetic particle concentrator (Dynal). The washing process was monitored by taking an aliquot of the sample, labeled with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin, and examined under dark field (all particles) and fluorescence field (Lewy particles and magnetic beads, see “Results”). To elute bound material, the magnetic beads were suspended in solubilization buffer (2% SDS, 8 m urea, 17.4 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). The volume of the solubilization buffer was equal to that of original bead suspension used. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the magnetic beads were removed using the magnetic particle concentrator. The supernatant was subjected to electrophoresis. For every 12 g of brain tissue (starting material), approximately 60–80 μg of total protein was recovered from the dementia with Lewy bodies tissue, whereas less than 6 μg of protein was obtained from normal control brain tissue. To prevent contamination between experiments, each case was processed separately. Cortical gray matter from normal control brains was processed identically as the tissue from patients of dementia with Lewy bodies. Reagents (primary and secondary antibodies, magnetic beads, and SDS/urea sample buffer) were added in amounts equivalent to Lewy body preparations. Control experiments were also conducted with Lewy body preparations including 1) omitting the primary or secondary antibodies and 2) primary antibody preincubated with corresponding peptide (20 μg/ml) before adding to the Lewy body fraction. To monitor the inclusions and non-inclusion contaminants, samples were taken at each step, stained for α-synuclein, and examined with light and electron microscopy. For electron microscopy, samples were fixed for 2 h (2% glutaraldehyde, 1% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.4), post-fixed for 2 h in 1% OsO4, dehydrated in cold graded acetone, and embedded in TAAB-embedding resin (TAAB Laboratories, Reading, UK). Ultrathin sections were stained with lead citrate and examined using a JEM 1200 EX electron microscope. An elution buffer containing 2% SDS and 8 m urea was used routinely to solubilize Lewy bodies. Total protein contents were determined by using a Bio-Rad DC protein microassay kit on aliquots of solubilized Lewy bodies or equivalent volumes of supernatant from controls. Some Lewy body samples were solubilized with 70% formic acid for 16 h at 37 °C. For electrophoresis, solubilized inclusion samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in 2% SDS, 2% mercaptoethanol loading buffer, and resolved by 6 and 10–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for analysis of MAP-1B and α-synuclein, respectively. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The sample volume for the solubilized inclusions and the human brain cytosol was equivalent to 20 μg of total protein. Recombinant human α-synuclein (∼200 ng) was used as standard for α-synuclein. Rabbit IgGs ASY-1 and ASY-3 to human α-synuclein (1:1000) and mouse monoclonal antibody to MAP-1B AA6 (1:1000) were used for immunoblotting. Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 125I-MAP-1B binding to immobilized α-synuclein was performed essentially as described previously for 125I-tau binding (8.Jensen P.H. Hager H. Nielsen M.S. Højrup P. Gliemann J. Jakes R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25481-25489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) but using Polysorb microtiter plates (NUNC, Kamstrup, Denmark) and a coating concentration of 50 μg/ml recombinant α-synuclein. The term fibril was used here for α-synuclein filaments formed in vitro to distinguish from the α-synuclein-containing filaments extracted from Lewy body disease brain tissue. All procedures were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Recombinant human α-synuclein was solubilized in fibril buffer (30 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN3) and concentrated to 20 mg/ml in a Centriprep device with 10-kDa cut off (Amicon Inc. Bedford, MA). Prior to initiation of filament formation, the α-synuclein solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 500,000 × g in a TLA 120.1 rotor in an Optima TLX centrifuge (Beckman Instruments) to remove aggregated material, and the supernatant was used for fibril formation. α-Synuclein fibrils were formed by incubating the supernatant at 37 °C for 7 days. The fibril solution was then diluted with 9 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Ligand binding was performed by incubating α-synuclein fibril solution with 900 pm125I-labeled MAP-1B or 125I-labeled transferrin (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Transferrin was chosen as a negative control as it is a soluble protein with no reported relation to Lewy bodies. Bound and free tracers were separated by placing 80 μl of the incubate over 120 μl of 40% sucrose cushion and centrifugation in an Airfuge (Beckman Instruments) at maximal speed for 20 min. One hundred and fifty microliters of the supernatant were collected, and the remaining supernatant was carefully removed from the tube using a cotton swab. The tip of the tube containing the pellet was cut and quantified by γ-counting (Packard Instrument Co.). For light microscopy, tissue blocks were dissected from various cortical or brainstem regions from fresh-frozen brains, embedded in Tissue-Tek (Sakura Fine Technical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), sectioned (10 μm) with a cryostat microtome, and thawed onto gelatin-coated glass slides. Sections were air-dried, blocked with 20% normal horse serum for 1 h, and then incubated with sheep anti-α-synuclein (2.6 μg/ml) and mouse anti-MAP-1B AA6 (1:300) overnight. Following three washes, sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-donkey anti-sheep (1:200) and Cy3-donkey anti-mouse (1:200) and examined with conventional or confocal fluorescence microscopy. Immunoelectron microscopy was used to confirm that fibrous structures prepared as above were indeed composed of α-synuclein and not the artifact of preparations. Three different experiments were performed as follows: 1) labeling with C-terminal directed ASY-1 and gold-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG; 2) preimmune rabbit IgG- and gold-labeled second antibody; and 3) gold-labeled second antibody alone. The last two experiments were controls for the specificity of ASY-1 staining of α-synuclein fibrils. All antibodies were used at 70 μg/ml and diluted in fibril buffer (30 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN3). α-Synuclein fibril preparations (1 mg/ml) were pipetted onto carbon-coated copper grids (3 μl for each grid) and allowed to stand for 1 min. The grids were blocked with 0.1% goat serum for 10 min and incubated with primary antibody or control antibody for 1 h. The grids were then washed twice for 10 min with fibril buffer, blocked for 10 min with 0.1% goat serum, and incubated with gold-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing for 10 min with 0.1% goat serum and 10 min with fibril buffer, the grids were stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 min. The grids were air-dried and examined in a Philips 208 electron microscope. Photomicrographs were taken at × 12,500, 25,000, or 31,500. Immunofluorescence double staining for α-synuclein and MAP-1B was used to investigate the presence of MAP-1B in cortical Lewy bodies. In routine formaldehyde-fixed pathological sections, only a small proportion of α-synuclein-positive cortical Lewy bodies (<5%) and none of Lewy neurites were MAP-1B-positive (not shown). In freshly prepared sections without formaldehyde treatment, however, most α-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies (Fig.1, A–C) and Lewy neurites (Fig. 1, D–F) were MAP-1B-positive. The MAP-1B staining of Lewy bodies and neurites was abolished when the AA6 antibody was preabsorbed with purified bovine MAP-1B (not shown). A quantitative analysis conducted in sections from three case of dementia with Lewy body indicated that more than 80% of cortical Lewy bodies (of total 130 Lewy bodies counted) and neurites (of total 320 Lewy neurites counted) contained MAP-1B immunoreactivity. Moreover, confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed a high degree of spatial overlapping between the two proteins in both Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (Fig. 1,A and D versus B andE). Despite concentrated MAP-1B staining in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the cytoplasm of Lewy body-containing neurons did not show increased MAP-1B immunoreactivity as compared with adjacent neurons that did not contain Lewy bodies or neurons from normal cases. Isolated Lewy bodies were used to investigate whether MAP-1B is specifically associated with Lewy bodies, and the biochemical nature of MAP-1B and α-synuclein extracted from Lewy bodies. For this purpose, we modified a method that was previously used to isolate glial inclusions from multiple system atrophy brain tissue (22.Gai W.P. Power J.H. Blumbergs P.C. Culvenor J.G. Jensen P.H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2093-2100PubMed Google Scholar). Lewy bodies were first enriched through multiple density gradient centrifugation and then captured from crude Lewy body fractions by sequential binding of 1) sheep antibodies against α-synuclein, 2) biotin-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG, and 3) streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. This procedure permits constant monitoring of the enrichment and purity of inclusions during isolation. Fig. 2(A–C) shows a purified Lewy body preparation with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads forming numerous aggregates with α-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies and neurites. These aggregates were not present in normal control brain preparations nor were they seen in Lewy body preparations if the anti-α-synuclein antibodies were omitted or preabsorbed with α-synuclein antigen (not shown, see Ref.22.Gai W.P. Power J.H. Blumbergs P.C. Culvenor J.G. Jensen P.H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2093-2100PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of purified Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites was better appreciated by confocal scanning laser microscopy (Fig. 2 C). Transmission electron microscopy revealed the filamentous nature of the inclusions (Fig. 2 D). Purified Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites were solubilized and resolved by reducing SDS-urea gel electrophoresis and analyzed by protein staining and immunoblotting. Coomassie Blue staining of gels revealed a smeary pattern containing multiple protein bands (data not shown). In human brain cytosol fractions, MAP-1B antibody AA6 detected a high molecular weight band, with some reactivity"
https://openalex.org/W1991974261,"CD40 belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family. CD40 signaling involves the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) to its cytoplasmic domain. We have identified a novel intracellular CD40-binding protein termedTRAF and TNFreceptor-associated protein (TTRAP) that also interacts with TNF-R75 and CD30. The region of the CD40 cytoplasmic domain that is required for TTRAP association overlaps with the TRAF6 recognition motif. Association of TTRAP with CD40 increases profoundly in response to treatment of cells with CD40L. Interestingly, TTRAP also associates with TRAFs, with the highest affinity for TRAF6. In transfected cells, TTRAP inhibits in a dose-dependent manner the transcriptional activation of a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent reporter mediated by CD40, TNF-R75 or Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and to a lesser extent by TRAF2, TRAF6, TNF-α, or interleukin-1β (IL-1β). TTRAP does not affect stimulation of NF-κB induced by overexpression of the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), the IκB kinase α (IKKα), or the NF-κB subunit P65/RelA, suggesting it acts upstream of the latter proteins. Our results indicate that we have isolated a novel regulatory factor that is involved in signal transduction by distinct members of the TNF receptor family.

Flavell R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The receptor is present on many cell types, and its function has been studied most extensively in B cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and endothelial cells. Characterization of mice deficient for CD40 or its ligand CD40L (also named CD154) highlights the importance of CD40-mediated signaling in the thymus-dependent humoral immune response and in isotype switching (2.Kawabe T.

CD40-mediated signal transduction induces the transcription of a large number of genes implicated in host defense against pathogens. This is accomplished by the activation of multiple transcription factors, including NF-κB (5.Berberich I. Shu G.L. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4357-4366PubMed Google Scholar), c-Jun (6.Berberich I. Shu G. Siebelt F. Woodgett J.R. Kyriakis J.M. Clark E.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and STAT3 (7.Hanissian S.H. Geha R.S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the past 5 years we have come to understand in significant detail the cascade that leads from stimulation of TNF receptors to the activation of transcription factors. The signal transduction is triggered by binding of trimeric ligands of the TNF family to their cognate receptors, which induces oligomerization of the latter at the cell surface. This brings the intracellular domains of these receptors in close proximity whereby they serve as a high affinity binding platform for many cytoplasmic proteins involved in signal transduction. Members of the TNF receptor family, such as CD30, CD40, TNF-R75, OX40, RANK, and 4–1BB, have been implicated primarily in gene activation rather than apoptosis and transmit their signal through the direct recruitment of TRAFs (8.Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). TRAFs 1–6 display similar structural features, i.e. they have an N-terminal RING finger (which is absent in TRAF1), followed by 5–7 zinc fingers, and a C-terminal TRAF domain that mediates receptor binding. CD40 associates with TRAFs 2, 3, 5, and 6 (9.Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 10.Rothe M.

The importance of the latter for signaling by CD40 and other receptors has become clear from the characterization of TRAF6-deficient mice. Experiments performed with cells derived from these mice demonstrated that TRAF6 is crucial for CD40L, IL-1, and lipopolysaccharide-dependent activation of NF-κB (13.Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C. Sarosi I.

These results confirmed earlier observations that TRAF6 is involved in gene activation through members of the TNF receptor and IL-1 receptor families (11.Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N.

Recently, TRAF2 was also shown to be essential for CD40-mediated responses in mice (17.Nguyen L.T. Duncan G.S. Mirtsos C. Ng M. Speiser D.E. Shahinian A. Marino M.W. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Yeh W.C. Immunity. 1999; 11: 379-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which TRAFs activate downstream effector proteins remain largely unknown. However, the current data suggest that this involves the interaction of TRAFs with different types of kinase. Some of these are involved in pathways leading to NF-κB activation, e.g. NIK (18.Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), MEKK1 (19.Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M.

Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). These kinases have the potential to activate the IκB kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) (21.Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar, 22.Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V.

This phosphorylation triggers ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκB, resulting in the release of NF-κB subunits that translocate into the nucleus, where they act as transcription activators (reviewed in Ref. 24.Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Signal transduction by members of the TNF receptor family also involves several regulatory factors. Most of these proteins have been identified as TRAF-binding proteins, e.g. A20 (25.Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), I-TRAF/TANK (26.Cheng G. Baltimore D.

Although their precise role in the signal transduction process remains elusive, overproduction of these factors either inhibits (in the case of A20, I-TRAF, TRIP) or synergistically activates (in the case of TANK) TRAF-mediated activation of NF-κB. As a result of a search for novel effector proteins involved in CD40 signaling, this study describes the identification of a novel regulatory protein that binds receptors and TRAFs and that inhibits activation of NF-κB. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma and anti-CD40 polyclonal antibody C20, that was used for Western blot, was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) tag monoclonal antibody was a gift from Innogenetics S. A.

FLAG-hTRAF5-pME was provided by J. Inoue (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan) and P65/RelA-pRc/cytomegalovirus by S. Plaisance (University of Gent, Gent, Belgium). CD40 cDNA was amplified by PCR from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library and cloned into pcDNA3. The cDNAs encoding the cytoplasmic part of human CD40 (amino acids 216–277 (11.Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S. Watanabe T. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Yamamoto T.

Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar)) in-frame with the sequence encoding the LexA DNA-binding domain. The cDNA for the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of LMP1 (amino acids 192–386 (31.Franken M. Devergne O. Rosenzweig M. Annis B. Kieff E. Wang F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7819-7826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was obtained from M. Rowe (University of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom (UK)). Our CD40 deletion and point mutants were constructed by PCR, as described by Ishida and co-workers (11.Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S. Watanabe T. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28745-28748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and cloned into pEG202. Plasmid hTNF-R75-pcDNA6 was described previously (29.Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Vanhaesebroeck B. Grooten J. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2904-2913PubMed Google Scholar), and human TRADD was cloned in frame with an N-terminal E tag, into pcDNA3. 4F2 and TRAF3 partial cDNAs that were picked in our two-hybrid screening were excised from pJG4–5, using EcoRI, and subcloned into the similarly digested vectors pEG202, FLAG-pcDNA3 and HA- pcDNA3. Full-length TTRAP cDNA was cloned in two ways. First, cloning into HA-pcDNA3 was done starting directly from the cDNA picked from the HUVEC library, via digestion withEcoRI and ligation into HA-pcDNA3. In doing so, 34 nucleotides from the library vector and 20 from the 5′-untranslated region of TTRAP cDNA are present between the sequence encoding the HA tag and the translation initiation codon of TTRAP. Second, for cloning of TTRAP cDNA in pJG4–5, a PCR-based approach was used. AnEcoRI site was engineered directly adjacent to the 5′-end of the TTRAP cDNA by amplification of TTRAP cDNA using the primer combination 5′-GACGAATTCAGAGGCGGCAGGAAGATGGAGTTGG and 5′-GCCTCACATCCTGAATGCAGGA. The amplified fragment was then digested with EcoRI and BglII and ligated together with a BglII-NcoI TTRAP cDNA fragment into pJG4–5. FLAG-TTRAP-pcDNA3 and TTRAP-pCS2 were obtained by ligation of the EcoRI fragment from TTRAP-pJG4–5 into FLAG-pcDNA3 and pCS2, respectively. Two-hybrid screening in yeast was performed by the interaction trap cloning method, which is often referred to as the LexA two-hybrid system (32.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic part of human CD40 was cloned in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain (the bait plasmid). Screening was done using a HeLa cell cDNA library in pJG4–5 (the prey plasmid), which was obtained from R. Brent (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). EGY48 (MAT α, his3, trp1, ura3–52, leu2::pLEU2-LexAop) yeast cells were transformed with the prey plasmid, the bait plasmid, and the lacZreporter plasmid pSH18–34 by the lithium acetate transformation method (33.Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). Yeast cells containing bait plasmid and lacZ reporter plasmid were transformed with 20 μg of library plasmid and plated on glucose medium lacking tryptophan, histidine and uracil, to select for the presence of all three plasmids. In total, approximately 2 × 106 colonies were obtained. These transformants were harvested and frozen at −80 °C in a glycerol solution (65% glycerol (v/v), 100 mm MgSO4, 25 mmTris/HCl pH 7.4). To screen for protein-protein interaction, 20 × 106 colony-forming units of an amplified stock of original transformants were tested for a positive interaction phenotype, as described (32.Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). When using yeast two-hybrid as test for interaction, we performed mating assays (34.Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Bait and prey constructs were transformed in yeast strain EGY48 (mating type α) and EGY42 (mating type a), respectively. Northern analysis of human and murine mRNA blots (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was carried out with human 4F2 and the entire cDNA of mouse TTRAP (EST clone 876634) as probes, respectively. Blots were hybridized at 65 °C in QUICKHYB hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The 2-kb-long probe used for in situ hybridization was the same as used for Northern analysis of mouse TTRAP . In vitrotranscription with T3 RNA Polymerase yielded [35S]-uracil (NEN Life Science Products) labeled single-stranded riboprobe. In situ hybridization in sections of mouse embryos was done as described previously (35.Dewulf N. Verschueren K. Lonnoy O. Moren A. Grimsby S. Vande Spiegle K. Miyazono K. Huylebroeck D. Ten Dijke P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2652-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length human TTRAP cDNA was obtained by screening a HUVEC cDNA plasmid library with human 4F2 as probe; colony lifting and hybridization was as described previously (36.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The mouse TTRAP homologue was obtained by screening with BLAST (37.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59416) Google Scholar) the EST data base for sequences homologous to human TTRAP. EST clone 1262914 (GenBankTM accession number AI465781) was requested from the IMAGE consortium (Cambridge, UK) and sequenced completely to obtain the mouse TTRAP cDNA sequence. The coiled coil prediction was obtained by running the program COILS (38.Lupas A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). 293T human embryonic kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glucose (4.5 g/liter) and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of plasmids for luciferase reporter assay or co-immunoprecipitation analysis was done with Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), using 2 μl of Fugene per μg of plasmid DNA. For luciferase reporter assays, transfections were done in duplicate using 3 × 105 293T cells per well of a 24-well plate. Each well was transfected with 15 ng of reporter plasmid NFconluc, encoding the luciferase reporter gene driven by a minimal NF-κB-responsive promoter (gift of A. Israel, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) or 50 ng of AP-1-luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To normalize the transfection efficiency, we co-transfected 75 ng of alacZ reporter construct that contains the Rous sarcoma virus promoter inserted upstream of Escherichia coli lacZ. If the amount of TTRAP plasmid used in transfections was varied, we kept the total amount of DNA constant by adding a Myc-TTRAPmutant-pCS3 construct that does not produce TTRAP protein, because the TTRAP cDNA was cloned out-of-frame of the sequence encoding the N-terminal Myc tag. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity according to the manufacturers' protocols (Promega (Madison, WI) andCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), respectively). Data were normalized by calculating the ratio of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. The average normalized luciferase activity is presented relative to the activity in nonstimulated samples as x-fold activation. For co-immunoprecipitation, 1–2 × 106 293T cells were transfected with 2 μg of each expression vector. In the TRAF-TTRAP co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we noticed that overexpression of TRAFs 2, 3, 5, and 6 resulted in different synthesis levels of TTRAP from the co-transfected TTRAP-pcDNA3 construct. This was probably because of the fact that the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen BV, Groningen, The Netherlands) is sensitive to the different levels of NF-κB induced by overexpressing these TRAFs. To circumvent this problem, we co-transfected 0.1 μg of hNIK-pcDNA3, which potently stimulates NF-κB. Stimulation of cells with CD40L was done by overlaying transfected cells with mouse 3T6 fibroblasts stably transformed with an expression vector encoding hCD40L (39.Pradier O. Willems F. Abramowicz D. Schandene L. de Boer M. Thielemans K. Capel P. Goldman M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 3048-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As a negative control we used nontransfected 3T6 cells. Transiently transfected 293T cells at subconfluence were overlaid with approximately twice the number of 3T6 cells. Cells were harvested 24–48 h after transfection in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 5 mmNA3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg aprotinin/ml). Cells were then lyzed by incubation for 20 min on ice or by passing five times through a 22-gauge needle. Cellular debris and nuclei were eliminated by centrifugation (Eppendorf 4517R, 14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min). Five μg of antibody was added to the lysate and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Gent, Belgium) was added to the samples, and the incubation was continued for 1 h. Next, the-Sepharose was washed four times in 750 μl of lysis buffer for 10 min at 4 °C. Finally, the beads were mixed with 20 μl of sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To verify the expression levels of the different proteins, 0.1% of the cytoplasmic extract was analyzed on Western blot. Proteins were separated on 12.5% Tris-Tricine gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (NEN Life Science Products) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Sigma). For Western analysis, the membrane was blocked in 3% skimmed milk in TBS-T (10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20). After sequential incubation with primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at 24 °C, proteins were visualized with the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (NEN Life Science Products). A two-hybrid screen in yeast was set up to identify novel CD40-interacting proteins. The cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic region of CD40 was cloned into the bait vector, which was transformed in yeast together with a HeLa cDNA library cloned in the prey vector. After screening approximately 2 × 106 transformants, eight different cDNAs were isolated from yeast colonies with a positive interaction phenotype. The corresponding eight polypeptides were tested for interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of other members of the TNF receptor family, i.e. human TNF-R75 and CD30. In addition, we also used as bait the C-terminal 192 amino acids of LMP1 from Epstein-Barr virus. Similar to CD30, CD40, and TNF-R75, LMP1 can signal through direct interaction with TRAFs (40.Devergne O. Hatzivassiliou E. Izumi K.M. Kaye K.M. Kleijnen M.F. Kieff E. Mosialos G. Mol. Cell.

One of the prey plasmids that was isolated in our screen contained a cDNA sequence encoding part of TRAF3 (amino acids 381–568, comprising part of the TRAF-N domain and the complete TRAF-C domain (9.Cheng G. Cleary A.M. Ye Z.S. Hong D.I. Lederman S. Baltimore D. Science. 1995; 267: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar)). This hybrid prey protein associated with the cytoplasmic region of CD40, CD30, and LMP1, but not TNF-R75 (Table I), which is in accordance with published results for TRAF3 (10.Rothe M. Sarma V.

The interaction phenotype of 4F2 with TNF-R75 was somewhat weaker than with CD40 and CD30. Also, the interaction phenotype of the latter two receptors with 4F2 was apparently not as strong as with the N-terminally truncated TRAF3 prey. The 1.8-kb-long partial cDNA for 4F2 encoded a novel polypeptide with no homology to TRAFs or other factors known to be involved in TNF receptor signaling.Table IInteraction test of TRAF3 (amino acids 381–566), 4F2, and TTRAP with the cytoplasmic domain of different receptors, using the yeast two-hybrid assayBaitPreyTRAF3 (381–568)4F2TTRAPCD40++++CD30++++TNF-R75−++LMP1++−−The interaction phenotype was estimated by blue/white staining of yeast colonies.

Staining was scored as blue, i.e. relatively strong and visible within 12 hours (++), strong and visible within 24 hours (+), or as white (−). To obtain a full-length cDNA of this protein, we screened a HUVEC cDNA library using 4F2 cDNA as a probe and isolated a 2-kb-long cDNA. This yielded a complete open reading frame encoding a protein of 362 amino acids, that has been named TTRAP (TRAF andTNF Receptor-associatedprotein). Recently the complete genomic sequence of human TTRAP became available in the data base as a cosmid clone that maps to chromosome 6p22.1-22.3 (EBI accession number AL031775). The sequence of mouse TTRAP was obtained by sequencing EST clone 1262914, and the candidate Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of TTRAP was retrieved from the data base as putative protein predicted from the genomic sequence. Further comparison of TTRAP with the public data bases revealed that it is related to the C-terminal 380 amino acids of the yeast transcription factor CCR4 (42.Draper M.P. Liu H.Y. Nelsbach A.H. Mosley S.P. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4522-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and to a CCR4-like protein named nocturnin, which has been isolated from Xenopus (43.Green C.B. Besharse J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14884-14888Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and recently also from human and mouse (44.Dupressoir A. Barbot W. Loireau M.P. Heidmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31068-31075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CCR4 is distinct from TTRAP and nocturnin because it is approximately twice as big. The alignment of the TTRAP-related protein sequences shows that, although the overall amino similarities are rather low, there are stretches of identical amino acids scattered throughout the C-terminal 250 residues in the alignment (Fig. 1). The data in Table II furthermore indicate that nocturnin is more related to CCR4 than to TTRAP, whereas the C. elegans protein is more similar to TTRAP than to nocturnin. Taken together, our results indicate that TTRAP, nocturnin, and CCR4 belong to an emerging gene family. Neither nocturnin nor the C-terminal part of CCR4 has been characterized functionally.Table IIAmino acid identity (percentage) for pair wise aligned protein sequenceshTTRAPmTTRAPCelTTRAPhnocturninxnocturninmTTRAP69celTTRAP3538hnocturnin323230xnocturnin32293375yCCR4-C3230323937The aligned sequences and their GenBank™/EBI accession numbers are: hTTRAP (human, AJ269473); mTT"
https://openalex.org/W1989920655,"RGS4, a mammalian GTPase-activating protein for G protein α subunits, requires its N-terminal 33 amino acids for plasma membrane localization and biological activity (Srinivasa, S. P., Bernstein, L. S., Blumer, K. J., and Linder, M. E. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 5584–5589). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain mediates membrane binding by forming an amphipathic α-helix. RGS4 bound to liposomes containing anionic phospholipids in a manner dependent on the first 33 amino acids. Circular dichroism spectroscopy of a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1–31 of RGS4 revealed that the peptide adopted an α-helical conformation in the presence of anionic phospholipids. Point mutations that either neutralized positive charges on the hydrophilic face or substituted polar residues on the hydrophobic face of the model helix disrupted plasma membrane targeting and biological activity of RGS4 expressed in yeast. Recombinant mutant proteins were active as GTPase-activating proteins in solution but exhibited diminished binding to anionic liposomes. Peptides corresponding to mutants with the most pronounced phenotypes were also defective in forming an α-helix as measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy. These results support a model for direct interaction of RGS4 with membranes through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions of an N-terminal α-helix. RGS4, a mammalian GTPase-activating protein for G protein α subunits, requires its N-terminal 33 amino acids for plasma membrane localization and biological activity (Srinivasa, S. P., Bernstein, L.

RGS proteins catalytically accelerate GTP hydrolysis on α subunits, resulting in faster termination of G protein signaling. The GAP activity of RGS proteins may account for discrepancies between the measured intrinsic rates of GTP hydrolysis of the α subunit and the deactivation rate of physiological effectors. In addition to their functions as GAPs, some RGS proteins may also regulate G protein pathways by serving as effector antagonists (3.Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 4.Wieland T. Chen C.-K. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8853-8856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As new RGS family members are identified and characterized, it has become clear that RGS proteins can act as effectors, as well as inhibitors, of G protein pathways (5.Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). More than 20 mammalian RGS proteins have been identified to date (1.Hepler J.R. Trends Pharm. Sci. 1999; 20: 376-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All RGS family members share sequence similarity that extends over approximately 120 amino acids. In many RGS proteins, this so-called “RGS box” or core domain is sufficient to bind G protein α subunits and catalyze GTPase activity in vitro (6.Faurobert E. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7.Popov S., Yu, K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1529-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However in a cellular context, regions outside the RGS domain are necessary for biological activity of the protein (8.Chen C. Lin S.-C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10.Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, important regulatory information is likely to be contained within these highly divergent flanking regions of RGS proteins. One way in which these RGS flanking regions can modulate protein activity is by determining subcellular localization. For several RGS proteins, regions near the N terminus are responsible for targeting the proteins to particular cellular locations. RGS-GAIP and RGSZ1 contain cysteine string motifs near their N termini. These domains contain multiple sites for palmitoylation, which is presumed to promote association with membranes (11.DeVries L. Elenko E. Hubler L. Jones T.L.Z. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15203-15208Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12.Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Many other RGS proteins contain protein-protein interaction domains that may determine their localization (1.Hepler J.R. Trends Pharm. Sci. 1999; 20: 376-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that a domain in RGS4 consisting of the first 33 amino acids of the protein is necessary for biological activity and is responsible for targeting RGS4 to the plasma membrane (10.Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). RGS5 and RGS16 share significant sequence homology in this region, suggesting that this region codes for a functionally important domain. Indeed, a recent study has revealed that the corresponding region of RGS16 is also required for membrane association and biological activity (13.Chen C. Seow K.T. Guo K. Yaw L.P. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19799-19806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Wilkie and co-workers (14.Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok J. Danho W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) have shown that the N-terminal domain of RGS4 mediates receptor selectivity, affirming its functional importance. RGS4 and RGS16 are palmitoylated at cysteine residues within the conserved N-terminal domain. However, mutation of the N-terminal cysteines in RGS4 or RGS16 does not interfere with membrane association of the proteins (10.Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13.Chen C. Seow K.T. Guo K. Yaw L.P. Lin S.-C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18836-18842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This suggests that other structural features of the N-terminal domain are mediating membrane attachment. We proposed a model based on secondary structure predictions that formation of an amphipathic α-helix within the N-terminal domain is responsible for membrane targeting (10.Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). When modeled as an α-helical wheel, this domain is an amphipathic α-helix with hydrophobic residues, including the two palmitoylated cysteines, lying on one face of the helix and positively charged hydrophilic residues on the opposing face (Fig. 1). Basic residues aligned on the hydrophilic face of the helix could associate with the head groups of anionic phospholipids of the membrane. Additionally, the nonpolar residues and the palmitate molecules on the cysteine residues may insert partially into the lipid bilayer of the membrane, yielding hydrophobic interactions with the lipid tails in the inner surface of the membrane. The helix is not necessarily continuous throughout the domain. At least two other proteins, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase and prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases 1 and 2, rely on amphipathic α-helices for mediating their associations with membranes (16.Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N.R. Tracey A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19799-19806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have modeled residues 12–30 of RGS16 as an amphipathic helix. Mutations that disrupt hydrophobic residues of the nonpolar face of the helix and positively charged side chains along the polar/nonpolar interface of the helix prevent plasma membrane localization of RGS16, suggesting that amphipathic features of RGS16 are required for membrane association. In this study, we demonstrate using model membranes that RGS4 has an intrinsic affinity for anionic lipids that is dependent upon its N-terminal 33-amino acid domain. We show that a peptide corresponding to this domain adopts an α-helical conformation in the presence of anionic phospholipids. We further demonstrate that both hydrophobic and basic amino acids contribute to the propensity of the domain to form an α-helix. These same residues are required for membrane bindingin vivo and in vitro and for biological activity. These results support a model in which an amphipathic α-helix within the N-terminal 33-amino acids mediates membrane association of RGS4 and its relatives RGS5 and RGS16. RGS4-GFP, Δ1–33 RGS4-GFP, and GFP were expressed in yeast from a constitutive ADH promoter in pVT102U as described previously (10.Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Wild type (WT) RGS4-GFP was subcloned as a BamHI-XhoI fragment into pBluescript for construction of the point mutants. K17A/R22A, R14A/K17A/R22A/K29A, and L23Q/L26Q/L27Q were made using the Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutant RGS4-GFP constructs were subcloned into pVT102U for expression in yeast for microscopy. For expression from a low copy plasmid in yeast, the ADH promoter, RGS4-GFP coding sequence, and ADH1 3′ region from pVT102U were subcloned as aSphI fragment into the SphI site of YCp50. For expression of RGS4 in Escherichia coli, WT RGS4 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction as aNcoI-SmaI fragment and subcloned into H6TEVpQE60 (19.Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This strategy required the addition of an alanine residue following the initial methionine of RGS4 to complete the NcoI site. For subcloning of the mutant RGS4 clones, a modified H6TEVpQE60 vector was created using His6pQE60 (19.Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) as a template. A double stranded oligonucleotide encoding the TEV protease site (ENLYFQG) andBamHI site and SpeI restriction sites was ligated with H6pQE60 digested with NcoI andHinDIII. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were 5′-CATGGCTGAGAATCTTTATTTTCAGGGATCCTAGACTAGTTAATAACCCGGGTAATA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTATTACCCGGGTTATTAACTAGTCTAGGATCCCTGAAAATAAAGATTCTCAGC-3′. The RGS4 mutants were then subcloned from RGS4-GFP-pBS asBamHI-XbaI fragments, removing the GFP tag and allowing ligation into the BamHI and SpeI sites of the new vector to create H6TEV-RGS4-pQE60. As an artifact of this subcloning, restriction sites contributed extra nucleotides at both ends of the RGS4 cloning sequence. After cleavage with TEV, WT RGS4 had an additional two amino acids (GA) at the N terminus. Mutant RGS4 proteins had an additional four amino acids at the N terminus (GSGT) and two amino acids at the C terminus (SS). The integrity of all RGS4 constructs was verified by DNA sequence analysis (Washington University Protein and Nucleic Acid Laboratory). H6TEV-RGS4-pQE60 constructs were transformed into the bacterial strain JM109. 1–2 L of transformed bacteria were grown to A 600 of 0.5–0.8 and induced at 30 °C with 500 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial pellets were lysed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mg/ml aprotinin by freeze-thaw and sonication. His6-TEV-RGS4 proteins were purified by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads (Qiagen). The proteins were eluted with 100–250 mmimidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 50 mmNaCl, and 2.5 mm DTT. Peak fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (NaPi buffer). Purified protein (0.5–2 mg) was digested with His-tagged TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. His-tagged TEV protease and uncleaved RGS4 were separated from cleaved RGS4 by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose chromatography. Cleaved RGS4 was collected in the flow-through and in sequential washes with NaPi buffer containing 0, 5, and 20 mmimidazole. Protein was dialyzed against HEDG buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) and concentrated to 0.3–2.3 mg/ml. GAP activity of WT and mutant RGS4 protein preparations was determined using a solution based single-turnover GTP hydrolysis assay modified from Linderet al. (20.Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant myristoylated Goα(200 nm) was incubated with 1 μm[γ-32P]GTP (10,000 cpm/pmol) (NEN Life Science Products) in 50 mm NaHepes, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% Lubrol for 20 min at 25 °C then returned to 4 °C. GTP, MgSO4 and RGS4 were added to final concentrations of 150 μm, 15 mm and 20 nm, respectively, to initiate GTP hydrolysis. Aliquots (50 μl) were taken at 15-s intervals for the first minute and then every minute for 5 min. Samples were processed as described (20.Linder M.E. Ewald D.A. Miller R.J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8243-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles were prepared using an adaptation of previously described methods (21.Kim J. Blackshear P.J. Johnson J.D.

Lipids (3 mg) (Avanti Polar Lipids) and 1 μCi of [3H]phosphatidylcholine tracer (NEN Life Science Products) were lyophilized and suspended in 400 μl of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 170 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT (buffer B). The suspension was sonicated briefly to break up aggregates and subjected to five cycles of freeze/thaw using liquid nitrogen and a 37 °C bath. The mixture was extruded through two 100-nm pore polycarbonate membranes using the LiposoFast Basic and Stabilizer (Avestin, Inc.) (15–19 passes). The vesicles were diluted 5-fold in buffer C (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEGTA), incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 22 °C. The pellet containing sucrose-loaded vesicles was suspended in 100 μl of buffer C. The lipid concentration of the vesicles was calculated based on the recovery of [3H]phosphatidylcholine in the vesicle pellet. Recombinant protein (0.2 μm) and lipid vesicles (1 mm) were incubated in 100 μl of buffer C for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 22 °C. The supernatant (90 μl, 90% of the total) was removed, and the pellet was suspended in 90 μl of buffer C. For immunoblots, both fractions were solubilized overnight in SDS sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (13% gel) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Micron Separations Inc.). After incubation in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.02% sodium azide) for 30 min, the blot was probed with the polyclonal antiserum WU872 (1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h; WU872 was generated against a peptide (NH2-SFKLKSEFSEENIEFWLAC-COOH) derived from the core domain of RGS1 and is cross-reactive with the core domains of RGS4 and other RGS proteins. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Cappel) and visualized by Supersignal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). For dot-blot analysis, vesicles were added to the supernatant fraction equivalent to the amount added to the initial reaction so that both fractions had the same lipid composition. An aliquot (25 μl) of each fraction was spotted in duplicate onto nitrocellulose using a dot-blot vacuum manifold. Each well was washed once with 100 μl of buffer C. The nitrocellulose membrane was incubated in blocking buffer for 30 min, followed by a 1-h incubation with antiserum WU872. After washing with blocking buffer, the nitrocellulose was incubated for 1 h with125I-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (ICN). After washing, the nitrocellulose was exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for 12–24 h. The image was scanned using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, and the images were processed using ImageQuant software. Bovine brain membranes were prepared as described (24.Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant protein (0.4 μm) and bovine brain membranes (200 μg) were incubated in TED (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) for 1 h at 4 °C. The reaction was loaded at the bottom of a three-step sucrose gradient (1.4, 1.2, and 0.5 m) and centrifuged in a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman) at 35,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The membranes floated up to form a band at the 1.2–0.5 m interface. The membrane band (pellet) and the layers below the band were collected (soluble fraction). The membranes were diluted 5-fold in TED and collected by centrifugation at 200,000 × g in a TL-100 rotor (Beckman). The soluble fraction was precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol at −20 °C for 1 h and then collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. Both membrane and soluble fractions were suspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis as above. Peptides corresponding to the first 31 amino acids of WT and mutant RGS4 were synthesized and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (BioMolecules Midwest). Residues 32 and 33 were excluded from the peptides to simplify the synthesis. The molecular weights of the peptides were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry for WT (3376), K17A/R22A (3234), R14A/K17A/R22A/K29A (3091), and L23Q/L26Q/L27Q (3422) peptides. These values corresponded to the predicted molecular weights of the sequences. The peptides were stored as a solid at −20 °C in a dessicator. A stock solution for each peptide was made by solubilizing ∼15 mg of solid peptide in 1 ml of double distilled water except the K17A/R22A peptide (15 mg/10 ml of water). The concentration of each peptide stock solution was determined by amino acid analysis. Stock solutions were aliquoted, stored at −20 °C, and thawed only once. 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (DPPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) and stored in chloroform stocks under argon at −80 °C. Small unilamellar liposomes were prepared by a method modified from Johnson and Cornell (25.Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4327-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Lipids from chloroform stocks were mixed in small glass vials and dried by nitrogen evaporation followed by high vacuum for a minimum of 1 h. The lipids were hydrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, to a lipid concentration of 20 mm. The suspension was sonicated in a bath sonicator (Laboratory Supply Co.) until the solution cleared. The sonicated solution was centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min in a Beckman TL-100 Ultracentrifuge to remove debris and multilamellar vesicles. The small unilamellar vesicles in the supernatant were used for CD spectroscopy the same day as prepared. Liposomes were examined by high performance thin layer chromatography (26.Macala L.J., Yu, R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid. Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to monitor the ratio of lipids. Far UV CD spectra were taken on a Jasco J600 Spectropolarimeter and recorded on a Dell 486D/50 personal computer for data processing. Spectra were recorded from 250 to 190 nm in 0.4-nm steps at 50 nm/min, with five spectra being averaged together. A 1-mm-path length quartz cell was used with the instrument at ambient temperature. For measurements, peptide and liposome stocks were diluted in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, to final concentrations of 30 μm and 4 mm, respectively (16.Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N.R. Tracey A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25.Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4327-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Background spectra of lipid vesicles alone gave a minimal signal and were subtracted from peptide spectra. Final data are expressed as mean residue molar ellipticity (deg cm2/dmol). The percentage of α-helix was estimated from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm (θ222) using the equation f h = (θ222/θh222∞) + (iκ/N) where f h is the fraction in α-helical form, θ222 is the mean residue molar ellipticity at 222 nm, θh222∞ is the molar ellipticity at 222 nm for an infinitely long α-helix (−39,500 deg cm2/dmol), i is number of helices (assumed to be one), κ is a wavelength specific constant (2.6 at 222 nm), andN is the number of residues in the peptide (31 residues) (16.Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N.R. Tracey A.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27.Chang C.T. Wu C.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The yeast strain used for microscopy was SWY518 (Mataura3-1 his3-11, 15 trp1-1 leu2-3, 112 can1) (28.Bucci M. Wente S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1185-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and for pheromone response assay was BC180 (MATa leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3Δ1 ade2-1 sst2-Δ2) (9.Srinivasa S.P. Watson N. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1529-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown and pheromone response assays were performed as described previously (10.Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Previously we demonstrated that when expressed in yeast, RGS4 requires its N-terminal domain for targeting to the plasma membrane. Although RGS4 is palmitoylated at cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain, membrane association is independent of the post-translational modification (10.Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether the association of RGS4 with membranes occurs via direct lipid-protein interactions, we examined the ability of RGS4 to bind to chemically defined sucrose-loaded lipid vesicles. RGS4 and the N-terminal deletion mutant, Δ1–33, were expressed as recombinant proteins with a cleavable hexahistidine tag and purified by nickel chelate chromatography. The tag was removed by cleavage with TEV protease, yielding the purified protein preparations shown in Fig. 5. Proteins were incubated with synthetic sucrose-loaded liposomes containing 33% brain phosphatidylserine (PS) and 67% liver phosphatidylcholine (PC). Vesicle-bound RGS4 was separated from soluble RGS4 by centrifugation. Both WT and Δ1–33 RGS4 were soluble in the absence of vesicles (Fig. 2 A). The small amount of RGS4 found in the pellet fraction was due to incomplete removal of the supernatant. In the presence of the PS:PC (1:2) vesicles, nearly all of the WT RGS4 was found in the vesicle pellet (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the Δ1–33 mutant remained in the supernatant, indicating that the N-terminal domain is necessary for lipid-protein interaction. Next, we tested the dependence of RGS4 binding on the presence of anionic phospholipids in the vesicles. PS was titrated into PC vesicles from 0 to 60%. RGS4 bound poorly to vesicles containing pure PC but efficiently to vesicles containing 20% or more PS (data not shown). The Δ1–33 mutant required higher concentrations of PS (40% or greater) before appearing in the vesicle pellet (data not shown). We conclude that RGS4 interacts directly with lipids and does not require any protein factor to mediate its binding to a membrane in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of anionic phospholipids (29.Devaux P.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Structure. 1992; 21: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Figure 2RGS4 binds directly to anionic lipids in the membrane. A, binding of recombinant wild type RGS4 and Δ1–33 RGS4 to PS:PC (1:2) sucrose loaded vesicles. Pellet (P) and soluble (S) fractions of proteins in the presence (+) or absence (−) of vesicles were visualized by immunoblot. A mobility shift was seen for the WT protein because of the presence of vesicles in the gel. B, binding of recombinant wild type and Δ1–33 RGS4 to bovine brain membranes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether our artificial liposomes adequately model cellular membranes, we examined the binding of recombinant RGS4 to bovine brain membranes. Greater than 50% of WT RGS4 bound to membranes, whereas none of the N-terminal deletion mutant bound (Fig. 2 B). Thus, qualitatively it appears that our observations of RGS4 association with liposomes are representative of its interactions with biological membranes. Our hypothesis predicts that the N terminus of RGS4 forms an amphipathic α-helix. Structural information for this region of the protein was not available from the x-ray crystal structure (30.Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used CD spectroscopy to examine the structure of a peptide corresponding to the first 31 residues of RGS4. Residues 32 and 33 of the N-terminal domain were omitted from the peptide to simplify the synthesis. Far UV circular dichroism is useful for determining the secondary structure elements of proteins such as β-sheet, α-helix, and random coil. These types of secondary structure can be distinguished by the characteristic shape of the CD spectrum. In aqueous solution, the RGS4 peptide adopted a random coil conformation as seen by the single minimum at 200 nm (Fig.3). To evaluate the conformation of the RGS4 peptide in the presence of liposomes, vesicles were prepared with DPPG and DPPC. This lipid composition was chosen because vesicles containing DPPG and DPPC gave no significant si"
https://openalex.org/W2099450468,"Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a mammalian integral membrane enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of a number of neuromodulatory fatty acid amides, including the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and the sleep-inducing lipid oleamide. FAAH belongs to a large class of hydrolytic enzymes termed the “amidase signature family,” whose members are defined by a conserved stretch of approximately 130 amino acids termed the “amidase signature sequence.” Recently, site-directed mutagenesis studies of FAAH have targeted a limited number of conserved residues in the amidase signature sequence of the enzyme, identifying Ser-241 as the catalytic nucleophile and Lys-142 as an acid/base catalyst. The roles of several other conserved residues with potentially important and/or overlapping catalytic functions have not yet been examined. In this study, we have mutated all potentially catalytic residues in FAAH that are conserved among members of the amidase signature family, and have assessed their individual roles in catalysis through chemical labeling and kinetic methods. Several of these residues appear to serve primarily structural roles, as their mutation produced FAAH variants with considerable catalytic activity but reduced expression in prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic systems. In contrast, five mutations, K142A, S217A, S218A, S241A, and R243A, decreased the amidase activity of FAAH greater than 100-fold without detectably impacting the structural integrity of the enzyme. The pH rate profiles, amide/ester selectivities, and fluorophosphonate reactivities of these mutants revealed distinct catalytic roles for each residue. Of particular interest, one mutant, R243A, displayed uncompromised esterase activity but severely reduced amidase activity, indicating that the amidase and esterase efficiencies of FAAH can be functionally uncoupled. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that amidase signature enzymes represent a large class of serine-lysine catalytic dyad hydrolases whose evolutionary distribution rivals that of the catalytic triad superfamily.

In support of this notion, FAAH-resistant analogues of anandamide show enhanced pharmacological activity in vivo (20.Calignano A. La Rana G. Giuffrida A. Piomelli D.

Life Sci. 1996; 58: 1249-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory has identified the catalytic nucleophile of FAAH as serine 241, one of three conserved serine residues in the AS sequence (13.Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have determined that FAAH does not utilize a histidine base for catalysis, indicating that AS enzymes employ a catalytic mechanism distinct from the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad common to most serine hydrolases (26.Dodson G. Wlodawer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 347-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Subsequent mutagenesis and kinetic efforts identified a conserved lysine residue, Lys-142, as a strong candidate for the catalytic base of FAAH responsible for nucleophile activation (14.Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although the data obtained in these studies clearly supported central catalytic roles for Ser-241 and Lys-142, the abundance of conserved, potentially catalytic residues in the AS sequence raised the possibility that other residues might possess equally important and/or overlapping catalytic functions. Indeed, a previous study on the Rhodococcal J1 amidase, a bacterial AS enzyme, had proposed that a conserved aspartic acid (Asp-237 in FAAH) acted as the catalytic base for this enzyme (27.Kobayashi M.

In order to clarify the roles that conserved residues play in the hydrolytic mechanism of the AS family, we have examined the function of all potentially catalytic residues in FAAH. These residues were selected based on two criteria: 1) high conservation among AS enzymes, and 2) possession of a side chain capable of participating in acid/base catalysis and/or hydrogen bonding. The results of this investigation reveal that only a limited subset of conserved AS residues play catalytic roles, with several other conserved residues appearing to be primarily of structural importance. FAAH mutants were constructed in the prokaryotic expression vector pTrcHis A (Invitrogen) using the Quickchange procedure (Stratagene) (13.Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The N206A mutant was generated using overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (28.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar, 29.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) with two complementary primers containing the desired mutation and two primers at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the FAAH cDNA. The mutants were subcloned into the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) using standard molecular biology procedures. The mutants were sequenced through their entire coding region and found to contain only the desired mutation. The FAAH mutants were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified as described (12.Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All E. coli expression constructs contained a deletion of the N-terminal transmembrane domain of FAAH. Deletion of this region facilitated its purification fromE. coli but had no effect on the enzymatic activity of FAAH (12.Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Importantly, the membrane-binding properties of FAAH were not affected by this deletion, and consequently, all purifications and enzyme reactions were performed in the presence of detergents. Transient transfections of FAAH mutants into COS-7 cells were performed as detailed (9.Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 30.Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2238-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Cells were scraped in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium following transfection, rinsed twice with buffer 1 (12.5 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer 1. The cells were sonicated using a 50-watt tip sonicator and centrifuged in a table top ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The pellet from this spin was resuspended by sonication in 200 μl of buffer 2 (20 mmHepes, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), rocked for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant from this spin, constituting solubilized FAAH membrane extracts, was collected, and its protein concentration was determined using the Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Nearly all FAAH activity and immunoreactivity present in the crude COS-7 lysate resided in this soluble membrane extract. Samples could be frozen in buffer 2 at −80 °C indefinitely with no effect on enzyme activity. Western blots were performed using rabbit anti-FAAH antibodies (12.Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibodies. For FP-biotin studies, samples were treated with 2 μm FP-biotin for 30 min as described (31.Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), followed by blotting using horseradish peroxidase-coupled avidin. All FAAH assays were performed as described using a TLC assay (12.Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13.Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, [14C]oleamide or oleoyl methyl ester (OME) was incubated with FAAH preparations, and aliquots were removed at various times and quenched with 0.2 n HCl. The substrate and product were extracted with ethyl acetate and separated on TLC plates using 50% ethyl acetate/hexanes. The radioactivity associated with substrate and product was then quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Packard Instrument Co.). Initial rates were determined during the linear phase of the reaction (up to approximately 20% conversion at 100 μmsubstrate). Errors presented with activity from COS-7 extracts indicate the standard deviation of the activity present in three independent transfections. Buffers used for standard assays and pH rate profile determinations were identical to those used previously (13.Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thek cat values presented in the pHversus k cat profiles of the S217A and S218A mutants were calculated based on the concentration of purified proteins measured by their UV absorbance at 280 nm as described previously (12.Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Solvent isotope effect studies were conducted in a buffer containing 50 mm Bis-Tris propane, 150 mm NaCl. The pD of the D2O buffer was adjusted with a DCl solution prepared by saturating D2O with gaseous HCl and was measured using a standard pH meter. The pD of the D2O solution was calculated by adding 0.4 to the pH measured by the meter. Reactions were conducted in 95% D2O. The ratio kH2O/ kD2Owas determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of saturating concentrations of oleamide or OME at pH (pD) values from 6.0 to 9.5. Maximal activity was obtained for FAAH between pH or pD 8.5 and 9.5 and the ratios of the activities in H2O and D2O at this plateau level are reported as kH2O/ kD2O. The S217A mutant showed no pH or pD dependence and therefore the ratio kH2O/ kD2Owas pH-independent. Significant homology among AS enzymes is confined to a region corresponding to residues 134–257 of FAAH (referred to herein as the AS sequence). Comparison of the primary structures of 86 AS enzymes over this segment revealed 23 positions where residues were conserved in 75% or more of the aligned sequences (Fig. 1). Of these conserved positions, 11 amino acids in FAAH were selected for mutagenesis based on their potential ability to participate in acid/base chemistry and/or hydrogen bonding. The following mutants were generated: K142A, E143Q, D167A, N206A, S217A, S218A, D237A, D237N, D237E, S241A, R243A, R243K, K255A, and T257A. Initially, attempts were made to express the indicated mutants in E. coli using the pTrcHis vector, a system that provides high expression levels of FAAH protein with a His6 tag for purification (12.Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this system, only the K142A (14.Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), S217A, S218A, and S241A (13.Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) mutants were expressed at high enough levels to permit their purification. The properties of the purified S241A and K142A mutants have been characterized previously and indicate that these residues serve as the nucleophile and general base/acid catalyst of FAAH, respectively (13.Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14.Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The purified S217A and S218A mutants were previously found to exhibit 2300- and 95-fold lower k cat values than FAAH, respectively, with no changes in their K m values for oleamide (13.Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The gel filtration migration profiles and circular dichroism spectra of the K142A, S217A, S218A, and S241A mutants were indistinguishable from those of FAAH, indicating that the observed catalytic deficits were not due to gross structural alterations (13.Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14.Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). All of the other FAAH mutants (E143Q, D167A, N206A, D237A, D237N, D237E, R243A, R243K, K255A, and T257A) were expressed mainly as inclusion bodies in E. coli, preventing a detailed analysis of their catalytic function in this system. Nonetheless, for many of the mutants (with the exception of D237N, D237A, R243A, and R243K), significant FAAH activity could be detected in crude E. coli lysates (data not shown). In order to examine the catalytic properties of the large number of FAAH mutants that were ineffectively produced in E. coli, these variants were expressed in a eukaryotic system. cDNAs encoding FAAH mutants were transfected into COS-7 cells, resulting in significant levels of expression for all of the proteins examined with the exception of the D237A and R243K mutants (Fig.2 A, upper panel). The D237A and R243K mutants were expressed at greater than 20-fold lower levels than FAAH (data not shown), and their analysis was not pursued further. The N206A and D237N mutants were expressed approximately 5- and 10-fold worse than FAAH, respectively (Fig. 2 B, upper panel), whereas all of the other mutants, K142A, E143Q, D167A, S217A, S218A, D237E, S241A, R243A, K255A, and T257A, expressed to levels at least 50% of that observed for FAAH. Thus, the expression of FAAH mutants in COS-7 cells provided a system where the majority of these variants could be directly compared. Importantly, the extremely low levels of endogenous FAAH activity in COS-7 cells permitted the kinetic analysis of transfected mutants with up to 300-fold reductions in catalytic activity. The levels of oleamide hydrolase activity in solubilized membrane preparations from COS-7 cells transfected with various FAAH mutants are shown in TableI. The E143Q, D167A, N206A, D237E, K255A, and T257A mutants retained greater than 10% of the oleamide hydrolase activity of FAAH. When the relative expression levels of these mutants were taken into account, all of the enzymes with the exception of the K255A mutant displayed greater than 25% of wild type activity (the K255A mutant exhibited slightly less than 20% of wild type activity). The D237N mutant showed approximately 40-fold reduced activity, which in combination with its 10-fold lower expression indicated that this variant was at least 20% as active as wild type FAAH. In contrast to the significant catalytic activities displayed by the aforementioned FAAH mutants, the K142A, S217A, S218A, S241A, and R243A mutants all exhibited ≤1% of the oleamide hydrolase activity of FAAH. Thus, only five conserved AS residues (Lys-142, Ser-217, Ser-218, Ser-241, and Arg-243) were critical for the amidase activity of FAAH.Table IOleamide hydrolysis rates of FAAH mutants expressed in COS-7 cellsEnzymeVRelative activitynmol/min/mg%FAAH200 ± 20100K142A0aV ≤ 0.2 ± 0.03 nmol/min/mg, the activity of extracts from cells transfected with empty vector.<0.1E143Q120 ± 1560D167A95 ± 1048N206A21 ± 511S217A0aV ≤ 0.2 ± 0.03 nmol/min/mg, the activity of extracts from cells transfected with empty vector.<0.1S218A2.0 ± 0.41.0D237E23 ± 212D237N4.5 ± 0.52.3S241A0aV ≤ 0.2 ± 0.03 nmol/min/mg, the activity of extracts from cells transfected with empty vector.<0.1R243A0.73 ± 0.070.3K255A34 ± 617T257A130 ± 3065a V ≤ 0.2 ± 0.03 nmol/min/mg, the activity of extracts from cells transfected with empty vector. Open table in a new tab The ∼100-fold catalytic deficiency displayed by the S218A mutant was similar to the 95-fold reduction in activity observed for the E. coli-derived form of this enzyme (13.Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Considering that the K142A, S217A, and S241A mutants all exhibited greater than 1000-fold reductions in k cat relative to FAAH when purified from E. coli (13.Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14.Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), their activities were predictably below the background levels of endogenous FAAH activity in COS-7 cells (0.2 nmol/min/mg). The R243A mutant exhibited more than a 200-fold decrease in oleamide hydrolase activity that, when evaluated in the context of its slightly lower expression, corresponded to at least a 100-fold decrease in amidase activity. The ability of FAAH mutants to react with a biotin-conjugated fluorophosphonate inhibitor (FP-biotin) (31.Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) was examined. Greatly reduced rates of labeling with fluorophosphonates are typically caused by mutations that 1) decrease the strength of the serine nucleophile of a hydrolase (32.Craik C.S. Roczniak S. Largman C. Rutter W.J. Science. 1987; 237: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and/or 2) disrupt residues involved in transition state stabilization, such as those composing the oxyanion hole of a hydrolase (33.Ordentlich A.

Ariel N. Segall Y. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19509-19517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). All of the FAAH mutants that displayed at least 20% wild type activity also exhibited near wild type levels of FP-biotin reactivity (Fig. 2,A and B, lower panels). In contrast, the K142A, S217A, and S241A mutants showed dramatically decreased reactivities with FP-biotin (Fig. 2 A, lower panel), consistent with their compromised catalytic activities. Interestingly, the S218A and R243A mutants, despite their severely reduced amidase activities, reacted with FP-biotin to a similar extent as FAAH (Fig. 2, A andB, lower panels). More detailed kinetic analyses revealed that the S218A and R243A mutants displayed wild type rates of reactivity with FP-biotin (data not shown), indicating that these residues do not participate in the activation of the nucleophile of FAAH. The loss of fluorophosphonate reactivity exhibited by the S241A and K142A mutants agrees with data from previous studies and supports proposed roles for these residues as the nucleophile and catalytic base/acid of FAAH, respectively (13.Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14.Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, the high catalytic activity and fluorophosphonate reactivity of the D237N mutant (Fig. 2 B, lower panel) argue against a previously suggested role for this residue as a catalytic base involved in nucleophile activation (27.Kobayashi M. Fujiwara Y. Goda M. Komeda H. Shimizu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11986-11991Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). FAAH is unusual among serine hydrolases in that the enzyme degrades structurally similar amides and esters at equivalent rates (14.Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The equivalentk cat andk cat/K m values for the amide and ester substrates of FAAH are not due to a common rate-limiting deacylation step but rather to similar acylation rates for these substrates (14.Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The E. coli-derived K142A mutant was previously found to lose this atypical behavior, reacting with esters more than 500-fold faster than amides (14.Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14125-14130Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, the esterase activity of the K142A mutant from COS-7 cells was compromised only 30-fold (at pH 9.0) despite a complete loss of detectable amidase activity. The hydrolysis rates for OME were determined for the S217A, S218A, S241A, and R243A mutants in order to evaluate whether any of these mutations also altered the unusual amide/ester reactivity of FAAH (TableII). The S217A and S241A mutants exhibited negligible esterase activity, whereas the S218A mutant displayed similarly compromised esterase and amidase activities relative to those of FAAH. Although both the amidase and esterase activities of the S217A mutant were below the background activity in COS-7 cells, we observed similar amidase and esterase activities for this mutant when purified from E. coli (data not shown).

In this study we have used Kir5.1-specific antibodies to reveal abundant expression of Kir5.1 in renal tubular epithelial cells, where Kir4.1 is also expressed. Moreover, we also show that Kir5.1/Kir4.1 heteromeric channel activity is extremely sensitive to inhibition by intracellular acidification and that this novel property is conferred predominantly by the Kir5.1 subunit.

The regulation of their production in the vascular system is, however, poorly understood.

In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, changes in membrane potential were induced by high potassium buffer, the non-selective potassium channel blocker tetrabutylammonium chloride (1 mm), and the non-selective cation ionophore gramicidin (1 μm). Superoxide formation was significantly elevated to a similar degree by all three treatments (by ∼60%, n = 23,p < 0.01), whereas hyperpolarization by theK ATP channel activator Hoe234 (1 μm) significantly decreased superoxide formation. Depolarization also induced an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several not yet identified proteins (90–110 kDa) and resulted in a significant increase in membrane association of the small G-protein Rac. Accordingly, the Rac inhibitor Clostridium difficile toxin B blocked the effects of depolarization on superoxide formation. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (30 μm, n = 15) abolished depolarization-induced superoxide formation and also prevented depolarization-induced Rac translocation associated with it.

Recent studies suggest that a neutrophil-type NAD(P)H oxidase is the main source of cellular superoxide generation in endothelial cells (8.Mohazzab K.M.-H. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S.

This multicomponent enzyme includes the membrane-bound cytochromeb 558 (p22 phox and gp91 phox) and cytosolic proteins (p47 phox, p67 phox, Rac1/2, and p40 phox) that translocate to the plasma membrane during stimulation to form a catalytically active oxidase (10.Chanock S.J. el Benna J.

Alternatively, protein kinase C-independent activation of NAD(P)H oxidase involves tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent steps (15.Dusi S. Della B.V. Donini M. Nadalini K.A. Rossi F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4615-4623PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Mitsuyama T. Takeshige K. Minakami S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17.Yaname H. Fukunaga T.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In both pathways, the translocation of the small GTP-binding protein Rac1/2 could be an integral step because it is required in leukocytes for the full activation of the respiratory burst (19.Kreck M.L. Freeman J.L. Abo A. Lambeth J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15683-15692Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20.Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, the mechanisms involved in activation of NAD(P)H oxidase have not yet been studied and may depend on the endothelial stimulus. Recently, Al-Mehdi et al. (21.Al-Mehdi A.B. Zhao G. Dodia C. Tozawa K. Costa K. Muzykantov V. Ross C. Blecha F. Dinauer M. Fisher A.B. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) reported that in isolated perfused lungs the production of reactive oxygen species was significantly increased in the presence of membrane-depolarizing potassium buffer. This may also hold true for other (patho-)physiologic conditions because stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells frequently goes along with acute changes in membrane potential. Moreover, vascular smooth muscle of hypertensive rats has been shown to be chronically depolarized (22.Martens J.R. Gelband C.H. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These acute and chronic changes of smooth muscle membrane potential can be conducted to the endothelial layer via heterologous gap junctions (23.Beny J.L. Pacicca C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H1465-H1472PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Marchenko S.M. Sage S.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H804-H811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the hypothesis of a pressure-induced depolarization, isolated arterioles exposed to high intravascular pressure for 30 min exhibited increased vascular superoxide formation (25.Huang A. Sun D. Kaley G. Koller A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 960-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about the cellular mechanisms that could lead to superoxide generation after depolarization of the cell membrane. In particular it is not clear whether the above mentioned signaling pathways are activated or whether there is a direct voltage-sensitive activation mechanism of the enzyme itself as suggested by the structural homology between NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases and a shaker potassium channel (26.Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We therefore first studied whether depolarization induces an activation of endothelial superoxide formation. Second, we analyzed whether this effect is mediated by protein kinase C or tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent pathways. Moreover, we tested whether depolarization would lead to an increased membrane translocation of Rac, which would make a direct voltage-dependent activation of the enzyme unlikely. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were isolated from freshly obtained human umbilical veins as described (27.Sohn H.Y. Gloe T. Keller M. Schoenafinger K. Pohl U. J. Vasc. Res. 1999; 36: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in Medium 199 supplemented with 16% fetal calf serum and 20% endothelial growth medium (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany). The cells used for experiments were in the 1–3 subpassage. The protein content of the samples was measured by the method of Bradford (28.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). For the measurements of the membrane potential the fluorescent dye bis-[1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid]trimethineoxonol (bis-oxonol)1 was used as an indicator of changes of membrane potential. This dye has been used previously for determination of changes in membrane potential of endothelial cells (29.He P. Curry F.E. Microvasc. Res. 1995; 50: 183-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured on coverslips were preincubated with bis-oxonol (100 nm) in modified Tyrode's buffer (135 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.49 mmMgCl2, 0.28 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES) for 30 min to equilibrate the cells with the dye and transferred into a perfusion chamber. The cells were continuously superfused with modified Tyrode's buffer containing bis-oxonol (0.5 ml/min). The fluorescence intensity (excitation, 488 nm; emission, >515 nm) was recorded every 20 s using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 410). The fluorescence intensities were calibrated in terms of changes in membrane potential using the cationic ionophore gramicidin in the presence of different potassium concentrations according to Langheinrich and Daut (30.Langheinrich U. Daut J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 502: 397-408Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Superoxide formation was determined by the cytochrome c assay. Endothelial cells were incubated in a modified Tyrode's buffer containing 40 μmcytochrome c with or without superoxide dismutase (200 units/ml). After 30–60 min the supernatant was removed, and the reduction of cytochrome c was measured at 550 nm (Ultrospec 2000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The superoxide-dependent part of cytochrome c reduction was calculated from the difference in absorbance between samples incubated with or without superoxide dismutase (ε550 nmol/liter = 21.1 mm−1cm−1). All measurements of superoxide formation were performed in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitorN G-nitro-l-arginine (30 μm) to prevent modulating effects of NO. In separate experiments, the NADH-induced superoxide production in cell lysates was measured. The cells were suspended in lysis buffer (20 mmpotassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.0). In 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (160 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.40) containing aliquots of the samples (5 μg protein content) with or without superoxide dismutase (200 units/ml), NADH (100 μm) was added, and the superoxide dismutase-dependent reduction of cytochrome c (40 μm) was determined for 15 min as described. Endothelial cells were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmorthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, pH 7.0) and further disrupted by passing them five times through a 29-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged (10,000 × g for 5 min), and the supernatants were used for experiments. Proteins were separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following standard procedures and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After incubation with the phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and a secondary antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase, tyrosine phosphorylation was detected with the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate system. Endothelial cells were lysed as described above in ice-cold lysed buffer and centrifuged (500 ×g for 5 min) to separate unbroken cells and nuclei. After centrifugation of the supernatant (22,000 × g for 90 min, 4 °C) the membrane fraction was used. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). Equal protein loading was confirmed by reprobing the membrane with anti-actin (data not shown). The amount of membrane-located Rac was determined using a specific antibody against Rac (Upstate Biotechnology). It recognizes human Rac1 and Rac2. The antibody was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml dissolved in the blocking buffer (20% horse serum, 3% albumin). The secondary antibody (Calbiochem) was linked to horseradish peroxidase. The band intensities for Rac were determined using a videodensitometric system (Bio-Rad). The expression of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunits p22 phox and gp91 phox was determined either by semiquantitative (p22 phox) or standard calibrated competitive (gp91 phox) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Total RNA was isolated using the single step TRI reagent as described in the product protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). 1 μg of the total RNA was used for the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, which was performed with the Titan reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The primer sequence used in this study for the p22 phox is described by Jones et al. (13.Jones S.A. O'Donnell V.B. Wood J.D. Broughton J.P. Hughes E.J. Jones O.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1626-H1634PubMed Google Scholar) (forward, GTT TGT GTG CCT GCT GGA GT; reverse, TGG GCG GCT GCT TGA TGG T). As internal control, the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used. For gp91 phox mRNA expression equal amounts of total RNA were incubated in separate reactions with defined amounts of gp91 phox standard cRNA molecules and subsequently reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers and SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Afterward, 25% of each reverse transcription reaction was amplified in separate reactions with gp91 phox primers (sense, 5′-GCT GTT CAA TGC TTG TGG CT-3′; antisense, 5′-TCT CCT CAT CAT GGT GCA CA-3′). Hoe234 was a gift from Dr. Hansen (Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany). Clostridium difficile toxin B was provided by Dr. M. Essler, University of Munich. Superoxide dismutase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Endothelial growth medium was purchased from PromoCell, sodium orthovanadate was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals, and bis-oxonol was purchased from Molecular Probes. All other substances were from Sigma. Statistical comparisons with and without treatment within the same experimental group were performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired observations. Differences were considered as significant at an error probability ofp < 0.05. For descriptive means all results are expressed as means ± S.E. The resting membrane potential of human umbilical vein endothelial cells was found to be −47.1 ± 1.8 mV (n = 23). Treatment by 90 mm potassium buffer, the non-selective potassium channel blocker tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBA, 1 mm), and the non-selective cation ionophore gramicidin (1 μm) elicited nearly the same magnitude of depolarization, whereas the K ATP channel opener Hoe234 (1 μm) significantly hyperpolarized the cells (Fig.1). The compounds immediately changed the membrane potential, but a new steady state potential was achieved only after 7–10 min. The latter result was due to the low flow rate in the perfusion chamber; the low flow rate was used to avoid flow- or pressure-dependent changes of the membrane potential. The new steady state potential remained constant over the whole perfusion time with a depolarizing agent. The effect of membrane depolarization on endothelial superoxide generation is shown in Fig.2 A. Superoxide formation was significantly elevated by high potassium buffer (90 mm), gramicidin (1 μm), and TBA (1 mm) to a similar degree (0.17 ± 0.03 versus 2.9 ± 0.03, 0.27 ± 0.4, and 0.28 ± 0.4 nmol of superoxide/min/mg of protein, respectively; n = 23, p < 0.01). In contrast, hyperpolarization by Hoe234 (1 μm) led to a significant decrease in superoxide formation (Fig.2 B, n = 11, p < 0.01). This decrease was prevented by preincubation of the cells with theK ATP channel blocker glibenclamide (10 μm, n = 7, p < 0.05). To examine whether a neutrophil-type NAD(P)H oxidase is involved in depolarization-induced superoxide formation, in a separate series of experiments, NADH-induced superoxide formation was examined in lysates of endothelial cells. This method allows the assessment of the amount of assembled and activated enzyme complexes. A depolarization for 1 h by high potassium buffer (90 mm), gramicidin (1 μm), and TBA (1 mm) resulted in a significant increase in NADH-dependent superoxide formation (Fig.3 A; 1.68 ± 0.2versus 3.22 ± 0.36, 3.46 ± 0.54, and 2.87 ± 0.41 nmol of superoxide/min/mg of protein, respectively;n = 18). Accordingly, in intact cells the NAD(P)H oxidase blocker diphenyleniodonium chloride (DPI, 30 μm) significantly attenuated depolarization-induced superoxide formation by 76.2% (n = 10, p < 0.05, Fig. 3 B). Fig. 4 demonstrates the expression of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunits p22 phox and gp91 phox in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Depolarization for 1 and 6 h with high potassium buffer (90 mm) did not affect the expression of these two components of the endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase (n = 3). We examined whether depolarization-induced activation of endothelial superoxide formation involves tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent steps or activation of protein kinase C. Pretreatment of the cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (100 nm) did not significantly alter depolarization-induced superoxide production (n = 12, data not shown). In contrast, the tyrosine kinase blocker genistein (30 μm, n = 15) blocked the superoxide production elicited by high potassium buffer (90 mm), gramicidin (1 μm), and TBA (1 mm, Fig.5) without altering the membrane potassium-induced depolarization (+11.4 ± 1.8 mV,n = 3). Daidzein, an inactive analog of genistein, had no effects on superoxide production. We also examined directly whether depolarization modulates cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. Membrane depolarization (30 min) induced an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several not yet identified 90–110-kDa proteins (Fig.6).Figure 6Depolarization-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in endothelial cells. After depolarization by high potassium buffer (90 mm), the cation ionophore gramicidin (1 μm), and the potassium channel blocker TBA (1 mm), endothelial cells were lysed, separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with an antibody specific for tyrosine phosphorylation (n = 3). Membrane depolarization induced an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several not yet identified 90–110-kDa proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the membrane association of Rac is necessary for a full activation of NAD(P)H oxidase in leukocytes, we studied whether depolarization leads to an enhanced membrane translocation of Rac. Depolarization for 30 min resulted in a significant increase in membrane-associated Rac (Fig. 7,n = 11). Preincubation with genistein (30 μm) prevented depolarization-induced Rac translocation as well as superoxide formation. Genistein-treated cells did not exhibit in the resting state a significantly reduced membrane association of Rac (Fig. 7). Treatment with the Rac inhibitor C. difficile toxin B (0.5 ng/ml) also completely blocked the increase of endothelial superoxide formation following depolarization (Fig. 8, n = 7; *,p < 0.05 versus control; #,p < 0.05 versus depolarization). C. difficile toxin B did not affect the potassium-induced membrane depolarization (+13.4 ± 5.4 mV, n = 3).Figure 8Inactivation of Rac abolishes depolarization-induced superoxide formation. After depolarization with the cation ionophore gramicidin (1 μm) or the potassium channel blocker TBA (1 mm), superoxide formation was determined using the cytochrome c assay. In separate experiments superoxide production was measured in the presence of the Rac inhibitor C. difficile toxin B (0.5 ng/ml;n = 7; *, p < 0.05 versuscontrol; #, p < 0.05 versusdepolarization).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results show that membrane depolarization induces an enhanced generation of superoxide in endothelial cells. This is because of the activation of a neutrophil-type NAD(P)H oxidase that involves a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent membrane translocation of the small G-protein Rac. At the same time, these results make a conceivable direct voltage-dependent activation of this enzyme unlikely. In neutrophils, the membrane translocation of the small G-protein Rac is known to be closely related to an activation of NAD(P)H oxidase and to be essential for full activation of the respiratory burst in phagocytes (19.Kreck M.L.

Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The translocation occurs in response to different stimuli such as protein kinase C activators orN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (15.Dusi S. Della B.V. Donini M. Nadalini K.A. Rossi F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4615-4623PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A.W. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In vascular cells, Rac also seems to be of crucial importance for the production of reactive oxygen species induced by hypoxia/re-oxygenation or by elevated shear stress (33.Kim K.S. Takeda K. Sethi R. Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Zhou Y.F., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Irani K. Goldschmidt C.P. Finkel T. J. Clin.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C838-C847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of the concept of a central role for Rac, depolarization-induced superoxide formation was also abolished following Rac inactivation by toxin B in this study. It is still not clear how Rac affects the activity of NAD(P)H oxidase. Dorseuil et al. (35.Dorseuil O. Quinn M.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) recently reported that the translocation of Rac2 but not of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase subunits p47 phox or p67 phox could be inhibited by genistein in chemoattractant-stimulated human neutrophils, which suggests that Rac may not control the assembly of the enzyme but rather a distal step. This remains to be determined in endothelial cells as well. The translocation of Rac following tumor necrosis factor-α treatment in neutrophils was sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein but not to protein kinase C blockade (15.Dusi S. Della B.V. Donini M. Nadalini K.A. Rossi F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4615-4623PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the neutrophil NAD(P)H oxidase involves tyrosine phosphorylation although neither the phosphorylation site nor the involvement of tyrosine kinase has yet been identified (15.Dusi S. Della B.V. Donini M. Nadalini K.A. Rossi F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4615-4623PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Mitsuyama T. Takeshige K. Minakami S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23611-23615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reported recently that tyrosine phosphorylation of 103- and 115-kDa proteins mediates hydrogen peroxide production in lung fibroblasts by a membrane-bound NADH oxidase. In agreement with this observation in neutrophils, we found that depolarization-induced translocation of Rac (which was followed by enhanced superoxide formation) was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein but not by the protein kinase C blocker staurosporine. This indicates that Rac is activated in a similar way in both cell types. Actions of genistein not related to tyrosine phosphorylation, such as scavenging of superoxides (37.Ruiz L.M. Mohan A.R. Paganga G. Miller N.J. Bolwell G.P. Rice E.C. Free Radic. Res. 1997; 26: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), were excluded because daidzein, a functional inactive analog of genistein, had no effect, a result similar to that observed in our previous studies (27.Sohn H.Y. Gloe T. Keller M. Schoenafinger K. Pohl U. J. Vasc. Res. 1999; 36: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We also found an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (90–110 kDa) after depolarization, of which the functional significance remains to be elucidated. In neutrophils, the respiratory burst is followed by a transient depolarization that is clearly a consequence of the electrical gradient induced by an outward flux of electrons (38.Lukacs G.L. Kapus A. Nanda A. Romanek R. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C3-C14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Gamaley I.A. Kirpichnikova K.M. Klyubin I.V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, this burst-induced depolarization could be prevented by the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor DPI, or this depolarization does not occur in neutrophils from patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease (40.Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Jones O.T. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 41.Whitin J.C. Chapman C.E. Simons E.R. Chovaniec M.E. Cohen H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1874-1878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, however, depolarization preceded superoxide formation, suggesting that a change in membrane potential was the initial step in a signal cascade that involved tyrosine phosphorylation and Rac translocation. The identical effects of structurally and mechanistically different compounds used for cell depolarization on superoxide formation imply that our observations were in fact due to the modulating effects of these different compounds on the membrane potential and not due to unspecific side effects. This implication is further supported by the fact that membrane hyperpolarization by opening K ATP channels attenuated superoxide production. This effect was not caused by an increased scavenging of superoxides by the enhanced production of NO due to hyperpolarization (42.Luckhoff A. Busse R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1990; 342: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), because the effect was observed in the presence of a NO synthase inhibitor. Similar findings with K ATP channel activation have also been described in neutrophils (43.Pieper G.M. Gross G.J. Immunopharmacology. 1992; 23: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The structural homology between NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases and a shaker potassium channel (26.Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) suggests one mechanism by which depolarization could induce a direct voltage-sensitive activation of the enzyme itself. Our results do not support this mechanism because it should have bypassed Rac translocation and the preceding tyrosine phosphorylation. The stimulating effects of depolarization could also not be attributed to an alteration in gene transcription enzyme constituents because a long term depolarization (1 and 6 h) did not alter the expression of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunits p22 phox and gp91 phox. Other investigators, however, observed an enhanced expression of these components in aortas derived from angiotensin II-treated rats, suggesting that an activation of the renin angiotensin system has additional effects as compared with an alteration in membrane potential (44.Fukui T. Ishizaka N. Rajagopalan S. Laursen J.B. Capers Q. Taylor W.R. Harrison D.G. deLeon H. Wilcox J.N. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In conclusion, membrane depolarization results in increased endothelial superoxide formation, which is probably due to an activation of an NAD(P)H-dependent oxidase. A tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent translocation of the small G-protein Rac is involved in these processes, which may represent a new and interesting target for therapeutic control of endothelial superoxide production. Because many vasoactive compounds go along with transient changes of endothelial membrane potential (45.Mehrke G. Pohl U. Daut J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 439: 277-299Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the mechanisms described here may represent a basic component in the control of vascular superoxide production. We thank D. Goessel and E. Musiol for excellent technical assistance and Paula H. Sohn for helpful discussions."

Sphingosine, ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and other sphingolipid derivatives are also known to play central roles in apoptosis, cellular senescence, cell cycle regulation, inflammation, tumor development, and intracellular calcium mobilization (2.Hannun Y.A.

Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 6.Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin.

Being ubiquitous and essential components of eukaryotic plasma membranes, sphingolipids are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans (8.Hakomori S. Kanfer J.N. Hakomori S. Handbook of Lipid Research: Sphingolipid Biochemistry. 3. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 1-150Google Scholar, 9.Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has several advantages as a model system to study sphingolipid-mediated cellular regulation. First, the basic structure and metabolism of sphingolipids are conserved between yeast and mammals, and yet yeast has only three major species of sphingolipids, whereas mammalian cells may contain more than 300 distinct molecular species (10.Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Second, yeast is a genetically tractable organism whose genome has been completely sequenced (11.Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Hoheisel J.D. Jacq C. Johnston M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Philippsen P. Tettelin H. Oliver S.G. Science. 1996; 274: 546-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar). Lastly, many yeast genes encoding sphingolipid biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes have been recently identified (12.Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The controlled expression of these genes can be exploited to modulate intracellular levels of certain sphingolipids and their derivatives. The LCB1 and LCB2 genes encode serine palmitoyltransferase, which catalyzes the first committed step in yeast sphingolipid biosynthesis, the condensation of l-serine and palmitoyl-CoA to produce 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS)1 (13.Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 14.Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7899-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recently, heat stress was shown to increase cellular levels of sphingoid bases (dihydrosphingosine (DHS) and phytosphingosine (PHS)) and ceramides with little effect on the levels of complex sphingolipids (15.Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 16.Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Skrzypek M.

This increase in sphingoid bases is blocked in an lcb1mutant, suggesting the de novo synthesis of sphingoid bases by serine palmitoyltransferase. This suggests potential involvement of sphingolipids in stress response, but the biological consequences of such an increase in the levels of cellular sphingoid bases and ceramides have been obscure. Moreover, these studies could not differentiate whether sphingolipids maintain plasma membrane integrity or are involved in relaying stress signals to downstream effectors. In this study, we set out to understand the role of sphingolipids in yeast stress response and the mechanism by which these lipids exert biological effects. This study led us to identify an essential function for serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT) and the de novo synthesis of PHS in mediating stress effects on nutrient permeases via a mechanism involving ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study include the following: JK9–3da(MAT a trp1 his4 leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 rme1 HML a) (17.Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hiestand P.C. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recipes for media and yeast genetic methods followed standard protocols (25.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods in Enzymology Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. 194. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). For solid media, after media were autoclaved and cooled down, sphingolipid derivatives were added to the media together with Tergitol (type NP-40; Sigma) to the final concentration of 0.05% for even distribution of the lipids (26.Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10200-10203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nitrogen starvation medium is 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Difco) plus 2% glucose, and carbon starvation medium is synthetic complete (SC) minus glucose. Tetrad dissection was performed after incubation of yeast cells on a sporulation medium for three or more days at 30 °C and resuspending and incubating the yeast cells in 100 μl of Zymolyase 20T (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) for 10 min at room temperature. Yeast transformation followed the protocol developed by Gietz et al. (27.Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Gene disruptions were carried out as described previously (28.Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2237) Google Scholar). In short, open reading frames were replaced by the PCR products consisting of the G418R gene cassette flanked by 43-base pair sequence homology to targeted genes on both sides of an open reading frame. Each gene disruption was confirmed by PCR, which was designed to amplify the specific chimeric junction of the target gene and the G418R cassette. PHS and stearylamine (STA) were purchased from Sigma, DHS was from Biomol, and KDS and C2-phytoceramide (PHC), which wasN-acetylated from PHS, were gifts from Dr. Alicja Bielawska (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). The quality of these sphingolipid derivatives was controlled by thin-layer chromatography for apparent homogeneity. Stock solutions were made in ethanol at 20 mm, stored at −20 °C, and warmed up before use to redissolve precipitates. Tritiatedl-histidine, l-leucine,l-tryptophan, l-serine, and uracil (1 mCi/ml each) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. Measurement of yeast growth was carried out as described previously (29.Chung N. Obeid L.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, in liquid culture, an overnight culture of cells at exponential growth phase was diluted into fresh medium containing indicated lipids or ethanol as a control. While incubating in a shaking incubator at 30 °C, growth was monitored at a given time by measuring absorbance at 600 nm (A 600), and the numbers were converted into cell density (cells/ml), using a pre-configured conversion table, when it was necessary. On solid medium, a small amount of cells from a single colony were streaked by three successive uses of toothpicks, or exponential-phase cells in liquid culture were plated onto medium. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days and photographed for our record. Isogenic wild-type andlcb1–100 mutant cells were grown at 24 °C until exponential phase, harvested, and resuspended in media at either 24 or 39 °C. After 15 min, an equal number of cells were harvested, processed for high performance liquid chromatographic analysis, and normalized by a phosphate assay as described previously (15.Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Log-phase cells were treated with the indicated sphingolipid derivatives or ethanol for 2 h, and total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). 20 μg of total RNA per lane were loaded onto 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and transfer and hybridization were carried out as described previously (30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes were prepared with a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. Cells were treated as in the Northern analysis procedure. Protein was extracted as described previously (31.Romanos M.A. Scorer C.A. Clare J.J. Glover D.M. Hames B.D. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 123-167Google Scholar), and the concentration was determined by the Bradford method. 10 (for Fur4 and Cpr1) or 30 (for Deg1-βGal, ubiquitin, and ubiquitin-Myc) μg of total proteins per lane were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and routinely stained with Ponceau S for checking even loading and transfer. Western blotting was performed according to a previously published procedure (32.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Fur4 antiserum (1:20,000 dilution; gift of Dr. R. Haguenauer-Tsapis; see Refs. 22.Galan J.M. Moreau V. André B. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol.

Membranes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with the following proper secondary antibodies: goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 dilution; Jackson Immunoresearch) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000 dilution; Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were again washed three times with PBS, and protein bands were visualized using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In this study we investigated whether sphingolipids mediate stress signals in S. cerevisiae. We have found that PHS specifically inhibits import of various nutrients, such as uracil, into yeast cells. 2N. Chung, Y. A. Hannun, and L. M. Obeid, unpublished data. Here we determined the mechanisms by which PHS inhibits uracil transport. Uracil import is mediated by the uracil permease (Fur4), a member of the major facilitator superfamily (36.Chevallier M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fur4 activity is known to be down-regulated upon heat stress and starvation (22.Galan J.M. Moreau V. André B. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 37.Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Geraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting Fur4 is a target of stress response pathways. We tested whether the inhibitory effect of PHS on uracil permease activity is due to a decrease in levels of the Fur4 protein. When yeast cells were exposed to PHS (20 μm), Fur4 protein levels started to decrease by 15 min and were almost undetectable by 2 h (Fig.1 A). In contrast, PHS did not alter the level of a control protein (Cpr1) (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to PHS, other closely related lipids including DHS, KDS, C2-PHC, and STA had little or no effect on Fur4 (Fig.1 B). Next, we determined whether the effect of PHS on Fur4 activity was physiologically relevant. Previous studies have demonstrated that PHS levels increase upon heat stress (15.Jenkins G.M. Richards A. Wahl T. Mao C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 16.Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Skrzypek M. Tillman P. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30196-30200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and that heat stress inhibits Fur4 activity (37.Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Geraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether PHS is necessary for Fur4 degradation in response to heat stress. To address this, we utilized anS. cerevisiae strain containing a conditional mutation in the LCB1 gene (lcb1–100), which encodes SPT, an essential enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step inde novo synthesis of PHS (13.Buede R. Rinker-Schaffer C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The lcb1–100strain is a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant strain, whose growth is arrested at 37 °C and slow even at the permissive temperature (24 °C) (18.Sutterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmoller F. Schroder S. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that SPT activity in thelcb1–100 strain is impaired to some degree even at 24 °C. The ts phenotype is reversible if the incubation temperature is returned from 37 to 24 °C or if the growth medium is supplemented with 5 mm PHS when the mutant is grown at 37 °C, indicating that the growth defects of the lcb1–100 strain are due to a defect in sphingolipid synthesis. Because thelcb1–100 allele was originally isolated as an endocytosis mutant (end8–1) and later shown to be a temperature-sensitive allele of the LCB1 gene, we first tested whether this mutation affects SPT activity and PHS generation. In wild-type cells 15 min of heat stress increased cellular levels of PHS severalfold. In contrast, in the lcb1–100 mutant cells, heat stress had little effect on PHS levels (Fig.2 A). We next evaluated Fur4 degradation in this model. With a short time lag in wild-type cells, Fur4 degradation followed the rise in PHS levels such that upon heat stress, Fur4 levels dropped soon after the increase in PHS and completely disappeared by 30 min of heat stress (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, in the lcb-100 strain upon heat stress, which blocked the generation of PHS by inactivating SPT, the Fur4 protein was stable over a prolonged incubation. These findings suggest that production of PHS by SPT is required for Fur4 degradation. To establish that the function of Lcb1 is to supply PHS, we tested whether the addition of exogenous PHS to lcb1–100 mutant cells would restore Fur4 degradation. SPT was first inactivated at 37 °C for 30 min to deplete endogenous PHS, and exogenous PHS was then added under conditions non-permissive for SPT activity (37 °C). As shown in Fig.2 C, exogenous PHS restored Fur4 degradation inlcb1–100 mutant cells, albeit not to the level of that inLCB1 wild-type cells. Next, we investigated the mechanism by which PHS reduces Fur4 protein. By Northern blot analysis, PHS does not repress transcription of theFUR4 gene (Fig.3 A). Nutrient permeases, including the uracil permease, are known to undergo proteolytic degradation (38.Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 39.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6903) Google Scholar). The uracil permease can be ubiquitinated in its cytoplasmic tail, which signals endocytosis to the vacuole and degradation (37.Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Geraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ubiquitin ligase, Npi1, and the deubiquitinase, Doa4, are required for Fur4 endocytosis and degradation (22.Galan J.M. Moreau V. André B. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 40.Galan J. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In both npi1 and doa4 mutant yeast strains, the Fur4 protein was no longer degraded upon addition of PHS (Fig.3 B). Moreover, the npi1 and doa4mutant strains were also PHS-resistant. Thus, Npi1 and Doa4 function downstream of PHS in the pathway regulating Fur4 stability. We next addressed whether PHS activates ubiquitination of Fur4 or regulates a step in Fur4 endocytosis independent of the ubiquitination. To resolve this issue, we analyzed the effects of PHS on the Deg1-βGal protein. Deg1-βGal is a fusion protein between the amino terminus of the α2 transcriptional repressor (which contains a degradation signal for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis) and theEscherichia coli enzyme β-galactosidase (23.Hochstrasser M. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1990; 61: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This fusion protein is cytoplasmic and is subject to degradation by the 26 S proteasome pathway, which is independent of endocytosis (38.Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 39.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6903) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, PHS (20 μm) induced degradation of Deg1-βGal. To confirm that PHS-induced degradation of Deg1-βGal was via the proteasome pathway, we analyzed the fate of the Deg1-βGal protein in a doa1mutant strain. DOA1 encodes a regulatory component of the proteasome pathway and is required for degradation of the α2 repressor (23.Hochstrasser M. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1990; 61: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the Deg1-βGal protein was not degraded when doa1 mutant cells were exposed to PHS. Thus, PHS also stimulates protein degradation through the proteasome pathway, supporting the hypothesis that PHS regulates ubiquitination. We addressed how PHS regulates ubiquitination and degradation of Fur4 and Deg1-βGal. Diverse types of stress are known to increase the intracellular ubiquitin pool via transcriptional activation of the polyubiquitin gene UBI4 (35.Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). PHS induced UBI4transcription; however, by Western blot analysis, the levels of ubiquitin were largely unchanged by PHS (data not shown), and Fur4 and Deg1-βGal were still degraded upon addition of PHS inubi4Δ mutant cells at a rate similar to UBI4wild-type cells (data not shown). We then examined other aspects of the ubiquitin system that may have a role in PHS-induced proteolysis. Ubiquitination involves linkage of the carboxyl-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin to the ε-amino group of a lysine residue in a target protein. Monoubiquitinated proteins can be further ubiquitinated through any of three lysine residues on the first ubiquitin; Lys-29, Lys-48, or Lys-63 (24.Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitination serves to increase the efficiency and rate of proteolysis (40.Galan J. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We tested whether PHS increases polyubiquitination by measuring the formation of ubiquitin-ubiquitin (ub-ub) dimers from monomeric ubiquitin in the presence of PHS. As shown in Fig.5 A, PHS increased ub-ub dimer formation in a dose-dependent manner. We next measured PHS-induced ub-ub dimer formation through specific lysine residues by utilizing ubiquitin mutants in which two of three lysines were mutated to arginines. Interestingly, PHS increased polyubiquitination at all three lysine residues (Fig. 5 B). Among these lysine residues, Lys-63 is suggested to be involved in stress responses (24.Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and polyubiquitination of the Fur4 permease (40.Galan J. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), making it a likely candidate target for PHS. To determine whether polyubiquitination through Lys-63 is required for PHS-induced proteolysis, we used mutant yeast strains that express either wild-type ubiquitin or a Lys-63-Arg mutant (K63R) as the sole source of ubiquitin. PHS-induced proteolysis of both Fur4 and Deg1-βGal was severely impaired in K63R ubiquitin mutant cells compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 5 C). Because K63R ubiquitin, like wild-type ubiquitin, can be used in a monoubiquitination reaction, this demonstrates that polyubiquitination through Lys-63 is critical for the PHS-induced proteolysis. We conclude that PHS-induced degradation of Fur4 and Deg1-βGal is executed by a PHS-stimulated polyubiquitination activity that extends through the stress-responsive Lys-63 residue of ubiquitin. Sphingolipids have been implicated in stress responses, but it has been unclear whether these lipids play an essential structural role or function as signal transducers. In this report we demonstrate an essential role for sphingolipids in signaling during heat stress response by showing that PHS targets both the Fur4 protein and the α2 repressor for degradation through two different ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathways. We propose a model in which heat stress activates PHS synthesis by SPT, which in turn signals to activate the ubiquitin system. Considering the ancient origin and evolutionary conservation of both sphingolipids and the ubiquitin system, this stress-sphingolipid-ubiquitin mechanism is likely not limited to yeast cells.

https://openalex.org/W2034668321,"Wound healing is compromised in aging adults in part due to decreased responsiveness of fibroblasts to extracellular signals. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not known. Aged dermal fibroblasts with reduced remaining replicative capacities demonstrated decreased epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell migrative and cell proliferative capacities, as reported previously. Thus, as cells approach senescence, programmedin vivo or in vitro, EGF responsiveness is preferentially lost. To define the rate-limiting signaling event, we found that the activity of two different EGF receptor (EGFR)-signaling pathways to cell migration (phospholipase-C γ) and/or mitogenesis (extracellular signal/regulated-mitogen-activated kinases) were decreased in near senescent cells despite unchanged levels of effector molecules. Aged cells presented decreased levels of EGFR, although insulin receptor and transferrin receptor levels were relatively unchanged. EGFR mRNA levels and production of new transcripts decreased during aging, suggesting that this preferential loss of EGFR was due to diminished production, which more than counteracts the reduced ligand-induced receptor loss. Since these data suggested that the decrement in EGF was rate-limiting, higher levels of EGFR were established in near senescent cells by electroporation of EGFR cDNA. These cells presented higher levels of EGFR and recovered their EGF-induced migration and proliferation responsiveness. Thus, the defect in EGF responsiveness of aged dermal fibroblasts is secondary to reduced EGFR message transcription. Our experimental model suggests that EGFR gene delivery might be an effective future therapy for compromised wound healing.

Since these data suggested that the decrement in EGF was rate-limiting, higher levels of EGFR were established in near senescent cells by electroporation of EGFR cDNA. These cells presented higher levels of EGFR and recovered their EGF-induced migration and proliferation responsiveness. Thus, the defect in EGF responsiveness of aged dermal fibroblasts is secondary to reduced EGFR message transcription. Our experimental model suggests that EGFR gene delivery might be an effective future therapy for compromised wound healing. epidermal growth factor receptor glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase green fluorescence protein mitogen-activated protein kinase population doublings remaining phospholipase C-γ extracellular signal-regulated kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bromodeoxyuridine Problems in wound and skin repair constitute major medical problems for aging adults. The age-related loss of wound healing capacity leads to a high risk of surgical wound dehiscence and infection (1.Lober C.W. Fenske N.A. South. Med. J. 1991; 84: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2.Nicolle L.E. Huchcroft S.A. Cruse P.J. J. Clin. Epidemiol. 1992; 45: 357-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All phases of wound healing are diminished (3.Ashcroft G.S. Horan M.A. Ferguson M.W. J. Anat. 1995; 187: 1-26PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Gerstein A.D. Phillips T.J. Rogers G.S. Gilchrest B.A. Dermatol. Clin. 1993; 11: 749-757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In normal wound healing, fibroblasts are recruited from the surrounding intact tissue into the granulation tissue to proliferate and regenerate a new dermal layer in response to various factors presented in the wound fluid (5.Hay E.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, both fibroblast motility and mitogenesis are critical for wound repair. During aging dermal fibroblasts lose both proliferative and basal migrative capacity (3.Ashcroft G.S. Horan M.A. Ferguson M.W. J. Anat. 1995; 187: 1-26PubMed Google Scholar); this seems to be a major reason for compromised wound healing in aged adults. To compensate, growth factors have been used as adjuvants in non-healing wounds with limited success (6.Beck L.S. DeGuzman L. Lee W.P. Xu Y. Siegel M.W. Amento E.P. J. Clin.

We propose that understanding the molecular bases underlying this age-associated decline in these capacities will allow for more rational and successful modulation of wound repair. Fibroblast motility and proliferation are regulated by numerous growth factors (11.Lawrence W.T. Diegelmann R.F. Clin. Dermatol. 1994; 12: 157-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar); among those that are most robust are factors that activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 (12.Barrandon Y.

These factors, transforming growth factor-α and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor in particular (17.Blotnick S. Peoples G.E. Freeman M.R. Eberlein T.J. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hand Surg. 1994; 28: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), are present during all stages of wound repair, suggesting that they play important roles in orchestrating wound repair. EGFR levels on dermal fibroblasts have been seen to decline in aging, with this decline correlating with decreased mitogenic responsiveness to EGF (20.Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Kokkonen G.C. Mock Y.D. Roth G.S. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3604-3607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 21.Reenstra W.R. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The other critical cell property induced by EGFR signaling, cell motility, has not been investigated during aging. It has been reported that endothelial cell proliferative and migratory responses to a different growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, decrease as human umbilical vein endothelial cell senesce (22.Garfinkel S. Hu X. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Kapnik E.M. McDowell S.D. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, since fibroblasts did not demonstrate a similar correlation between aging and fibroblast growth factor nonresponsiveness (23.Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J.H. Hu X. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells are dependent on fibroblast growth factor for growth, the causal nature of this correlation between senescence and responsiveness to growth factors is uncertain and remains to be demonstrated. Furthermore, the crucial question of whether this concomitant decline in EGFR levels and cell responsiveness is causally or only coincidentally related to a global cellular decline in functioning remains unknown. Recent advances in signal transduction research have defined intracellular signaling pathways that are required for both motility and mitogenesis. Full EGF-induced cell migration requires phospholipase-C γ (PLCγ) signaling (24.Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 25.Ji Q.S. Ermini S. Baulida J. Sun F.L. Carpenter G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PLCγ signaling specifically abrogates cell motility but not proliferation (24.Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 26.Chen P. Xie H. Wells A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); thus, activation of this pathway could be thought of as an indicator of EGFR-mediated cell locomotion. Another major signaling pathway from EGFR is via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which is required for both cell mitogenesis and cell migration (27.Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche J. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 28.Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta K. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the point of divergence of these two cell responses occurs downstream of MAPK kinase in this pathway (28.Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta K. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but remains to be deciphered. Despite the uncertainty of all the signals required for either motility or mitogenesis, these two intracellular effectors, PLCγ and Erk-MAPK, provide intracellular barometers of signal transduction and intermediary markers of cell locomotive and proliferative responses, respectively. We hypothesized that decreased EGFR expression causally results in impaired responsiveness of dermal fibroblasts. We measured negative effects of cell aging on EGF-induced cell migration and mitogenesis. By examining the activation status of the intermediary PLCγ and Erk-MAPK effectors, we determined that the diminished responsiveness was at least partly due to a receptor or immediate post-receptor defect. Examining production and consumption of EGFR demonstrated that the age-related decrease in mRNA transcription outweighed the reduced ligand-induced degradation. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of EGFR restoration in aged fibroblasts. Re-expression of EGFR to the levels seen in young fibroblasts restored the EGFR-mediated responses in the near senescent cells. These data hint at an age-related promoter element in the EGFR gene. Hs68 and other normal human diploid fibroblasts were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD): 23-week male fetus CRL-1475 (obtained at passage 8; hereafter referred to as P8), 1-month-old male CRL-1489 (P8), 17-year-old male CRL-7315 (P5), 83-year-old male CRL-7815 (P3); 10-month-old female CRL-1497 (P6); 84-year-old female CRL-7321 (P3). Human diploid fibroblasts from 16-week female fetus(GM04522A, P6) and 19-year-old female (GM08399, P5) were purchased from the NIA cell repository (Camden, NJ). Cells were passaged by 1:8 split to increase cumulative cell population doubling level by 3 on each passage (29.Cristofalo V.J. Charpentier R. Phillips P.D. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 313-318Google Scholar). Population doublings remaining (PDR) was back-calculated from passaging cells to senescence; PDR indicates the remaining replicative capacity, so that comparisons can be made between cells of different initial doubling levels. EGF was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). EGF-induced proliferation was determined by incorporation of [3H]thymidine by standard procedures (24.Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 12-well plates and quiesced for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME) with 0.1% dialyzed FBS and then incubated with EGF (1 nm) for 16 h. [3H]Thymidine (5 μCi/well) was added, and cells were incubated for a further 10 h. Basal and EGF-induced migration was assessed by the ability of the cells to move into an acellular area as described previously (15.Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on a 6-well plastic dish and grown to confluence in DME with 7.5% FBS. After a 48-h quiescence in media with 0.1% dialyzed FBS, an area was denuded by a rubber policeman. The cells were then treated with or without EGF (1 nm; a concentration that provided maximal motility of Hs68 cells (data not shown)) and incubated at 37 °C. Photographs were taken at 0 h and 24 h, and the distance traveled by the cells at the acellular front was determined. The levels of target molecules were assessed by immunoblotting. Cells (4 × 106) were treated with EGF (1–10 nm). Cell lysates were separated on 7.5% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blot was probed by anti-EGFR antibody (05–104, Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated, Lake Placid, NY), anti-β-insulin receptor antibody (I16630, Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-transferrin receptor antibody (GR09, Calbiochem), anti-α-actin antibody (A-2066, Sigma), anti-phospho-Erk-MAPK (9101, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), anti-pan MAPK antibody (9102, New England Biolabs), anti-PLCγ1 antibody (05-163, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20, Transduction Laboratories). Target proteins were visualized by probing with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by development with a colorimetric method (Promega, Madison, WI). The expression levels of EGFR, transferrin receptor, and β-insulin receptor were determined by densitometry (NIH Image) and reported as a ratio to α-actin, chosen as a housekeeping gene. The activation status of PLCγ was determined by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. Cells (2 × 107) were treated with EGF as described, and lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PLCγ1 antibody (05-163, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Immuno-complexes were captured with protein G-agarose beads and washed three times with 20 nm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium vanadate. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed following immunoblotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20, Transduction Laboratories). The expression level of EGFR was determined by a standard binding assay (30.Wiley H.S. Walsh B.J. Lund K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18912-18920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence in 12-well plates and washed twice with binding buffer (DME with 1% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V; Sigma)). 0.1 nm[125I]EGF (ICN, Irvine, CA) was added to unlabeled EGF (0–10 nm) in binding buffer. Plates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and then the unbound-labeled EGF was collected. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% SDS). Both unbound and bound radioactivity was counted by γ-counter (Beckman Instruments). The number of binding sites was calculated by Scatchard analysis using linear regression. Northern blot analyses to quantitate message levels were performed using 3 μg of mRNA purified by TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Oligo-(dT) cellulose (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was electrophoresed and transferred to nylon membrane Hybond N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and probed according to the standard procedures. A probe for EGFR was prepared from human EGFR cDNA (15.Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was prepared from the human GAPDH cDNA (ATCC). The probes were labeled with α[32P]-dCTP using the Ready To Go random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were analyzed by phospho-image analyzer Molecular Imager System GS-525 and Molecular analyst (Bio-Rad). For RNA stability analysis, cells were treated with actinomycin D (Sigma) (5 μm) for 2.5 h before collecting RNA. P5 and P18 of Hs68 cells were treated with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min on ice. Intact nuclei were collected by centrifugation 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclei then were incubated with 32P-labeled UTP and unlabeled ATP, CTP, and GTP to label the nascent RNA. 32P-labeled RNAs were isolated by TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and hybridized with dot-blotted DNA on nylon membrane Hybond N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 12 h at 42 °C. The membranes were washed and exposed for autoradiography. The amounts of gene transcription were determined by densitometry. Cells were plated in 10-cm culture plate and grown to confluence in DME with 10% FBS. Cells were treated with interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 (50 ng/ml) (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for 4 h or forskolin (25 μm) (Sigma) for 30 min. Ice-cold extraction buffer (50% ethanol, 0.1 nHCl) was added and incubated on ice for 15 min. Extracts were lyophilized and re-suspended in 100 μl of water. cAMP was quantitated using a cAMP assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After the extraction, cells were lysed with 0.1 n NaOH and analyzed for protein content using the Bradford protein assay. Near senescent CRL-7815 cells from an 83-year-old male donor (tested at P6; reproducibly senesced at P7) and Hs68 cells (P18, PDR3; reproducibly senesced at P19) were electroporated with a human EGFR cDNA driven from the SV-40 early promoter (15.Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Green fluorescence protein (GFP) plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.) was introduced in parallel, and GFP expression was determined by fluorescence microscopy after 48 h to assess efficiency of electroporation. Approximately 107cells were electroporated (500 μF, 0.320 kV) with 20 μg of DNA in a total volume of 500 μl. Electroporated cells were incubated for 48 h in DME with 0.1% dialyzed FBS before experimentation. Cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plastic plates and washed twice with binding buffer (as described in Scatchard analyses for EGFR expression levels). Cells were pre-incubated with binding buffer for 1 h at 37 °C and incubated in 0.1 nm125I-EGF (ICN) for 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, and 0 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold binding buffer at the end of incubation. Surface bound125I-EGF was obtained by collecting two washes of the cells with acid strip buffer (50 mm glycine, 100 mmNaCl, 2 mg/ml polyvinlpyrrolidone, 2 m urea, pH 3.0 adjusted with HCl). Internalized 125I-EGF were obtained by lysing the cells with 1 m NaOH. Both surface and internalized radioactivity was counted by γ counter (Beckman). The endocytic rate constants were calculated by the time course of loss of surface-bound EGF and accumulation of internalized EGF (31.Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. Cell. 1981; 25: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Near senescent cells (Hs68 P18, PDR3) were electroporated with 20 μg of EGFR plasmid and 20 μg of GFP plasmid or mock electroporated without plasmid. These cells were mixed 1:1 and plated for analyses. Cells that express GFP are presumed to also express exogenous EGFR. The cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% dialyzed FBS for 48 h before EGF (1 nm) treatment. After a 16-h incubation with EGF, cells were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 1 h. Cells were observed by fluorescent microscope, then cells were fixed by 70% ethanol and stained with a BrdUrd staining kit (HCS24, Oncogene research products, Cambridge, MA) Hs68 cells reproducibly senesce at P19 (n = 4). We note two separate populations in terms of EGF responsiveness: early- and mid-passage (>PDR10) and late-passage (<PDR10) (Fig. 1 A). The average basal cell motility decreases steadily from 360 μm/day in early passage down to 290 μm/day in near senescent fibroblasts, although only by P18 (PDR3) was there a statistical difference in motility. EGF-induce motility was relatively constant until about P13 (PDR18) at >470 μm/day (average 1.7-fold induction); thereafter it fell precipitously to 300 μm/day by P18 (PDR3) (1.1-fold induction). Basal thymidine incorporation remained low but steady during early- and mid-passage (average 8300 cpm) until late passage (P18, PDR3 presented 850 cpm) (Fig. 1 B). EGF-induced mitogenesis was strong early (15-fold for early- and mid-passage) but disappeared as cells approached senescence (0.99-fold at P18, PDR3). These data on proliferative capacities mirror earlier reports (32.Reff M. Schneider E.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 36: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33.Schneider E.L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1979; 73: 15-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), thus validating this use of this cell line for in vitro aging studies. To determine whether the diminutions in absolute and EGF-induced responses that occurred during in vitro aging were mimicked by in vivo aging, dermal fibroblasts from different aged individuals were obtained from the ATCC and NIA repositories. There was variation between individuals, and age of the donor did not strictly predict replicative capacity remaining, as recently reported (34.Cristofalo V.J. Allen R.G. Pignolo R.J. Martin B.G. Beck J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, cells with lower PDR were less EGF responsive, and this responsiveness decreased further as cells approached senescence (Fig. 1, C and D). A second series of dermal fibroblasts from four similarly aged female donors were qualitatively similar (data for female donors are not shown due to space limitations). The variation in individuals may reflect aging of the fibroblasts, as the cells from the 17-year-old male were already at the near senescent PDR6. As the age of the donor increased, the basal motility and mitogenic levels decreased significantly for fibroblasts from the 83- and 84-year-old donors. EGF responsiveness was retained, although the mitogenic response was diminished (average mitogenic stimulus 4.2-fold in fibroblasts from fetus and baby versusaverage of 2.8-fold in fibroblasts from 83- and 84-year-old donors); the absolute EGF-induced levels were reduced with age. Thus, aged cells lost both cell proliferative and migrative capacity, although these cells retained some EGF-induced cell migration and proliferation responsiveness. This was not unexpected, as near-senescent cells would be selected against during the collection and short term culturing of these donor fibroblasts. The data obtained with the early passage in vivo aged cells suggested that the fibroblasts aged in vivo but had not reached the critical late passage at which we note reduced EGF responsiveness. This would be confirmed by rapid loss of EGF-induced responses upon passaging of these cells. Comparing two fibroblast populations, from the 1-month-old male (CRL-1489) and the 83-year-old male (CRL-7815), the cells from the aged individual senesced earlierin vitro (P7 versus P16; n = 2). The basal cell migrative and proliferative capacities gradually decreased during in vitro aging of the CRL-1489 cells down to levels comparable with the CRL-7815 cells (Fig. 1 C). Late passage cells from either donor lost EGF responsiveness in cell migration (1-month-old (CRL-1489): 1.4–1.2-fold; 83-year-old (CRL-7815): 1.8–1.3-fold) and cell proliferation (CRL-1489: 4.7 to 2.3, CRL-7815: 3.1 to 1.1) compared with earlier passages of the cells (<P12 of CRL-1489, P3 of CRL-7815). Thus, cells aged in vivo presented less reserve in their responsiveness to EGF, a situation that may become limiting during wound healing repopulation. Diminished cellular activities could be due to alterations at any intracellular level from decreased signaling to reduced end-target action. To determine the site of age-related decrease in EGF-induced responses, we assessed activation of downstream signaling pathways and receptor functioning in aged fibroblasts (Fig.2). EGFR kinase activity, including auto-phosphorylation, and Erk1/2-MAPK tyrosyl phosphorylation, as markers of activation (24.Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 35.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4235) Google Scholar), were enhanced by EGF stimulation in early passage Hs68 cells. PLCγ tyrosyl phosphorylation, a surrogate marker of activity (36.Vega Q.C. Cochet C. Filhol O. Chang C.P. Rhee S.G. Gill G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), was at a high basal level in early passage Hs68 fibroblasts and was only minimally increased by EGF stimulation. In near senescent Hs68 cells (P17) EGF-induced EGFR kinase and auto-phosphorylation are reduced, and there is little if any PLCγ and MAPK tyrosyl phosphorylation. EGF-induced kinase activity and activation of PLCγ and Erk-MAPK are decreased in fibroblasts from the 83-year-old donor compared with those from the fetal or 1-month-old donors (data not shown). However, the signaling is not decreased to the same extent as the near senescent Hs68 cells; this is consistent with the cell response data. The reduced phosphorylation of PLCγ and Erk-MAPK is not due to availability of these effectors, as their levels are essentially unchanged during aging (Fig. 2). We postulated that the reduced EGFR signaling was due to a receptor-level deficit as two divergent pathways were similarly affected, and EGFR levels were shown to be decreased in an earlier report (21.Reenstra W.R. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Total cellular EGFR levels were assessed using immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (Fig.3 A). EGFR levels in aged cells were down to about half in early population doubling level cells. To determine whether this represented a specific loss of EGFR or whether there was a global decrease in cell surface receptors, the levels of the transferrin receptor and insulin receptor β-subunit were also assessed by immunoblotting and densitometry. These, representing two other classes of surface receptors, were relatively unchanged in aging (Fig. 3 A) when compared with actin, suggesting a specific down-regulation of EGFR levels during cell aging. It was possible that the fewer EGFR were differentially presented, so we assessed the number of binding sites (Fig. 3 B). EGF binding sites decreased during aging down to 40% that of the level of early- and mid-passage cells (Fig. 3 B). The loss of EGFR on the surface mirrored the decrease in total cell EGFR (Fig. 3 A). The decline in EGFR may be due to increased turnover or decreased synthesis. Upon binding, ligand EGFR are rapidly internalized and degraded by a saturable pathway; therefore, we examined internalization of EGF. Internalization was significantly decreased in aged Hs68 and cells from aged individuals (Fig. 4) in agreement with an earlier report (21.Reenstra W.R. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The internalization of EGFR in near senescent Hs68 (P18, PDR3) was 29% that of young Hs68 (P4, PDR45) and, in the cells from the 83-year-old male, was 44% that of the cells from the 1-month-old male. Thus, increased degradation of EGFR was unlikely to be the cause of decreased levels; rather, the decreased internalization would maintain higher levels of accessible, signaling EGFR. To investigate the effects of cell aging on production of EGFR, mRNA levels were determined (Fig. 5). In near-senescent cells, EGFR mRNA levels were significantly reduced compared with expression of a “housekeeping” gene, GAPDH. The EGFR mRNA expression level of near senescent Hs68 (P18, PDR3) was barely detectable (Fig. 5 A), as was the EGFR mRNA expression level of cells from the 83-year-old male (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Aging effects on EGFR mRNA expression levels (A"
https://openalex.org/W2157752410,"The NH2-terminal portion (putative ligand-binding domain) of α subunits contains 7 homologous repeats, the last 3 or 4 of which possess divalent cation binding sequences. These repeats are predicted to form a seven-bladed β-propeller structure. To map ligand recognition sites on the α5 subunit we have taken the approach of constructing and expressing αV/α5 chimeras. Although the NH2-terminal repeats of α5 and αV are >50% identical at the amino acid level, α5β1 and αVβ1show marked differences in their ligand binding specificities. Thus: (i) although both integrins recognize the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence in fibronectin, the interaction of α5β1 but not of αVβ1 with fibronectin is strongly dependent on the “synergy” sequence Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn; (ii) α5β1 binds preferentially to RGD peptides in which RGD is followed by Gly-Trp (GW) whereas αVβ1 has a broader specificity; (iii) only α5β1 recognizes peptides containing the sequence Arg-Arg-Glu-Thr-Ala-Trp-Ala (RRETAWA). Therefore, amino acid residues involved in ligand recognition by α5β1 can potentially be identified in gain-of-function experiments by their ability to switch the ligand binding properties of αVβ1 to those of α5β1. By introducing appropriate restriction enzyme sites, or using site-directed mutagenesis, parts of the NH2-terminal repeats of αV were replaced with the corresponding regions of the α5 subunit. Chimeric subunits were expressed on the surface of Chinese hamster ovary-B2 cells (which lack endogenous α5) as heterodimers with hamster β1. Stable cell lines were generated and tested for their ability to attach to α5β1-selective ligands. Our results demonstrate that: (a) the first three NH2-terminal repeats contain the amino acid sequences that determine ligand binding specificity and the same repeats include the epitopes of function blocking anti-α subunit mAbs; (b) the divalent cation-binding sites (in repeats 4–7) do not confer α5β1- or αVβ1-specific ligand recognition; (c) amino acid residues Ala107–Tyr226 of α5(corresponding approximately to repeats 2 and 3) are sufficient to change all the ligand binding properties of αVβ1 to those of α5β1; (d) swapping a small part of a predicted loop region of αV with the corresponding region of α5 (Asp154-Ala159) is sufficient to confer selectivity for RGDGW and the ability to recognize RRETAWA. The NH2-terminal portion (putative ligand-binding domain) of α subunits contains 7 homologous repeats, the last 3 or 4 of which possess divalent cation binding sequences. These repeats are predicted to form a seven-bladed β-propeller structure. To map ligand recognition sites on the α5 subunit we have taken the approach of constructing and expressing αV/α5 chimeras.

More than 20 distinct integrin heterodimers have been identified, and each integrin recognizes a different set of extracellular matrix or cell-surface proteins. The major sequences recognized by integrins within their ligands have been shown to be short motifs that contain a critical Asp or Glu residue, such as Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD).1 Analysis of the three-dimensional structures of integrin ligands has revealed that these recognition motifs are displayed in surface-exposed sites (2.Humphries M.J.

Although ligand recognition is known to involve the NH2-terminal regions of both α and β subunits (4.Loftus J.C. Halloran C. Ginsberg M.H. Feigen L.P. Zablocki J.A. Smith J.W. J. Biol.

These predictions are supported by extensive biochemical analyses (6.Irie A. Kamata T. Takada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The NH2-terminal portion of integrin α subunits has been shown to contain seven homologous repeats, each 60–70 amino acid residues in length. Repeats 4–7 (or in some integrins repeats 5–7) contain putative divalent cation-binding sites (10.Tuckwell D.S. Brass A.M. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The seven NH2-terminal repeats are predicted to fold cooperatively into a seven-bladed β-propeller (11.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Each blade of the propeller contains four β-strands connected by loops of varying length; these strands are tilted such that the connecting loops are either on the lower or upper surfaces of the propeller. Loops between the first and second, and between the third and fourth β-strands lie on the lower surface of the propeller, whereas loops between the second and third β-strands, and between the fourth β-strand of one blade and first β-strand of the next blade lie on the upper surface. The divalent cation-binding sites are predicted to lie on the lower surface of the propeller.An inserted (I or A) domain of about 200 amino acid residues is present in about one-third of integrin α subunits, lying between repeats 2 and 3. In α subunits that contain an A-domain, this module contains the major sites involved in ligand binding (2.Humphries M.J. Newham P.

Cross-linking of a peptide from the γ chain of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 showed that the major site of interaction was in the fifth NH2-terminal repeat (26.D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3440-3446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An RGD-containing peptide also cross-linked to αVβ3 via a site in the divalent cation binding repeats, although some cross-linking was also observed to the second and third repeats (27.Smith J.W.

In addition, recombinant proteins containing repeats 4–7 of αIIb or α5 have been shown to possess ligand binding activity (28.Guilino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J.

The central cell-binding domain (CCBD) of fibronectin contains a number of repeated modules termed fibronectin type III repeats. An RGD sequence in the tenth type III repeat is the major binding site for α5β1(40.Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar, 41.Yamada K.M. Kennedy D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar); however, α5β1 differs from other fibronectin-binding integrins, such as those of the αVfamily, in that ligand recognition is also strongly dependent on binding of a synergy sequence (Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn) in the ninth type III repeat (42.Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Akiyama S.K. Aota S. Yamada Y. Cell Adhes.

In addition, although several closely related integrins (such as αVβ1, αVβ3, αVβ5, and αIIbβ3) recognize the RGD sequence, the nature of the amino acid residues COOH-terminal to RGD has a major effect on the affinity and specificity of integrin binding. For example, α5β1 shows strong selectivity toward peptides containing the sequence RGDGW, whereas αVintegrins bind well to peptides containing the sequences RGDXF or RGDXR (where X is frequently Ser or Thr) (45.Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 46.Barbas, C. F., III, Languino, L., and Smith, J. W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 10003–10007Google Scholar). In addition, a specific ligand peptide for α5β1, Arg-Arg-Glu-Thr-Ala-Trp-Ala (RRETAWA), has been isolated from a Cys-X 7-Cys phage display library (47.Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Although the RRETAWA sequence appears unrelated to RGD, the binding sites for RRETAWA and RGD on α5β1 are closely overlapping because a peptide containing the RRETAWA sequence acts as a direct competitive inhibitor of RGD binding to α5β1 (36.Mould A.P. Burrows L. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25664-25672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).A possible criticism of previous integrin mutagenesis studies is that only a loss of ligand binding was demonstrated, therefore it is possible that these mutations had an indirect effect on ligand recognition by perturbing integrin structure. Here we have taken the approach of constructing and expressing chimeric αV/α5 subunits to determine the regions of α5 that when introduced into αV causegain of ligand-binding function. Our results show that replacing the second and third repeats of αV with those of α5 converts αVβ1 into a receptor with the same ligand binding specificity as α5β1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a short putative loop region connecting the second and third repeats is involved in the binding of RRETAWA and RGDGW-containing peptides. Our findings are consistent with the β-propeller model and appear to rule out a direct role for the divalent cation-binding sites in ligand recognition.DISCUSSIONIn this report we have sought to identify the regions of the integrin α subunit that are involved in ligand recognition using αV/α5 chimeras. Our major findings are as follows: (i) the first three NH2-terminal repeats contain the epitopes of function blocking anti-α subunit mAbs and the amino acid sequences that determine ligand binding specificity; (ii) the divalent cation-binding sites (in repeats 4–7) do not determine the specificity of ligand recognition; (iii) the amino acid sequence Ala107-Trp226 of α5(corresponding approximately to the second and third repeats) is sufficient to confer on αVβ1 the ligand binding properties of α5β1; (iv) swapping a 6-amino acid sequence from a predicted loop region of αVwith the corresponding region of α5(Asp154-Ala159) is sufficient to confer on αVβ1 selectivity for RGDGW and recognition of RRETAWA.In this study we observed a close correspondence between the regions of the α subunit involved in determining the specificity of ligand recognition and those that contained the epitopes of function blocking mAbs. This finding supports previous evidence that the epitopes of function blocking mAbs are proximal to sites involved in ligand binding (5.Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y.

In addition, these data lend strong support to the β-propeller model, which predicts that the ligand-binding sites lie on the upper face of the β-propeller (11.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Recently, we have mapped some of the residues that form part of the JBS5, mAb 16, and P1D6 epitopes by substituting residues in human α5 with the corresponding residues from mouse α5. Ser85was found to contribute to the JBS5 epitope, Glu126 and Leu128 to the mAb 16 epitope, and Leu212 to the P1D6 epitope (8.Burrows L. Clark K. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All these residues are predicted to lie on the upper face of the β-propeller domain. The results of the present study, including decreased binding of JBS5 to the αV/α5(A107–G232) chimera, are in good agreement with these data.Two loop swapping mutants, αV/α5(K125–D130) and αV/α5(D154–A159), failed to react with the function blocking anti-αV mAb 69.6.5. However, since they did react with two other function blocking anti-αV mAbs it is likely that the structure of the NH2-terminal repeats had not been grossly perturbed. Hence, a probable explanation is that these mutations disrupted the 69.6.5 epitope. Therefore, residues that form part of the 69.6.5 epitope probably lie in the 2-3 loop of repeat 2 and in the 4-1 loop between repeats 2 and 3. These two loops are predicted to lie adjacent to each other on the upper face of the β-propeller. The observation that the αV/α5(D154–A159) chimera bound α5β1-selective ligands but retained the epitopes of 17E6 and 14D9.F8 is consistent with previous findings that the epitopes of most function blocking mAbs are close to but not directly overlapping with sites involved in ligand recognition (5.Mould A.P.

The reasons for this are unclear. However, it is likely that there is an interaction between these two loops since they are predicted to lie adjacent to each other in the β-propeller model (11.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Mutation of Phe177-Tyr178 of αV could have a destabilizing effect on the tertiary structure, leading to loss of expression at the cell surface. An interaction between the two exchanged loops in the αV/α5(Y186–F187, Q218–Y226) chimera may compensate for this destabilizing effect, thereby allowing normal levels of expression.Although our results show that the divalent cation sites in the α subunit do not influence the specificity of ligand binding, it is possible that the divalent cation binding repeats of α5and αV could have an identical function in ligand recognition. For example, these repeats may be involved in interacting with the RGD sequence, which is a property common to both α5β1 and αVβ1. However, it is noteworthy that none of the function blocking mAbs mapped to repeats 4–7. Indeed, it has been shown that a mAb directed against the αL subunit whose epitope includes the divalent cation-binding site of the fifth repeat has no effect on ligand recognition by αLβ2 (7.Oxvig C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4870-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Additionally, in a study of α5/α6 chimeras it was found that swapping parts of the divalent cation binding repeats of α5 with the corresponding regions of α6(which does not recognize RGD) did not perturb recognition of RGD or the synergy sequence (55.Cao Z. Huang K. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31670-31679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Taken together with evidence that mutations at the divalent cation-binding sites do not affect ligand binding (56.Pujades C. Alon R. Yauch R.L. Masumoto A. Burkly L.C. Chen C. Springer T.A. Lobb R.R. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2647-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we favor the hypothesis that these sites have a purely regulatory role. Finally, there is strong evidence that the β subunit, rather than the α, contains the major site of RGD recognition (5.Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J.

Importantly, however, it has yet to be demonstrated whether the specificity and affinity of ligand binding of these recombinant fragments is the same of that of the native integrin. Cross-linking of ligand peptides to αIIbβ3 and αVβ3also indicated that these peptides interacted (at least in part) with the divalent cation binding repeats (26.D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A.

Further studies will be required to resolve these inconsistencies, and to show if the findings for α5β1 in this report can be generalized to all non-A-domain containing integrins. However, the position of ligand recognition sites in the α5 subunit deduced here (the second and third repeats) is strikingly similar to the location of the A-domain in α subunits that contain this module (between the second and third repeats). This observation suggests an attractive general model of receptor-ligand interactions in both A-domain containing and non-A-domain containing integrins (61.Humphries M.J. Biochem. Soc.

In B lymphocytes, co-clustering of antigen receptor surface immunoglobulin with FcγRIIb promotes the negative effects of SHIP, but how SHIP activity is regulated is unknown. To explore this issue, we investigated the effect of SHIP phosphorylation, receptor tyrosine engagement by its Src homology 2 domain, and membrane recruitment of SHIP on its enzymatic activity. We examined two SHIP phosphorylation kinase candidates, Lyn and Syk, and observed that the Src protein-tyrosine kinase, Lyn is far superior to Syk in its ability to phosphorylate SHIP both in vitro and in vivo. However, we found a minimal effect of phosphorylation or receptor tyrosine engagement of SHIP on its enzymatic activity, whereas membrane localization of SHIP significantly reduced cellular phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate levels.

Res. 1999; 19: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The most proximal signaling event is the stimulation of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), which phosphorylates tyrosine residues within conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), found in receptor-associated proteins (4.Isakov N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Once the tyrosines in the ITAM are phosphorylated, they serve as docking sites for numerous proteins and enzymes containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains including the PTK Syk and the p85 adapter subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase; reviewed in Refs. 5.Campbell K.S.

These activation signals are then propagated through additional tyrosine phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions and result in changes in B cell biology. PtdIns 3-kinase is comprised of a p85 adapter subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit. By catalyzing the phosphorylation of the D-3 position of the inositol ring (7.Hawkins P.T. Welch H. McGregor A. Eguinoa A. Gobert S. Krugmann S. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Stephens L. Biochem. Soc.

PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 binds to pleckstrin homology domains of enzymes (8.Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem.

In contrast to activating signals generated upon sIg clustering, co-clustering of sIg with the B cell Fc receptor for IgG (FcγRIIb) aborts B cell activation. It has been proposed (14.Sinclair N.R. Lees R.K. Chan P.L. Khan R.H. Immunology. 1970; 19: 105-116PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Sinclair N.R.S. Chan P.L. Adv. Exp. Med.

We have termed sIg-FcγRIIb co-clustering “negative signaling,” to contrast with positive signaling initiated by sIg clustering alone and that promotes B cell proliferation. Phillips and Parker (16.Phillips N.E. Parker D.C. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 602-606PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Phillips N.E. Parker D.C. J.

Immunol. 1985; 134: 2835-2838PubMed Google Scholar) described an in vitro model using a F(ab′)2 fragment and intact anti-Ig reagents of the IgG class to study biochemical events associated with positive and negative signaling. Earlier studies using this model demonstrated phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue contained within a 13-amino acid motif of the FcγRIIb cytoplasmic tail (19.Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Additional experiments showed that certain structural features of the FcγRIIb 13-amino acid motif were shared in common with other receptors that likewise conferred an inhibitory function; accordingly, the motif has been termed the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM; reviewed in Ref. 20.Vely F. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2075-2077PubMed Google Scholar). Like signaling through the ITAM, the phosphorylated ITIM recruits SH2 domain-containing molecules to carry out negative signaling. The SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase, SHIP, was identified as one of several proteins that bind to the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIM of FcγRIIb (21.Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). SHIP is a 145-kDa cytosolic protein that contains a single SH2 domain, a central catalytic region, and two tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region (23.Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In addition to the B cell FcγRIIb, SHIP is recruited to and inhibits cellular activation by a variety of other receptors, including numerous cytokine receptors and the mast cell Fcε receptor (reviewed in Refs.26.Liu L. Damen J.E. Ware M. Hughes M. Krystal G. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 27.Huber M. Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Scheid M. Duronio V. Liu L. Ware M.D. Humphries R.K. Krystal G. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, in the B cell model, we demonstrated that SHIP was tyrosine-phosphorylated to high stoichiometry and associated with Ras adapter protein Shc only upon co-clustering sIg with FcγRIIb (28.Tridandapani S. Chacko G.W. Brocklyn J.R.v. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1125-1132PubMed Google Scholar). These events were because of the direct recruitment of the SH2 domain of SHIP to the phosphorylated cytoplasmic tyrosine residue of the FcγRIIb ITIM and hence induces SHIP recruitment to the B cell plasma membrane (29.Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D. Justement L.B. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar findings of SHIP membrane translocation have been made in T cells stimulated via CD28 (30.Edmunds C. Parry R.V. Burgess S.J. Reaves B. Ward S.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The kinase-phosphorylating SHIP is unknown in any cellular system. Studies of SHIP enzymatic activity revealed an exclusive preference for the hydrolysis of 3-phosphoinositides. As such, SHIP can reverse the action of PtdIns 3-kinase by consuming the PtdIns 3-kinase products (31.Deuter-Reinhard M. Apell G. Pot D. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Kavanaugh W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2559-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Other experiments revealed that co-clustering of sIg and FcγRIIb leads to a dramatic reduction of cellular PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 (32.Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S.

Therefore, stimulation of SHIP enzymatic activity and the resulting hydrolysis of PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 are most likely the cause of PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3-dependent enzyme inhibition. Despite the fact that SHIP enzymatic activity is induced by various cytokines and immunoreceptors, it is unclear how the enzymatic activity of SHIP is regulated. Because SHIP was highly phosphorylated upon co-clustering sIg with FcγRIIb (21.Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar) and recruited to the plasma membrane through the engagement with the phosphorylated receptors (29.Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 1408-1414PubMed Google Scholar), we have formulated three distinct hypotheses that can account for the observed increased SHIP enzymatic activity. First, SHIP enzymatic activity may be directly stimulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Other enzymes such as Vav (39.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 40.Han J. Das B. Wei W. Van Aelst L. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) respond in this way to tyrosine phosphorylation. Second, the engagement of a phosphorylated ITIM may promote the elevated activity of SHIP. The SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase, which binds to the same phosphorylated ITIM of FcγRIIb, exhibits an ∼50-fold enhancement of phosphatase activity upon ITIM engagement by its SH2 domain (42.Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1141-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Third, SHIP membrane recruitment may lead to induced enzymatic activity. Many enzymes involved in signal transduction including Akt (43.Astoul E. Watton S. Cantrell D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and PtdIns 3-kinase (13.Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) are activated by changing their subcellular location from the cytosol to the membrane. To investigate the effect of phosphorylation on SHIP enzymatic activity, we sought the identity of the kinase capable of SHIP phosphorylation. We considered two candidate PTKs, Src family kinases (44.Burg D.L. Furlong M.T. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Syk (45.Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because members of these two PTK families are present and associated with the ITAMs of sIg and thus are capable of promoting SHIP phosphorylation upon sIg-FcγRIIb co-clustering. We observed that Src family PTKs are superior to Syk regarding SHIP phosphorylation, both in vitro and in vivo. Next, we addressed the three proposed mechanisms of SHIP enzymatic regulation and found a minimal effect on SHIP 5-phosphatase activity by either phosphorylation or engagement of the phosphorylated ITIM of FcγRIIb by the SH2 domain of SHIP. However, enforced plasma membrane localization of SHIP decreased the total amount of cellular PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 in cells expressing a chimera of human CD8-SHIP, indicating that the subcellular localization directly contributes to SHIP-mediated substrate hydrolysis. Based on these results, we propose that SHIP negatively affects PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3-dependent enzymes by altering its subcellular location from cytosol to the plasma membrane, which is accomplished by recruitment to phosphorylated cytoplasmic tyrosines of receptors. Anti-Lyn and anti-Syk antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antiphosphotyrosine (4G10) monoclonal antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-p85 antisera and anti-SHIP antibody were used as described elsewhere (28.Tridandapani S. Chacko G.W. Brocklyn J.R.v. Coggeshall K.M. J.

The resulting material encodes the extracellular and transmembrane domain of CD8α and SHIP as the intracellular domain of the chimera. cDNA encoding murine Lyn was obtained from Dr. A. DeFranco (University of California, San Francisco); cDNA encoding Syk was obtained from Dr. K. Zoller (Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA). Cloned pPICZB-SHIP-His was transformed to yeast pichia strain, GS115. Transformants expressing high levels of SHIP protein were selected and induced by methanol according to manufacturer's directions. His-tagged SHIP protein was purified by Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography and subsequent size exclusion chromatography. The resulting material produced a single band upon SDS-PAGE of ∼145 kDa, the expected size of the recombinant protein. To produce the substrate and standards for SHIP 5-phosphatase assay, we prepared [32P]PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 and [32P]PtdIns-(3,4)P2 essentially as described elsewhere (25.Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), using commercial sources of PtdIns-(4,5)P2and PtdIns-(4)P (Calbiochem), phosphatidylserine, [γ32P]ATP, and immunoprecipitated PtdIns 3-kinase. All procedures were slightly modified from previous reports (25.Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106cpm of [32P]PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 in chloroform/methanol (1:1, vol/vol) were evaporated under vacuum and resuspended by sonication in 300 μl of SHIP assay buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.25), 10 mm MgCl2, 1%Nonidet P-40). For 5-phosphatse assay, 25 μl of substrate in SHIP assay buffer, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and various amounts of recombinant SHIP enzyme were mixed to 30 μl of total volume. The reaction was stopped after 20 min at 37 °C by extraction of phospholipids with 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) and 100 μl of 2 m KCl. The organic phase containing SHIP substrates and products was washed four times with 100 μl of chloroform; the washes and organic phase were combined and evaporated under vacuum. The dried phospholipids were dissolved in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1), and the material was separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using Silica gel 60 plates saturated with 1% potassium oxalate in 50% ethanol, as described earlier (25.Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The identity of PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns-(3,4)P2 were confirmed by comparison of the mobility of [32P]PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 and [32P]PtdIns-(3,4)P2 prepared separately using authentic commercial standards on the same TLC plate. PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns-(3,4)P2 were quantified by a Molecular Dynamics Storm system. Lyn from pervanadate (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.6% H2O2)-stimulated A20 B cells and Syk from pervanadate-stimulated THP-1 monocytic cells were immunoprecipitated as described earlier (46.Sarkar S. Schlottmann K. Cooney D. Coggeshall K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20182-20186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and resuspended in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2). To each reaction, 10 μm cold ATP, 2–4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 2 μg of recombinant SHIP were incubated with the immunoprecipitated kinases for 10 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 25 μl to permit SHIP phosphorylation. The reaction was stopped by adding 5× SDS sample buffer (0.6 m Tris (pH 6.8), 50% glycerol, 12% SDS) and incubating the samples at 95 °C for 5 min. The phosphorylated products, including the autophosphorylated kinases themselves, were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, identified by autoradiography, and quantified by a Molecular Dynamics Storm system. To assess the effect of phosphorylation on enzymatic activity, thein vitro kinase reaction was performed as above. Because the Mn2+ cation was inhibitory toward SHIP 5-phosphatase activity (see “Results”), we lowered [Mn2+] by mixing 23 μl of supernatant containing recombinant, phosphorylated SHIP with 1 and 10 mm EDTA and MgCl2, respectively. After incubation on ice for 10 min, 0.1 μg of recombinant SHIP was subjected to 5-phosphatase assay. For transfection into COS-7, 10 μg of cDNA encoding Lyn or Syk PTKs were co-transfected with 10 μg of cDNA encoding SHIP. Cells were harvested after 48 h, stimulated with pervanadate, and analyzed by antiphosphotyrosine blotting as described (21.Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel, Lyn and Syk were immunoprecipitated from the SHIP co-transfected cells and assessed forin vitro kinase activity by autophosphorylation and by antiphosphotyrosine blotting. For measurements of SHIP 5-phosphatase activity after tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo, COS-7 cells co-transfected with SHIP and/or Lyn were stimulated with or without pervanadate for 5 min and immunoprecipitated with anti-SHIP antibody. For measurements of SHIP 5-phosphatase activity after stimulation of B cells, lysates of resting or intact anti-Ig-stimulated A20 B cells were incubated with 2.4 μm biotinylated, phosphorylated ITIM peptide, as earlier described (29.Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D. Justement L.B. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bound material was eluted by incubating streptavidin beads with 100 mm phenylphosphate in SHIP assay buffer, and the eluted material was applied to 5-phosphatase assays. Approximately 9 × 106 COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pEFneo, pEFneo-SHIP, or pEFneo-CD8-SHIP using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). 30 h after transfection, cells were labeled to equilibrium by a 16-h incubation with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum exhaustively dialyzed against saline containing 20 mm Hepes. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mmHepes, but without 10% fetal bovine serum, resuspended in 100 μl of same buffer, and stimulated with pervanadate for 3 min. Lipid extraction and TLC were performed essentially as described earlier (47.Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Omann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15668-15673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [32P]PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 and [32P]PtdIns-(3,4)P2 were prepared from a PtdIns 3-kinase reaction as described above and used as standards. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding wild-type SHIP or the CD8-SHIP chimera. 48 h after transfection, the viable cells were detached by cell dissociation solutionTM (Sigma) and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD8 and biotinylated cholera toxin B subunit (to visualize the plasma membrane), followed by Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)-conjugated streptavidin. Additionally, transfected COS-7 cells were permeabilized to identify intracellular proteins with 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline and immunostained with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-SHIP antibodies. Cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy, and digital images were prepared. Purified SHIP enzyme was prepared from yeast transformed with cDNA encoding SHIP and containing a 6x Histidine tag at the C terminus. About 1 mg of SHIP enzyme was purified from yeast lysates derived from a 1-liter culture (Fig.1 A). We tested the purified recombinant enzyme in a phosphatase assay, using [32P]PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3 prepared from commercial PtdIns-(4,5)P2 and immunoprecipitated PtdIns 3-kinase. The results, shown in Fig. 1 B, indicated that SHIP generated [32P]PtdIns-(3, 4)P2 from [32P]PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3, indicating that the recombinant enzyme had 5-phosphatase activity, as expected. The enzymatic activity was lost in the presence of EDTA, revealing a need for a divalent cation to support SHIP hydrolytic activity toward [32P]PtdIns-(3,4,5)P3. We examined several divalent cations for their ability to support SHIP activity and found (Fig. 2 A) that only Mg2+ was active in this regard. SHIP enzymatic activity was greatly reduced in the presence of Mn2+ and the oxidant, H2O2 (Fig. 2 B). SHIP displayed a relatively broad pH optimum from pH 6 to pH 8 (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2Enzymology of recombinant SHIP. A,divalent cation requirement for SHIP for its activity.

These results are representative of five separate and similar assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate whether tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP affects its enzymatic activity, it was necessary to identify the PTK capable of phosphorylating SHIP. Both Src family PTKs and Syk associate with the B cell antigen receptor and either kinase family member are thus properly positioned for carrying out SHIP phosphorylation upon sIg-FcγRIIb co-clustering. Accordingly, we investigated the ability of each of these candidate PTKs to phosphorylate SHIP. Using immunoprecipitated Lyn (as a representative Src family kinase member) or Syk in an in vitro kinase reaction with the recombinant SHIP prepared as described above, we found (Fig. 3 A) that Lyn was far superior to Syk in SHIP phosphorylation; indeed, there was no detectable increase in SHIP tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of Syk, despite the fact that Syk displayed high autophosphorylating activity (Fig. 3 A,inset 2A summary of the findings appears here; the original data were provided for review. ). As a second approach, we applied the Src family PTK inhibitor PP2 (48.Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol.

A loss of function phenotype for deterin of cell death was indicated by transfections with either a dominant negative deterin mutant or with inhibitory RNA (RNAi) for deterin. The dominant negative C-terminal fragment that antagonized antiapoptotic activity of deterin did not affect antiapoptotic activity of DIAP1 or p35.

Physiol. 1965; 11: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the process has been distinguished from cell death by necrosis (6.Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar, 7.Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar) and has since been conventionally characterized by cell shrinkage, blebbing of the plasma membrane, convolution of the nuclear membrane, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation into a nucleosomal ladder. In some tissues, these apoptotic cells are phagocytosed intact, without an acute inflammatory reaction. These phenomena are in contrast to cell death by necrosis, in which cells swell and lyse to release cellular contents, inducing an inflammatory reaction. The various diverse stimuli that induce apoptosis can be external to the cell (e.g. UV, antibiotics, hormones, and liposomal cytotoxicants) or endogenous (e.g. transcriptional regulators and DNA damage due to free radicals). These apoptotic stimuli feed into apoptotic pathways of the cell by routes not well understood, although many pathways appear to converge into common or at least overlapping biochemical machinery. These pathways include activators that can activate special effector proteolytic enzymes, caspases, that in turn cleave and activate other caspases, which then cleave end target molecules; the molecular death of these target molecules causes the apoptotic death of the cell (8.Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar, 9.Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Because many caspases in the apoptotic pathway are apparently always present in the cell, either as procaspases or perhaps performing otherwise nonapoptotic functions (10.Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar), the cell must have a means to prevent “leaky” or inadvertent triggering of the pathway. This protection is accomplished in part by the presence of inhibitors of various steps in the apoptotic machinery. For example, in vertebrates and the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans there are inhibitors of the “activators,” such as the well known BCl-2 and related BCL-XL (11.Reed, J. C. Nature 387, 773–776Google Scholar). There are also other caspase inhibitors, such as certain inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP)1 proteins, first discovered in baculoviruses (12.Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems (13.Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M.

These proteins are typically characterized by BIR type repeats and a RING finger motif (18.Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 19.LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3247-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). However, there is much that we do not yet understand about the role and action of the IAPs generally in apoptosis and normal cell physiology. Structurally, the function of the characteristic BIR type repeat in IAPs is also little understood. Roy et al. (20.Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) report that for the vertebrate c-IAP-1 and c-IAP-2, the BIR region alone could bind to caspases and block caspase activation. However, the inhibitory effect was greater when the RING finger was also present. More paradoxically, Hauser et al. (21.Hauser H.P. Bardroff M. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) report a ubiquitin conjugating complex component that has a single BIR and no RING finger and no activity to inhibit apoptosis. Similarly, both an insect virus (AcIAP, Ref. 22.Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5212-5222Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) and an unrelated mammalian virus (23.Neilan J.G.

Virology. 1997; 230: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) encode BIR-containing proteins that have no demonstrated function to inhibit apoptosis. Recently, a vertebrate protein, survivin, has been reported from humans and mice that represents a new subgroup of IAPs that contain only a single BIR and no RING finger (24.Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 25.Kobayashi K. Hatano M. Otaki M. Ogasawara T. Tokuhisa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). A great deal of excitement about survivin-like IAPs has been engendered by the findings that survivin is expressed in a wider variety of cancers than any other known apoptosis inhibitor (26.Jaattela M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). An apparently homologous single BIR-containing protein from C. elegans, BIR1, has also been described recently (27.Fraser A.G. Claerwen J. Evan G.I. Hengartner M.O. Current Biology. 1999; 9: 292-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The studies on vertebrate survivin demonstrated antiapoptotic activity of survivin in cell transfection assays and also suggested a possible role in cell division due to the localization of survivin to mitotic spindles and its expression in proliferating but not quiescent tissues. In contrast, genetic studies on BIR1 molecule in C. elegans indicated a role in cell division but did not detect antiapoptotic activity. These disparate findings raise the important question as to whether the antiapoptotic activity of this protein group is restricted to vertebrates, in contrast to a role solely in cell division in invertebrates (28.Miller L.K. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 323-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To date, two Drosophila IAPs have been reported, DIAP1 and DIAP2, that contain the conventional multiple BIR and RING finger motifs (13.Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M.

Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Yet, to date, no IAP-type proteins have been published from insects that possess the single BIR/no RING finger structure. We report here the gene and cDNA for a new insect IAP, deterin, that has a single BIR and no RING finger motif. We also demonstrate that this new insect IAP exerts a distinct action to deter apoptosis, that a loss of function phenotype for deterin is cell death, and that its transcript exists in particular tissues of multiple developmental stages. As the first invertebrate member of the survivin-type IAP group to exhibit apoptosis-inhibitory activity, Drosophila deterin demonstrates that antiapoptotic activity of survivin-type IAPs is not confined to the vertebrate kingdom. The cDNA clone for deterin was isolated from a Drosophila melanogaster embryo cDNA library kindly provided by Roger Brent. The sequenced cDNA was radiolabeled and used to screen D. melanogaster P1 genomic library filters (Genomesystems). The two most strongly positive hybridizing clones corresponded to independent P1 clones both associated with the 90A region of the D. melanogaster third chromosome. The inserts in these two clones were excised, recovered, and subjected to restriction digestion and probing with the radiolabeled cDNA, and the restriction pattern confirmed the overlap of the two clones. An approximately 3-kbp BamHI fragment was detected to completely contain the cDNA probe, and the deterin gene within this fragment was sequenced in both directions. During this study, a cDNA was reported into the Flybase as isolated from a late larval-prepupal library (AI260030). The reported protein coding sequence for that corresponding cDNA matched exactly the sequence of the cDNA we obtained from the embryonic library. Mutant constructs were prepared by PCR amplification of respective coding fragments and cloning into pIE1-4 vector. Deterin deleted for its C terminus (Det-NBIR) was prepared by deleting amino acids 111–153. The construct with the C terminus alone (Det-Cterm) contained the coding region for amino acids 108–153. In the Det-RING construct, the DIAP1 RING motif residues 391–425 were placed after residue 153 of deterin. For exchange of the C terminus of deterin with that of survivin (Det-SurvCterm), residues 111–153 of deterin were replaced with residues 98–142 of human survivin. All constructs were cloned into the pIE1-4 insect cell expression vector. Salivary glands were dissected, fixed to slides, and denatured in a method similar to that described by Pardue (35.Pardue M.-L. Goldstein L.S.B. Fryberg E.A. Methods in Cell Biology, Drosophila melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 334-350Google Scholar). The probe (biotinylated deterin cDNA) was added to hybridization solution (formamide/SSC/dextran sulfate) and incubated with the prepared chromosomes overnight at 37 °C. The slides were washed with 2× SSC and then phosphate-buffered saline, and the hybridized probe was detected with Vectastain reagents (Vector). The EcoRI/XhoHI deterin cDNA fragment was subcloned into Bluescript and then excised with BamHI/XhoHI (the latter end filled in with Klenow) and ligated into the BamHI/NruI sites of pIE1-4 vector, in which expression of the encoded protein is driven in insect cells by a baculovirus promoter ie1(Novagen). A fusion construct was prepared by placing the coding sequence for green fluorescent protein (GFP) in frame with deterin.D. melanogaster reaper coding sequence (30.Grether M.E. Abrams J.M.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), which was initially named threadbut which has been referred to in the literature by numerous abbreviations (DIAP1, DIAP-1, dIAP1, etc.), is referred to here by the abbreviation used in the original paper by Hay et al. (13.Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of DIAP1, reaper, the procaspases DCP1 and DRONC, and baculoviral p35 were also each cloned into the BamHI andNotI sites of pIE1-4. The control plasmid expressing β-galactosidase under the constitutive control of hsp70 promoter (phsp-β-gal) was as described (38.Jones G. O'Mahony P. Chang S. Schachtschabel U. Gene. 1996; 173: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Spodoptera frugiperda SF9 cells were maintained at 25 °C in SF900 SFM media (Life Technologies, Inc.). D. melanogaster S2 cells were maintained at 25 °C in Schneider's Drosophila medium, (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum. The pIE1-4-deterin construct (above), and the pIE1-4 vector only, were each separately and stably transformed into SF9 cells by cotransfection with pIE1-neo plasmid, and selection with neomycin, as per manufacturers instructions (Novagen). For transfections involvingDrosophila reaper-mediated apoptosis, 106 cells were transferred to 6 well culture dishes (Corning) in 1 ml media, and transfected with 3 μl of Cellfectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), with 0.2 μg of reporter phsp-β-gal or the pIE1-4-GFP construct, as noted, and with either 2 μg of pIE1-4-reaper and/or 6 μg of pIE1-4-deterin, pIE1-4-GFP-deterin, pIE1-4-DIAP1, or pIE1-4-p35. In addition, pIE1-4 vector was added in an amount sufficient to equalize the total amount of DNA transfected in each treatment to 8.2 μg. To assess deterin activity against exogenous apoptotic activation, liposomal conditions for induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis were used (39.Ebert O. Finke S. Salahi A. Herrmann M. Trojaneck B.

Bull. 1997; 20: 1119-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We determined that these conditions of S2 and SF9 cells were an excess of liposomal reagent relative to numbers of treated cells of 3 μl of Cellfectin to 0.5 × 106cells/ml. For RNAi experiments, sense and antisense transcripts were synthesized from the corresponding cDNA in Bluescript SK+ vector, using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript preparations were mixed, briefly boiled, and then annealed. The given RNAi was subjected to the same transfection procedures as transfected DNAs. For all transfections, 5 h after addition of reagents, the appropriate medium was added to achieve a total volume of 2 ml in each well, and 24–48 h later (as noted), the cells were either stained for β-galactosidase activity (2 mm MgCl2, 5 mMK4Fe(CN)6-3H2O, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 0.2% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside) or fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyzed for the GFP reporter, as described above. For the β-galactosidase reporter, the number of positive reporter (blue X-gal staining) cells in the consecutive fields of view in a transect across the widest diameter of each well were counted (typically several hundred to several thousand). The standard method for assessing cell viability used previously for survivin and other IAP-type molecules was also used here (22.Clem R.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell.

This procedure was additionally verified in the present studies by preliminary tests, which showed little cell division by transfected SF9 or S2 cells during the time course under the conditions used and which showed that there was no increase in DNA synthesis during the time course in cells overexpressing deterin relative to control cells. In all transfection experiments, each treatment was repeated at least three times. Data are reported as mean and standard error. RNA was extracted from 0–4-h-old embryos, 4–8-h-old embryos, and late feeding stage final instar larvae, as described (46.Andres A.J. Thummel C.S. Goldstein L.S.B. Fyrberg E.A. Methods in Cell Biology, Drosophila melanogaster: Practical Uses in Cell and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 565-573Google Scholar). Embryos or larvae were homogenized in SDS lysis buffer and digested with proteinase K, and the nucleic acids were extracted with phenol and then with phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. After fractionation on formaldehyde-containing agarose gels, the nucleic acids were transferred to Nytran membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) and probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled deterin cDNA; radiolabeling was performed by the random primer method. Signals were visualized by autoradiography. RNA samples from embryos or larvae were also used as the RT-PCR template, using primers corresponding to the 5′ end and 3′ end of the protein-coding region, respectively. Templates for RT-PCR were RNAs extracted from 0–12 h old embryos, late feeding stage third instar larvae, and mated females. For the transcript corresponding to the cloned deterin cDNA, the expected PCR product using these primers is 459 base pairs in length. In order to confirm the presence of endogenous Drosophila deterin transcripts inDrosophila S2 cells, cultured cells were collected and boiled for 5 min, the debris was pelleted, and aliquots of the supernatant were used as template in various PCRs using combinations of primers designed from cDNA designed to yield diagnostic and different size transcripts in each reaction. Confirmation of the presence of Drosophila deterin transcripts inSpodoptera SF9 cells stably transformed with aDrosophila deterin-expressing construct was performed on the cultured cells in a similar manner. The presence of overexpressed deterin protein in these SF9 cells was also confirmed by immunoblotting cellular proteins after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using rabbit polyclonal antibodies prepared against bacterial recombinantDrosophila deterin. Adult female ovaries were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, permeabilized with 4 μg/ml proteinase K, refixed, prehybridized, and then hybridized in hybridization solution: 50% deionized formamide, 5× SSC, 100 mg/ml each of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and yeast type X tRNA (Sigma), 50 mg/ml heparin, and 1%Tween. Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C, with either sense or antisense riboprobe of the deterin cDNA, labeled by incorporation of digoxigenin-labeled UTP. After washings at 65 °C, alkaline-phosphatase conjugated antidigoxigenin antibody (BMB; 2 μl per 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween) was added for 1 h of incubation at room temperature. The preparation was washed with pH 9.0 Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween and then stained with alkaline phosphatase in the same buffer. Mixed stage embryos were dechorionated with bleach; agitated betweenn-heptane and 4% formaldehyde, 0.1 mNa2PO4; passed sequentially through methanol, ethanol, xylene/ethanol, and methanol; and finally fixed in 5% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween (PBT)). After the embryos were changed to PBT, they were digested with 40 μg/ml proteinase K (BMB) for 8–10 min and then postfixed in 5% formaldehyde. The formaldehyde was washed out with PBT, and the embryos were prehybridized for 1–2 h at 55 °C in the same hybridization solution as described above. Hybridization in the same buffer overnight at 55 °C was performed with the same sense or antisense probes as used for the ovary in situ hybridizations. The next day, the embryos were washed with PBT, incubated with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated antidigoxigenin antibody, and stained by methods similar to that described above for the ovaries. The encoded sequence for deterin, a 153-amino acid protein, contains a BIR-type repeat that is typical of BIRs found in IAP-type apoptosis inhibitory proteins (Fig.1). However, it possesses a single BIR and no RING finger motif, whereas most IAP-type proteins encode two or three BIR repeats, and most have a RING finger. In this structure, the encoded protein is most similar to a human and mouse apoptosis inhibitor, survivin and TIAP, respectively (25.Kobayashi K. Hatano M. Otaki M. Ogasawara T. Tokuhisa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 42.Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar), although there is considerable divergence in structure in the N-terminal 25 amino acids, including a 13-residue insertion, and little sequence homology over the C terminus (Fig. 1 B). Cotransfection of SF9 cells with a deterin-expressing plasmid rescued the cell viability from the apoptotic effects of reaper, the insect cell death activator (Fig.1 D). The gene encoding deterin was isolated in order to assess indications from gene structure of the functional organization of the protein. Thedeterin cDNA was used for polytene chromosome in situ hybridization, and a single specific signal was detected at band 90A1–A2, on the right arm of the third chromosome (not shown). The cDNA was also used to probe a P1 filter genomic library. Both of two overlapping, approximately 80-kilobase pair specific hybridizing clones were shown by restriction mapping to encode the same singledeterin sequence consistent with the in situresults. On this basis, it does not appear that sequences closely similar to the single detected deterin gene are located at loci outside of 90A1–A2. The transcription start site has not been mapped, but the protein coding sequence of the cDNA is the same as an expressed sequence tag sequence deposited into the BDGP Flybase data base (accession number AI260030). The protein coding sequence is interrupted by two introns of 77 and 61 base pairs and is flanked in the mature transcript by a 5′ untranslated region and a 3′ untranslated region of 91 bases (Fig. 1 A). The locations of the introns may also be informative in relation to the functional structure of the deterin protein. Despite the divergence in primary structure of the human survivin and the D. melanogaster deterin, the first intron in both genes is inserted in essentially identical positions (Fig. 1 B, closed arrow). Both first introns begin either immediately before (deterin) or immediately after (survivin) the codon for the basic amino acid at the beginning of the most conserved motif between the two protein sequences (↓50KMAEAGFYW58 for deterin, 37R↓MAEAGFIH45 for survivin). In addition, predictive secondary structural analysis for the encoded deterin protein suggests that the first exon encodes a protein region that is predominated by α-helical conformation (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, the second exon is predicted to encode a region nearly devoid of α-helical structure and instead has a primarily coiled coil conformation, along with most of the β-form present in the protein. Furthermore, the second intron is positioned at exactly the residue (Val111) predicted to mark both the end of the BIR repeat and the beginning of a final domain with a high helical density (Fig.1, B and C). This final domain was confirmed (as described below) as possessing a discrete biological activity relating to cell death. Nurse cells undergo apoptosis only after they have completed their function of delivering molecules and cytoplasmic components to the developing oocyte (48.Foley K. Cooley L. Development. 1998; 125: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specific developmental timing of this apoptosis suggests a mechanism to prevent premature apoptosis in oocytes prior to that time. We analyzed the abundance of the deterin transcript in the ovaries of the adult female by in situ hybridization. The level of deterin mRNA increased sharply in later stage nurse cells, especially during stages 10 and 11 (Fig.2 D). The transcript accumulates in the darkly staining cytoplasm of the nurse cells, shortly before the dumping of cytoplasmic contents into the developing oocyte. The presence of abundant deterin transcript in the nurse cells just prior to dumping of their cytoplasmic contents into the oocyte suggested that the transcript may be found in the embryo. In situ hybridization detected the deterin transcript distributed throughout the embryo prior to stage 4 (not shown), consistent with a putative"
https://openalex.org/W2025403816,"The heat shock protein Hsp33 is a very potent molecular chaperone with a distinctive mode of functional regulation; its activity is redox-regulated. In its reduced form all six cysteinyl residues of Hsp33 are present as thiols, and Hsp33 displays no folding helper activity. Exposure of Hsp33 to oxidizing conditions like H2O2, however, rapidly converts Hsp33 into an efficient molecular chaperone. Activated Hsp33 binds tightly to refolding intermediates of chemically denatured luciferase and suppresses efficiently their aggregation in vitro. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry peptide mapping in combination with in vitro and on target protein chemical modification showed that this activation process of Hsp33 is accompanied by the formation of two intramolecular disulfide bonds within Hsp33: Cys232—S—S—Cys234 and Cys265—S–S—Cys268. Cys141, although not involved in disulfide bond formation, was found highly reactive toward chemical modifications. In contrast, Cys239is readily accessible under reducing conditions but becomes poorly accessible though still reduced when Hsp33 is in its active state. This indicates a significant conformational change during the activation process of Hsp33. Mass spectrometry, thus, unraveled a novel molecular mechanism by which alteration of the disulfide bond structure, as a result of changes in the cellular redox potential, results in the activation of a molecular chaperone.

Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Hsp33 protects bacterial cells from deleterious effects caused by oxidants like H2O2 showing that it plays a role in the bacterial defense system against oxidative stress. Hsp33 is distinguished from all other known chaperone proteins by the finding that Hsp33 is functionally regulated at posttranslational level, by the redox conditions of the environment (1.Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs. 2.Aslund F. Zheng M. Beckwith J. Storz G. Proc. Natl.

Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), but the precise molecular mechanism that translates the changes of the cellular redox environment into differences in chaperone activity is not yet understood. The Hsp33 amino acid sequence contains a novel conserved motif consisting of four cysteinyl residues near the C terminus of the protein. These cysteinyl residues form a C-X-C motif and a C-Y-Z-C motif (Fig.1), separated by 27–30 amino acid residues in Escherichia coli Hsp33 and its homologues. These four cysteinyl residues are present in all 27 known Hsp33 homologues suggesting that they play an important role in the function of Hsp33. In addition, two further cysteinyl residues, Cys141 and Cys239, are present in Hsp33. Cys239 is very poorly conserved occurring in only 4 of the 27 known Hsp33 homologues. Cys141 is moderately conserved and is present in 10 of the 27 Hsp33 homologues known so far. We have postulated that disulfide bond formation is involved in the activation process of Hsp33. Thus, analysis of the disulfide bond status and connectivities in inactive and in active Hsp33 seemed very important to further understand the regulation of this efficient molecular chaperone. Two complementary mass spectrometry-based strategies are suitable for determining the presence and locations of disulfide bonds in proteins. Which one is superior is dependent on the proximity of the involved cysteinyl residues in the amino acid sequence. Both approaches involve cleavage of the protein by enzymatic or chemical means under conditions that minimize disulfide bond scrambling (4.Glocker M.O. Arbogast B. Schreurs J. Deinzer M.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5.Glocker M.O. Arbogast B. Deinzer M.L. J. Am. Soc.

The first approach can be used when the proteolytically derived peptides contain zero or one cysteinyl residue. The peptide mixtures are directly analyzed by mass spectrometric peptide mapping. Molecular mass analyses identify the peptides and disulfide-bonded dipeptides by assigning the observed ion signals to the corresponding calculated masses from the amino acid sequence. To confirm whether or not an observed peak in the recorded mass spectrum represents a disulfide-linked dipeptide, a chemical reduction reaction is performed afterward with the sample eitherin vitro (4.Glocker M.O. Arbogast B. Schreurs J. Deinzer M.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5.Glocker M.O. Arbogast B. Deinzer M.L. J. Am. Soc.

Subsequent re-analyses of these samples by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS)1 should show the disappearance of the ion signals from dipeptides that are disulfide-linked and the appearance of signals corresponding to the resulting pairs of reduced peptides. The second approach has been developed for the situation where proteolytic cleavage results in individual peptides that contain more than one cysteinyl residue. The absence or presence of disulfide bonds in these peptides is detected by first alkylating free thiols in the intact protein followed by proteolytic cleavage and subsequent detection of the peptide masses (4.Glocker M.O. Arbogast B. Schreurs J. Deinzer M.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,12.Glocker M.O. Arbogast B. Milley R. Cowgill C. Deinzer M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 185-210Google Scholar). Thiol-containing peptides are found alkylated and are clearly distinguished by the corresponding mass shifts from unmodified and, thus, disulfide bond-carrying peptides. Thiol selective modification reagents such as iodoacetic acid and iodoacetamide are widely used for cysteinyl-selective modification of reduced proteins (4.Glocker M.O. Arbogast B. Schreurs J. Deinzer M.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15.Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). They rapidly and irreversibly modify free thiol groups but do not react with intact disulfide bonds. This combination of chemical and mass spectrometric methods were successfully used here (i) to unambiguously demonstrate that intramolecular disulfide bond formation is involved in the activation mechanism of Hsp33 and (ii) to identify the disulfide bond connectivities. The Hsp33 protein was overexpressed and purified as described previously (1.Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Highly purified Hsp33 was stored frozen at −20 °C in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, 20 mm KCl, pH 7.5. To isolate Hsp33 that is homogeneous with respect to its oxidation status, purified Hsp33 (22 μm in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, 20 mm KCl, pH 7.5) was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm DTT to reduce existing disulfide bonds. The buffer also contained 22 μm zinc chloride to saturate the zinc binding capacity of Hsp33. A portion of this reduced preparation was desalted using a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated in metal-free buffer (100 ml of 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, incubated with 5 g of Chelex (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 37 °C). The other portion of the reduced Hsp33 preparation was oxidized by incubation in 5 mm H2O2 for 1 h at 37 °C prior to the desalting step. The protein concentrations of both oxidized and reduced species were determined as described previously (1.Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). For determination of the free thiol groups, 3 μm protein was prepared in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Dithio-1,4-nitrobenzoic acid was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the absorbance change at 412 nm was monitored at 25 °C using a Beckman DU 640 UV-visible spectrophotometer (16.Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993Google Scholar). The chaperone activity of oxidized and reduced Hsp33 was tested with luciferase as substrate protein. Firefly luciferase (12.6 μm) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was denatured with 5m guanidinium-HCl in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, for 90 min at room temperature. Refolding was initiated by diluting denatured luciferase 1:133 into 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, at 25 °C in the absence or presence of Hsp33. To monitor aggregation, light scattering measurements were performed using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder under constant stirring. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 350 nm, and the slit widths were 2.5 nm. To test for the effects of reduction on the chaperone activity of Hsp33, oxidized Hsp33 was reduced with 2 mm DTT for 25 min at 37 °C prior to the addition to the reaction mixture. Control experiments showed that the residual concentration of DTT present in the reaction mixture (0.2 mm) did not influence the aggregation behavior of luciferase in the absence of any additional protein. Hsp33 was reduced by adding 6 μl of a 44 mm DTT solution (in 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8) to 50 μl of a solution containing 100 μg of Hsp33 (3 nmol, in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, 20 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.50). The mixture was immediately diluted with 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8, to yield a final protein concentration of 1 μg/μl. The molar ratio of DTT to cysteinyl residues was 14:1. Reduction was performed for 1 h at 37 °C and was complete as judged by Ellman's assay. Hsp33 was oxidized using 4 mm H2O2 at room temperature as follows: 1.6 μl of 800 mmH2O2 (in 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8) was added to 320 μl of a 1 μg/μl Hsp33 solution (50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Aliquots (100 μl) were desalted using an Amicon microconcentration device (cutoff: 10,000 Da). Retentates were washed three times with 200 μl of 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8. The final protein concentration was ∼2 μg/μl. Air oxidation of Hsp33 was performed in ammonium bicarbonate buffer at 4 °C. The Hsp33 solution (2 μg/μl in 40 mm HEPES-KOH, 20 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5) was diluted 1:2 with 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8. Aliquots containing 100 μg of Hsp33 were pipetted into Eppendorf tubes and covered with cellulose membrane (molecular mass cutoff 3500 Da). Gentle stirring at 8 °C allowed oxygen exchange between the reservoir (3 liters of air-saturated 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8) and the sample solution. Samples were removed after 1 h and 24 h, respectively, and stored frozen at −20 °C. Hsp33 (100 μg = 3 nmol) were incubated in 100 mmiodoacetamide, 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, in the dark for 30 min to carboxamidomethylate all accessible thiolgroups. This iodoacetamide concentration represents a 1000-fold molar excess over the cysteinyl residues in Hsp33. The reaction was terminated by adding glacial acetic acid, which shifted the pH to ∼4. Buffer exchange was performed using microconcentrator devices as described above. Aliquots (20 μl) were lyophilized after the addition of 20 μl of 0.1% 2,2,2-trifluoroacetic acid. Proteolytic degradations of Hsp33 and its carboxamidomethylated derivatives (40 μg each) were carried out in 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8, 2.5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) CH3CN. Protease stock solutions of Lys-C (EC3.4.99.30, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and trypsin (1 μg/μl, EC3.4.21.4, Sigma) were prepared with a concentration of 1 μg/μl in 50 mm NH4HCO3. Enzyme to substrate ratios were 1:80 for Lys-C and 1:50 for trypsin, respectively. Digestions were performed for 2 h at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding glacial acetic acid, shifting the pH to ∼4. On target reduction in the presence of 4-hydroxy-α-cyano-cinnamic acid (HCCA) matrix was carried out with the Lys-C-derived Hsp33 peptides after MALDI-MS peptide mapping (see below) according to published procedures (8.Happersberger H.P.

For nanoelectrospray ionization (nano-ESI)-MS analyses, samples containing freshly isolated Hsp33, oxidized and reduced Hsp33, as well as the carboxamidomethylated derivatives were redissolved in 200 μl of acetic acid trifluoroethanol (3 volumes of 10% aqueous acetic acid mixed with 7 volumes of neat trifluorethanol), pH 2 (final protein concentration was ∼0.2 μg/μl). Nano-ESI-MS was performed with a Vestec-201A quadrupole mass spectrometer as described previously (10.Happersberger H.P. Stapleton J. Cowgill C. Glocker M.O. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; Suppl. 2: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mass calibration was performed with the 8+ to 12+ charged ions of hen egg white lysozyme (M r 14305.1), and raw data were analyzed using a Vector-2 data system (Teknivent). For MALDI-MS peptide mapping analyses 1-μl aliquots from the proteolytic digests were used either without further purification or after elution from C-18-reversed phase material deposited in gel loader pipette tips (8.Happersberger H.P. Bantscheff M. Barbirz S. Glocker M.O. Chapman J.R. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar). Matrix solution (1 μl = 10 μg/μl; HCCA) dissolved in CH3CN/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (2: 1, v/v), pH 2, was added directly on the target. Spectra were recorded after evaporation of the solvent with a Bruker Biflex linear time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a UV-nitrogen laser (337 nm) and a dual microchannel plate detector. The acceleration voltage was set to 20 kV. Spectra were calibrated with insulin and processed using the X-MASS data system. To characterize the thiol status of Hsp33, homogenous preparations of reduced and of oxidized protein were prepared. Hsp33 was incubated with 2 mm DTT in the presence of equimolar amounts of zinc chloride to saturate the zinc binding capabilities of Hsp33. Thiol titration experiments revealed the presence of 5.7 ± 0.3 freely accessible cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups (data not shown). The molecular mass of this Hsp33 derivative was determined by MALDI-MS to be 32,783 ± 5 Da, which is in good agreement with the 32,779 Da mass calculated from the translated amino acid sequence for Hsp33 in a fully reduced form. Carboxamidomethylation of this Hsp33 preparation resulted in a Hsp33 derivative with a molecular mass of 33,119 ± 8 Da (M r 33,121), consistent with the complete modification of all cysteinyl residues. Fully oxidized Hsp33 was prepared from the reduced protein sample by incubation in excess amounts of H2O2. Gel filtration was performed to remove DTT, Zn2+, and H2O2. An Ellman's assay revealed that less than 0.5 freely accessible thiol groups were present in this sample (data not shown). The molecular mass for H2O2-oxidized Hsp33 of 33,032 ± 4 Da was calculated from the nano-ESI mass spectrum (Fig.2). This molecular mass is consistent with the addition of 16 oxygen atoms (M r33,029), presumably because of oxidation of methioninyl, tryptophanyl, and cysteinyl residues in monomeric Hsp33. To analyze the chaperone activity of DTT-reduced and of H2O2-oxidized Hsp33, these two species were tested for their ability to interact with refolding intermediates of chemically denatured luciferase as substrate. Denatured luciferase immediately aggregates upon dilution into renaturation buffer (17.Herbst R. Gast K. Seckler R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6586-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones are able to recognize and bind these refolding intermediates of luciferase and efficiently prevent the otherwise irreversible aggregation processes. Oxidized Hsp33 is able to nearly completely suppress the aggregation of refolding intermediates of luciferase as monitored with light scattering (Fig.3 a). This implies that Hsp33 is capable of recognizing and binding to very early, unstructured folding intermediates, thereby keeping their free concentration low and preventing their aggregation. Reduction of Hsp33 by incubation of the active, oxidized Hsp33 in 2 mm DTT for 25 min at 37 °C was sufficient to completely abolish the chaperone activity of Hsp33in vitro (Fig. 3 b). Reduced Hsp33 is no longer able to recognize these folding intermediates. The light scattering kinetics of luciferase in the presence of reduced Hsp33 is nearly indistinguishable from the kinetics monitored in the absence of any additional protein (Fig. 3 c). To obtain the peptide maps, reduced and H2O2-oxidized Hsp33 were carboxamidomethylated and subsequently cleaved proteolytically with either Lys-C or trypsin, respectively. The resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-MS peptide mapping. Lys-C cleavage of reduced Hsp33 produced 8 peptides (L1–L8; cf. Fig. 1), trypsin cleavage yielded a pattern of 20 different peptides (T1–T20; cf. Fig. 1). All six cysteinyl residues of reduced Hsp33 were found completely alkylated (Table I). An ion signal atm/z 683, for example, represented the doubly carboxamidomethylated peptide T16 (amino acids 232–236) that carries residues Cys232 and Cys234 (Fig.4 A and Table I). Similarly, the ion signal at m/z 4574 represented peptide T19 (amino acids 245–283) that carries doubly carboxamidomethylated residues Cys265 and Cys268 (Table I). The corresponding Lys-C derived doubly carboxamidomethylated peptide L8 (amino acids 245–294) was observed at m/z 5706 (Fig. 4 B). Both less conserved cysteines were found carboxamidomethylated in the peptides T9 (Cys141) and T17 (Cys238).Table IMass assignments of Cys-containing peptides after tryptic digestion from reduced/alkylated and H2O2-oxidized/alkylated Hsp33Cys-residue/no. of alkyl groupsPeptide/(amino acid range)[M + H]+(calculated)m/z(observed)aAverage masses.ReducedH2O2oxidationCys141/1T9/(127–148)bCalculated mass for carboxamidomethylated Cys residue(s).2508.82509−c−, not detected.Cys141/0T9/(127–148)dCalculated mass for addition of four oxygen atoms.2515.8−c−, not detected.2516Cys232 +234/2T16/(232–236)bCalculated mass for carboxamidomethylated Cys residue(s).683.7 683−c−, not detected.Cys232 +234/0T16/(232–236)c−, not detected.567.7−c−, not detected. 568Cys232 +234/0T16/(232–236)fCalculated mass as in footnote c plus the addition of one oxygen atom.585.7−c−, not detected. 584Cys239/1T18/(239–244)bCalculated mass for carboxamidomethylated Cys residue(s).676.7 676−c−, not detected.Cys239/0T17/18/(237–244)gCys residue as thiols.906.0−c−, not detected. 906Cys265 +268/2T19/(245–283)bCalculated mass for carboxamidomethylated Cys residue(s).4573.94574−c−, not detected.Cys265 +268/0T19/(245–283)hCalculated mass as in footnote d plus the addition of two oxygen atoms.4489.9−c−, not detected.4490e Cys residues are forming one intramolecular disulfide bond.a Average masses.b Calculated mass for carboxamidomethylated Cys residue(s).c −, not detected.d Calculated mass for addition of four oxygen atoms.f Calculated mass as in footnote c plus the addition of one oxygen atom.g Cys residue as thiols.h Calculated mass as in footnote d plus the addition of two oxygen atoms. Open table in a new tab e Cys residues are forming one intramolecular disulfide bond. MALDI-MS peptide mapping after tryptic digestion of the fully oxidized Hsp33 showed the presence of all individual peptides indicating that intermolecular disulfide bond formation is not involved in the activation process of Hsp33. This result also ruled out the formation of disulfides between cysteines located on different tryptic peptides. Two ion signals, though, were significantly different from the ion signals of the corresponding reduced peptides. Peptide T16, carrying Cys232 and Cys234, was found unalkylated atm/z 568 (Table I) compared with m/z 683 of the corresponding peptide in reduced and carboxamidomethylated Hsp33. This indicated that these two cysteines are linked with a disulfide bridge and, thus, were found unmodified. In addition, an ion signal atm/z 584 was observed that was consistent with a derivative of peptide T16 with an additional oxygen atom. This ion signal may represent a subpopulation of Hsp33 in which T16 bears a thiosulfinate group (-S(O)S-; (18.Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar)) instead of a disulfide bridge (Table I). Peptide T19, harboring Cys265 and Cys268, was found atm/z 4490 instead of m/z 4574 indicating that a second disulfide bond had occurred upon H2O2incubation in Hsp33 linking Cys265 and Cys268(Table I). Peptide T19 was found 32 Da higher in mass than calculated for unmodified T19 (M r 4458). This indicates additional oxidation of the two methionine residues, Met263and Met277, in this peptide. None of the cysteinyl residue-carrying peptides, including the peptides harboring the less conserved cysteines, were found alkylated in the H2O2-oxidized form of the protein. Peptide T9, which contains Cys141 was observed at m/z 2516, consistent with the addition of four oxygens (Table I). Likely amino acid side chains that may be oxidized in this peptide are Cys141 and Met147. Oxidation of Cys141, e.g. resulting in the formation of a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) would prevent alkylation, Ellman's reaction, and formation of a disulfide bond with this residue. Peptide T17/18 (m/z 906), on the other hand, was found completely unmodified. Thus, Cys239 in this peptide seemed to be buried in the oxidized form of Hsp33. These results agree well with the thiol titrations of oxidized Hsp33, which revealed that none of the cysteines are easily accessible in the active species of Hsp33 (data not shown). We conclude that activation of Hsp33 by H2O2results in the formation of two intramolecular disulfide bonds linking Cys232—S—S–Cys234 and Cys265—S—S–Cys268. These results are consistent with those obtained by ESI-MS molecular mass determinations that showed most of the active Hsp33 as monomeric but heavily oxidized species in this sample (see above). As H2O2 oxididation not only caused formation of disulfide bonds in Hsp33 but also lead to the uptake of additional oxygen atoms, we attempted to prepare solely disulfide bond-carrying Hsp33 species by air oxidation. When reduced Hsp33 was incubated in air-saturated buffer for 1 h and was subsequently alkylated with iodoacetamide, mixtures of differently carboxamidomethylated Hsp33 derivatives were observed after proteolytic digestions. This was very similar to the results obtained with freshly harvested Hsp33. Ellman's titration of freshly isolated and untreated Hsp33 revealed the presence of 2.4–3.0 accessible cysteinyl residues (1.Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). As the sequence of Hsp33 codes for six cysteinyl residues (cf. Fig.1), this result may be explained by partial formation of disulfide bonds. Alternatively, this result is consistent with the presence of a protein mixture consisting of (partially) disulfide bond-carrying and completely reduced species. Proteolytic digestion of Hsp33 after 1 h of air oxidation using Lys-C protease and mass spectrometric peptide mapping showed peptide ion signals that covered the entire amino acid sequence of Hsp 33 (Fig.5). Interestingly, some of the cysteine-containing peptides resulted in multiple ion signals differing by the mass increment of 57 Da, showing the presence of cysteinyl-carboxamidomethyl groups. Peptide L7 that carries residues Cys232, Cys234, and Cys239 was found triply and singly carboxamidomethylated, giving rise to ion signals at m/z 1626 and m/z 1511, respectively. Similarly, peptide L8 that harbors Cys265 and Cys268 showed ion signals representing doubly carboxamidomethylated and unmodified peptide at m/z 5706 andm/z 5590, respectively. In contrast, peptide L4, which contains Cys141, was only found alkylated giving rise to an ion signal at m/z 6511. This result clearly showed that this Hsp33 sample presented a mixture of disulfide bond-containing (oxidized) and completely reduced protein species. It further is consistent with the finding that on native gel electrophoresis Hsp33 migrates as multiple bands. These bands can be converted into single but distinctively migrating bands when either strictly reducing or oxidizing conditions are used (1.Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Incubation for 24 h in air-saturated buffer yielded in fully oxidized Hsp33; however, a mixed population of monomeric and dimeric proteins was formed. The latter Hsp33 derivative harbored both intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds. Small ion signals corresponding to dimeric Hsp33 were observed in the ESI spectra of this sample together with dominant ion signals of monomeric Hsp33. The molecular mass of 65,523 ± 30 Da for dimeric Hsp33 was determined from the spectra (M r 65,546). Proteolytic digestion of this Hsp33 mixture after carboxamidomethylation unambiguously determined the connectivities of the disulfide bridges. An ion signal for T16 (amino acids 232–236) atm/z 568 was observed (TableII), in agreement with an intramolecular disulfide bond that connected Cys232 with Cys234. Further, an ion signal at m/z 5590 represented peptide L8 in which a disulfide bridge was formed between residues Cys265 and Cys268 (Table II).Table IIMass assignments of Cys-containing peptides after proteolytic digestion from air-oxidized/alkylated Hsp33Cys-residue/no. of alkyl groupsPeptideaLn = Lys-C derived peptide; Tn = tryptic peptide./amino acid range[M + H]+ (calculated)m/z(observed)bAverage masses.1 h24 hCys141/1L4/(108–166)cCarboxamidomethylated Cys residue(s).6510.365116510Cys141/1T9/(127–148)cCarboxamidomethylated Cys residue(s).2508.825082509Cys232 +234/2T16/(232–236)cCarboxamidomethylated Cys residue(s).638.7 683−d−, not detected.Cys232 +234/0T16/(232–236)eOne intramolecular disulfide bond.567.7 568 568Cys239/1T18/(239–244)cCarboxamidomethylated Cys residue(s).676.7 676−d−, not detected.Cys239/0T17/18(237–244)fCys residue as thiol.906.0−d−, not detected. 9052x(Cys239)/0T17/18-S–S–T17/18gOne intermol"

A comparison of thermodynamic, proteolytic, and x-ray crystallographic data from previous studies allowed a small number of amino acid residues in subdomain 2A to be selected as targets for substitution. The following recombinant human serum albumin species were synthesized in the yeast species Pichia pastoris: K195M, K199M, F211V, W214L, R218M, R222M, H242V, R257M, and wild type human serum albumin. The affinity of bilirubin was measured by two independent methods and found to be similar for all human serum albumin species. Examination of the absorption and circular dichroism spectra of bilirubin bound to its high affinity site revealed dramatic differences between the conformations of bilirubin bound to the above human serum albumin species. The absorption and circular dichroism spectra of bilirubin bound to the above human serum albumin species in aqueous solutions saturated with chloroform were also examined. The effect of certain amino acid substitutions on the conformation of bound bilirubin was altered by the addition of chloroform. In total, the present study suggests a dynamic, unusually flexible high affinity binding site for bilirubin on human serum albumin.

Early medical interest in the bilirubin-HSA interaction arose when it became clear to physicians that prolonged high blood concentrations of bilirubin, which often occur in premature infants, could result in bilirubin encephalopathy (1.Schenker S. Dawber N.H. Schmid R. J. Clin. Invest. 1964; 43: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2.Bernstein R.B. Novy M.J. Piasecki G.J. Lester R. Jackson B.T. J. Clin.

Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 192: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this condition, significant amounts of bilirubin, which is toxic to all tissues, partitions from the blood to neuronal tissue causing irreversible brain damage. The prolonged high blood concentrations of bilirubin in premature infants results from underdevelopment of the liver, the organ responsible for conversion of bilirubin to a soluble form and its excretion into the bile. HSA binds bilirubin (K d = 10−7–10−8m) at a high affinity site and acts as a buffer preventing the transfer of bilirubin from blood to the tissues, thus playing a critical role in impairing the development of bilirubin encephalopathy. In total, other studies on the pathology of bilirubin encephalopathy in premature infants have highlighted the importance of HSA as a bilirubin transport molecule in normal neonates (who experience a transient hyperbilirubinemia after birth) and in normal adults. These findings provided the motivation for many years of study on the bilirubin-HSA binding mechanism, making it one of the most studied of the HSA-ligand interactions (6.Brodersen R. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1980; 11: 305-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7.Hsia J.C. Er S.S. Tan C.T. Tinker D.O. J. Biol.

Although some studies have suggested that lower affinity binding components (K d = 10−6–10−3m) contribute to HSA-bilirubin binding, most studies have primarily attempted to locate the high affinity binding site and to identify amino acid residues involved in the high affinity binding process. A number of studies that measured the affinity of proteolytic fragments of HSA for bilirubin showed that the high affinity bilirubin binding site was located in subdomain 2A (12.Sjodin T. Hansson R. Sjoholm I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 494: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13.Geisow M.J. Beaven G.H. Biochem. J. 1977; 163: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14.Reed R.G. Feldhoff R.C. Clute O.L. Peters Jr., T. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4578-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 15.Jacobsen C. Biochem. J. 1978; 171: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Subdomain 2A, which corresponds approximately to amino acid positions 190–300, has recently been shown by x-ray crytallography to be one of two principal sites on HSA for small hydrophobic ligands (16.Carter D.C. He X.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 208-215Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 17.Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar). One of the proteolytic studies described above identified a region containing amino acid positions 186–238 as common to all fragments that retained the ability to bind bilirubin (14.Reed R.G. Feldhoff R.C. Clute O.L. Peters Jr., T. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4578-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, another study indicated that the region corresponding to amino acid positions 240–258 was critical for bilirubin binding (15.Jacobsen C. Biochem. J. 1978; 171: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on the above proteolytic studies, the region corresponding to amino acid positions 186–258 was selected as a target for mutagenesis. Selection of specific residues within this region for mutagenesis were based on the following observations. In thermodynamic work on the bilirubin-HSA interaction, the ΔH° and ΔS° were found to be −13.5 kcal/mol and −0.0085 kcal/mol/degree, respectively (18.Jacobsen J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1977; 9: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The observation that the large negative free energy for the interaction was mainly provided by a large enthalpy change suggested the importance of electrostatic rather than hydrophobic interactions. Because bilirubin contains two carboxyl groups, researchers proposed that key lysine or arginine residues in the binding site must form critical salt linkages with bilirubin carboxyl groups. One study claimed to verify the importance of lysine in the binding process by acetylating all the lysine residues in HSA and showing a dramatic reduction in bilirubin affinity (19.Tayyab S. Qasim M.A. Biochem. Int. 1989; 18: 343-349PubMed Google Scholar). Although a further such study showed a reduction in bilirubin affinity only when buried lysine residues (20.Mir M.M. Fazili K.M. Abul Qasim M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were acetylated, these types of studies cannot identify the specific amino acid residues involved in the binding process and raise serious concerns about changes in the global structure of HSA. In another study, an analog of bilirubin was covalently linked to HSA, which was then digested with several proteases (15.Jacobsen C. Biochem. J. 1978; 171: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The bilirubin analog was found to be covalently linked to a proteolytic fragment of HSA that contained only one positively charged residue, lysine 240. Lysine 240 was believed to be critical for bilirubin binding to HSA until a natural variant of HSA K240E was discovered (21.Minchiotti L. Galliano M. Zapponi M.C. Tenni R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and found to have the same affinity as wild type HSA for bilirubin. In the present investigation, positively charged residues between amino acid positions 186 and 260 shown in the x-ray crystal structure of HSA to protrude into the subdomain 2A binding pocket were chosen as targets for mutagenesis. Because of the potential importance of interactions between aromatic amino acid residues and the pyrrole rings of bilirubin, three aromatic residues that protrude into the subdomain 2A binding site were also selected for mutagenesis. The following HSA mutants were synthesized in the yeast speciesPichia pastoris: K195M, K199M, F211V, W214L, R218M, R222M, H242V, and R257M. Recombinant wild type HSA was also produced. The affinity of bilirubin for each HSA species was measured using fluorescence spectroscopy (22.Levine R.L. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 2292-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and a well validated kinetic assay (23.Jacobsen J. FEBS Lett. 1969; 5: 112-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24.Brodersen R. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 1353-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the second phase of this study, circular dichroism and absorption spectroscopy were the methods chosen to investigate the conformation of bilirubin bound to the HSA mutants described above. The decision to use the above methods was based on previous work in which these methods were successfully used to elucidate the conformation of bilirubin bound to wild type HSA (25.Blauer G. Wagniere G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1975; 97: 1949-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26.Lightner D.A. Reisinger M. Landen G.L. J. Biol.

In the present study, the absorption and CD spectra of bilirubin bound to each of the HSA mutants were intercompared, and the differences were used to draw conclusions about the contribution of various amino acid residues to the structure of the wild type HSA-bilirubin complex. The bisignate CD spectrum of bilirubin bound to wild type HSA can be inverted by lowering the pH from 7.4 to 4.8 (28.Blauer G. Harmatz D. Snir J. Biophys. Biochem. Acta. 1972; 278: 68-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or by saturating an aqueous solution with chloroform (29.McDonaugh A.F. Pu Y.-M. Lightner D.A.

In previous work, these changes in the CD spectrum of bound bilirubin have been attributed to changes in the conformation of bound bilirubin resulting from structural changes induced in wild type HSA by either low pH or chloroform. The absorption and CD spectra of bilirubin bound to each of the HSA mutants in the presence of saturating chloroform were intercompared. The expectation of these experiments was that by monitoring how various mutations influence the chloroform-induced inversion of the CD spectrum that it might be possible to gain insights into how specific amino acid residues contribute to the dynamic flexibility of the bilirubin binding site. The techniques used in this study to mutate the HSA coding region and to synthesize and purify the mutated protein have been previously described (32.Petersen C.E. Ha C.E. Mandel M. Bhagavan N.V.

The fluorescence emission spectrum of tryptophan at amino acid position 214, which is the only tryptophan in HSA and is located in the subdomain 2A binding pocket, overlaps significantly with the absorption spectrum of bilirubin. Hence, the net decrease in fluorescence of HSA upon serial additions of bilirubin is directly proportional to the fraction of HSA molecules with a bilirubin molecule bound. Extrapolation of a line through the initial portion of the stochiometric titration, where an insignificant amount of dissociation occurs to a bilirubin/HSA mole ratio of 1, can be used to determine the quenching efficiency, i.e. the fraction of the fluorescence remaining when every high affinity HSA bilirubin binding site is occupied. For all measurements described in this report, all HSA samples were treated identically and all experiments were performed three times. Fluorescence intensity measurements were made on a QM-1 spectrafluorometer (Photon Technologies Int., South Brunswick, NJ). Samples were excited at 295 nm with a 2.0 nm bandpass, and emission intensity was collected through a monochrometer from 330 to 360 nm. The fluorescence emission intensity was determined to be the integrated area under the emission spectrum from 330 to 360 nm. All samples were suspended in 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4 (PBS). The fluorescence of a buffer blank was subtracted from all measurements. For all titrations, 800 μl of an HSA solution was placed in a dual-path length fluorescence cuvette (10 x 2 mm), with the short path length oriented toward the emission side, maintained at a temperature of 37 °C by a constant temperature circulator. All bilirubin stock solutions were prepared by dissolving bilirubin in 10 mm NaOH. Dilutions of bilirubin stock solutions were prepared by diluting the stock with distilled water. For stochiometric titrations, 10 μm HSA was titrated to a bilirubin/HSA mole ratio of 2.0. ForK d determinations, 0.4 μm HSA was titrated with bilirubin to a bilirubin/HSA mole ratio of 4.0. Because the HSA mutant W214L does not contain tryptophan, theK d value for this mutant could not be measured by the above method. For fluorescence spectroscopy, data bracketing the titration midpoint (0.4–0.6 bound) was fit to the single component simple binding equation shown below by the least squares method using the computer program Prism (Graphpad). Number bound=free concentration/(Kd+free concentration)Equation 1 The use of the peroxidase oxidation method to determine the K d value for the bilirubin-HSA complex is based on several assumptions that have been shown to be valid for the wild type HSA-bilirubin complex in previous studies (23.Jacobsen J. FEBS Lett. 1969; 5: 112-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24.Brodersen R. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 1353-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A known amount of bilirubin is added to a certain amount of HSA so that less than 1% of the total bilirubin added is unbound. An optimal amount of the enzyme, horseradish peroxidase, and hydrogen peroxide are added to the bilirubin/HSA mixture, and the rate of oxidative destruction of bilirubin is determined by monitoring the reduction in absorbance of the mixture at 440 nm. It is assumed that only free bilirubin is available as a substrate for horseradish peroxidase so that there is a relationship between the rate of destruction of bilirubin and its free concentration. Because the concentration of free bilirubin is far below the K m of the enzyme for bilirubin, the relationship between the free concentration of bilirubin and its oxidation rate is linear. It is assumed that the rate constant for the dissociation of bilirubin from HSA is much greater than the oxidation rate, so that equilibrium between free and bound bilirubin is instantaneously re-established as bilirubin is oxidized,i.e. oxidation of bilirubin by horseradish peroxidase is the rate determining step. From the start of the reaction until 5% or less of the total bilirubin is oxidized, it is assumed as a simplifying approximation that the free bilirubin concentration is constant. Linear regression through this initial rate data is used to calculate the oxidation rate. Experiments with lower concentrations of horseradish peroxidase and bilirubin in the absence of HSA are used to determine a rate constant for the oxidation process. This rate constant can be used to derive free bilirubin concentrations from the oxidation rates measured in the presence of HSA. The K d values can then be calculated when the free and bound concentrations of bilirubin and the HSA concentration are known. All absorption measurements in this study were recorded with a Cary 1E spectrophotometer (Varian). Bilirubin was added, to a concentration of 20 μm, to 1 ml of a 40 μm HSA solution in PBS in a 1-cm pathlength cuvette equilibrated at 37 °C by a constant temperature circulator. Hydrogen peroxide was added to a final concentration of 100 μm, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of peroxidase to a final concentration of 10 nm. Reduction in the absorbance of the solution at 440 nm because of the oxidation of bilirubin was monitored for 5 min using kinetic data acquisition software provided with the instrument. Linear regression through this data using the computer program Prism (Graphpad) was used to calculate the oxidation rate. The rate constant for the bilirubin oxidation process was determined as follows. 0.1 nm peroxidase was added to a 1-ml solution of PBS without HSA, a peroxide concentration of 100 μm, and a bilirubin concentration of 1 μm, and the rate of bilirubin destruction was monitored by the reduction in absorbance at 440 nm as described above. Varying the bilirubin concentration from 1 to 10 μm did not significantly affect the value of the rate constant determined by the above method. The absorption spectrum of bilirubin bound to each HSA species was obtained as follows. To 1 ml of a 40 μm HSA solution suspended in PBS in a 1-cm pathlength cuvette maintained at 37 °C, bilirubin was added to a concentration of 5 μm, and after allowing 10 min for equilibration, the spectrum was recorded from 300 to 550 nm. Under the above conditions, dissociation is insignificant, and therefore the spectrum corresponds approximately to that of HSA-bound bilirubin. The absorption spectrum of the appropriate HSA species in the absence of bilirubin was used as a blank in each case. The absorption spectrum of bilirubin bound to HSA in the presence of chloroform was obtained as follows. 1.2 ml of 40 μm HSA in PBS was mixed with 200 μl of chloroform previously equilibrated with PBS and allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min. After the two phases were separated, 1 ml of the aqueous layer was removed, bilirubin was added to a concentration of 5 μm, and the spectrum was recorded as described above. All experiments were performed at room temperature using a Jasco 700 spectrapolarimeter. 400 μl of a 40 μm HSA solution in PBS, either in the absence of chloroform or saturated with chloroform as described above, was placed in a 0.2-cm pathlength pockels cell and scanned from 200 to 550 nm. Bilirubin was added to a final concentration of 30 μm, and after mixing and allowing 10 min for equilibration, the sample was re-scanned from 200 to 550 nm. The scan for each HSA species in the absence of bilirubin was used as a blank and subtracted from the appropriate measurement in the presence of bilirubin to produce the final spectrum. The addition of bilirubin to PBS in the absence of HSA did not produce a measurable CD spectrum, thus confirming previous observations that free bilirubin in aqueous solutions does not exhibit opitical activity. The initial hypothesis of this study, that mutation of certain positively charged and aromatic amino acid residues in subdomain 2A would result in HSA species with dramatically reduced affinity for bilirubin, was shown to be false by two independent methods (Fig. 1, Table I). The K dvalues determined by either method varied slightly. This variation is expected as each method is subject to unique systematic errors. TheK d values reported for bilirubin binding to wild type HSA, using either method, vary widely in the literature. MostK d values have fallen in a range from approximately 10−7 to 10−8m (22.Levine R.L. Clin. Chem. 1977; 23: 2292-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23.Jacobsen J.

Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar); for all HSA species examined in the present study, the K d values were in this range.Table IThe K d values determined by fluorescence spectroscopy and peroxidase protection assay are shown ± 1 S.D.

The CD spectra in the wavelength range from 200 to 300 nm in the presence or absence of bilirubin were identical to those of wild type HSA for all mutants, indicating that the secondary structure of HSA was not altered by any of the mutations or by the addition of bilirubin. In the CD spectrum of HSA-bound bilirubin corresponding to the wavelength range from 300 to 550 nm, striking deviations from the CD spectrum of bilirubin bound to wild type HSA were observed for some mutants. Surprisingly, these spectral changes were most dramatic for two HSA mutants containing substitutions of aromatic residues, F211V and H242V. R222M also exhibited moderate changes in the bilirubin CD spectrum. The three HSA mutants described above also had bilirubin absorption spectra significantly different from that of wild type HSA. K195M, K199M, and R218M had normal bilirubin absorption spectra but exhibited slight changes in their CD spectra. W214L and R257M had bilirubin absorption spectra and CD spectra similar to that of wild type HSA. Saturation of an aqueous wild type HSA/bilirubin mixture with chloroform resulted in an inversion of the bilirubin CD spectrum as reported previously for commercial HSA (Fig. 3). All of the HSA mutants except F211V exhibited chloroform-induced bilirubin CD spectra similar to that of bilirubin bound to wild type HSA in the presence of chloroform (Fig. 3). The absorption spectrum of bilirubin bound to H242V and R222M HSA in the presence of chloroform was also similar to that observed for bilirubin bound to wild type HSA in the presence of chloroform. The absorption spectrum of bilirubin bound to F211V HSA was not significantly altered by the addition of chloroform (Fig. 3).Figure 2Circular dichroism and absorption spectra of bilirubin bound to HSA mutants.

There are several potential explanations for this finding. First, positively charged and/or aromatic residues may not be critical in providing the free energy for the HSA-bilirubin interaction. Second, critical, positively charged, or aromatic residues may not have been mutated in this study. One of the inherent limitations of site-directed mutagenesis is that it requires the selection of a reasonably small number of residues as targets for mutagenesis. In this report, information from proteolytic, x-ray crystallographic, and thermodynamic studies were combined to select targets for mutagenesis. It is possible that the solution structure of the subdomain 2A bilirubin binding site is significantly different from that observed in crystals, so that positively charged or aromatic residues in subdomain 2A that appear to be protruding into the binding pocket in the crystal structure are unimportant in the solution structure of subdomain 2A. Third, it could be possible that, despite the evidence from proteolytic studies, that bilirubin does not bind to subdomain 2A. Finally, the large number of amino acid residues in subdomain 2A with the potential to interact favorably with bilirubin, coupled with the unusually high degree of flexibility of HSA, could result in a dynamic situation in which no single amino ac"

To begin our investigation, two cysteine residues (Cys911 and Cys964) in the wild-type α-subunit were substituted to create a background mutant devoid of exposed cysteines (Lutsenko, S., Daoud, S., and Kaplan, J. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 5249–5255). Into this background construct were then introduced single cysteines in each of the five putative extracellular loops (P118C, T309C, L793C, L876C, and M973C) and the resulting α-subunit mutants were co-expressed with the β-subunit in baculovirus-infected insect cells. All of our expressed Na,K-ATPase mutants were functionally active. Their ATPase, phosphorylation, and ouabain binding activities were measured, and the turnover of the phosphoenzyme intermediate was close to the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that they are folded properly in the infected cells. Incubation of the insect cells with the cysteine-selective reagent revealed essentially no labeling of the α-subunit of the background construct and labeling of all five mutants with single cysteine residues in putative extracellular loops. Two additional mutants, V969C and L976C, were created to further define the M9M10 loop. The lack of labeling for these two mutants showed that although Met973is apparently exposed, Val969 and Leu976 are not, demonstrating that this method may also be utilized to define membrane aqueous boundaries of membrane proteins. Our labeling studies are consistent with a specific 10-transmembrane segment model of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit. This strategy utilized only functional Na,K-ATPase mutants to establish the membrane topology of the entire α-subunit, in contrast to most previously applied methods.

The enzyme consists of two subunits, a large catalytic α-subunit (about 110 kDa) and a glycosylated β-subunit (∼55 kDa); both subunits are required for enzymatic activity (1.Noguchi S. Mishina M.

The ion gradients generated by the sodium pump are important for regulating a variety of physiological functions such as cell excitability, contractility, and secondary active transport. Several isoforms of the α- and β-subunits have been cloned from various species, and the primary sequences have been described (5.Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol.

These regions are followed by a large cytoplasmic loop that has been identified as the ATP-binding domain. Chemical reagents that inactivate the Na,K-ATPase (and abolish high affinity ATP binding) in an ATP protectable manner all modify amino acid residues in this loop (reviewed in Ref. 5.Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T.

Most methods used until now to establish membrane topology of the Na,K-ATPase suffer from inherent limitations. Several methods employ proteolytic digestion in sealed vesicles or with purified protein (7.Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Jørgensen P.L. J. Biol.

It is not clear in such studies whether after the initial protease cleavages that the protein retains what can be considered as its native structure. In more recent cleavage methods, based on metal-ion catalyzed cleavages (15.Shimon M.B. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol.

Indeed with this and other cleavage approaches, interpretations based on minor fragmentation products need further confirmation by other methods. In the use of epitope accessibility, assumptions must be made about the effects of permeablilizing detergents, i.e. that such detergent treatments do not alter protein structure (9.Yoon K.L.

These methods are particularly prone to provide misleading information with a protein such as the Na,K-ATPase, where abundant evidence exists demonstrating the mobility or flexibility of its carboxyl-terminal regions. In other methods originally introduced in studies of prokaryotic membrane protein topology, the amino-terminal domain truncations are attached to reporter proteins to determine the topogenic properties of the fusion region (13.Xie Y. Langhans-Rajasekaran S.A. Bellovino D. Morimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2563-2573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14.Fiedler B. Scheiner-Bobis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29312-29320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, because the complete structure of the protein of interest is not used and functional tests are not then available, it is assumed that the membrane orientation of the truncations faithfully reflects their orientation in the complete proteins. In this paper, we describe a different approach to determine the correct number of transmembrane-spanning regions of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit. This method uses data obtained from functional Na,K-ATPase molecules in their native states. Two cysteine residues (Cys911 and Cys964) in the α-subunit are changed into serine or alanine residues; the resulting α “null” mutant protein no longer has available cysteine residues for extracellular chemical modification (17.Lutsenko S. Daoud S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5249-5255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Using this null protein as a starting point, our strategy is to introduce one cysteine residue into each of the putative extracellular loops so the membrane topology of the α-subunit can be probed by surface labeling with membrane impermeable sulfhydryl reagents. The Na,K-ATPase mutants are heterologously expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. We are able to characterize and perform labeling experiments exclusively on expressed proteins, because the insect cells (sf9 and High Five cells) contain no detectable amount of endogenous Na,K-ATPase activity (3.DeTomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Liu G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Blanco G. DeTomaso A.W. Koster J. Xie Z.J. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23420-23425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with a specific 10-transmembrane segment topological model of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit. A preliminary report of some of our findings has been published previously (19.Hu Y.-K. Kaplan J.H. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): 387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA clone encoding the wild-type sheep Na,K-ATPase α1- and β1-subunits was a gift of Dr. Elmer Price (University of Missouri, Columbia). The Bac-To-BacTMbaculovirus expression system was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Site-directed mutagenesis of the α-subunit was carried out in the pST100 vector via the polymerase chain reaction overlap extension mutagenesis method (20.Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar,21.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) using primers listed in Table I. The plasmid pST100 was constructed by subcloning the wild-type sheep α-subunit cDNA into the multiple cloning site of pOCUS-2 vector (Novagen) as a NotI and Sse8387I fragment; two silent mutations were then introduced into the α-subunit cDNA to facilitate cassette mutagenesis (see Fig. 1 A). Using the C911S/C964A mutant as the background construct, cysteine residues listed in Table I were introduced in the α-subunit individually.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for site-directed mutagenesisMutationsReactive external loopPCR primers (5′-3′)Subcloning sitesSilent NdeI siteggatccacgtccaccatatgctcagacaaaactggDraIII/NsiI MluI sitegctgacttggtcatctgcaagacgcgtaggaattccgtcttccBspHI/SacINull mutants C911AcgtggagttcactgcgcatacggccttcttcgBspHI/MluI C911ScgtggagttcactagtcatacggccttcttcgBspHI/MluI C964AgctttcctgtcctacgcgcctggtatgggtgttgccMluI/Bsu36ICys mutants P118CM1M2ccaagctgctacagaagaggaatgccaaaatgataatctgtaccttggXhoI/XbaI T309CM3M4cctttctctgatccttgagtactgctggttggaggctgtcatcttccXbaI/NdeI L793CM5M6gatatttattattgcaaacattccatgccccctggggaccMunI/BspHI L876CM7M8ctccctattcactgcctaggcatccgagBspHI/MluI V969CM9M10gccctggaatggggttgtgcactgaggatgtatccccMluI/SacI M973CM9M10ggtgttgctcttcggtgctatcccctMluI/SacI L976CM9M10aggatctatccctgcaaacctacctMluI/SacIPolymerase chain reaction overlap extension mutagenesis was carried out using primers listed.

Underlined bases denote mutations.NdeI and MluI sites were introduced into the wild-type α-subunit cDNA as silent mutations to facilitate cassette mutagenesis. Recombinant baculovirus was produced by following the Bac-To-Bac™ system protocols provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the donor plasmid pFASTBACDUALαβ (Fig. 1 B) was constructed by subcloning the wild-type β- and α-subunit cDNA into the multiple cloning sites I and II of the pFASTBACDUAL vector, respectively. The β-subunit cDNA was introduced into the vector as an EcoRI/SpeI fragment and the α-subunit cDNA as a SmaI/StuI fragment. To construct donor plasmids containing the cysteine mutations, the wild-type α-subunit cDNA in the pFASTBACDUALαβ was replaced with the α mutants using AflII and SacI. DH10BAC cells were transformed with pFASTBACDUALαβ vectors to obtain recombinant baculovirus shuttle vectors (bacmids), which were used to transfect insect cells to generate recombinant baculoviruses. The genomic DNA of the recombinant baculoviruses were isolated by using the Easy-DNA Kit (Invitrogen) and were sequenced to ensure the appropriate cysteine mutations in the α-subunits. High Five cells were maintained at 27 °C in 250-ml suspension cultures and were split every 3 days with fresh Ex-Cell™405 medium (JRH Biosciences) to keep cell density between 0.5 and 4 × 106 cells/ml. For viral amplification, log phase high viability High Five cells (>98%, as determined by trypan blue exclusion) were infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1–1. After 5 days, cells were centrifuged (500 × g, 10 min), and the resulting supernatants were collected as viral stocks. For protein expression, log phase high viability High Five cells in medium containing 1% ethanol (v/v) were infected with viral stocks at a multiplicity of infection of 10–15. High Five cells were harvested (100 × g, 10 min) 4 days after infection. Harvested High Five cells (∼4 × 108 cells) were frozen at −20 °C for an hour and then were resuspended in 6 ml of ice-cold homogenizing buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). The cells were disrupted via Dounce homogenization, and the cell mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 500 × g to remove intact cells and debris. Into the supernatant containing cell membranes was added an equal volume of 2.55 m sucrose (made in 2 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and the membrane mixture was fractionated on a five-step sucrose gradient as described (22.Yang B. van Hoek A.N. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7625-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sucrose gradients (3 ml of 2m sucrose, 6 ml of 1.6 m sucrose, 12 ml of cell membrane mixture, 12 ml of 1.2 m sucrose, and 6 ml of 0.8m sucrose) were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 28 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 2.5 h, and the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and plasma membrane fractions were discernible at the 1.5m, 1.3 m, and 1 m density regions, respectively. The collected plasma membrane fraction was diluted with buffer (25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), concentrated by centrifugation (Beckman 60Ti rotor, 40,000 rpm, 30 min) and resuspended in a small volume of the homogenizing buffer. The plasma membrane proteins were kept at 4 °C for short term storage and at −20 °C for long term storage (∼4 weeks). A typical Na,K-ATPase assay contained 500 μl of assay medium (0.6 mm EGTA, 156 mm NaCl, 24 mm KCl, 3.6 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mm ATP, 60 mm imidazole, 10 mmsodium azide, pH 7.2) and 100 μl of cell membrane preparations containing 8 μg of protein. The protein concentration was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (23.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the phosphate release was determined as reported by Brotheruset al. (24.Brotherus J.B. Møller J.V. Jørgensen P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase activity was the difference between the ATP hydrolysis measured in the presence and absence of 83 μm ouabain. This procedure was carried out essentially as described (25.Pedemonte C.H. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16660-16665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 50-μl medium containing: 1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 50 μg of membrane protein. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP ([γ-32P]ATP, NEN Life Science Products, and 7.27 μm Tris-ATP) on ice for 60 s, and the phosphorylation was quenched with 750 μl of ice-cold 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 0.5 mm Tris-ATP and 1.5 mm Tris-phosphate. The samples were filtered through Millipore filters (pore size 0.45 μm), washed three times with 2 ml of quenching buffer, and counted in a scintillation counter. Phosphorylation of the Na,K-ATPase enzyme was calculated from the difference between [32P]phosphate incorporation in the medium above and that measured in a medium containing 1 mKCl instead of NaCl. Ouabain binding of the expressed proteins was measured as described (26.Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jørgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2514-2522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Insect cell membrane protein (100 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 50 μl of incubation buffer (3 mm MgSO4, 1 mmNaTris2VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MOPS1-Tris, pH 7.2) containing 3.78 μm [3H]ouabain (NEN Life Science Products) and 1.55 μm ouabain and then was placed on ice for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were filtered through Millipore filters (pore size 0.45 μm), washed three times with ice-cold 2 ml washing buffer (10 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.2), and counted in a scintillation counter. Samples containing 1.4 mm excess ouabain were used to correct for nonspecific binding. High Five cells (1 × 108 cells) were infected for 3 days and were incubated at room temperature for 4 h in 10 ml of incubation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) containing 200 μm MTSEA-biotin (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc). At the end of the incubation period, the cell mixture was briefly treated with 2-mercaptoethanol (14 mm) to remove excess reagent and then was washed twice with 50 ml of the incubation buffer. When the 2-mercaptoethanol quench was omitted, the outcome of the labeling reactions was unaltered (data not shown). Cells were harvested, and the cell membranes were fractionated on the five-step sucrose gradient as described above. For immunoprecipitations, 100–300 μg of plasma membrane proteins were solubilized in 500 μl of 2% CHAPS in the incubation buffer for 15 min at room temperature, and the insoluble material was pelleted (600 × g, 6 min). The CHAPS mixture was diluted to 1% and precleared overnight with rabbit pre-immune serum and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Sepharose beads were pelleted (600 × g, 3 min), and the resulting supernatant was incubated with antibody raised against the ATP-binding domain of the α-subunit (11.Gatto C. Wang A.X. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10578-10585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and fresh protein G-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed twice with 1% CHAPS and eluted with a 30-μl sample buffer (equal volumes of 8 m urea, 10% SDS, and 125 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.8). The protein samples were separated in 7.5% acrylamide gel (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (MSI Micron Separations, Inc.) by electroblotting in 10 mmCAPS (pH 11) containing 10% methanol, and immunostained with peroxidase-linked streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An identical nitrocellulose blot was stained with mouse monoclonal anti-α1 antibody (ABR Bioaffinity Reagent, Inc.) and peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The signal intensity levels on the blots were analyzed by the computer software NIH Image. Using the C911S/C964A construct as the null background, a panel of Na,K-ATPase α mutants was generated. Each mutant contained one cysteine residue in each of the putative extracellular loops (TableI) and was co-expressed with the wild-type sheep β-subunit using infection with baculovirus. The expressed plasma membrane proteins were purified by a five-step sucrose gradient centrifugation and characterized to confirm functional integrity. As shown in Table II, the mutants displayed specific activities in the range of 0.1–0.6 μmol Pi · mg−1 protein · min−1, had equal ouabain-binding and phosphorylation levels, which ranged from 10–100 pmol · mg−1 protein, and the turnover number, based on these specific activities and the ligand-binding levels, were all between 7000 and 10,000 min−1. In other words, all the expressed mutants showed normal functional activity.Table IICharacteristics of Na,K-ATPases isolated from dog kidney inner medulla and from membrane preparations of baculovirus-infected High Five cellsSpecific activityaThe Na,K-ATPase activity for the plasma membrane preparations of noninfected High Five insect cells is 0.33 nmol Pi · mg−1 protein · min−1.Ligand bindingTurnover numberOuabainPhosphorylationnmol Pi · mg −1 protein · min −1pmol · mg −1 proteinmin −1Dog Kidney2.15 × 10427407847High Five Expressed: wild-type17831286357C911A, C964A163181610188C911S, C964A45267726278P118C (M1M2)10810119818T309C (M3M4)12815168000L793C (M5M6)10811129000L876C (M7M8)12215177176V969C (M9M10)61798867174M973C (M9M10)40353616607L976C (M9M10)30036417317Dog kidney enzyme was obtained as described (39,40).

High Five cells expressing the Na,K-ATPase cysteine mutants were incubated with MTSEA-biotin so that a biotin group would be introduced into the α-subunits that contain extracellularly exposed cysteines. After the MTSEA-biotin treatment, the mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the protein biotinylation levels were determined on a blot using peroxidase-linked streptavidin and chemiluminescence. An identical blot was stained with anti-α1 antibody to determine the amount of α-subunit immunoprecipitated. Fig. 2 A shows the typical α-subunit biotinylation patterns for the expressed proteins, and Fig.2 B shows the amount of α-subunit on the blot. A plot of the specific activity of the mutants against their respective α-subunit intensities on the blot is shown in Fig.3 A. A strong correlation between the two variables is found in this plot, demonstrating that the difference in the specific activity is because of the difference in the expression level. The very low level (if any) of labeling of the null mutant can be readily seen by visual examination of the relative intensity of staining by the streptavidin compared with the α-subunit activity (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). To allow for the different expression levels of the mutants, the ratio of the α-subunit biotinylation level to the α-subunit intensity level on the blot was calculated for each mutant. Fig. 3 B shows such ratios normalized against that of the null construct. The relative biotinylation signals for the P118C, T309C, L793C, L876C, and M973C mutants are 4–12 times stronger than that of the null mutant. The ratios demonstrate the significantly greater access of the cysteine residues in these constructs than in the null mutant. To further define the M9M10 extracellular loop, V969C and L976C mutants were constructed. The α-subunit biotinylation and intensity levels for these and the M973C mutant are shown in Fig. 4,A and B, respectively. Good expression levels for the three mutants in the M9M10 regions are observed (Fig.4 B); however, the labeling data of the V969C and L976C mutants showed that these two residues are not accessible from the extracellular medium (Fig. 4 A).Figure 3A, the α-subunit intensity levels in"
https://openalex.org/W1532356970,"Four mammalian β-spectrin genes are currently recognized, all encode proteins of ≈240–280,000M r and display 17 triple helical homologous ≈106-residue repeat units. In Drosophila andCaenorhabditis elegans, a variant β spectrin with unusual properties has been recognized. Termed β heavy (βH), this spectrin contains 30 spectrin repeats, has a molecular weight in excess of 400,000, and associates with the apical domain of polarized epithelia. We have cloned and characterized from a human retina cDNA library a mammalian ortholog of DrosophilaβH spectrin, and in accord with standard spectrin naming conventions we term this new mammalian spectrin β 5 (βV). The gene for human βV spectrin (HUBSPECV) is on chromosome 15q21. The 11,722-nucleotide cDNA of βV spectrin is generated from 68 exons and is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular weight of 416,960. Like its fly counterpart, the derived amino acid sequence of this unusual mammalian spectrin displays 30 spectrin repeats, a modestly conserved actin-binding domain, a conserved membrane association domain 1, a conserved self-association domain, and a pleckstrin homology domain near its COOH terminus. Its putative ankyrin-binding domain is poorly conserved and may be inactive. These structural features suggest that βV spectrin is likely to form heterodimers and oligomers with α spectrin and to interact directly with cellular membranes. Unlike its Drosophila ortholog, βV spectrin does not contain an SH3 domain but displays in repeat 5 a 45-residue insertion that displays 42% identity to amino acids 85–115 of the E4 protein of type 75 human papilloma virus. Human βV spectrin is expressed at low levels in many tissues. By indirect immunofluorescence, it is detected prominently in the outer segments of photoreceptor rods and cones and in the basolateral membrane and cytosol of gastric epithelial cells. Unlike its Drosophilaortholog, a distinct apical distribution of βV spectrin is inapparent in the epithelial cell populations examined, although it is confined to the outer segments of photoreceptor cells. The complete cDNA sequence of human βV spectrin is available from GenBankTM as accession number AF233523.

The complete cDNA sequence of human βV spectrin is available from GenBankTM as accession number AF233523. polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline group of overlapping clones First identified in association with the erythrocyte plasma membrane, spectrin is now appreciated as the central component in a ubiquitous and complex system linking membrane proteins, membrane lipids, and cytosolic factors with the major cytoskeletal filament systems of the cell. The functional unit of spectrin is typically a heterodimer composed of α- and β-type subunits joined noncovalently. Two mammalian α-spectrin genes are recognized, encoding αI and αII spectrin; four mammalian β spectrin genes have been described, encoding βI–βIV spectrin. Combinations of different α- and β-spectrins, together with diversity generated by alternative mRNA splicing, correlate with the localization of different spectrins to different cells and tissues, as well their segregation to specific intracellular compartments, including localized plasma membrane domains, the Golgi, and other organelles (for reviews and relevant references see Refs. 1.Winkelmann J.C. Forget B.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Hartwig J.H. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 715-749Google Scholar, 3.De Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2331-2343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this diversity, an enigma has been the apparent lack in mammals of an unusual spectrin first identified in Drosophila (4.Dubreuil R.R. Byers T.J. Stewart C.T. Kiehart D.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1849-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and later in Caenorhabditis elegans (5.McKeown C. Praitis V. Austin J. Development. 1998; 125: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This spectrin, termed β heavy (βH), is unique in that it contains 30 spectrin repeat units rather than the 17 repeats characteristic of other β spectrins, may lack ankyrin binding capacity, and contains a SH3 domain. Like other β spectrins, it associates with α spectrin, binds actin, displays an ≈106-residue repeat unit size, and contains a pleckstrin homology domain near its COOH terminus. These features mark it as a member of the spectrin family rather than as a more distant relative of spectrin such as dystrophin or α-actinin. In theDrosophila egg, maternally loaded βH spectrin is found in a uniform distribution along the plasma membrane (6.Thomas G.H. Kiehart D.P. Development. 1994; 120: 2039-2050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the onset of cellularization and then gastrulation, βHspectrin redistributes to the apical-lateral furrows. In the adult fly, it persists as an apical protein and together withDE-cadherin contributes to the maintenance of adherens junctions and the apical terminal web in epithelial tissues (7.Thomas G.H. Zarnescu D.C. Juedes A.E. Bales M.A. Longergan A. Korte C.C. Kiehart D.P. Development. 1998; 125: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is essential for normal development, with mutations in βHspectrin (karst locus) displaying pleiotropic larval phenotypes and frequent lethality. The few individuals that survive lack photoreceptor R7 and display bent wings, tracheal permeability defects, and other aberrations (7.Thomas G.H. Zarnescu D.C. Juedes A.E. Bales M.A. Longergan A. Korte C.C. Kiehart D.P. Development. 1998; 125: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have suggested a role for βH spectrin in maintaining apical polarity, cell-cell contact, and cell signaling, although it does not per se appear to be required for the formation of simple apicalversus basolateral polarity (7.Thomas G.H. Zarnescu D.C. Juedes A.E. Bales M.A. Longergan A. Korte C.C. Kiehart D.P. Development. 1998; 125: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar conclusions have been noted in C. elegans, where the βH spectrin homolog, sma-1, resides on chromosome V. In sma-1 mutants, the extent of embryonic elongation is decreased, apparently because of impaired contraction of the actin skeleton in the epidermal cells enveloping the early embryo. Subsequently, sma-1 is expressed in the developing pharynx, intestine, and excretory cells, where it is postulated to participate in the formation of their apical domain (5.McKeown C. Praitis V. Austin J. Development. 1998; 125: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also appears likely that a βH-like spectrin, albeit of lower molecular weight, might exist in avian enterocytes, because their brush border contains a variant spectrin (TW260/240) with an unusually large β subunit (8.Glenney Jr., J.R. Glenney P. Cell Motil. 1983; 3: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although this protein has never been cloned or sequenced, its apical location, size, and lack of ankyrin binding capacity (9.Howe C.L. Sacramone L.M. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggest that it differs from other β spectrins, features suggestive of an avian homolog of Drosophila βH. Paradoxically and unlike the situation in flies, nematodes, and avians, the terminal web of mammalian enterocytes is rich in the more generally expressed αIIβII spectrin (10.Carboni J. Howe C.L. West A.B. Barwick K.W. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 129: 589-600PubMed Google Scholar). We now report the identification and characterization of a full-length human ortholog of Drosophila βH spectrin. Cloned from a human retinal cDNA library and representing the largest mammalian spectrin gene yet identified, the human protein shares considerable overall structural and functional similarity toDrosophila βH. The mammalian protein also contains a unique sequence insertion homologous to a portion of the E4 protein of human papilloma virus type 75. Expressed most abundantly in cerebellum but also in other tissues and especially the retina and gastric epithelium, we anticipate that this unusual spectrin may play a role in organizing the actin skeleton associated with photoreceptor discs in the outer segment of the retina and the lateral and internal membranes of certain epithelial cells. In accord with standard spectrin naming conventions (1.Winkelmann J.C. Forget B.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and recognizing the recent identification of mammalian βIV spectrin, 1S. Berghs, D. Aggujaro, R. Dirkx, Jr., E. Maksimova, P. R. Stabach, J.-M. Hermel, J.-P. Zhang, W. Philbrick, V. Slepnev, and M. Solimena, submitted for publication. we term this new mammalian protein βV spectrin. Unless otherwise stated, all molecular biological procedures followed standard methods (12.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Candidate sequences were derived from GenBankTM by BLAST searching using conserved sequences from human αII spectrin. Oligonucleotides were designed to amplify and sequence the entire βV spectrin cDNA from aCLONTECH Human Retina Marathon Ready cDNA library using platinum Taq high fidelity polymerase from Life Technologies, Inc., following the manufacturer's protocols. The oligonucleotides used are listed in Fig. 1 and Table I. All were designed with high predicted melting temperatures to suppress false priming. Primary PCR2reactions started with 2.5 μl of template DNA and contained 60 mm Tris-SO4, pH 8.9, 18 mm ammonium sulfate, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm each dNTP, 1 μm of each primer, and 1.0 unit of platinumTaq high fidelity polymerase in a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction profile utilized 27 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min followed by a 68 °C annealing and extension step for 1 min/kb of expected amplimer. 5 μl of primary reaction was then used as template in a 50-μl nested PCR reaction under the same conditions. After amplification, 30 μl of the PCR reaction was loaded onto a 1% NuSieve GTG Low Melt Agarose gel, and amplimers of the appropriate size were excised from the gel using a clean razor blade. Extracted DNA was gel purified using GFX PCR gel band purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cloned into the TA-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Automated DNA sequence analysis was performed by the Keck Laboratory, Yale University. Adapter primers provided with the Marathon Ready cDNA kit were used in conjunction with βV gene-specific primers to perform 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends according to the manufacturer's instructions and treated as above. To eliminate errors associated with amplification, multiple overlapping PCR reactions representing the entire length of βV spectrin were cloned, sequenced, and compared with each other and the sequence of Chromosome 15 deposited from the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research. Most sequence analysis was performed using the software Gene Construction Kit (Textco, Inc.) and a portfolio of analysis tools from DNAStar Inc. The intron/exon boundaries were established by comparing the entire cDNA sequence against the sequence of chromosome 15, followed by heuristic inspection of the resulting pairwise comparison for canonical splice junctions.Table IOligonucleotides used to identify human βV spectrinSense5′ → 3′Antisense5′ → 3′50039CAGCTGCTGGACCCCGAGGACGTGG50040CCACGTCCTCGGGGTCCAGCAGCTG50043CTTCCAGCGCAAGGCAGCCCTCCGGGAG50041CAAGGAGATGTGGGAGATCTGGAAACGCAG50731GTGTCAGAGCTGGAGGGCTGGGTGGAGG50042CTCCCGGAGGGCTGCCTTGCGCTGGAAG50732GCTGGAGGCCCGGGAGAAGCTGTGGCAG50728GCGCGCTCCGGAGGGCTCATGCGCAGC50733CTGCAGGACCAGCGGGACCAGGTGTATC50729CAGCCCCTTCTCTTCCATCCACTGCATCAG51082GCATGAGTTCCTGAGGGAGGCTGAGGACC50730CGCTTCACATGCCCTCTCCAGCTCTGCC51085TCATGAGGGCCTGGGCCTTGCAGAGCTG51078GGCTCGAGGGTGACTCTGTGCCAGGAGAG51086CACAAGATGCTGGAGTGGGACCTGGAGG51079CAGGAAGTTCCGCCTGTCCTCCAGCTCC51087TGCAGGCGGGAAAGATCAGTGCTCTGGAG51080CACAGTGGGGGCTCTCAGCTCAACCTCG51723ATGGCCAGCTTCACCCAGGCCGCAAC51081CTGGCCCAGCAGTGCCTCAGCCTGCCTG51748GAGCGGGGCCATGTCCTGGACAGCGAGG51083TCTGATACACCTGGTCCCGCTGGTCCTG51749CATGGGCCACAGTGCTGAAGCCACACAG51084CCTTGGTGGGTGTCCCTGCAGCAAGAAGTGC51905AGCTGGGCCGCCTCTGTGGAACCCAG51904CAGGATGCCAGCCTCCAGCATGCCCAGC51959GCAGAGTTCCTGCGCAACTGTGAGGAGG51960CTGCGGGTGGCGAGTAGCTCGCTCTC52248AGCCCTGCTGTCCACCAAGGAAGCCCTG52090CTGCAGCCGCTCGATGCGTGGGCTGAAC52249CCAGCGGAAGACAGCCAGCTACACCAACG52091CCAGCCGCCGCAGAAGGGCCTGTGT52727CCTGGGAACTCCACACAAATCC52203GGCCGGGCATCCTTGGTCGTGCACTC52744AAGGATGCCCGGCCTGGATGTCTACTCAG52618GTTGCACTGGGGTTCACCTCAGGGATCAG52745CCTGTCAGCTCTCTGAATGAGTGCACGACC52619GGCTCCTTCCCGTGGCTGCTTCAACCC52749ATCCAGGCACAGTGGACCAGGCTCCAGG52728TCCACTTCTCGGCCAAACTTCTGCAG52750AGTGAGCAGAGGAGGAGGCAGTTGCTGGC52729CAGAGGTGCAGGGCGTGCTCGG52960GCCATCCAGCAGCTCCTCATCCCCAAAG52748TGCAGCCTCTGGCTGGAGCGCAGGTCC53052GCCCGCACAGAGAACTTGGCTGC52957CTGTAGGGCCCCTTCGAGCTGCTCCAGC53053CCGAGAGCTGGGCCTGCAGAAGC52958CAGGAGTTGCTCCTGCTGTCCAGCCTGC53054GCTGAGGCGCCACGTGCGGCTGG58000AGCCCAGAGGCCCTTTCCCACAGCCAG58001GCTCCAAAGGGTGCAGCCCCAGGCTGA Open table in a new tab Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues were performed according to the instruction of the manufacturer, using their multiple human tissue Northern blot (catalog number D1809-08, lot number 8904019; Invitrogen), as well as a human multiple tissue expression array (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). βV Spectrin cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 5424–6012 was gel purified and random labeled with [32P]dATP using EZ-Strip probe labeling kit from Ambion. The loading of mRNA was verified by probing β-actin mRNA with the probe provided with the multiple human tissue Northern blot kit. βV Spectrin cDNA corresponding to amino acids 2059–2270 was subcloned into both pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pTRC-HIS-C (Invitrogen) and overexpressed in DH5α strain of Escherichia coli with the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Soluble bacterial proteins were removed with a 1% Triton X-100 extraction in 50 mm NaCl and 50 Tris, pH 8.0, following sonication. The insoluble glutathione S-transferase fusion peptide was analyzed by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained lightly with Coomassie Blue, and the recombinant proteins were sliced from the gel, emulsified, and injected subcutaneously into New Zealand White rabbits as before (13.Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Sera were affinity purified against the recombinant His-tagged proteins using Millipore Immobilon-P membrane blots (14.Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity purified antibodies were eluted from the membranes with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and neutralized with 110 volume of 1 m Tris, pH 7.5. Alternatively, antibodies were generated using His6 fusion peptides (amino acids 1732–2088), and the immune serum was affinity-purified against glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the same amino acids. Western blots demonstrating the specificity and activity of these antibodies are available as a supplementary figure in the on-line version of this manuscript. Fresh rat tissues were quick frozen in OCTTM embedding compound in isopentane immersed in liquid N2. After frozen sectioning, 5-μm slices were fixed on glass slides for up to 2 h in ice-cold acetone. Fixed sections were rehydrated in cold PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in PBS for 1 h. Primary antibodies were applied overnight in a humidified chamber followed by PBS rinse. Cy3-labeled secondary goat anti-rabbit antibodies were then applied for 2 h. After washing, slides were mounted with glass coverslips and visualized by epifluorescence using an Olympus AX-70 microscope. Alternatively, human tissues were obtained at autopsy under protocols approved by the Yale Human Investigation committee (numbers 2422 and 3388) and fixed in buffered formalin. Fresh tissues from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were harvested into phosphate-buffered formalin. These human or rat tissues were fixed for 4–12 h and then embedded into paraffin and sectioned as before (15.Dillon D.A. D'Aquila T. Reynolds A.B. Fearon E.R. Rimm D.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar). Slides prepared in this way were suitable for immunostaining with the protocols used for frozen sectioning, provided that the deparaffinized sections were autoclaved for 5–7 min in 6.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0 (15.Dillon D.A. D'Aquila T. Reynolds A.B. Fearon E.R. Rimm D.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blotting, cells or tissues were lysed in lysis buffer (2% SDS in PBS plus protease inhibitors) and separated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, proteins of interest were detected with affinity purified antibodies. Protein determinations were carried out using the Pierce BCA method, as described in the Pierce Catalog and Handbook (16.AnonymousPierce Catalog and Handbook. Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford1994: T116Google Scholar). βV spectrin was identifiedin silico by pairwise comparison of αII spectrin amino acid sequences with the High Throughput Genomic Sequence data base using TBLASTN, a program that dynamically translates the nucleotide sequence into all six reading frames and compares them against a protein query sequence (17.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). A match was made with GenBankTM accession number AC009877, a sequence deposited from the Whitehead Institute of the MIT Center for Genome Research. This sequence consisted of 19 unordered contigs of 166,613 base pairs located on chromosome 15. A BLAST search using these contigs identified 11 direct matches from the nonredundant data base of expressed sequence tags. Of these matches, two were derived from libraries of pooled human tissues (GenBankTM accession numbers AI743728 andAI803545), one was from a Gessler Wilms tumor library (accession numberAA599654), two were from human fetal heart (accession numbers W95544, and W95287), and the remaining six were from human retina libraries (accession numbers AA020814, R84914, H87737, AA021476, R85945, andW96166). Sequences at both the 5′ and 3′ ends were extended by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a Marathon-Ready cDNA library from human retina (CLONTECH). Oligonucleotide primers flanking selected sites within the putative sequence were selected so as to cover the entire length of the expressed gene, and PCR was used to amplify the requisite sequences from a human retina cDNA library (CLONTECH). The oligonucleotides used to span the sequence of βV spectrin are summarized in Fig. 1 and in TableI. All reaction products were sequenced in both directions from at least two independent amplification reactions. Where discrepancies were identified between reactions or with the available expressed sequence tag or genomic sequences (see below), additional reactions and sequencing were carried out to assure the fidelity of the reported sequence. The complete cDNA sequence of βV spectrin derived from this analysis is available from GenBankTM as accession number AF233523. The full-length cDNA comprises 11,722 nucleotides and includes 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of 288 and 469 nucleotides, respectively. Not shown is the polyadenylation sequence at the 3′ end, which is present on clones abutting this end of the gene. The open coding region consists of 11,025 nucleotides, predicting a 3,675-amino acid, 416,960-kDa protein (Fig. 2). A satisfactory Kozak initiation sequence is present immediately upstream of the first ATG, and an in-frame stop codon occurs at nucleotide 88. We are thus confident that the first ATG beginning at nucleotide 229 is the initiator methionine of the derived protein. The derived protein sequence of βV spectrin displays many unusual features that define it both as a β-spectrin, as well as a mammalian ortholog of Drosophila βH spectrin. A characteristic feature of all spectrins is the presence of an ≈106-amino acid repetitive unit composed of three α-helices; typically within this unit there is strong conservation of tryptophane followed by a hydrophobic residue at positions 17 and 18. Leucines are also typically found at positions 94 and 104. In vitrostudies suggest that these residues are needed for maximal conformational stability (18.MacDonald R.I. Musacchio A. Holmgren R.A. Saraste M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1299-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), although they may be absent in regions of specialized function without disrupting the ≈106-residue phasing. Nonhomologous sequences that bestow special functionality may also appear within a repeat unit, such as the SH3 domain or sequences bestowing calmodulin binding activity within helix C of the 10th repeat of αII spectrin (19.Harris A.S. Croall D.E. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15754-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Wasenius V.M. Saraste M. Salven P. Eramaa M. Holm L. Lehto V.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Beginning at codon 305, the sequence of βV spectrin displays 29 complete spectrin repeats and a partial 30th repeat unit (Fig. 2). Like other β spectrins, the first repeat is 120 amino acids in length and contains two short stretches of nonhomologous sequence to which have been attributed a role in membrane binding (21.Lombardo C.R. Weed S.A. Kennedy S.P. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29212-29219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22.Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. De Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10711-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and heterodimer nucleation (23.Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Viel A. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10839-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Repeats 2, 3, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, and 28 lack the conserved tryptophane at position 17 but are otherwise conventional. All repeats align with good fidelity to the ≈106-residue repeat length, and all are anticipated to form triple helical structures (Fig. 2). Other predicted features of this protein along with its composite composition are shown in Fig.3. In βH spectrin, and unlike other β spectrins, a SH3 domain sequence appears in repeat 5, at a position corresponding to the junction between helices B and C. βV spectrin lacks a SH3 domain, but in this same region of repeat 5 displays a novel 45-residue insert (codons 816–860). This inserted sequence is unique among animal proteins in GenBankTM. It is proline-rich and contains a single PXXP motif generally required for binding to SH3 domains (25.Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it shares 42% identity and 50% similarity to residues 85–115 of the human papilloma virus type 75 E4 protein and shows a similar degree of homology to a putative equine herpesvirus protein (Fig. 4 A). Other β spectrins possess an ankyrin-binding domain in repeat 14–15 (26.Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This motif is characterized by a well conserved sequence leading into repeat 15, replacement of tryptophane at position 17, and an ≈43-residue region of poor homology (to other repeats) within the putative B helix. A comparison of all known β spectrins, three of which have documented ankyrin binding activity (βI, βII, and βIII), reveals strong preservation of these features in β spectrins I to IV (Fig. 4 B). However, this strong degree of conservation does not extend to the 14–15 repeat or any other repeat, of βV spectrin. Thus, although the 14–15 repeats of βV spectrin are the repeats most similar to the 14–15 repeat units of the other spectrins, the level of divergence in βV spectrin in this region is such to suggest that this spectrin may not bind to ankyrin. Finally, the last repeat unit of βV spectrin, like the last repeat of other β spectrins, is only a partial repeat. Such partial repeat units, consisting of helices A and B, are characteristic of the heterodimer self-association site that mediates the assembly of the αβ spectrin heterodimer to form the tetrameric unit (27.Kennedy S.P. Weed S.A. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11400-11408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of this site in βV spectrin strongly suggests a role for βV spectrin in forming mixed heterotetramers and oligomers with an α spectrin. Beyond the central repeats domain (region 2), in region 1 of βV spectrin there is a putative actin-binding domain (codons 134–157) that is 58% similar to the canonical actin-binding sequence found in other spectrins and in many actin-binding proteins (28.Matsudaira P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In region 3, a pleckstrin homology domain is found (codons 3533–3641) (Fig. 2). A comparison of the sequence of βV spectrin with other human spectrins, as well as with Drosophila βH spectrin, reveals it to be overall more similar to βH than to any other mammalian spectrin (Fig. 3 A). When each repeat of region 2 is individually compared with the other mammalian spectrins, the overall degree of homology is on the order of 30% (25–42%) with about equal representation between the β versus α spectrins. These similarities are greater than they are to other spectrin-related proteins, such as dystrophin or α-actinin. Homologies over regions 1 and 3 are slightly better (52 and 30% respectively), probably reflecting the functional specialization of these regions. A dendrogram of the relationships between these spectrins and a similarity matrix is presented in Fig.5. A Blast search of the human genome data base using βV sequences identified the βV spectrin gene, which we term HUBSPECV, on chromosome 15. Two sequence tagged markers fall within this gene, G42451 and G42463, which together with the known locus of the flanking gene for cytosolic phospholipase A2 β (cPLA2 β, accession number AF065216) (29.Pickard R.T. Strifler B.A. Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8823-8831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) allow a refinement of its locus to 15q21. Comparison of the genomic sequence against the cDNA sequence reveals that βV spectrin is generated from 68 exons. Nearly all of these exons are flanked by canonical donor/acceptor spice sequences; these and the genomic structure ofHUSPECV are summarized in Fig.6. Based on the identified expressed sequence tag sequences and the sequences derived directly by PCR amplification from retinal and cerebellum cDNA libraries, it appears that the first exon may be alternatively spliced, yielding at least one alternative 5′ transcript of βV spectrin. A second interesting feature to emerge from the structure of the βV gene is its close proximity to the gene immediately downstream, cPLA2 β. No nucleotides separate the 3′ end of the transcribed sequences of βV spectrin from the 3′ end of the transcribed gene for cPLA2 β. The immediate adjacency of these two genes is supported by both the absence of identified expressed sequence tags that bridge this region, as well as by direct amplification across this region of genomic DNA by"

We have used primary cultured neurons to delineate the signaling pathways by which insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which plays a critical role in the survival of neuronal cells, promotes eIF-2B and protein synthesis activation. Treatment of cortical neurons with IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) for 30 min stimulates [3H]methionine incorporation, and a parallel increase in eIF-2B activity was observed. Wortmannin and LY294002 reversed both effects, indicating that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mediates IGF-1-induced protein synthesis and eIF-2B activation. IGF-1 induced glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inactivation in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent fashion because it is inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002. By using GSK-3 immunoprecipitated from untreated and IGF-1-treated cells, we demonstrate the phosphorylation of eIF-2B coincident with its inactivation. The treatment of cortical neurons with IGF-1 also promoted the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The MAPK-activating kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 inhibited MAPK activation and reversed IGF-1-induced protein synthesis and eIF-2B activation. These findings suggest that IGF-1-induced eIF-2B activation on neurons is promoted through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and GSK-3 kinase, and we report an IGF-1-induced MEK/MAPK activation pathway implicated in eIF-2B activation.

Protein synthesis is activated in different cell types by a variety of growth factors, which are determinant for cell growth, differentiation, and survival. The pathway through which this mechanism is exerted is not well characterized, at least in neurons of the central nervous system. Translational control starts at the level of initiation (1.Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996Google Scholar, 2.Clemens M.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The polypeptide chain initiation depends on initiation factor 2 (eIF-2),1 which is required for ternary complex formation (eIF-2·GTP·Met-tRNAi), as well as the binding of mRNA to the ribosomes and recognition of the initiator codon, and constitutes the steps subject to the finest regulation. The eIF-2 factor is required for priming each 40 S ribosomal subunit for every round of translation (3.Ochoa S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 325-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4.Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 5.Kimball S.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), but upon 80 S initiation complex formation, GTP is hydrolyzed and eIF-2 is released from the ribosome as a binary complex (eIF-2·GDP), which is functionally inactive. Initiation factor 2B (eIF-2B) promotes eIF-2 recycling by catalyzing the dissociation of GDP from eIF-2·GDP in the presence of GTP (4.Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 6.Manchester K.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), making eIF-2 available to undergo a further round of initiation. eIF-2B activity can be regulated in different ways. Firstly, phosphorylated eIF-2 in the α subunit (eIF-2α) is a competitive inhibitor of eIF-2B activity (7.Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). eIF-2B activity can be regulated in the absence of changes in phosphorylated eIF-2α (eIF-2αP) levels; thus allosteric effectors such as NADPH that binds to eIF-2B are necessary to maintain nucleotide exchange activity in vitro(8.Dholakia J.N. Mueser T.C. Woodley C.L. Parkhurst L.J. Wahba A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6746-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, eIF-2B activity can be regulated in vitro by phosphorylation of its ε subunit. Three kinases have been described that are able to phosphorylate in vitro the ε subunit of eIF-2B (eIF-2Bε), casein kinases 1 and 2, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) (9.Dholakia J.N. Wahba A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10.Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem.

We have investigated the effect of IGF-1 on protein synthesis and eIF-2B activities in primary cultures of cortical neurons. Furthermore, by using specific inhibitors of PI3-K and MEK (MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-activating kinase) and studying GSK-3 and MAPK, we have delineated the two signal transduction pathways involved in eIF-2B activation. In the present paper, we first report two new findings. First, our findings provide the link between IGF-1-induced cellular growth and protein synthesis and eIF-2B activation. Secondly, we present evidence for the involvement of both PI3-K and MEK signaling pathways in IGF-1-dependent eIF-2B activation on neuronal cells. IGF-1, wortmannin, anti-ERK1 and 2, and anti-ERK1 and 2 diphosphorylated were provided by Sigma, PD-98059 was from Biomol, Leibovitz L-15, Ham's F-12, and high glucose Dulbecco's medium were from Life Technologies, Inc., and [3H]GDP and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Synthetic peptides were supplied by Chiron Technologies, anti-GSK-3β was from Transduction Laboratories, and anti-phospho-GSK-3β(Ser9) was supplied by Chemicon. eIF-2 and eIF-2B were purified from calf brain (34.Alcázar A. Martı́n M.E. Soria E. Rodrı́guez S., L. Fando J. Salinas M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of cells from cerebral cortex were prepared from 16-day-old fetuses removed from timed pregnant Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats. Fetuses were placed in Leibovitz L-15 medium for brain dissection. The cerebral cortex was separated from the rest of the brain using iridectomy scissors, and the meningeal membranes were carefully removed. The resulting pieces were then dissociated using Pasteur pipette and 20–21G needles into a homogeneous cell suspension. Trypan blue exclusion was used to count the living cells. Neurons was seeded on plastic multidishes precoated with 0.05 mg/ml poly-d-lysine at a density of 2–2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 and cultured at 37 °C with 5.5% CO2 in air, in Dulbecco's medium with 15% fetal calf serum. After 24 h, cultures were placed and maintained in serum-free medium Dulbecco's/Ham's F-12 (1:1, v/v) (D:F medium) supplemented with 1.8 mg/ml glucose, 100 μg/ml transferrin, 100 μm putrescine, 20 nm progesterone, and 30 nm sodium selenite. 6–7-day-old neurons in culture were used in the experiments. The neuronal content, as determined by immunocytochemistry with antibodies against the neuron-specific protein β-tubulin isotype III, was found to be more than 90%. Cells were maintained in D:F medium without supplements for 16 h before treatments and then placed in the same medium in the absence or presence of additives. When inhibitors were used, cells were treated with the inhibitors for 1 h before and during the treatment. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before harvesting. Protein synthesis rate was assessed in 16-mm multidishes where the medium was aspirated and replaced with 0.25 ml of fresh medium containing 0.35 Ci/mmol [3H]methionine (115 μm). After incubation, the dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were harvested in 0.25 ml of 0.25% Nonidet P-40 in buffer 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine and centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g. The protein present in the supernatant was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. Both untreated and treated cells cultured on 35-mm multidishes were lysed for 10 min in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and antipain, 2 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium molybdate, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysate was made to 4 mm magnesium acetate and 140 mm potassium acetate and was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g. All the steps were carried out at 4 °C. A binary complex eIF-2·[3H]GDP was formed as described (35.Alcázar A. Rivera J. Gómez-Calcerrada M. Muñoz F. Salinas M. Fando J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 38: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). eIF-2B activity present in cell extracts (60 μg of protein) was measured for its capacity to exchange eIF-2-bound [3H]GDP for free GDP (35.Alcázar A. Rivera J. Gómez-Calcerrada M. Muñoz F. Salinas M. Fando J.L. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 38: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 1 pmol of eIF-2·[3H]GDP was used as a substrate, and the GDP exchange reaction was incubated for 5 min. eIF-2B activity was expressed as a percentage or pmol of [3H]GDP released from binary complex. Both untreated and treated cells cultured on 35-mm multidishes were harvested, lysed in 8.5 m urea, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 70 mm sodium chloride (10 × 106 cells/ml), and kept for 30 min at room temperature. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 18,500 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was resolved in horizontal isoelectric focusing slab gels. The bands corresponding to eIF-2α and eIF-2αP proteins were stained on immunoblots with a polyclonal antibody (1:100) purified by immunoaffinity and quantified as described (36.Alcázar A. Martı́n de la Vega C. Bazán E. Fando J.L. Salinas M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with an image analyzer with software package (DiversityOne, PDI, New York). eIF-2B levels were determined in cell extracts, prepared in the same way as that for eIF-2B assay, from both untreated and treated cells by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blots. The blots were stained with a monoclonal antibody (1:500) raised against the ε subunit of eIF-2B (eIF-2Bε), a generous gift from Dr. Kimball (University of Hershey, Hershey, Pennsylvania). Quantification of bands was as described above. Cell extracts (10 μg), prepared in the same way as that for eIF-2B assay, from both untreated and treated cells were assayed for GSK-3 activity in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 Ci/mmol), with 12 μg of RRAAEELDSRAGS(P)PQL eIF-2Bε-based peptide used as a substrate, or with 12 μg of RRAAEELDSRAGAPQL as a negative control as described (37.Welsh G.I. Patel J.C. Proud C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), in a volume of 25 μl. After 15 min at 30 °C, 10 μl of the sample was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper, rinsed three times with 3% (v/v) phosphoric acid, and counted. The other 10-μl sample of the reaction mixture was analyzed by SDS-PAGE run at a pH of 7.8 (to avoid the peptide exclusion) followed by autoradiography and quantified with an image analyzer as described above. For eIF-2Bε phosphorylation by GSK-3, 50 μg of cell extract was immunoprecipitated with 3 μl of anti-GSK-3β and 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose as described (38.Van Lint J. Khandelwal R.L. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One-half of the immunoprecipitated sample was incubated in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 μm ATP, 7 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of purified eIF-2B in a volume of 25 μl for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 12.5 μl of SDS sample buffer and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. The dried gel was stained and exposed to film. The resulting autoradiographs were quantified as described above. The other fraction was incubated in the same conditions without radioactive ATP and with 0.3 μg of purified eIF-2B and assayed for eIF-2B activity as described above. Cell extracts, prepared in the same way as that for eIF-2B assay, was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the blots were visualized by using specific polyclonal antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated GSK-3β(Ser9) (inactive form of the kinase). The total amount of the kinase was detected with a monoclonal antibody, recognizing both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of GSK-3β. To detect the ERK1 and 2 MAP kinases, phosphorylation protein immunoblot analysis was performed by using anti-ERK1 and 2 diphosphorylated monoclonal antibody, which recognizes neither the nonphosphorylated nor the monophosphorylated forms of the enzyme (inactive forms). Equal loading of samples was checked with an anti-ERK1 and 2 polyclonal antibody. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. values for independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using t test for paired and unpaired dataversus control values or analysis of variance and Dunnett's post-test for comparisons between treated groups. Cultured neurons were treated with IGF-1 for 30 min, 60 min, or 2 h, and the protein synthesis rate was determined in the presence of 0.35 Ci/mmol [3H]methionine (115 μm). As shown in Fig.1 A, amino acid incorporation was linear (r2, 0.994 both) at all the times assayed. Protein synthesis was significantly increased after exposure to 10 μg/ml insulin (not shown) and 100 ng/ml IGF-1 1.25- and 1.3-fold over control, respectively (Fig. 1 A). A concentration of 0.1 μm wortmannin, a PI3-K inhibitor, was enough to block the activation of [3H]methionine incorporation produced by IGF-1 (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that PI3-K pathway is necessary for protein synthesis activation. Moreover, PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 (30 μm) reduced protein synthesis rate below 0.1 μm wortmannin level. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 (30 μm) inhibited protein synthesis rate below control levels. This finding suggests a role for MEK/MAPK kinases activation in growth factor-induced protein synthesis in our cultures. Neuronal cells were treated for 30 min with growth factors and processed to measure eIF-2B activity as described above (see “Experimental Procedures”). Insulin (10 μg/ml) increased eIF-2B activity by 32% (not shown), whereas IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) induced a 45% increase (Fig.2) and nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) did not have any effects on eIF-2B activity (not shown). Fig.2 A shows the linearity (r2, 0.959) of the reaction between 0.5 and 1.5 pmol of substrate (binary complex, eIF-2·[3H]GDP). Wortmannin, PD98059, and LY294002 inhibited IGF-1-induced activation of eIF-2B (Fig. 2 B), paralleling the effects produced on protein synthesis (Fig.1 B). The inhibitors did not produce any effects on untreated control cells or eIF-2B activity assay at the concentrations tested (not shown). IGF-1-induced increased eIF-2B activity, which might be due to decreased levels of their physiological inhibitor (eIF-2αP), or might be a reflection of increased cellular levels of the factor. Consequently, untreated and IGF-1-treated cells for 30 min were lysed and analyzed by horizontal isoelectric focusing slab gels and protein immunoblot to determine eIF-2α and eIF-2αP levels or by SDS-PAGE and protein immunoblot to achieve eIF-2Bε levels. The bands corresponding to eIF-2α and phosphorylated eIF-2α (eIF-2αP) were identified by a polyclonal antibody recognizing both forms of eIF-2α (Fig. 3 A). eIF-2B protein detection was carried out by a monoclonal antibody recognizing eIF-2Bε, and the amount of eIF-2Bε was considered as being representative of the total amount of eIF-2B (Fig. 3 B). Quantification of the bands in three independent experiments showed no differences between untreated and IGF-1-treated cells in the phosphorylated form of eIF-2α (12.4 ± 1.3% versus11.5 ± 0.8% of total eIF-2α) or eIF-2B levels (62.4 ± 3.8 versus 61 ± 2.1, in arbitrary units), suggesting that increased eIF-2B activity in the latter was not due to either the change in eIF-2α phosphorylation status or eIF-2B levels. To determine GSK-3 involvement in IGF-1-induced eIF-2B activation, kinase activity was measured in untreated and IGF-1-treated neuronal cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, IGF-1 treatment induced a 31% (from 34 to 22 arbitrary units) decrease in the phosphorylation of the specific peptide used as a substrate of the reaction, which correlates with the observed activation of both eIF-2B activity and protein synthesis rate (Figs. 1 and 2). IGF-1-induced GSK-3 inactivation was blocked by wortmannin and LY294002 but not by PD98059 (Fig. 4 B), indicating the known upstream regulation of GSK-3 by PI3-K. PI3-K inhibition by wortmannin and LY294002 promoted GSK-3 activation and eIF-2B and protein synthesis inhibitions. PD98059 did not exert any effects on GSK-3 inactivation by IGF-1, suggesting the independent regulation of GSK-3 by MEK/MAP kinases. To further assess the participation of GSK-3 in IGF-1 signal cascade, both phosphorylation and activity of exogenous added eIF-2B were simultaneously determined in GKS-3 immunoprecipitates from IGF-1-treated and untreated neurons. eIF-2Bε phosphorylation by GSK-3 from IGF-1-treated cells was 32% lower (from 17 to 12 arbitrary units) than eIF-2Bε phosphorylation produced by GSK-3 in untreated cells, suggesting higher activity of the enzyme in the latter (Fig.5 A). As a consequence of lower eIF-2B phosphorylation levels in IGF-1-treated immunoprecipitates, eIF-2B activity was higher in these samples (Fig. 5 B). Both findings confirm that IGF-1-induced eIF-2B activation is promoted via a decrease in GSK-3-dependent eIF-2Bε phosphorylation. By using an antibody recognizing the Ser9 residue in the phosphorylated form of GSK-3β (inactive form), and unable to detect nonphosphorylated GSK-3β (active form) we found increased inactive GSK-3 form upon stimulation of neuronal cells with IGF-1 (Fig.6, A and B,top panels). This phosphorylation was reversed by 0.1 μm wortmannin and completely blocked by 1 μm of the inhibitor (Fig. 6 A). The MAP kinases ERK1 and 2 were activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues (e.g. Thr183 and Tyr185 in ERK2). Interestingly, by using an antibody against these regulatory sites of active ERK that does not recognize either the nonphosphorylated or the monophosphorylated form of the enzyme, we also detected ERK2 activity activation induced by IGF-1-treatment on neuronal cells (Fig. 6 B, middle panel). As expected, PD98059 treatment did not affect GSK-3 phosphorylated status and did reverse ERK2 activation (Fig.6 B, top and middle lanes). To verify that the different lanes contained comparable amounts of sample, all immunoblots were reprobed with the corresponding antibodies recognizing both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated form of the kinases (Fig.6, A and B, bottom panels). These control antibodies were raised in a different host animal to avoid signal cross-reactivity. The findings reported here support the possibility that in cortical neurons two signaling components are simultaneously activated by IGF-1. Interestingly, both signal pathways, PI3-K and MEK, are implicated in protein synthesis and eIF-2B activation. The straight correlation existing between IGF-1 action and eIF-2B activation suggests eIF-2B participation in IGF-1-mediated survival described in this type of cells (29.Dudek H. Datta S.R.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1548-1560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin stimulates protein synthesis in mammalian cells, and at least two signaling pathways, the PI3-K and Ras-MEK/MAPK cascades, may be involved in the hormone action. Several initiation or elongation factors involved in insulin action, eIF-4E binding protein dephosphorylation, S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation, eIF-2B activation, and eEF-2 elongation factor inactivation have been reported (23.Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). On the contrary, in neuronal cells insulin fails to activate MAPK and, at superphysiological concentrations, promotes survival via PI3-K signaling (29.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that in this system the effects of insulin are consequence of insulin-IGF-1 receptor cross-reactivity (39.Schumacher R. Soos M.A. Schlessinger J. Brandenburg D. Siddle K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1087-1094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with these results, we found higher activation of protein synthesis and eIF-2B in IGF-1-treated than that of insulin-treated neurons. IGF-1 effect on eIF-2B activity cannot be explain in terms of an increased factor level or decreased eIF-2αP levels. Instead, the straight correlation observed between PI3-K inhibition, GSK-activation, and eIF-2B inhibition suggests that eIF-2B activity could be regulated through phosphorylation. This mechanism has been proposed to explain eIF-2B activation in response to nerve growth factor and epidermal growth factor in PC12 cells (21.Kleijn M. Welsh G.I. Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Proud C.G. Thomas A.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5536-5541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although eIF-2B activation has been reported in vivo in different types of cells following stimulation with several treatments including growth factors, eIF-2B phosphorylation status in vivo has not been demonstrated as yet (13.Jefferson L.S. Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). IGF-1 has become significant because it is known to promote important cellular responses that vary with the different types of cell. For instance, IGF-1 promotes hypertrophy by growth and differentiation in many types of cells (30.Foncea R. Andersson M. Ketterman A. Blakesley V. Sapag-Hagar M. Sugden P.H. Leroith D. Lavandero S.

Our results delineate IGF-1-induced activation signaling pathway for protein synthesis in neuronal cells, which implies PI3-K activation, as shown with the inhibitors wortmannin and LY29002, phosphorylation, and consequently inactivation of GSK-3 and eIF-2B activation. Although GSK-3 is a substrate in vitro for three insulin-stimulated protein kinases, (p70 S6 kinase, p90 S6 kinase (p90RSK), and PKB), current evidence points out that PKB is the enzyme responsible for GSK-3 inactivation in vivo by insulin (26.van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van Lint J.

PKB is a protein kinase downstream of PI3-K and has been established to mediate IGF-1 effects on neuronal survival (29.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Because PKB is sensitive to wortmannin and independent of MAPK pathway (26.van Weeren P.C. de Bruyn K.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. van Lint J. Burgering B.M.T. J. Biol.

A similar pathway has been proposed to explain nerve growth factor and epidermal growth factor-induced protein synthesis and eIF-2B activation in PC12 cells (21.Kleijn M. Welsh G.I. Scheper G.C.

Our findings clearly show the existence of an IGF-1-induced increase in MAPK (ERK2) phosphorylation (active form of the enzyme), specifically inhibited by PD98059, which demonstrates the activation of this cascade. Our finding that IGF-1 activates MAPK and increases eIF-2B activity, in a MEK pathway-dependent fashion, raised the possibility that MAPK regulates eIF-2B factor. The fact that the inhibition of PI3-K by wortmannin promotes GSK-3 activation and eIF-2B and protein synthesis inhibitions, whereas PD98059 does not affect GSK-3 activity, suggests an MEK-independent regulation of GSK-3. We can conclude that IGF-1 induces protein synthesis activation and eIF-2B activity in a PI3-K- and MEK kinase-dependent fashion. Here we report findings supporting the possibility that IGF-1 promotes activation of two different signaling pathways in cortical neurons; interestingly both of them promote protein synthesis and eIF-2B activation. The observed parallelism between eIF-2B activation and protein synthesis suggests eIF-2B involvement in protein synthesis regulation following IGF-1 addition. IGF-1-induced eIF-2B activation occurs in a PI3-K-dependent fashion by inhibiting GSK-3; whereas MEK-induced activation of eIF-2B might be mediated by casein kinase-induced phosphorylation of the factor or other unknown eIF-2B-specific protein kinase. The two pathways seem to be independent each other, because MEK inhibitor PD98059 did not affect GSK-3 activity (see above), nor did PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 affect MAPK (ERK1 and 2) phosphorylation (42.Vlahos C.J.

Integrin α5β1 has been shown to bind with high affinity to peptides containing an Arg-Gly-Asp-Gly-Trp (RGDGW) sequence but with relatively low affinity to other RGD peptides. The residues within the ligand-binding pocket that determine this specificity are currently unknown. A cyclic peptide containing the RGDGW sequence was found to strongly perturb the binding of the anti-α5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 16 to α5β1. In contrast, RGD peptides lacking the tryptophan residue acted as weak inhibitors of mAb 16 binding. The epitope of mAb 16 has previously been localized to a region of the α5 subunit that contains Ser156-Trp157. Mutation of Trp157(but not of Ser156 or surrounding residues) to alanine blocked recognition of mAb 16 and perturbed the high affinity binding of RGDGW-containing peptides to α5β1. The same mutation also abrogated recognition of the α5β1-specific ligand peptide Arg-Arg-Glu-Thr-Ala-Trp-Ala (RRETAWA). Based on these findings, we propose that Trp157 of α5 participates in a hydrophobic interaction with the tryptophan residue in RGDGW, and that this interaction determines the specificity of α5β1 for RGDGW-containing peptides. Since the RGD sequence is recognized predominantly by amino acid residues on the β1 subunit, our results suggest that Trp157 of α5 must lie very close to these residues.

Recognition sequences for integrins in their ligands include short motifs containing an aspartate or glutamate residue, such as the well known Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)1 sequence found, for example, in fibronectin, vitronectin, and thrombospondin. Interaction of integrins with these motifs is typically of low affinity, and many integrins recognize secondary (or so-called synergistic) sites in their native ligands (4.Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

The fibronectin receptor α5β1 has served as a prototype for the study of integrin-ligand binding. α5β1recognizes an RGD sequence in the tenth type III repeat of fibronectin and a “synergy” site, Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn, in the ninth type III repeat (4.Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although, as pointed out above, the interaction of integrins with the RGD motif is typically of low affinity, high-affinity peptide ligands for RGD-binding integrins have been isolated from phage display libraries (7.Kraft S.

A general finding from these studies is that the specificity and affinity of integrin binding can be strongly influenced by the amino acid residues lying C-terminal to RGD. For example, α5β1 has a preference for RGD to be followed by a glycine residue and a tryptophan or phenylalanine residue (RGDG(W/F)) (9.Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10.Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this specificity and high affinity is not understood but may reflect the nature of the amino acid residues that form the ligand-binding pocket. Since integrins with the same β subunit (such as α5β1 and αVβ1) have different ligand-binding specificities, amino acid residues from the α subunit must play a key role in this specificity. Currently, the tertiary structure of integrins is unknown. However, sequence analysis has shown that the N-terminal half of an integrin α subunit consists of seven homologous repeats, each of about 60 amino acid residues. Repeats 4–7 (or in some integrins repeats 5–7) contain putative divalent cation-binding sites (11.Tuckwell D.S. Brass A.M. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). About one-third of integrin α subunits contain an inserted (I or A) domain of about 200 amino acid residues between the second and third repeats and, where present, the A-domain contains the major sites involved in ligand binding (12.Diamond M.S.

Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The N-terminal repeats of α subunits are predicted to fold cooperatively into a 7-bladed β-propeller (15.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Each blade of the propeller contains four β-strands connected by loops of varying length; these strands are tilted such that the connecting loops are either on the upper or lower surfaces of the propeller. For α subunits that lack an A-domain (such as α5β1), putative loop regions on the upper surface of the β-propeller have been implicated in ligand binding (16.Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W.

Function blocking anti-α5 and anti-β1 mAbs have served as useful tools for mapping the binding interface between α5β1 and its ligands. In a previous report (18.Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), these mAbs were used to show that the RGD sequence in fibronectin interacted mainly with the β1 subunit, whereas the synergy sequence interacted mainly with the α5 subunit. More recently, we showed that the α5β1-specific ligand peptide RRETAWA acted as a direct competitive inhibitor of the binding of the anti-α5 mAb 16 to α5β1; hence, the epitope of this mAb was found to be closely overlapping with the binding site of RRETAWA (20.Mould A.P. Burrows L. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25664-25672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The epitope of mAb 16 was localized to a region of the α5 subunit that included residues Ser156-Trp157. Mutation of these residues to Gly-Ser (as found in mouse α5) blocked the interaction of both mAb 16 and RRETAWA with α5β1. We therefore concluded that Ser156 and Trp157 form part of the ligand-binding pocket of α5β1. Ser156 and Trp157 lie in a putative loop region on the upper face of the α5 subunit β-propeller domain. Although the RRETAWA sequence is not found in any known physiological ligand for α5β1, its binding site on the integrin appears to closely overlap with the binding site for RGD because peptides containing the RRETAWA sequence act as direct competitive inhibitors of the binding of RGD-containing fibronectin fragments to α5β1 (20.Mould A.P. Burrows L. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25664-25672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, differences between the binding sites of RGD and RRETAWA are apparent in that (i) RGD peptides do not competitively inhibit the binding of mAb 16 to α5β1 but instead act as allosteric inhibitors, and (ii) mutation of Ser156-Trp157 has no effect on recognition of RGD (20.Mould A.P. Burrows L. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25664-25672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, the precise relationship between the binding sites for RGD and RRETAWA is unresolved. Similarities between the two high affinity α5β1-binding sequences RRETAWA and RGDGW, in particular the shared tryptophan residue, suggested to us that both motifs may interact with the same region of the α5subunit. Here we show that the addition of the GW sequence C-terminal to RGD converts an RGD peptide into a potent inhibitor of mAb 16 binding to α5β1. Mutation of Trp157 of α5 to alanine blocks mAb 16 binding and causes loss of high affinity binding of α5β1 to RGDGW. The same mutation blocks recognition of RRETAWA. Our results suggest that Trp157participates in a hydrophobic interaction with the tryptophan residue in RGDGW. A tryptophan-tryptophan interaction may also be involved in recognition of RRETAWA. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the specificity of α5β1, and, importantly, constrain the position of Trp157 to be very close to the RGD-binding site on the β1 subunit.

After incubation of the mixture for 5 min at room temperature, unreacted peptide and cross-linker were removed by dialysis against PBS. The dialysate was centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min, and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Purified α5β1 (at a concentration of ∼500 μg/ml) was diluted 1:500 with PBS containing 1 mm Ca2+and 0.5 mm Mg2+, and 50-μl aliquots were added to the wells of a 96-well ELISA plate (Costar, High Wycombe, UK).

Wells were then washed three times with 200 μl of 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml BSA (buffer A). 50-μl aliquots of mAbs (0.3 μg/ml or 1:10,000 dilution of ascites in buffer A) were added to the wells in the presence or absence of 100 μg/ml peptides. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Unbound antibody was aspirated, and the wells were washed three times with buffer A. Bound antibody was quantitated by addition of 1:1000 dilution of anti-rat or anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate (Dako A/C, Denmark) in buffer A for 20 min. Wells were then washed four times with buffer A, and color was developed using ABTS substrate (Sigma). The absorbance of each well at 405 nm was then measured using a multiscan ELISA reader (Dynatech, Billingshurst, UK). Measurements obtained were the mean ± S.D. of four replicate wells. To test the effects of peptides on the apparent affinity and maximal extent of mAb 16 binding, the amount of antibody binding over a range of antibody concentrations (0.01–30 μg/ml) was measured as described above at constant peptide concentrations (0, 1, 10, and 100 μg/ml). The apparent affinity and maximal extent of antibody binding were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis as described previously (30.Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

To test if peptides behaved as direct competitive inhibitors or allosteric inhibitors of mAb 16 binding, the inhibition of antibody binding at different concentrations of peptide was measured as described above over a 10-fold range of mAb 16 concentrations (0.1, 0.3, and 1 μg/ml). The concentration of peptide required to half-maximally inhibit antibody binding, and the maximal extent of inhibition were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis as described previously (30.Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In all the assays described above, the amount of nonspecific binding was measured by determining the level of antibody binding to wells coated with BSA alone; these values were subtracted from the corresponding values for receptor- or ligand-coated wells. Each experiment shown is representative of at least three separate experiments. A 1.8-kilobaseKpnI/XhoI fragment of human α5 in pcDNA3 was subcloned into pUC119, as described previously (31.Burrows L. Clark K. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the GeneEditor kit (Promega, Southampton, UK), with the primer 5′-CTGCCGCTCAGCTTTCAGCTGGGC-3′ to introduce the Asp154 to Ala mutation; 5′-CTGCCGCTCAGATGCCAGCTGGCAGC-3′ to introduce the Phe155 to Ala mutation; or 5′-CTCAGATTTCAGCGCGGCAGCAGGACAG-3′ to introduce the Trp157to Ala mutation. The presence of the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. The mutated KpnI/XhoI fragment was subcloned into pCDNA3 containing α5 cut withKpnI and XhoI to reconstruct the full-length cDNA. The Ser156 to Ala mutation was introduced into wild type α5 cDNA in the pBJ-1 vector using the unique site elimination method as described previously (16.Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with the primer 5′-CGCTCAGATTTCGCCTGGGCCTGGGCAGCAGG-3′. Chinese hamster ovary cells B2 variant (32.Schreiner C.L.

Juliano, University of North Carolina, NC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1% non-essential amino acids (growth medium). Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland, UK) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Briefly, 2 μg of wild-type or mutant α5 DNA was mixed with 10 μl of PLUS reagent and 65 μl of serum-free growth medium and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The precomplexed DNA was then mixed with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent diluted in 65 μl of serum-free growth medium. After a further 15-min incubation at room temperature, the complexed DNA was added to subconfluent cells in a 6-well plate (Costar, High Wycombe, UK) with 1 ml of serum-free growth medium. After 4–5 h incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, the medium was replaced with growth medium. 48 h post-transfection, cells were detached using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin, 0.02% (w/v) EDTA in PBS, and the cells seeded into a 75-cm2 flask (Costar) in growth medium supplemented with 0.7 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). For the Ser156 to Ala mutation cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (16.Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5550-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). G418 resistant colonies were harvested after 10–14 days. To select for cells expressing α5, cells were incubated first with mAb 11 (a mAb that recognizes a non-functional epitope on the α5 subunit), and then with anti-rat IgG-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Bromborough, UK). The expression of wild-type and mutant α5 was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis in FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Cowley, UK) using mAb 11. Cells expressing mutant or wild-type α5 were then cloned by limiting dilution to obtain high level expressors. The percentage of cells reactive to a panel of anti-α5 mAbs was assessed using flow cytometry, using rat IgG or mouse IgG as controls. Chinese hamster ovary-B2 cells, or cells transfected with mutant or wild-type human α5 were detached using 0.05% (w/v) trypsin, 0.02% (w/v) EDTA in PBS, washed with 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the same buffer with 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml BSA (buffer A), and resuspended in buffer A at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar). Wells were coated for 60–90 min at room temperature with 100-μl aliquots of III6–10, or peptide-IgG conjugates diluted with Dulbecco's PBS, and then sites on the plastic for nonspecific cell adhesion were blocked for 40–60 min at 37 °C with 100 μl of 10 mg/ml heat-denatured BSA. The BSA was removed by aspiration and the wells were washed once with buffer A. 100-μl aliquots of the cells in buffer A were then added to the wells and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2. For experiments examining the effect of anti-α5 mAbs or peptides on cell attachment, cells were resuspended to a concentration of 2 × 106/ml in buffer A, and mAbs or peptides were diluted to twice the final concentration in the same buffer. 50-μl aliquots of the cells with 50-μl aliquots of the mAbs or peptides were then added to the wells and incubated as described above. To estimate the reference value for 100% attachment, cells in quadruplicate wells coated with poly-l-lysine (500 μg/ml) were fixed immediately by direct addition of 20 μl of 50% (w/v) glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Loosely adherent or unbound cells from experimental wells were removed by aspiration, the wells were washed once with 200 μl of buffer A, and the remaining bound cells were fixed by addition of 100 μl of 5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS. The fixative was aspirated, the wells were washed three times with 200 μl of PBS, and attached cells were stained with Crystal Violet (Sigma) as described previously (30.Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The absorbance of each well at 570 nm was then measured using a multiscan ELISA reader (Dynatech). Each sample was assayed in quadruplicate, and attachment to BSA (<5% of the total) was subtracted from all measurements. Each experiment shown is representative of at least three separate experiments. In a previous report we showed that a cyclic peptide containing the RRETAWA sequence acts as a direct competitive inhibitor of mAb 16 binding (20.Mould A.P. Burrows L. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25664-25672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicating that the mAb 16 epitope overlaps with the binding site of RRETAWA. In contrast, typical RGD peptides (such as GRGDS) act as allosteric inhibitors of mAb 16 binding to α5β1 (20.Mould A.P. Burrows L. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25664-25672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicating that the mAb 16 epitope does not directly overlap with binding site of RGD. However, we subsequently noted that the high affinity α5β1-binding sequence RGDGW (10.Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) is somewhat similar to RRETAWA; in particular, both contain a tryptophan residue that is important for their activity. We therefore tested the effect of the cyclic peptide ACRGDGWCG (*CRGDGWC*) on the binding of mAb 16 and of other function blocking anti-α5 and anti-β1 mAbs to α5β1. MAb 11 and K20 were used as control (nonfunction blocking) anti-α5 and anti-β1 mAbs, respectively. The results (Fig. 1 A) showed that *CRGDGWC* strongly inhibited mAb 16 binding. The inhibition of mAb 16 binding by *CRGDGWC* was specific because this peptide did not inhibit the binding of four other function blocking anti-α5 mAbs (JBS5, P1D6, SAM-1, and SAM-2). Furthermore, *CRGDGWC* did not inhibit mAb 16 binding in the presence of EDTA (data not shown), demonstrating that the inhibition of mAb 16 binding is contingent on divalent cation-dependent recognition of the peptide by α5β1. As a control we used the peptide ACRGDGACG (*CRGDGAC*), in which the tryptophan residue in *CRGDGWC* was substituted by alanine. In comparison to *CRGDGWC*, the *CRGDGAC* peptide was a relatively weak inhibitor of mAb 16 binding (Fig.1 B), and inhibited mAb 16 binding to a similar extent as linear RGD peptides (20.Mould A.P. Burrows L. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25664-25672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A further control peptide *CRGDGRC* gave similar results to *CRGDGAC* (data not shown). *CRGDGWC* and *CRGDGAC* peptides had similar, weakly inhibitory effects on the binding of the function-blocking anti-β1 mAbs 13, P4C10, and 4B4 to α5β1. To examine the mechanism of the inhibition of mAb 16 binding by *CRGDGWC*, we tested the effect of differing concentrations of this peptide on mAb 16 binding to α5β1. The results (Fig. 2 A) showed that *CRGDGWC* affected both the apparent affinity and maximal extent of antibody binding. The apparent affinity of mAb 16 binding increased with increasing peptide concentration (see Fig. 2, legend), in a manner similar to that expected for a directly competitive interaction (33.Mahler H.R. Cordes E.H. Biological Chemistry. Harper and Row, New York1966: 250-253Google Scholar). However, the observation that the maximal extent of antibody binding decreased with increasing peptide concentration suggests that a more complex mode of inhibition by *CRGDGWC* is also present, in which a component of the total integrin has near-zero affinity for mAb16. *CRGDGAC* had a much smaller effect on the apparent affinity of mAb 16 binding than *CRGDGWC* (Fig. 2 B). The apparent affinity of mAb 16 binding was changed only slightly with increasing peptide concentration, as would be expected for an allosteric inhibition of antibody binding (affinity approaches a limiting value with increasing inhibitor concentration). In contrast to *CRGDGWC*, *CRGDGAC* caused only a small decrease in the maximal extent of mAb 16 binding. We also performed experiments in which the peptide concentration was varied at constant antibody concentrations. The results (Fig.3 A and B) showed that high concentrations of *CRGDGWC* almost totally blocked antibody binding (for low antibody concentrations), and that the concentration of peptide required for half-maximal inhibition of antibody binding increased with increasing antibody concentrations (see Fig. 3,legend). These characteristics are similar to those expected for a directly competitive interaction; however, the concentration of peptide required for half-maximal inhibition of antibod"
https://openalex.org/W2085170367,"The sensitivity of HepG2 cells overexpressing catalase in either the cytosolic or mitochondrial compartment to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and cycloheximide was studied. Cells overexpressing catalase in the cytosol (C33 cells) and especially in mitochondria (mC5 cells) were more sensitive to TNF-α-induced apoptosis than were control cells (Hp cells). The activities of caspase-3 and -8 were increased by TNF-α, with the highest activities found in mC5 cells. Sodium azide, an inhibitor of catalase, reduced the increased sensitivity of mC5 and C33 cells to TNF-α to the level of toxicity found with control Hp cells. Azide also decreased the elevated caspase-3 activity of mC5 cells. A pan-caspase inhibitor prevented the TNF-α-induced apoptosis and toxicity produced by catalase overexpression. Addition of H2O2prevented TNF-α-induced apoptosis and caspase activation, an effect prevented by simultaneous addition of catalase. TNF-α plus cycloheximide increased ATP levels, with higher levels in C33 and mC5 cells compared with Hp cells. TNF-α did not produce apoptosis in mC5 cells maintained in a low energy state. TNF-α signaling was not altered by the overexpression of catalase, as activation of nuclear factor κB and AP-1 by TNF-α was similar in the three cell lines. These results suggest that catalase, overexpressed in the cytosolic or especially the mitochondrial compartment, potentiates TNF-α-induced apoptosis and activation of caspases by removal of H2O2.

Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The most critical protease families implicated in apoptosis are cysteine proteases known as caspases (3.Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar, 4.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Caspases are constitutively present in cells as zymogens and require proteolytic cleavage into the catalytic active heterodimer. Inhibiting the activation of caspases suppresses the ability of cells to undergo apoptosis or causes a switch from apoptosis to necrosis (4.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar, 5.Samali A. Nordgren H. Zhivotovsky B. Peterson E. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 are thought to be involved in many forms of apoptosis. Increased levels of ROS have been detected in cells undergoing apoptosis (5.Samali A. Nordgren H. Zhivotovsky B. Peterson E. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 6.Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress also affects the process of apoptosis. For example, treatment of cellsin vitro with H2O2 causes either apoptosis or necrosis depending on the concentration of H2O2 employed and the type of cells being studied (7.Lennon S.V. Martin S.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Proliferation. 1991; 24: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 8.Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicated that oxidative stress inhibits apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic drug VP-16 (9.Lee Y. Shacter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) or by αCD95 (5.Samali A. Nordgren H. Zhivotovsky B. Peterson E. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). TNF-α is a cytokine produced by a wide variety of cell types whose production is up-regulated in a number of stressful and pathological conditions (10.Beutler B. Cerami A. Nature. 1986; 320: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 11.Tracey K.J. Wei H. Manogue K.R. Fong Y. Hesse D.G. Nguyen H.T. Kuo G.C. Beutler B. Cotran R.S. Cerami A. J. Exp.

TNF-α kills cancer cells in intact animals and a variety of cell lines in vitro by inducing these cells to undergo either apoptosis or necrosis. However, the biochemical basis for the cytotoxic action of TNF-α is still largely unknown. TNF-α has to been shown to increase production of ROS, and this appears to be an important step in its cytotoxic mechanism (16.Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 17.Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Although some studies reported that antioxidants could protect against TNF-α toxicity (18.Zimmerman R.J. Chan A. Leadon S.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 1644-1648PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), there are other reports that antioxidants including catalase did not prevent TNF-α-mediated cell death (20.O'Donnell V.B. Spycher S. Azzi A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In a previous study (21.Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), stable HepG2 cell lines overexpressing catalase in the cytosol or mitochondria were established by transfection with catalase cDNA or with a catalase cDNA with a manganese-superoxide dismutase mitochondrial leader sequence that could conduct catalase into mitochondria. We found that the cells overexpressing catalase in either cellular compartment were more resistant to H2O2-, menadione-, or antimycin A-induced toxicity and apoptosis compared with cells transfected with the empty plasmid vector. In view of the conflicting reports concerning the ability of antioxidants to prevent TNF-α toxicity, and since one major locus of TNF-α-induced oxidative stress appears to be the mitochondrial compartment, studies were carried out to investigate the sensitivity of HepG2 cells that overexpress catalase in the cytosol or mitochondria to apoptosis induced by TNF-α. To our surprise and in contrast to the decreased sensitivity to H2O2, menadione, or antimycin A, cells overexpressing catalase, especially in the mitochondrial compartment, displayed an increased sensitivity to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Recombinant human TNF-α, cycloheximide (CHX), sodium azide, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, MEM, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Sigma. Propidium iodide was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Bovine catalase, caspase inhibitor I, substrates of caspase-3 and -8, and polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit against human caspase-3 or cytochrome cwere obtained from Calbiochem. Zeocin for selection was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). HepG2 cells overexpressing cytosolic catalase (C33 cells) and mitochondrial catalase (mC5 cells) as well as control cells (Hp cells) were established in our laboratory previously (21.Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) by transfection with plasmid vector pZeoSV2(+) containing human catalase cDNA (pZeoSV-CAT), plasmid vector pZeoSV2(+) containing human catalase cDNA with a manganese-superoxide dismutase mitochondrial leader sequence (pZeoSV/MSP-CAT), and empty vector pZeoSV2(+) into HepG2 cells. Cells were cultured in MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 300 μg/ml Zeocin, and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The DNA fragmentation pattern (DNA ladder) was carried out by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cells (1× 106) treated with various reagents were scraped and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, and 0.5% SDS and incubated for 2 h at 50 °C. DNA was extracted with 1 ml of phenol, pH 8.0, followed by extraction with 1 ml of phenol/chloroform (1:1) and chloroform. The aqueous phase was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, at −20 °C overnight. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 50 μl of Tris/EDTA buffer supplemented with 100 μg/ml RNase A. DNA was loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, electrophoresed in Tris acetate/EDTA buffer for 2 h at 50 V, and photographed under UV illumination. Flow cytometry DNA analysis was used to quantify the percentage of apoptotic cells. Cells (5 × 105) were seeded onto six-well plates and incubated with various reagents. At different time points, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed with PBS, followed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 80% ethanol and stored at 4 °C for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS. The pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 100 μg/ml RNase A, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), and analyzed by flow cytometry DNA analysis as described previously (21.Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Hp, C33, and mC5 cells treated as described in the figure legends were harvested by scraping from the dishes, washed with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, and 0.1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, supernatants were transferred to new tubes. Protein concentration was measured with the DC protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Caspase-3 activity was measured in the supernatant using the CaspACETM assay system kit (Promega) by following the cleavage of 50 μm acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. The fluorescence of the cleaved 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin substrate was determined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer 650-10S, Hitachi, Ltd.) set at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. The same method was used to measure the activity of caspase-8 using 50 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin as a substrate and 400 nm as the excitation wavelength and 505 nm as the emission wavelength. Activities are expressed as arbitrary units of fluorescence. To detect procaspase-3, cells treated with or without TNF-α plus CHX were washed twice with PBS, harvested by scraping, and subsequently sonicated at duty cycle 50% and output control 4 for 10 s (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc.). The sonicated suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the protein concentration was measured. To detect cytochrome c, a post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction was prepared by homogenization and differential centrifugation as described previously (21.Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). 50 μg (for procaspase-3) or 20 μg (for cytochromec) of denatured protein was resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-human caspase-3 (1:300) or rabbit anti-human cytochrome c (1:1000) polyclonal antibody as the primary antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (1:5000). Detection by the chemiluminescence reaction was carried out for 1 min using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Cells treated with medium or with medium containing 15 ng/ml TNF-α for 15 or 30 min were harvested by scraping and centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in 800 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After incubation on ice for 15 min, 50 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added; the lysed cells were mixed in a Vortex mixer for 10 s and then spun down (13,000 × g, 1 min, 4 °C); and the supernatant was removed. The nuclear pellet was quickly resuspended in 400 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The nuclei were extracted on ice for 15 min with Vortex mixing every minute. The nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C); the supernatant, considered as the nuclear extract, was removed; and the protein concentration was measured. The DNA binding reaction was performed using the gel shift assay system from Promega according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 2–5 μg of nuclear extract was incubated in gel shift binding buffer for 10 min at room temperature. NF-κB and AP-1 DNA probes (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′ and 5′-CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA-3′, respectively) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 10,000 cpm of32P-labeled DNA probe was then added to the nuclear extract in binding buffer and allowed to bind for 30 min. The reaction was then loaded onto a 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. After gel electrophoresis, the gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film. Intracellular ATP levels were determined using the ENLITENTM ATP assay kit (Promega). Hp, C33, and mC5 cells (∼5 × 105 cells) were treated with or without TNF-α/CHX for 3 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and 250 μl of ice-cold 2.5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added to the six-well dishes. After scrapping from the dish, the cell extract was immediately centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 10 times and neutralized with Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.75. 10-μl samples and 100 μl of luciferin-luciferase reagent were used for ATP measurements according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). Luminescence units were measured using a Model 1251 luminometer (LKB Wallac). The relative luminescence units were used as an index of the intracellular ATP levels. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. The numbers of experiments are indicated in the figure legends. Statistical evaluation was carried out using Student's t test. HepG2 cells were transfected with empty plasmid or plasmid containing human catalase cDNA or human catalase cDNA with a 80-base pair manganese-superoxide dismutase mitochondrial leader sequence, and stable cells were generated (21.Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Catalase activity was increased from values of ∼40 units/mg of total cell protein in the cells transfected with empty vector (Hp cells) to values of 100–120 units/mg of cell protein in the cells transfected with catalase cDNA (C33 cells) or catalase cDNA with the mitochondrial leader sequence (mC5 cells). Isolated mitochondria from Hp or C33 cells displayed low catalase activity (<10 units/mg of mitochondrial protein) compared with mitochondria from mC5 cells (∼140 units/mg of mitochondrial protein). Western blot analyses showed similar results as the catalase activity assays, with levels of catalase protein increasing at least 2-fold in the cell extract from C33 or mC5 cells compared with Hp cells. Catalase was barely detectable in mitochondria isolated from Hp or C33 cells, whereas a prominent band with at least 10-fold increased staining intensity was found in mitochondria isolated from mC5 cells. The activity of the other major enzyme system for removal of H2O2, the glutathione peroxidase system, was found to be similar for all three cell lines; total cellular glutathione peroxidase activity was between 17.1 and 19.6 milliunits/mg of cell protein for the three cell lines, whereas mitochondrial glutathione peroxidase activity ranged between 6.1 and 6.7 milliunits/mg of mitochondrial protein for the three cell lines. HepG2 cells are known to be resistant to TNF-α-induced apoptosis; however, by combining with CHX or actinomycin D, TNF-α induces typical apoptosis at low concentrations and at short times (22.Hill D.B. Schmidt J. Shedlofsky S.I. Cohen D.A. McClain C.J. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1114-1119PubMed Google Scholar). The appearance of apoptosis morphology, including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies, and biochemical changes such as DNA fragmentation and the activation of caspases occurs in the presence of TNF-α plus CHX. Hp, C33, and mC5 cells were treated with medium or with medium containing 15 ng/ml TNF-α and 40 μm CHX for 4, 8, and 12 h, and apoptosis was evaluated by a DNA fragmentation assay and by flow cytometry DNA analysis. Both assays showed that C33 cells and especially mC5 cells were more sensitive to TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis than were Hp cells (Fig. 1). DNA fragmentation assays showed clear DNA ladders in C33 cells (Fig.1 A, lane 7) and mC5 cells (lane 11) as early as 4 h in response to the TNF-α/CHX treatment, whereas no DNA ladder or a weak DNA ladder was seen in Hp cells at 4 h and even 8 h (lanes 3 and 4), respectively. A clear DNA ladder was observed in Hp cells 12 h after the TNF-α/CHX treatment (lane 5), and this was intensified in C33 cells (lane 9) and especially in mC5 cells (lane 13). The hypodiploidy of cellular DNA measured by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining was used to indicate the percentage of apoptotic cells. These percentages were 9, 17, and 18% at 4, 8, and 12 h in Hp cells, respectively (Fig. 1 B, white bars), and increased to 13, 33, and 35% in C33 cells (light-gray bars) and dramatically increased to 48, 57, and 73% in mC5 cells (dark-gray bars) at 4, 8, and 12 h, respectively. The histograms of Hp, C33, and mC5 cells treated with medium (control) or with TNF-α/CHX for 8 h are shown in Fig.1 C. Activation of caspases, especially caspase-3, occurs in many models of apoptosis. In the absence of TNF-α/CHX, the activity of caspase-3 was very low and similar in the three cell lines (Fig.2). Caspase-8 activity was higher, but also similar in the three cell lines. Addition of TNF-α/CHX increased caspase-3 activity in Hp cells, whereas only a small increase in caspase-8 activity was observed. The TNF-α/CHX activation of caspase activity was greater in C33 cells than in Hp cells and was highest in mC5 cells (Fig. 2). The increase in caspase-3 activity produced by TNF-α/CHX was >2-fold higher in mC5 cells than in Hp cells. The only apparent difference between Hp cells and C33 or mC5 cells is the increased activity and content of catalase in the cytosol or mitochondria of the latter compared with the former. To validate that the increased sensitivity of C33 and mC5 cells to TNF-α is indeed due to overexpression of catalase, the effect of sodium azide on TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis and caspase activation was determined. Addition of sodium azide to a final concentration of 1 mmresulted in a 70% decrease in catalase activity in C33 and mC5 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, pretreating the cells with 1 mm sodium azide for 6 h, followed by incubation with 15 ng/ml TNF-α and 40 μmCHX for 6 h, resulted in an inhibition of the TNF-α-induced DNA ladder formation in all three cell lines (compare lanes 4,7, and 10 with lanes 3, 6, and 9). Similarly, sodium azide lowered the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis in the presence of TNF-α/CHX (Fig.3 B). This prevention of apoptosis by sodium azide was observed in all three cell lines, and much of the increase in apoptosis found in C33 and mC5 cells was prevented by sodium azide (percent apoptosis induced by TNF-α/CHX was 16, 33, and 41% in Hp, C33, and mC5 cells in the absence of sodium azide and 8, 12, and 15% in its presence). The striking increase in caspase-3 activity induced by TNF-α/CHX in mC5 cells was also reduced by sodium azide (Fig.3 C). The increased sensitivity of C33 and mC5 cells to TNF-α/CHX and the prevention of TNF-α toxicity by sodium azide suggest that H2O2 may be a key modulator of sensitivity to TNF-α. To evaluate this, Hp, C33, and mC5 cells were incubated with 15 ng/ml TNF-α and 40 μm CHX in the absence or presence of 200 μmH2O2; and after 6 h, apoptosis was determined by the DNA fragmentation assay. H2O2completely inhibited apoptosis in Hp cells (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and4) and partially inhibited apoptosis in C33 and mC5 cells (lanes 8 and 9 and lanes 13 and14, respectively). Adding catalase to the medium abolished this inhibitory effect of H2O2 and reestablished TNF-α-induced apoptosis (lanes 5,10, and 15). At this dosage and time, cells did not show significant necrosis caused by H2O2. The increase in caspase-3 activity produced by TNF-α/CHX in all three cell lines was largely prevented by 200 μmH2O2 (Fig. 4 B). H2O2 also produced inhibition of caspase-8 activity, which was slightly increased by addition of TNF-α/CHX; the inhibition of caspase-8 activity by H2O2 was less than the inhibition of caspase-3 activity (Fig. 4 B). The inhibition of TNF-α-induced caspase activation by H2O2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the levels of procaspase-3. Addition of TNF-α/CHX to Hp cells and especially to mC5 cells decreased the levels of procaspase-3 (Fig.4 C, compare lanes 2 and 6 withlanes 1 and 5), consistent with the cleavage of the procaspase form to the active caspase-3 fragments. H2O2 prevented the TNF-α-induced cleavage of procaspase-3 especially in Hp cells, which show the least sensitivity to TNF-α-induced apoptosis (lane 3). The activation of caspases such as caspase-3 in all three cell lines upon addition of TNF-α/CHX, the increased activation of caspase-3 in mC5 cells, and the inhibition by H2O2 of TNF-α-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation suggest that caspases play an important role in the developing apoptosis and in the different sensitivity of Hp, C33, and mC5 cells to TNF-α. This was validated by studying the effect of Z-VAD-fmk, an inhibitor of caspase-3 as well as several other caspases, on the TNF-α toxicity. At a final concentration of 50 μm, Z-VAD-fmk prevented the induction of apoptosis by TNF-α/CHX in all three cell lines (Fig. 4 A, comparelanes 6, 11, and 16 with lanes 3, 8, and 13), prevented the activation of caspase-3 by TNF-α/CHX in all three cell lines (Fig. 4 B), and prevented the TNF-α/CHX-induced cleavage of procaspase-3 (Fig.4 C, compare lane 4 with lane 2 andlane 8 with lane 6). Caspase-8 activity was not inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk at a concentration that strongly inhibited caspase-3 activity (Fig. 4 B). In summary, the results of Fig. 4 show that the TNF-α/CHX-induced apoptosis and activation of caspase-3 and the increased sensitivity of C33 cells and especially mC5 cells to TNF-α/CHX can be prevented by H2O2and by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Release of cytochrome cfrom the mitochondria to the cytosol occurs in certain systems undergoing apoptosis (23.Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X.

Med. 1996; 183: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c in conjunction with caspase-9 can activate caspase-3 (25.Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Bernner C. Larochette N. Prevost M.C. Alzari P.M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The possible presence of cytochrome c in the post-mitochondrial supernatant fraction of Hp, C33, or mC5 cells was evaluated by Western blot analysis 4 and 6 h after addition of TNF-α plus CHX to the incubation system, a time frame when apoptosis is occurring. Very low levels of cytochromec were detected in all three cell lines under these conditions (Fig. 5). Increased release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria does not appear to be responsible for the increased caspase-3 activity and sensitivity to apoptosis of mC5 cells treated with TNF-α/CHX. Activation of oxidant-sensitive transcription factors such as NF-κB by TNF-α has been observed in many experimental models (26.Hu W.H. Johnson H. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30603-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 27.Kohler H.B. Knop J. Martin M. de Bruin A. Huchzermeyer B. Lehmann H. Kietzmann M. Meier B. Nolte I.

DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that activation of NF-κB and the subsequent activation of NF-κB-responsive genes are a cellular response to minimize the toxicity of TNF-α (29.Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 30.Kitamura M. Eur. J.

Urol. 1999; 161: 674-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Could the increased sensitivity of C33 and mC5 cells to TNF-α reflect a failure to activate NF-κB in these cells (i.e. overexpression of catalase in C33 or mC5 cells minimizes TNF-α production of ROS and ROS activation of NF-κB (32.Schmidt K.N. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Baeuerle P.A. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 13-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar))? We initially discounted differences in protective responses by NF-κB activation in the three cell lines because the presence of CHX, which was required for the TNF-α toxicity, would prevent synthesis of short-lived death antagonists; indeed, the requirement for CHX to observe TNF-α toxicity is likely due to the failure to synthesize protective factors. To study this further, the ability of TNF-α to activate NF-κB and AP-1 was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays. As shown in Fig.6 A, all three cell lines showed a very early response to TNF-α addition with respect to activation of NF-κB; increased binding to a NF-κB consensus sequence could be observed 15 min after addition of TNF-α. Similarly, all three cell lines showed a low activation of AP-1 binding, which increased 15 and 30 min after addition of TNF-α (Fig. 6 B). In general, activation of NF-κB and AP-1 by TNF-α appeared to be similar in the three cell lines. Importantly, this suggests that TNF-α binding and signal transduction are not significantly altered by the overexpression of catalase. ATP is necessary for cells to"

We report in the accompanying article (Byrd, J. C., and MacDonald, R. G. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 18638–18646) that only one of the two extracytoplasmic mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) binding domains is necessary for high affinity Man-6-P ligand binding, suggesting that, like the cation-dependent Man-6-P receptor, oligomerization of the IGF2R contributes to high affinity interaction with lysosomal enzymes. In the present study, we have directly characterized both naturally occurring and engineered forms of the IGF2R for their ability to form oligomeric structures. Whereas gel filtration chromatography suggested that purified bovine IGF2R species exist in a monomeric form, native gel electrophoresis allowed for the separation of dimeric and monomeric forms of the receptors with distinct phosphomannosyl ligand binding characteristics. The ability of the IGF2R to form oligomeric complexes was confirmed and localized to the extracytoplasmic domain through the use of epitope-tagged soluble IGF2R constructs bearing deletions of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Finally, chimeric receptors were engineered containing the extracytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the IGF2R fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor with which dimerization of the chimeras could be monitored by measuring autophosphorylation. Collectively, these results show that the IGF2R is capable of forming oligomeric complexes, most likely dimers, in the absence of Man-6-P ligands.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through its ability to bind several distinct ligands, this receptor is thought to carry out multiple functions in cellular physiology. The IGF2R binds insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) at the cell surface, resulting in the internalization and degradation of this mitogen in the lysosomal compartment (3.Oka Y. Rozek L.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9435-9442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Oka Y. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

The receptor also binds urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, which may be involved in the activation of latent transforming growth factor-β (7.Gleizes P.E. Munger J.S. Nunes I. Harpel J.G.

Finally, the receptor interacts with proteins that bear the Man-6-P marker, resulting in sorting to the lysosomal compartment. Functional mapping studies of the extracytoplasmic domain of the IGF2R have revealed the location of two distinct binding domains for Man-6-P, localized to repeats 1–3 and 7–9 of the extracytoplasmic domain (10.Dahms N.M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22358-22366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The IGF2R functions in the biogenesis of lysosomes and in the uptake and degradation of IGF-II, by transporting its cargo between three different compartments. This receptor cycles between the trans-Golgi network, the endosomal compartment, and the cell surface (for review see Ref. 13.Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Binding of ligands to the IGF2R results in their targeting via clathrin-coated vesicles to the endosomal compartment, where the decreased pH results in dissociation and packaging of the ligands into prelysosomal vesicles (14.Kornfeld S. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 15.Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 16.Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trafficking and recycling of the IGF2R occurs constitutively, even in the absence of ligand (4.Oka Y. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9090-9093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the addition of exogenous Man-6-P-bearing proteins has recently been shown to increase the internalization rate of the IGF2R from the cell surface, possibly through receptor dimerization (17.York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that receptor oligomerization may function in the binding of multivalent Man-6-P ligands, allowing for high affinity interaction with the IGF2R (54.Byrd J.C. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18638-18646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Studies of the oligomeric nature of the IGF2R to this point, however, have been inconsistent. Characterization of purified forms of the receptor by gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation has suggested that the receptor exists in solution in a monomeric form (17.York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18.Perdue J.F. Chan J.K. Thibault C. Radaj P. Mills B. Daughaday W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7800-7811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas chemical cross-linking studies have demonstrated that the receptor forms aggregates in the membranes of intact cells (19.Stein M. Braulke T. Krentler C. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1987; 368: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent observations, however, suggest that the IGF2R may bind multivalent Man-6-P-bearing lysosomal enzymes by forming an oligomeric receptor complex. Addition of exogenous Man-6-P-bearing proteins influences the oligomeric nature of the receptor in vitro, as measured by gel filtration chromatography, and alters the rate of receptor trafficking in cell culture models (17.York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, the repeat 3 and repeat 9 Man-6-P binding domains of the IGF2R demonstrate distinct preferences in their ability to sort lysosomal enzymes, which could be explained if the Man-6-P binding domains of the receptor interact in an oligomer to form two unique binding sites (12.Marron-Terada P.G. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22358-22366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, we report in the accompanying article (54.Byrd J.C. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18638-18646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that the IGF2R displayed negative cooperativity in binding a multivalent Man-6-P-bearing ligand, and that the repeat 3 and repeat 9 Man-6-P binding domains can form high affinity binding sites independently of each other. However, the mechanism of IGF2R oligomerization is poorly understood. It has remained unclear if binding of ligand stimulates dimerization of the IGF2R or if the presence of an existing receptor dimer allows for high affinity Man-6-P binding. Receptor oligomerization plays an important role in the function of many other membrane proteins. Signal transduction through many of the tyrosine kinase receptors is controlled by receptor dimerization (20.Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 443-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In addition, for molecules such as the insulin family of receptors, constitutive receptor dimers are not only important for signal transduction, but for ligand binding as well (21.Sweet L.J. Morrison B.D. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6939-6942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, receptor oligomerization confers high affinity Man-6-P-specific lysosomal enzyme binding on the related cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) (22.Marron-Terada P.G. Bollinger K.E. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17223-17229Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These examples suggest that the oligomeric state of the IGF2R may be important in the overall function of this ubiquitously expressed receptor. In this report, we have studied the ability of the IGF2R to form dimeric complexes in the presence and absence of Man-6-P ligands using both naturally occurring forms of the IGF2R as well as human IGF2R constructs encompassing portions of the receptor's extracytoplasmic domain. The natural state of the IGF2R appears to be a constitutive dimer, as this receptor formed oligomeric complexes through its extracytoplasmic domain in a ligand-independent manner.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2553-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. William S. Sly (St. Louis University Medical Center, St. Louis, MO). The EGFRvIII cDNA was from the laboratory of Dr. Surinder K. Batra (University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE). Both the α-Myc antibody and a cDNA encoding a carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged version of the kinase suppressor of Ras (pCMV5/KSRF) (25.Joneson T. Fulton J.A. Volle D.J. Chaika O.V. Bar-Sagi D. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7743-7748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were gifts of the laboratory of Dr. Robert E. Lewis (University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE). Restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Other reagents and supplies were obtained from sources as indicated. Two forms of the IGF2R were purified from bovine sources. First, the soluble IGF2R (sIGF2R) was purified from outdated lots of fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) following a modified procedure of Valenzano et al. (26.Valenzano K.J. Kallay L.M. Lobel P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 ml of FBS was diluted 2-fold with buffer to a final concentration of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and passed twice over a 5-ml pentamannose phosphate (PMP)-Sepharose affinity column, which was prepared as described previously (23.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The column was then washed five times with 5 ml of column buffer containing 5 mmglucose 6-phosphate. The bound sIGF2R was then eluted from the column with 25 ml of column buffer containing 10 mmMan-6-P. Fractions containing the sIGF2R were pooled and lyophilized. Purification of the sIGF2R yielded about 7–10 mg of protein/liter of FBS, determined by Coomassie Blue staining of samples analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The full-length IGF2R was purified from bovine liver according to a modified procedure of York et al. (17.York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After homogenization of 220 g of bovine liver and extraction in a buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 7, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 80 μg/ml benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, the full-length IGF2R was affinity-purified on PMP-Sepharose as described for the soluble receptor. Samples containing the receptor were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until use. This procedure yielded about 1.5 mg of purified IGF2R, as determined by Coomassie Blue staining of material analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After affinity purification, aliquots of the lyophilized IGF2R species (approximately 0.75 mg) were dissolved in 150 mm ammonium acetate, 250 mmacetic acid, pH 4.5, and applied to a 20-ml Superose 12 column equilibrated under the same acidic conditions as described by Valenzanoet al. (26.Valenzano K.J. Kallay L.M. Lobel P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Elution of the purified receptor was monitored by both absorbance at 280 nm and with SDS-PAGE of the fractions and Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). This acidic gel filtration step was used to remove any Man-6-P and other phosphomannosylated ligands that may have copurified with the IGF2R during the affinity chromatography. Fractions containing the receptors were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until use. The oligomeric state of both the sIGF2R and full-length IGF2R species was analyzed with fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) analysis on an analytical 20-ml Superose-12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with column buffer (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, and 0.05% Triton X-100). Aliquots (0.2 mg) of the lyophilized, affinity-purified receptors were resuspended in 0.2 ml of water and run on the column. Elution of the purified receptor was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Stokes radius measurements were made by comparing elution profiles of the receptors to those of protein standards: thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, aldolase, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Native gel electrophoresis of the receptors was carried out by a modified procedure of Kuehn et al. (27.Kuehn L. Meyer H. Rutschmann M. Thamm P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 113: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Aliquots (1–10 μg protein) of sIGF2R or IGF2R directly eluted from the PMP-Sepharose column were electrophoresed on native PAGE composed of a 4–12% linear gradient containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After electrophoresis, protein was detected with Coomassie Blue staining. Stokes radius estimates were made by comparing the mobility of the receptor to that of native gel standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To determine the role that Man-6-P and other phosphomannosylated ligands play in the topology of the receptor's extracytoplasmic domain, aliquots (0.5 mg) of the purified soluble IGF2R were resuspended in water and dialyzed for 24 h against HBST (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100) using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Pierce) to remove the Man-6-P. In addition, a pseudoglycoprotein containing multiple Man-6-P moieties, PMP-BSA, was synthesized as previously reported (23.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the purified sIGF2R (1–10 μg of protein) were incubated with a range of PMP-BSA concentrations (from 1–8000 nm) in 30 μl of HBST for 3 h at 3 °C and then subjected to native PAGE or cross-linked with 2.5 mmdisuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) at 3 °C for 15 min and resolved by 6% reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Ligand blotting was performed using a modified procedure published earlier for the detection of IGF-binding proteins (28.Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). The purified sIGF2R and full-length IGF2R (∼ 1 μg for each lane) were electrophoresed on native 4–12% gradient gels as described above, then transferred to BA85 nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were washed and blocked with 1% BSA. Affinity for IGF-II and PMP-BSA was detected by probing the blots with 1.5 × 106 cpm 125I-PMP-BSA or 125I-IGF-II in 8 ml of blocking solution for 16 h at 3 °C. The blots were then washed and exposed to x-ray film. Intensity of ligand binding was determined using a densitometer with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). A soluble construct containing all 15 extracytoplasmic repeats of the IGF2R followed by a FLAG epitope, 15F, was engineered using the hIGF2R cDNA as described previously (23.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A similar construct, 15myc, was generated using the same strategy with a COOH-terminal Myc epitope tag (MEQKLISEEDLN) (29.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar) engineered in place of the FLAG tag. Transient expression of these truncated constructs was done by calcium phosphate precipitation following a previously described method in 293T human embryonic kidney cells (23.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Coexpression of the 15F and 15myc constructs was performed by mixing equal amounts of the cDNAs (30 μg each/100-mm dish containing approximately 2.5 million cells) prior to transfection. Serum-free conditioned media (24 h) and 1% Triton X-100 cell lysates were prepared on the 5th or 6th day after transfection as described previously (30.Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm expression of the FLAG- and Myc-tagged constructs, aliquots of both conditioned media (75 μl) or cell lysates (30 μl) were analyzed by immunoblotting with either the α-FLAG M2 antibody or the α-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody, or both, using a previously reported procedure (23.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The ability of the FLAG- and Myc-tagged receptor constructs to interact was measured in a coimmunoprecipitation procedure (23.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Routinely, aliquots of cell lysates (20–40 μl) containing the expressed constructs were incubated with 12 μl of packed M2 α-FLAG resin in 25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl (HBS) with 0.5% BSA at 3 °C for 2–4 h. Following immunoadsorption, the resin pellets were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 s and then washed twice with 0.75 ml of HBST. The resultant resin pellets could then be analyzed by immunoblotting to determine if the FLAG- and Myc-tagged receptor constructs were capable of coimmunoprecipitation. In order to study the dynamics of complex formation between the 15F and 15myc constructs in vitro, each species was purified separately from transiently transfected 293T cells on PMP-Sepharose affinity columns, as has been described for the soluble IGF2R above. The constructs were eluted from the affinity columns using 10 mm Man-6-P, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C until use. Aliquots of the purified receptor constructs were mixed and incubated for increasing lengths of time (0–8 h) at 37 °C. The amount of 15F and 15myc present in a complex was measured using the coimmunoprecipitation procedure described above. The cytoplasmic domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was fused to the extracytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the IGF2R to create a chimeric IGF2R/EGFR construct. A construct containing the IGF2R cDNA, lacking the EagI fragment between nt 162 and 5319 (23.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), was used as a template for amplification by Vent™ polymerase using a 5′ primer containing a KpnI restriction site preceding the sequence corresponding to nt 94–113 of the IGF2R cDNA and a 3′ primer that represented sequence complementary to nt 7114–7134 followed by a HindIII site. The resultant product of the amplification was digested with KpnI andHindIII and subcloned into pCMV5. Next, the EagI fragment from the wild-type IGF2R cDNA was subcloned in, completing the extracytoplasmic portion of the IGF2R half of the chimera. Finally, the cytoplasmic domain of the EGFR was amplified using Pfupolymerase with the variant III human EGFR cDNA (EGFRvIII) as a template and two primers. The 5′-primer contained a HindIII site followed by sequence corresponding to nt 2206–2221 of the human EGFR cDNA (31.Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. et al.Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar), and the 3′-primer was complementary to nt 3802–3813 followed by the FLAG epitope, a UAG stop codon, and anXbaI site. The resultant product was digested withHindIII and XbaI and subcloned into the pCMV5 vector containing the IGF2R portion of the chimera, completing the construct. The 11-TM/EGFR and 13-TM/EGFR chimeras were prepared utilizing a similar strategy. The region of the IGF2R extracytoplasmic domain to be included in these constructs was amplified from the full-length IGF2R cDNA using 5′-primers containing an EcoRI site followed by sequence corresponding to nt 4675–4692 for the 11-TM/EGFR or nt 5542–5560 for the 13-TM/EGFR. The 3′-primer for both constructs represented sequence complementary to nt 7114–7134 of the IGF2R cDNA followed by a HindIII site. The resultant product of the amplification was digested with EcoRI andHindIII and subcloned into CMV5RIX (30.Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the first half of repeat 1. The cytoplasmic portion of the EGFR cDNA was isolated from the IGF2R/EGFR construct after digestion withHindIII and XbaI and subcloned into both the CMV5RIX/11-TM and CMV5RIX/13-TM plasmids, completing the 11-TM/EGFR and 13-TM/EGFR chimeras. The IGF2R portion of the 13-TM/EGFR was sequenced to confirm that its phenotype was not due to mutations occurring in the extracytoplasmic or transmembrane domains. A Myc epitope tag was put on the carboxyl terminus of the IGF2R cDNA through a similar procedure as described for preparation of the 15myc construct. The IGF2R cDNA lacking the EagI fragment was used as a template for amplification with Vent™ polymerase with a 5′ primer containing an XhoI site preceding sequence corresponding to nt 94–113 of the receptor cDNA and 3′ primer containing sequence complimentary to 7602–7620 of the IGF2R cDNA followed by 36 nt encoding the Myc epitope, a UAG stop codon, and an XbaI site. The resultant product was digested with XhoI and XbaI, subcloned into pBKCMV (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and then digested with HindIII and XbaI so that it could be cloned into the pCMV5 vector. Finally, the wild-type EagI fragment was subcloned in, completing the IGF2Rmyc construct. To study the tyrosine phosphorylation of the chimeras, the constructs were transiently expressed in 293T cells using the modified calcium phosphate transfection procedure. In addition, cotransfection of the chimeras with IGF2Rmyc was conducted by mixing the same amount of the chimera cDNA (20 μg/100-mm dish) with various amounts of the IGF2Rmyc cDNA (0.5–40 μg/100-mm dish) prior to the transfection. Varying the amount of input IGF2Rmyc cDNA allowed for control of the levels of expression of the IGF2Rmyc in relation to the chimeras in the cell population. The transfection medium was replaced 24 h after the transfection with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) or DMEM containing 5 mm Man-6-P, 25 nm PMP-BSA, or 5 mm Glc-6-P. To ensure a consistent level of exogenous ligands, the cells were again fed with media containing 5 mm Man-6-P, 25 nm PMP-BSA, or 5 mm Glc-6-P 3 h prior to collection of cell lysates at 51 h after transfection. Cell lysates were prepared following the procedure of Meng and Lin (32.Meng T.C. Lin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22096-22104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Each 100-mm dish of 293T cells was scraped, and the cells were washed with 2 ml of ice-cold HBS and then lysed in 400 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mmZnCl2, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 80 μg/ml benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Aliquots (20 μl) were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with the α-FLAG or α-Myc antibodies and developed with 125I-protein A to determine the relative levels of expression via PhosphorImager analysis. Equimolar amounts of the chimeric receptor constructs from cell lysates of each transfection set, or 30 μl of pCMV5-transfected control cell lysates, were immunoadsorbed to 15 μl of α-FLAG M2 resin in the presence of HBS + 1% BSA for 2.5 h at 3 °C. The pellets were then collected and washed twice with 0.75 ml of ice-cold HBST. They were then electrophoresed on reducing 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to BA 85 nitrocellulose. The blots were then subjected to the immunoblot procedure with either α-FLAG M2 antibody, α-Myc 9E10 antibody, or the α-phosphotyrosine (α-Tyr(P)) 4G1"

The mechanism of microtubule nucleation by γ-tubulin and the role of associated proteins is not understood. Here we show that in vitro translated monomeric γ-tubulin nucleates microtubules by lowering the size of the nucleus from seven to three tubulin subunits. In capping the minus end with high affinity (1010m−1) and a binding stoichiometry of one molecule of γ-tubulin/microtubule, γ-tubulin establishes the critical concentration of the plus end in the medium and prevents minus end growth. γ-Tubulin interacts strongly with β-tubulin.

In an interphase cell, the microtubule network is organized in a radial fashion from the microtubule organizing center, which in animal cells consists of a pair of centrioles surrounded by an electron-dense pericentriolar material. Microtubules are nucleated at the pericentriolar material by their minus end (1.Kellogg D.R. Moritz M. Alberts B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 639-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The control of the polarity of the microtubule array is essential in cell function and is mediated by γ-tubulin. γ-Tubulin, a member of the tubulin superfamily first identified in Aspergillus nidulans (2.Oakley C.E. Oakley B.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 662-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), then found in all eukaryotes (3.Joshi H.C. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 1999; 9: 43-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which it nucleates microtubule assembly is not understood. Although γ-tubulin is mainly localized in the pericentriolar material, it is also found in cytoplasmic complexes (11.Stearns T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 76: 623-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). A large γ-tubulin-ring complex (γ-TuRC)1 was first identified in the Xenopus egg (12.Zheng Y. Wong M.L. Alberts B.M. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). It was also found in mammalian cells (see Refs. 13.Meads T. Schroer T.A. Cell Motil.

Sedat J.W. Alberts B.M. Agard D.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 638-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), together with a smaller (280 kDa) complex (17.Moritz M. Zheng Y. Alberts B.M. Oegema K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The small complex comprises two molecules of γ-tubulin and one molecule each of γ-tubulin complex proteins GCP2 and GCP3 (18.Oegema K. Wiese C. Martin O.C. Milligan R.A. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J. Zheng Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 19.Murphy S.M. Urbani L. Stearns T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), homologs of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae Spc97p and Spc98p, which are associated with γ-tubulin in the yeast cytoplasmic γ-tubulin complex and at the spindle pole bodies (20.Knop M. Pereira G. Giessler S. Grein K. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1550-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 21.Knop M. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6985-6995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The γ-TuRC derives from the smaller complex by condensation and association with other proteins. The γ-TuRC nucleates microtubule assembly in vitro (12.Zheng Y. Wong M.L. Alberts B.M. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Two models were proposed for microtubule nucleation by the γ-TuRC. In one model (12.Zheng Y. Wong M.L. Alberts B.M. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), the γ-TuRC acts as a template in which the 13 γ-tubulin subunits forming the ring interact end-on with the terminal α-tubulin subunits at the minus end of the nascent microtubule. In the other model (22.Erickson H.P. Stoffler D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the ring opens and extends into a protofilament interacting laterally with αβ-tubulin units to seed a bidimensional microtubule lattice. The smaller γ-tubulin complex is a poorer nucleator in vitro (18.Oegema K. Wiese C. Martin O.C. Milligan R.A. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J. Zheng Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar); however, the fact that it has some nucleating activity has to be considered regarding the molecular mechanism of microtubule nucleation and calls for a detailed investigation of the interaction of γ-tubulin itself with microtubule ends. In vitro translated γ-tubulin is in part monomeric (23.Melki R. Vainberg I. Chow R. Cowan N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The bulk in vitro translated γ-tubulin has been shown to bind microtubule minus ends with high affinity (1010m−1) and a stoichiometry of 13 ± 2 γ-tubulin/microtubule (24.Li Q. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present work, experiments were performed to analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic effects of γ-tubulin, isolated as a monomer, in microtubule assembly in vitro, with the ultimate goal to understand the specific roles of γ-tubulin and of the associated proteins in the nucleation of microtubules at the centrosome. 35S-Radiolabeled human γ-tubulin was synthesized in vitro using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. A coupled translation-transcription system (TNTTM Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was used, in which T7 polymerase of the recombinant pET plasmid containing the cDNA encoding human γ-tubulin was incubated in the presence of 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (PROMIX in vitro cell labeling, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The translation product was purified by phosphocellulose chromatography and gel filtration on Superose 6 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in S buffer (80 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.4m glycerol). The 35S elution profile showed a minor 900-kDa peak (attributed to complexes of γ-tubulin with cytoplasmic chaperonin), followed by a major narrow peak corresponding to the overexpressed monomeric 50-kDa γ-tubulin (23.Melki R.

Fractions containing monomeric γ-tubulin were equilibrated in P buffer (60 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.9, 0.75 mm EGTA, 0.75 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5m glycerol, 1 mm GTP), rapidly frozen on liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The concentration of monomeric γ-tubulin was determined by quantitative immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody against γ-tubulin raised in the laboratory and the ECL chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and comparison with standards of bacterially expressed γ-tubulin. Routinely, 10 ± 3 pmol of radiochemically pure γ-tubulin were obtained (Fig. 1). A control sample was prepared in exactly the same way except for the absence of cDNA encoding γ-tubulin in the reticulocyte lysate. Immunodepletion of γ-tubulin from the semipurified preparation was performed as follows. In vitro translated35S-labeled monomeric γ-tubulin eluted from the Superose 6 HR column (0.22 pmols) was incubated in P buffer at 4 °C for 90 min with 7 × 107 Dynabeads coupled to rabbit anti-IgG (Dynal) that had been preincubated for 30 min at room temperature either with 7.5 μg affinity-purified anti-γ-tubulin antibody in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (depleted sample) or with phosphate-buffered saline buffer alone (mock depleted control). Tubulin purified from pig brain by three polymerization cycles followed by phosphocellulose chromatography (see Ref. 25.Carlier M.-F. Didry D. Pantaloni D. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 418-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar for all standard procedures in tubulin handling) was used in all experiments. Polymerization assays were carried out in PMg buffer (P buffer containing 6 mmMgCl2) as described (25.Carlier M.-F. Didry D. Pantaloni D. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 418-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Polymerization was monitored turbidimetrically at 350 nm, 37 °C, with a 0.4-cm path thermostated cell (Hellma) in a HP 8453 Hewlett-Packard or a Cary 1 Varian spectrophotometer. Experiments were performed in a range of concentrations where it was checked that the turbidity change was linearly correlated with the amount of sedimented microtubules. The lag time τ was defined as the time at which the linear semilogarithmic plot of the time course of turbidity change intercepts the turbidity line at time zero. Microtubule elongation assays were performed using a preassembled microtubule seed solution (30 μm tubulin) that was 10-fold diluted into the cuvette containing prewarmed tubulin at a series of concentrations in PMg buffer. All pipettings were done gently to avoid microtubule breakage and using truncated warm pipettes tips. Initial rates of elongation (26.Carlier M.-F. Hill T.L. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were derived from the turbidity recordings using the ChemStation software (Hewlett-Packard). Histograms of microtubule length distributions were derived from electron micrographs of negatively stained samples of microtubules assembled from tubulin (5 μm) in the absence or presence of 0.7 nmγ-tubulin. Observations were made in a Philips EM 410 microscope at a 12,470-fold magnification. Analysis was performed using Optimas software. Microtubules containing or not35S-labeled γ-tubulin were sedimented at 200,000 ×g at 37 °C for 10 min in a TL 100 Tabletop Beckman ultracentrifuge. The amount of tubulin in the supernatant was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Coomassie Blue-stained bands were scanned (Arcus, NIH Image software) and compared with standards that were co-electrophoresed on the same gel. The amounts of γ-tubulin free and bound to microtubules were determined also by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the pellets and supernatants, followed by autoradiography (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamic) with comparison with standards of35S-labeled γ-tubulin. The rate of hydrolysis of GTP bound to tubulin during the nucleation of microtubules was measured as described (25.Carlier M.-F. Didry D. Pantaloni D. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 418-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The [ γ-32P]GTP-tubulin 1:1 complex was separated from free GTP by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration (PD10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated at 37 °C in PMg buffer, at a concentration of 6 μm in the presence or absence of γ-tubulin. Aliquots were removed at time intervals during the nucleation period before microtubules were assembled, acid quenched, and processed for Pi extraction. Turbidity measurements were made to verify that no microtubule assembly occurred during the experiment. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of pure tubulin was done at pH 9.5 under conditions (27.Best D. Warr P.J. Gull K. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suitable for maximum separation of α- and β-subunits. For brain tubulin, it has been established that β is the faster migrating subunit (28.Bryan J. Wilson L. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1762-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 29.Clayton L. Quinlan R.A. Roobol A. Pogson C.I. Gull K. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Following transfer on nitrocellulose and visualization of the α- and β-subunits using Ponceau Red, the membrane was submitted to Western immunoblotting (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the DM1A anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (ICN) at a 1:4000 dilution. α-Tubulin was verified to be the slower migrating polypeptide. The nitrocellulose sheet was then dehybridized following the ECL protocol provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and washed extensively in buffer S6 containing 30 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The sheet was incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the presence of gel-filtered35S-radiolabeled γ-tubulin (0.6 nm, 25 Ci/mmol), washed extensively five times, dried, and autoradiographed using Hyperfilm βmax (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In vitro translated 35S-labeled γ-tubulin was translated in vitro using the reticulocyte lysate system, partially purified by phosphocellulose chromatography and isolated as a 50-kDa polypeptide by Superose 6 chromatography (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1). The effect of monomeric γ-tubulin on the time course of spontaneous polymerization of pure tubulin was analyzed. γ-Tubulin caused a dose-dependent decrease in the nucleation lag time that precedes microtubule growth (Fig.2 A). Typically, at 12 μm tubulin, the lag time decreased from 12 to 5 min in the presence of 0.6 nm γ-tubulin. The decrease in lag time showed a saturation behavior, and the lag reached a low limit value upon increasing the concentration of γ-tubulin. No effect was observed with a material purified through the same steps from reticulocyte lysates that did not express γ-tubulin. That control testified that putative 50-kDa polypeptides coming from the reticulocyte lysate and contaminating the monomeric γ-tubulin fraction were not responsible for the observed nucleating effect. Immunodepletion of γ-tubulin from the preparation using IgG-coated Dynabeads coupled to anti-γ-tubulin antibody abolished the effect (Fig. 2 B). Because γ-tubulin was isolated as a 50-kDa protein, it is not possible to imagine that the immunodepletion removed a protein associated with γ-tubulin that could be responsible for the observed effect. In conclusion, monomeric γ-tubulin facilitates microtubule nucleation in vitro. Short linear oligomers of tubulin are formed in the prenucleation stages of tubulin polymerization. The nucleus is the linear oligomer that has reached equal probabilities of lateral or longitudinal interaction with an αβ-tubulin dimer (30.Erickson H.P. Pantaloni D. Biophys. J. 1981; 34: 293-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31.Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Kuchnir-Fygenson D. Flyvbjerg H. Sneppen K. Libchaber A. Leibler S. Phys. Rev.

The size of the nucleus is equal to 2m − 1, where m is the value of the slope of the log/log plot of the lag timeversus the concentration of αβ-tubulin (34.Oosawa F. Asakura S. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Protein. Academic Press, New York1975: 41-55Google Scholar). The value of m was lower in the presence of γ-tubulin (Fig.2 C). The size of the nucleus decreased from 7 to 3 tubulin subunits at a saturating concentration of γ-tubulin. Accordingly, the apparent rate constant for microtubule growth increased with γ-tubulin, consistent with a higher number of microtubules. Histograms of length distribution of microtubules (Fig. 2 D) showed average lengths of 5.0 and 3.7 μm for microtubules assembled in the absence or presence of 0.6 nm γ-tubulin, respectively. The effect of γ-tubulin on the critical concentration for microtubule assembly was measured turbidimetrically and in sedimentation assays (Fig.3 A). The critical concentration decreased in a saturation fashion with γ-tubulin from 2.5 μm to a lower limit of 1.3 μm, reached at 0.8 nm γ-tubulin (Fig. 3 A,inset). The binding of γ-tubulin to sedimented microtubules was analyzed by autoradiography in a similar experiment (Fig. 3 B). γ-Tubulin bound to microtubules with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 8–10.10−11m−1 and a stoichiometry of 1 molecule of γ-tubulin/microtubule. These data are consistent with the capping of the minus end of microtubules by a single molecule of γ-tubulin, resulting in a shift of the critical concentration toward the plus end critical concentration. The observed shift is quantitatively consistent with the previously observed difference in the critical concentrations at the plus and minus ends (35.Bergen L.G. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 84: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which reflects the treadmilling property of microtubules (36.Margolis R.L. Wilson L. Cell. 1978; 13: 1-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 37.Rodionov V.I. Borisy G.G. Science. 1998; 275: 215-218Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The affinity of γ-tubulin is high enough for at least 80% saturation of microtubule ends to be reached at the concentrations (0.6–0.8 nm) of γ-tubulin used throughout the present work. Further evidence for capping of the minus end of microtubules by γ-tubulin was derived from measurements of the rate of microtubule growth at different concentrations of dimeric tubulin (Fig.4). This kinetic assay allows the determination of the association rate constant of tubulin to microtubule ends, derived from the slope of the J(c) plot, and of the critical concentration, derived from the intercept on the concentration axis (26.Carlier M.-F. Hill T.L. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the absence of γ-tubulin, the plot reflects the contribution of both ends to microtubule growth. A value of 7.5 μm−1 s−1 was found for the sum of the association rate constants at the plus and minus ends. The critical concentration was 1.5 μm, which is intermediate between the critical concentrations at the plus and minus ends. In the presence of 0.8 nm γ-tubulin, the J(c) plot displayed a lower slope, consistent with a value of the association rate constant of 4.4 μm−1 s−1, and extrapolated to a lower value, 0.8 μm, of the critical concentration. This behavior is consistent with growth of microtubules from the plus end only, in the presence of γ-tubulin. The value of the association rate constant of tubulin to the minus end (2.7 μm−1 s−1) and the critical concentration for assembly at the minus end (2.3 μm) were derived by subtraction of the two plots. According to these results, the rate constant for association of tubulin to microtubules is 1.6-fold lower at the minus end than at the plus end, in good agreement with previous electron microscopy measurements (35.Bergen L.G. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 84: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 38.Mitchison T.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1984; 312: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 39.Horio T. Hotani H. Nature. 1986; 321: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present kinetic measurements are in good agreement with previous studies in which γ-tubulin was localized at the minus end of microtubules (24.Li Q. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and show evidence for the function of γ-tubulin as a minus end capper. Nucleation of microtubules is accompanied by GTP hydrolysis, which destabilizes the nuclei by preventing lateral interaction of prenuclei oligomers with tubulin (25.Carlier M.-F. Didry D. Pantaloni D. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 418-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of GTP is thought to be linked to the curling of linear oligomers into rings, which is the favored conformation when GDP is bound to tubulin (40.Howard W.D. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8292-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the presence of 0.7 nmγ-tubulin the hydrolysis of GTP during the nucleation phase was decreased by 2-fold, whereas more nuclei were formed (data not shown). This result suggests that γ-tubulin enhances nucleation by inhibiting the hydrolysis of GTP on oligomers, thus preventing their subsequent destabilization. To determine how γ-tubulin interacts with tubulin at the minus end of microtubules, a blot overlay assay was carried out (Fig.5) using in vitro translated monomeric 35S-radiolabeled γ-tubulin and nitrocellulose-transferred αβ-tubulin electrophoresed under conditions that maximize the separation of α and β subunits (27.Best D. Warr P.J. Gull K. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28.Bryan J. Wilson L. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 1762-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 29.Clayton L. Quinlan R.A. Roobol A. Pogson C.I. Gull K. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). α-Tubulin was identified as the slower migrating subunit. γ-Tubulin bound the faster migrating β-tubulin exclusively. No binding was observed using thermodenatured 35S-labeled γ-tubulin. This result provides biochemical evidence for the strong interaction between β- and γ-tubulin that was expected from genetic studies (2.Oakley C.E. Oakley B.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 662-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The demonstration of a strong interaction of γ-tubulin with β-tubulin does not rule out its interaction with α-tubulin, which is also expected given the fact that α-tubulin is exposed at the minus end (47.Mitchison T.J. Science. 1993; 261: 1044-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However the strong binding of γ-tubulin to β-tubulin imposes constraints on the possible structural models for minus end capping. Monomeric γ-tubulin, in the absence of associated proteins, is able to nucleate microtubules in vitro and to cap microtubule minus end. Although the γ-tubulin used here is only partially purified from reticulocyte lysates, control experiments unambiguously establish that the nucleation activity is because of monomeric γ-tubulin. This result is in partial agreement with Vassilev et al. (41.Vassilev A. Kimble M. Silflow C.D. LaVoie M. Kuriyama R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with Li and Joshi (24.Li Q. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) who measured the binding of γ-tubulin to microtubules. However a binding stoichiometry of 12–15 (13 on average) γ-tubulin/microtubule end was determined by Li and Joshi (24.Li Q. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas here we find that a single molecule of monomeric γ-tubulin is sufficient to nucleate and cap the minus end. The partial discrepancy between the two estimates may be because of the difference in the material and in the methods used to quantitate the number of microtubules. The in vitrotranslated γ-tubulin used by Li and Joshi (24.Li Q. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was not isolated as monomeric γ-tubulin by a sizing column. We relied on length distribution measurements of negatively stained microtubules observed in the electron microscope, whereas Li and Joshi (24.Li Q. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) used fluorescence optical microscopy of rhodamine-labeled microtubules and found a saturating amount of 130 pm γ-tubulin bound/microtubule, in a solution that contained 0.2 μm polymerized tubulin and 20 μm Taxol, which should correspond to 10 pm microtubules assuming a stoichiometry of 13 γ-tubulin/microtubule. The authors measured that the number of microtubules was increased 1.5-fold by 8–10 passages through a 26-gauge needle. Different reports found in the literature about the average length of sheared microtubules using the same technique (23.Melki R. Vainberg I. Chow R. Cowan N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar,42.Farrell K.W. Jordan M.A. Miller H.P. Wilson L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 43.Keates R.A. Hallett F.R. Science. 1988; 241: 1642-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 44.Williams Jr., R.C.

Neurochem. 1993; 60: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) provide numbers in the range of 1–2 μm, the lower range corresponding to Taxol-stabilized microtubules that do not rapidly redistribute in length. If the microtubules in Li and Joshi's (24.Li Q. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) experiment were 1.5-fold longer before shearing, they must have been 1.5–3 μm long, which corresponds to a concentration of 80–40 pm. This microtubule concentration would in turn correspond to a stoichiometry of 1.6–3.2 γ-tubulin bound/microtubule. On the other hand, the estimate coming from measurements of the number of microtubules in the fluorescence microscope corresponds to an average length of 200,000/(1650 × 10) = 12.1 μm before shearing, and 12.1/1.5 = 8 μm after shearing, a value much too high to be compatible with the shearing assay. We conclude that there may have been some artifacts in the fluorescence assay, like the lack of resolution of small microtubules or the lack of appreciation of aggregated microtubules, that may have led to an underestimated value of the concentration of microtubule ends, hence an overestimated value of the stoichiometry of bound γ-tubulin/microtubule end. In most cell extracts γ-tubulin is found in small and large γ-tubulin complexes, which have nucleating properties. The fact that the intrinsic properties of monomeric γ-tubulin enable it to act as a nucleator and to block minus end growth with high affinity and at a molar ratio of only one molecule of γ-tubulin/microtubule suggests that γ-tubulin in those complexes must interact in the same fashion with the minus end of microtubules. A simple model accounting for our results is presented in Fig. 6. This model incorporates the present findings in classical models proposed for microtubule nucleation from pure tubulin (30.Erickson H.P. Pantaloni D. Biophys. J. 1981; 34: 293-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31.Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10430-10438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In those models, nucleation of microtubules is driven by the lateral association of αβ-tubulin with linear oligomers of tubulin in which the subunits interact longitudinally. The lateral association generates a bidimensional microtubule lattice. The longitudinal and lateral growths of the microtubular sheet are determined by the free energy of longitudinal and lateral interactions. In line with this concept and with the model proposed by Erickson and Stoffler (22.Erickson H.P. Stoffler D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we propose that γ-tubulin facilitates nucleation by binding laterally to β-tubulin with a much higher affinity than αβ-tubulin itself. As a result, γ-tubulin initiates the growth of a bidimensional microtubule wall from a linear oligomer of αβ-tubulin that contains a lower number of subunits than the one which an αβ-tubulin molecule would have a chance to interact with. This feature accounts for the decrease in the nucleation lag time, for the increase in microtubule number and corresponding decrease in average length, for the lower cooperativity in the kinetics of polymerization in the presence of γ-tubulin, and for the lower GTP hydrolysis during the nucleation phase. The model of lateral association of γ-tubulin to polymerized β-tubulin is in good agreement with the conclusions derived from the identification of the peptides of γ-tubulin interacting with αβ-tubulin, which indicate that γ-tubulin and αβ-tubulin associate through lateral interactions (46.Llanos R. Chevrier V. Ronjat M. Meurer-Grob P. Martinez P. Frank R. Bornens M. Wade R.H. Wehland J. Job D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15712-15720Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A single γ-tubulin appears able to cap the microtubule minus end, preventing growth from that end. To account for this result, the model proposed here stipulates that whereas the plus end-directed face of γ-tubulin is able to interact longitudinally with the minus end of an α-tubulin subunit along a protofilament, it cannot interact with tubulin at its other end. Further, the strong capping suggests that no lateral association of αβ-tubulin can take place with the lateral face of γ-tubulin opposite the one that interacts strongly with a β-tubulin, making γ-tubulin a perfect plug. The high affinity of γ-tubulin for microtubule ends and the absence of measurable interaction in solution between dimeric αβ-tubulin and γ-tubulin is very puzzling. Such a large difference in affinity suggests that the regions of αβ-tubulin that are recognized by γ-tubulin are hidden in dimeric tubulin and exposed upon tubulin assembly. It is also possible that the strong binding of γ-tubulin to the minus end involves its interaction with two tubulin molecules, a lateral interaction with β-tubulin and a longitudinal interaction with α-tubulin, a situation that can occur with the appropriate geometry at the minus end only. How do the present results relate to the nucleation of microtubulesin vivo by small and large complexes? It is highly likely that one of the γ-tubulin subunits in the complexes interacts with the minus end in the same way as monomeric γ-tubulin. The role of the associated proteins GCP2 and GCP3 may be to enhance the nucleating/capping properties by stabilizing the bonds between the γ-tubulin subunits in the oligomer. Within the template open ring model, the γ-tubulin at one end of the ring would interact laterally with β-tubulin, whereas association with the GCPs would enhance the longitudinal interaction between γ-tubulin and the α-subunits at the minus end. Within the protofilament oligomer model, the longitudinal interactions between γ-tubulin subunits maintained by GCP2 and GCP3 would tighten the lateral association of the γ-tubulin oligomer to the protofilament. In conclusion, the present work may help understand the structural and thermodynamic implications of the function of γ-tubulin complexes in vivo.

Occupied cell surface receptors are internalized via clathrin-coated vesicles and are transported to endosomes, where ligands dissociate during the gradual acidification of the endosomal lumen (1.Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The main structural component on clathrin-coated vesicles is clathrin, a trimeric scaffold protein, which organizes itself into cage-like lattices (2.Pishvaee B. Payne G.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Clathrin has the shape of a triskelion, where each of the three legs is made of a heavy and a light chain. The assembly of the clathrin lattice on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane occurs during the formation of a coated pit, leading to the production of a coated vesicle. Clathrin is thus an organizing framework for the proteins that carry out receptor sorting and several steps in the cycle of vesicle assembly, uncoating, and fusion. The major proteins that drive clathrin coat formation are APs1 (3.Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 4.Brodsky F.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 175-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). APs can promote clathrin cage assembly, linking clathrin to the membranes and interacting with membrane proteins that contain appropriate signals for sorting into clathrin-coated vesicles. Each AP contains four subunits. Different APs are associated with specific clathrin-coated vesicle populations and confer distinct sorting properties onto these vesicles (5.Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 99-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). AP-1 complexes are associated with clathrin-coated vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi network and contain γ, β1, μ1, and ς1 subunits. AP-2 complexes are associated with endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles and contain α, β2, μ2, and ς2 subunits. AP-3 and AP-4 have been identified but have not yet been well characterized (6.Simpson F. Peden A.A. Christopoulou L. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 7.Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7278-7285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The β subunits of AP-1 and AP-2 interact with clathrin and drive the formation of coats. Membrane proteins (receptors) that are internalized in clathrin-coated vesicles contain at least one signal sequence that direct the proteins into clathrin-coated pits (8.Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-based signals of the form of YXXΦ and dileucine (LL)-containing signals in the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors interact with AP-2 complexes. YXXΦ motif binds directly to the μ2 subunit, but the binding site on AP-2 for LL signals is not yet clearly established. Although the mechanism by which the receptor is captured by clathrin-coated pits is not clear, the AP-2/receptor complex may recruit cytosolic clathrin to form a coated pit or be captured by available clathrin already located at the edge of a coated pit. The crystal structure of the appendage domain of the α subunit (α-adaptin) of AP-2 has been solved (9.Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E.M. Hunter J.B. Dafforn T.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Cell. 1999; 97: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The N-terminal β-sandwich subdomain appears to function as a scaffold and spacer that supports a C-terminal platform subdomain to which various proteins implicated in endocytosis including Eps15, Epsin, and AP180 bind (10.Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12111-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 11.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R.

Biol. 1999; 9: R332-R335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Eps15 was originally identified as a substrate of EGF receptor kinase and is constitutively associated with the plasma membrane and AP-2 (13.Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoskova B. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5814-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,14.Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Sorkin A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound Eps15 is mainly associated with clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. Furthermore, expression of the AP-2-binding region of Eps15 in CV-1, COS, and HeLa cells inhibits internalization of the EGF and transferrin receptors (15.Carbone R. Fre S. Iannolo G. Belleudi F. Mancini P. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Di Fiore P.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5498-5504PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Benmerah A. Lamaze C. Begue B. Schmid S.L. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Thus, Eps15 is involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Eps15 has three copies of the EH domain in the N terminus. The EH domain has been found in several proteins of mammals, yeast, insects, and nematodes, thus establishing its evolutionary conservation (14.Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Sorkin A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have identified an EH domain-containing protein that binds to RalBP1 (Ral-binding protein1), which is an effector protein of small G protein Ral (17.Feig L.A. Urano T. Cantor S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and named it POB1 (partner of RalBP1) (18.Ikeda M. Ishida O. Hinoi T. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). POB1 has a single EH domain in its N-terminal region and two proline-rich motifs and a coiled-coil structure in its C-terminal region. The activated Ral forms a complex with POB1 through RalBP1. POB1 binds directly to Grb2 but not to Nck or Crk. Furthermore, EGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of POB1, which leads to the formation of a complex between EGF receptor and POB1 (18.Ikeda M. Ishida O. Hinoi T. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 814-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Expression of the EH domain and the C-terminal region of POB1 inhibits the internalization of EGF and insulin (19.Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Other proteins with the EH domain include Eps15R (forEps15-related), Reps1 (forRalBP1-associated Eps homology domain protein1), intersectin, Pan1, and End3. Eps15R has 47% amino acid identity with Eps15 and exhibits characteristics similar to those of Eps15 (20.Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9530-9534Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21.Coda L. Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Pelicci G. Sorkina T. Sorkin A. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3003-3012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The POB1-related protein Reps1 has been identified as a RalBP1-binding protein (22.Yamaguchi A. Urano T. Goi T. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31230-31234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Intersectin (Ese) has five Src homology 3 domains in addition to two EH domains and is involved in the regulation of internalization of the transferrin receptor (23.Yamabhai M. Hoffman N.G. Hardison N.L. McPherson P.S. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. Kay B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31401-31407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 24.Sengar A.S. Wang W. Bishay J. Cohen S. Egan S.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1159-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Pan1 and End3 are Saccharomyces cerevisiae dimeric partners that are necessary for endocytosis of the α-mating factor receptor and for normal organization of the actin cytoskeleton (25.Benedetti H. Raths S. Crausaz F. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 26.Tang H.Y. Munn A. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4294-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, the EH domain containing proteins are likely to regulate endocytosis. Epsin has been identified as a binding protein of the EH domains of Eps15, POB1, and intersectin (11.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5915-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of Epsin has the evolutionarily conserved domain called ENTH (for Epsin N-terminalhomology) (28.Kay B.K. Yamabhai M. Wendland B. Emr S.D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the central region is characterized by the presence of eight repeats of Asp-Pro-Trp (DPW) motif, and the C-terminal region of Epsin contains three Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) motifs, which are known to constitute the binding sequence of the EH domain (14.Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Sorkin A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The central region of Epsin binds to AP-2, and overexpression of this region inhibits the clathrin-dependent internalization of the receptors for EGF and transferrin (11.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Epsin has a Leu-Val-Asp-Leu-Asp (LVDLD) sequence. Similar amino acid sequences are found in β subunits of clathrin adaptors (AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3), arrestin 3, and amphiphysin and are shown to bind clathrin directly (29.Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Therefore, Epsin would regulate endocytosis by interacting with AP-2 and clathrin. We have demonstrated that the small G protein Ral and its downstream molecules, RalBP1 and POB1, are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis for EGF and insulin (19.Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that Eps15 and Epsin bind directly to the EH domain of POB1 (19.Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 27.Morinaka K. Koyama S. Nakashima S. Hinoi T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5915-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the signal from Ral to Eps15 and Epsin through RalBP1 and POB1 regulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, how assembly and disassembly of this complex are regulated is not known. It has been shown that the complex formation of proteins involved in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles is regulated by their phosphorylation (30.Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether phosphorylation affects receptor-mediated endocytosis in the Ral signaling pathway. CHO-IR cells (insulin receptor-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells) and the anti-GST and anti-MBP antibodies were kindly supplied by Drs. Y. Ebina (Tokushima University, Tokushima, Japan), and M. Nakata (Sumitomo Electric Industries, Yokohama, Japan), respectively. Histone H1 and pACT2/α-adaptin were generous gifts from Drs. H. Usui (Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan) and H. Ohno (Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan), respectively. Hygromycin-resistant CHO-IR cells that stably express RalBP1, POB1, human Epsin (hEpsin), or their mutants were propagated as described (19.Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3629-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The anti-POB1 and anti-hEpsin antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits with GST-POB1-(126–227) and hEpsin-(1–205), respectively. GST and MBP fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli. [125I]Insulin was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The anti-Eps15 and anti-α-adaptin antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories, Inc.

The 0.53-kb fragment encoding hEpsin-(297–474), in which Ser357 was mutated to Asp or Ala, was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction, digested with StuI, and inserted into StuI-cut pBSKS/hEpsin (full length). To construct pEF-BOS-Myc/hEpsinS357D and pEF-BOS-Myc/hEpsinS357A, pBSKS/hEpsinS357D and pBSKS/hEpsinS357A were digested with XbaI and then inserted into XbaI-cut pEF-BOS-Myc. pCGN/POB1S411D and pCGN/POB1S411A were constructed as follows. The 0.57-kb fragment encoding POB1-(321–512) in which Ser411 was mutated to Asp or Ala was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction, digested with BglII andMunI, and inserted into BglII- andMunI-cut pCGN/POB1 (full length). To construct pGEX-2T/α-adaptin appendage domain (app), the 0.7-kb fragment encoding αc-adaptin (701–938) with BamHI andEcoRI sites was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and inserted intoBamHI- and EcoRI-cut pGEX-2T. To construct pGEX-2T/RalBP1-(364–647), pMAL-c2/RalBP1-(364–647) was digested withBamHI, and the fragment encoding RalBP1-(364–647) was inserted into BamHI-cut pGEX-2T. To construct pGEX-2T/POB1- (1–125) and pGEX-2T/POB1-(228–406), pBSKS/POB1-(1–125) and pBSKS/POB1-(228–406) were digested withPmaCI and EcoRI, and the 0.4- and 0.55-kb fragments were inserted into SmaI- and EcoRI-cut pGEX-2T. To construct pGEX-2T/POB1-(322–521), pUC19/POB1 (full length) was digested with BglII and blunted with Klenow fragment, and the 0.6-kb fragment encoding POB1-(322–521) was inserted into pGEX-2T that had been digested with BamHI and blunted with Klenow fragment. To construct pCGN/POB1-(322–521), pUC19/POB1 (full length) was digested with BglII and inserted intoBamHI-cut pMAL-c2, then digested with EcoRI, blunted with Klenow fragment, and digested with XbaI. The fragment encoding POB1-(322–521) was inserted into pCGN that had been digested with XbaI and SmaI. To construct pEF-BOS-Myc/hEpsin (204–551), pBSKS/hEpsin (full length) was digested with BamHI and XbaI and then blunted with Klenow fragment. The 1-kb fragment encoding hEpsin-(204–551) was inserted into pEF-BOS-Myc that had been digested with XbaI and blunted with Klenow fragment. Mitotic CHO cells were isolated as described (31.Pypaert M. Mundy D. Souter E. Labbe J.C. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32.van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Huber L.A. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were subjected to 16-h thymidine block, followed by 2.5-h incubation in the absence of thymidine. 40 ng/ml of nocodazole was added to the medium to arrest cells in mitotic phase. Mitotic cells were collected 5 h later by mechanical shake off, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed as described (31.Pypaert M. Mundy D. Souter E. Labbe J.C. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells without thymidine block remaining on flasks after nocodazole treatment were lysed and used as interphase cells. The lysates of CHO-IR cells were prepared as described (19.Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kishida S. Kikuchi A.

The lysates (1 mg of protein) of CHO-IR cells were incubated with 1 μm GST fused appendage domain of α-adaptin (GST-app) or GST for 1 h at 4 °C. GST-app or GST was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and the precipitates were probed with the anti-Eps15, anti-Epsin, anti-POB1, and anti-RalBP1 antibodies. To show the interaction of POB1 with α-adaptin, CHO-IR cells expressing HA-POB1 or its mutants were lysed. The lysates (1 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-α-adaptin and anti-HA antibodies. To determine which region of POB1 associates with α-adaptin, deletion mutants of HA-POB1 were expressed in COS cells. The complex formation of Epsin with α-adaptin in intact cells was examined in the same way. The overlay assay was performed as described (19.Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M.

The lysates (100 μg of protein) of mitotic phase and interphase of CHO-IR cells expressing Myc-RalBP1, HA-POB1, or Myc-hEpsin were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. GST-app, GST-POB1-(322–521), GST-RalBP1-(364–647), GST-POB1-(126–227), GST-Eps15-(1–330), or GST was incubated with the nitrocellulose membranes in overlay buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween-20) at a final concentration of 2.2–50 nm for 12 h at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed and probed with the anti-GST antibody. The Myc-RalBP1, HA-POB1, and Myc-hEpsin immune complexes were incubated with 3 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase in 20 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 37 °C. MBP-hEpsin deletion mutants, GST-POB1 deletion mutants, and histone H1 (1 μm of protein each) were incubated with p34 cdc2 kinase precipitated with GST-p13 suc1 from synchronized cells in 25 μl of kinase assay mixture (50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (500–1500 cpm/pmol), 50 mm NaF, 100 mm β-glycerophosphate) for 15 min at 37 °C. The phosphorylation of each protein was detected by autoradiography. The activities of the binding and the internalization of insulin in CHO-IR cells were determined as described previously (19.Nakashima S. Morinaka K. Koyama S. Ikeda M. Kishida M. Okawa K.

Briefly, confluent wild type CHO-IR cells and CHO-IR cells expressing POB1, hEpsin or their mutants (35-mm-diameter dishes) were incubated with 100 pm [125I]insulin (4–5 × 103 cpm/pmol) for 5 h at 4 °C. Internalization was initiated by adding warm binding medium (Ham's F-12 medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4) at 37 °C after the cells had been washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline three times. At various times the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with the acidic washing buffer (0.2 macetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl). The acid-stripped cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS. The rate of the internalization of insulin was expressed as the percentage of internalized [125I]insulin relative to the sum of surface-bound and internalized [125I]insulin. The structures of RalBP1, POB1, hEpsin, Eps15, α-adaptin, and their deletion mutants used in this study are summarized in Fig.1. The appendage domain of α-adaptin of AP-2 binds directly to Eps15 and Epsin (10.Benmerah A. Begue B. Dautry-Varsat A. Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5915-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we examined whether α-adaptin forms a complex with RalBP1 and POB1. The appendage domain of α-adaptin was purified as a GST fusion protein (GST-app). GST-app but not GST precipitated Eps15, RalBP1, Epsin, and POB1 from the lysates of CHO-IR cells (Fig.2 A), suggesting that RalBP1 and POB1 form a complex with α-adaptin. To determine which region of POB1 forms a complex with α-adaptin, various deletion mutants of GST-POB1 were incubated with the lysates of CHO-IR cells. GST-POB1-(126–227) (EH domain), but not GST-POB1-(1–125), GST-POB1-(228–406), or GST-POB1-(375–521), precipitated the α-adaptin of AP-2 (Fig. 2 B). Next, we examined whether POB1 forms a complex with AP-2 in intact cells. Consistent with the previous observations (11.Chen H. Fre S. Slepnev V.I. Capua M.R. Takei K. Butler M.H. Di Fiore P.P.

When the lysates of CHO-IR cells expressing HA-POB1 were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody, α-adaptin was observed in the POB1 immune complexes (Fig. 2 C). In COS cells, the N-terminal half of POB1 (POB1-(1–374)), which contains the EH domain, but not the C-terminal half (POB1-(322–521)) was immunoprecipitated with α-adaptin (Fig.2 D). These results suggest that the EH domain of POB1 is responsible for forming a complex with α-adaptin of AP-2 in intact cells. However, GST-app did not bind directly to POB1 in the overlay assay under the conditions in which it interacted with Epsin (Fig.2 E). Therefore, POB1 would associate indirectly with AP-2 through other proteins, probably Eps15 or Epsin.Figure 2Complex formation of α-adaptin with POB1.

The lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with the anti-Myc (lanes 4 and 5) or anti-HA antibody (lanes 6 and7).

By band mobility shift assay, we detected a factor binding to the D-STAT-recognition sequence in extracts of cultured Drosophila cells treated with vanadate peroxide. UV-cross-linking analyses suggested the size of the binding factor to be almost same as that of D-STAT. Furthermore, the binding activity was increased in cells cotransfected with HOP and D-STAT expression plasmids. These results strongly suggest that D-STAT binds to the D-STAT recognition sequence in the D-raf gene promoter. Transient luciferase expression assay using Schneider 2 cells indicated that the D-raf gene promoter is activated by D-STAT through the D-STAT-binding site. Furthermore, analyses with transgenic flies carrying Draf-lacZ fusion genes with and without mutations in the D-STAT-binding site pointed to an important role in D-raf gene promoter activity throughout development. We also found that the D-STAT-binding site is required for injury-induced activation of the D-raf gene promoter.

Kim I.-J. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Biol. Sci. 1998; 2: 117-122Crossref Google Scholar). The transcription factor STAT is known to be activated by the Janus kinase (JAK) in response to a variety of cytokines, growth factors, and interleukins in mammals (16.Ihle J.N.

Regarding D-STAT as an activator of transcription, only the pair rule gene even-skipped (eve) has been identified as a target (20.Yan R. Small S. Desplan C. Dearolf C.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of D-STAT in regulation of theD-raf gene promoter. The obtained results indicate that theD-raf gene is a target of D-STAT activated by HOP and suggest the possibility of participation in regulation of the MAPK cascade. The sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the D-STAT recognition sequence in theD-raf gene (DrafSTATwt) and its two base-substituted derivatives (DrafSTATmut1 andDrafSTATmut2) were described previously (15.Kwon E.-J. Kim H.-I. Kim I.-J. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Biol. Sci. 1998; 2: 117-122Crossref Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide ODBS (optimumD-STAT-binding site) determined by sequence selection was prepared as described previously (20.Yan R. Small S. Desplan C. Dearolf C.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides eveS1 and eveS2 containing D-STAT-binding sites in theeven-skipped (eve) gene stripe 3 promoter region were as described earlier (21.Small S. Blair A. Levine M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides contained a 6-base pair linker sequence recognizable by BglII and BamHI and were chemically synthesized. The 2×ODBSwt, 2×DrafSTATwt, and 2×DrafSTATmut1 oligonucleotides used for luciferase reporter constructs were as follows: 2×ODBSwt, 5′-gatccGGATTTTTCCCGGAAATGGTCGGATTTTTCCCGGAAATGGTCa, 3′-gCCTAAAAAGGGCCTTTACCAGCCTAAAAAGGGCCTTTACCAGtctag; 2×DrafSTATwt, 5′-gatccTAAAATTCGCGGAAAGTAATAAAATTCGCGGAAAGTAAg, 3′-aATTTTAAGCGCCTTTCATTATTTTAAGCGCCTTTCATTtctag; 2×DrafSTATmut1, 5′-gatccTAAAATGCGCGCAAAGTAATAAAATGCGCGCAAAGTAAg, 3′-aATTTTACGCGCGTTTCATTATTTTACGCGCGTTTCATTtctag. Mutated bases are underlined, and lowercase letters indicate the linker sequences. To amplify a sequence containing full amino acids of D-STAT (amino acid 1–761), a set of PCR primers were synthesized: 5′-specific oligonucleotide (5′-GGGCGCGGATCCGCGAGCATGAGCTTGTGGAAGCGC) and 3′-specific oligonucleotide (5′-GACAAGCTGTGACCGTCTCCG). For the UV-cross-linking assay, single-stranded oligonucleotides containing Draf-STAT sites were chemically synthesized, the oligonucleotides as follows: UV-DrafSTAT, 5′-TAAAAATTCGCGGAAAGTAATAAAATTCGCGGAAAGTAAATAAA TTGTTATAGC; PR-DrafSTAT, 5′-GCTATAACAATTTAT. A DNA fragment containing theD-raf promoter region (−663 to +302) was isolated from the plasmid p5′-663DrafCAT (previously called p-878DrafCAT) (9.Ryu J.-R. Choi T.-Y. Kwon E.-J. Lee W.-H. Nishida Y.

The fragment was then inserted into the SmaI site of the plasmid PGVB (Toyo Ink.) to create p5′-663Drafwt-luc. The expression plasmids of D-STAT and HOP contain coding regions placed under control of theDrosophila actin 5C gene promoter derived from pPAC5C-PL (22.Yan R. Luo H. Darnell Jr, J.E. Dearolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5842-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide 2×ODBSwt was inserted betweenSmaI and SacI sites of the plasmid TATA-PGVB (23.Sawado T. Hirose F. Takahashi Y. Sasaki T. Shinomiya T. Sakaguchi K. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. J.

The oligonucleotides 2×DrafSTATwt and 2×DrafSTATmut1 were inserted between SmaI and SacI sites of the plasmid TATA-PGVB to create 2×DrafSTATwt-TATA-luc and 2×DrafSTATmut1-TATA-luc, respectively. To construct p5′-663DrafSTATmut1-lacZ, a DNA fragment containing base-substituted mutations in the D-STAT-binding site of theD-raf gene promoter region was isolated from p5′-663DrafSTATmut1CAT by digestion with KpnI. Then the fragment was inserted into the KpnI site of the plasmid pCaSpeR-AUG-βgal (24.Tummel C.S. Boulet A.M. Lipshitz H.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) having the P element. To construct the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-D-STAT-expressing plasmid, the polymerase chain reaction product containing full-length D-STAT (amino acids 1–761) was inserted between BamHI andNotI sites of pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This expression plasmid was used for large scale preparation of the D-STAT polypeptides, which were then applied as an antigen to raise antibodies. Extraction and purification of recombinant protein were carried out as described previously (25.Date T. Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Nishimoto Y. Tanihara K. Matsukage A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2983-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). GST-D-STAT was used to immunize mice as described previously (26.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Kuroda K. Omori A. Hachiya T.

Antibody specific to D-STAT was affinity-purified from antiserum with GST-D-STAT-conjugated Sepharose after preabsorption with GST-conjugated Sepharose. Drosophila Kc and Schneider 2 cells were grown at 25 °C in M3 (BF) medium (27.Cross D.P. Sang J.H. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1978; 45: 161-172PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 2 and 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. Drosophila l (2)mbn hemocyte cells (28.Gateff E. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanism of Immune Response in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 189-200Google Scholar) were grown at 25 °C in Schneider's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To induce immune reaction inl(2)mbn cells, culture medium containing LPS (a component of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria) purchased from Sigma was added to cells. Transfection of various DNA mixtures in Kc and Schneider 2 cells was performed using the Cell-Fectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The luciferase assay was carried out by means of a PicaGene assay kit (Toyo Ink.) as described previously (29.Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsuoka S. Takahashi T. Matsukage A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to protein amounts determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay. To induce phosphorylated D-STAT protein, M3(BF) medium containing the indicated concentrations of sodium orthovanadate and hydrogen peroxide was preincubated for 15 min and then was added to growing cells. After incubation for 30 min, whole cell lysates were prepared by solubilizing cells for 10 min on ice in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% glycerol, and proteinase inhibitors containing 0.4 μg of aprotinin, 0.4 μg of leupeptin, 0.2 μg of pepstatin A, 0.2 μg of antipain, and 200 μg of Pefabloc SC. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. Preparation of nuclear extracts was performed as described elsewhere (30.Cecil M.K. Steven G.N. James M.E. Terrance J.K. Jeffrey A.L. Gary L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11541-11549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Band mobility shift assay was carried out as described earlier (10.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments with antibodies, Kc cell nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibody for 2 h on ice. UV-cross-linking analysis was performed as described earlier (32.Hayashi Y. Hirose F.

The molecular weights of the protein bands were estimated by comparing their mobilities with those of prestained marker proteins (Bio-Rad): myosin (200,000), β-galactosidase (116,500), phosphorylase b (106,000), bovine serum albumin (80,000), ovalbumin (49,500), carbonic anhydrase (32,500), soybean trypsin inhibitor (27,500), and lysozyme (18,500). To establish transgenic flies carrying p5′-663DrafSTATmut1-lacZ, P element-mediated germ line transformation was carried out as described earlier (33.Spradling A.C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 175-197Google Scholar, 34.Ha H.-Y. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Genet. 1997; 19: 267-276Google Scholar). Quantitative measurements of β-galactosidase activity in larval extracts were carried out as described previously (34.Ha H.-Y. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Genet. 1997; 19: 267-276Google Scholar). In this study, the transgenic flies carrying p5′-663Drafwt-lacZ (previously called p5′-1103Draf-lacZ) (35.Ryu J.-R. Kim Y.-S. Kim H.-I. Lee H.-J. Lee W.-H. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Genet. 1996; 18: 73-81Google Scholar) were used as a positive control. To correct for endogenous β-galactosidase activity, extracts from the wild-type strain (white) were included in each experiment, and this background reading was subtracted from readings obtained with each transformant line. Embryos carrying one copy of p5′-663Drafwt-lacZ or p5′-663DrafSTATmut1-lacZ fusion genes were collected 5 h after mating of the transgenic lines with host strain w, dechorionated, and treated with octane. They were then exposed to 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 2 mm hydrogen peroxide for 30 min at 25 °C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and further incubated for 3 h at 25 °C. Quantitative measurements of β-galactosidase activity were carried out as described above. Injury experiments were performed by pricking third instar larvae 72 ± 4 h after egg laying, with a fine needle (34.Ha H.-Y. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Genet. 1997; 19: 267-276Google Scholar). Histochemical analyses of lacZexpression were conducted as described earlier (34.Ha H.-Y. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Genet. 1997; 19: 267-276Google Scholar, 35.Ryu J.-R. Kim Y.-S. Kim H.-I. Lee H.-J.

Since the transcription initiation site of theD-raf gene was uncertain, we determined the site by primer extension analysis. 2E.-J. Kwon, E.-J. Oh, Y.-S. Kim, F. Hirose, K. Ohno, Y. Nishida, A. Matsukage, M. Yamaguchi, and M.-A. Yoo, manuscript in preparation. The mapped transcription initiation site is 215 base pairs upstream from the reported putative cap site (9.Ryu J.-R. Choi T.-Y. Kwon E.-J. Lee W.-H. Nishida Y. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. Yoo M.-A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), predicted from the consensus signal sequence for transcription initiation of Drosophila mRNA (37.Hultmark D. Kelmenz R. Gehring W.J. Cell. 1986; 44: 429-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the region between −82 and −74 with respect to the newly determined transcription initiation site, we found the nucleotide sequence 5′-TTCGCGGAA (15.Kwon E.-J. Kim H.-I. Kim I.-J. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Biol. Sci. 1998; 2: 117-122Crossref Google Scholar) that perfectly matches the D-STAT recognition consensus sequence, 5′-TTCNNNGAA (20.Yan R. Small S. Desplan C. Dearolf C.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Since the sequence is located close to the transcription initiation site, we considered that D-STAT may be involved in regulation of the D-raf gene promoter. We designated this putative D-STAT recognition sequence theDraf-STAT site. As noted previously (9.Ryu J.-R. Choi T.-Y. Kwon E.-J. Lee W.-H. Nishida Y. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. Yoo M.-A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), DRE is located in the region between −155 and −142 (Fig. 1). It has been noted that activated D-STAT protein in Drosophila cells treated with vanadate/peroxide mixture can bind to oligonucleotide ODBS with high affinity (20.Yan R. Small S. Desplan C. Dearolf C.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). It is well known that vanadate/peroxide inhibits tyrosine phosphatases and maintains D-STAT in an active phosphorylated form (20.Yan R. Small S. Desplan C. Dearolf C.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 38.Sweitzer S.M. Calvo S. Kraus M.H. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16510-16513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In a band mobility shift assay using extracts of Kc cells treated with vanadate/peroxide, the binding activity to oligonucleotide ODBS proved greater in vanadate/peroxide-treated Kc cell extracts than that in vanadate-treated cell extracts (Fig.2 A). The DNA-protein complex was diminished effectively by adding unlabeled oligonucleotides ODBS, eveS1, and eveS2 as competitors (Fig. 2 B). Effective competition was also observed with the addition of theDrafSTATwt oligonucleotide, while oligonucleotideDrafSTATmut1 (Fig. 1) did not compete for binding (Fig.2 B). From the extent of competition, it appears that theDraf-STAT and eve gene D-STAT-binding sites have comparable affinity to the vanadate/peroxide inducible factor, probably a D-STAT protein. Essentially similar results were obtained with Schneider 2 cell extracts (data not shown). To determine if the shifted band represents a ODBS-D-STAT complex, anti-D-STAT antibody was added to the binding reaction with vanadate/peroxide-treated Kc cell nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig.2 C, the addition of the anti-D-STAT antibody supershifted the DNA-protein complex, and this supershifted complex formation was effectively diminished by adding unlabeled oligonucleotides ODBS andDrafSTATwt as competitors. Since the vanadate/peroxide-inducible factor binding to ODBS was competitively blocked by the DrafSTATwt oligonucleotide, a band mobility shift assay was carried out again using the latter as a probe. As observed with ODBS, binding activity was enhanced in cells treated with increasing concentrations of vanadate/peroxide (Fig.3 A). The DNA-protein complex disappeared on adding unlabeled DrafSTATwt oligonucleotide as a competitor but not the mutant oligonucleotide carrying a base-substitution in the D-STAT core binding sequence,DrafSTATmut1, even when added in excess (Fig.3 B). The oligonucleotide DrafSTATmut2 (Fig. 1) carrying a base-substitution in a noncritical sequence for binding of D-STAT competed effectively (Fig. 3 B). These results taken together indicate that the vanadate/peroxide-activated D-STAT protein has affinity for ODBS, eveS1, eveS2, and Draf-STAT sites. To determine the size of the polypeptide(s) binding to the Draf-STAT site, a UV-cross-linking assay was carried out using the UVDraf-STAT oligonucleotide as a probe and extracts of vanadate/peroxide-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 4, polypeptides at around 88 kDa were specifically cross-linked with the probe. A lesser amount of radiolabeled polypeptides was observed on adding unlabeled DrafSTATwt oligonucleotides as competitors. However, the DrafSTATmut1 oligonucleotides did not compete. Essentially the same results were obtained with different cell lines, Kc (Fig. 4 A) and Schneider 2 (Fig. 4 B). Since the molecular weight of D-STAT protein is reported to be 87,500 and the D-STAT protein migrates to a position corresponding to 88 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20.Yan R. Small S. Desplan C. Dearolf C.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1996; 84: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), it is again very likely that the protein bound to the probe is the D-STAT protein. To confirm that the factor binding to the D-STAT recognition sequence is activated by HOP, we performed a band mobility shift assay using D-STAT and HOP transient expression cell extracts. The DNA-protein complex formed with oligonucleotide ODBS increased effectively upon D-STAT and HOP coexpression (Fig. 5 A,lane 4) but was diminished when unlabeled oligonucleotides, ODBS, eveS1, eveS2, or DrafSTATwt were added as competitors. Little competition was observed when theDrafSTATmut1 oligonucleotide was added (Fig. 5 B). From these results, it is likely that D-STAT activated by HOP has high affinity for the Draf-STAT site and D-STAT-recognition sites in the eve gene and ODBS. Since D-STAT very likely binds to the Draf-STAT site, we conducted the following experiments to test whether D-STAT activated by HOP can regulate activity of the D-raf gene promoter. Expression of the HOP protein had little effect on the D-raf gene promoter activity (Fig. 6 A). However, expression of D-STAT protein gave an enhanced transcriptional signal possibly because of endogenous HOP expression (Fig. 6 A). When D-STAT and HOP protein were expressed simultaneously, the p5′-663Drafwt-luc produced the strongest transcriptional signal (Fig. 6 A). These results indicate thatD-raf gene promoter activity is dependent on the amounts and ratio of D-STAT to HOP. For further confirmation of the Draf-STAT sequence as a target of the activated D-STAT, three luciferase reporter constructs were prepared in which transcription of the luciferase genes was driven by the Drosophila metallothionein gene basal promoter carrying two copies of the ODBS wild type sequences (2×ODBS), theDraf-STAT wild type (2×DrafSTATwt), or its mutant type (2×DrafSTATmut1). The HOP and D-STAT expression alone induced transcriptional activation of 2×DrafSTATwt-TATA-luc by 2-fold (Fig. 6 B). When both HOP and D-STAT were expressed in Schneider 2 cells, the promoter activity of 2×DrafSTATwt-TATA-luc increased much more effectively (17-fold) (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, little activation by HOP and D-STAT expression was observed with 2×DrafSTATmut1-TATA-luc (Fig. 6 B). Thus, theDraf-STAT sequence functions as a target of the D-STAT protein, which appears to be activated by HOP protein. To confirm a role of theDraf-STAT site for D-raf gene promoter activityin vivo, transgenic Drosophila were used. Previously, we established three independent transgenic fly lines carrying a wild type D-raf gene promoter-lacZfusion gene (p5′-663Drafwt-lacZ) (35.Ryu J.-R. Kim Y.-S. Kim H.-I. Lee H.-J. Lee W.-H. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Genet. 1996; 18: 73-81Google Scholar). In the present study, four independent transformant lines carrying the p5′-663DrafSTATmut1-lacZ fusion gene that has a mutation in the D-STAT core binding sequence were established. As shown in Fig. 7, mutation in theDraf-STAT site resulted in extensive reduction oflacZ expression throughout development. To confirm whether expression of the D-raf gene is regulated by the activated D-STAT in living flies, the dechorionated and permeabilized embryos were incubated in vanadate/peroxide mixture. Transcriptional activation of the p5′-663Drafwt-lacZ transgene by vanadate/peroxide treatment is shown in Fig. 8. The level of β-galactosidase activity of the vanadate/peroxide-treated embryos bearing one copy of the p5′-663Drafwt-lacZ fusion gene was 2.2-fold higher than that of untreated embryos. In embryos bearing one copy of p5′-663DrafSTATmut1-lacZfusion gene, the expression of lacZ was little induced by vanadate/peroxide treatment. Thus, it was confirmed in living embryos that the Draf-STAT site is required for vanadate/peroxide-inducible activation of theD-raf gene promoter. The hemocytes play an important role in the events that lead to the activation of the immune response.Drosophila l(2)mbn hematocyte cell line is derived from larval hemocytes of the mutant lethal (2.Tsuda Y.

Science. 1978; 200: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), in which the diptericin and cecropin genes are rapidly induced by the addition of LPS (40.Kappler C. Meister M. Lagueux M. Gateff E. Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1561-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 41.Samakovlis C. Asling B. Boman H.G. Gateff E. Hultmark D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mammalian STAT has been implicated in a variety of immunity-related signaling pathway, including the response to proinflammatory cytokines (42.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that the D-raf gene promoter was activated by injury or bacterial challenge (34.Ha H.-Y. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Genet. 1997; 19: 267-276Google Scholar). To investigate whether the Draf-STAT site is involved in this activation, the band mobility shift assay was carried out with nuclear extracts of thel(2)mbn cells treated with LPS and the DrafSTATwt oligonucleotides as a probe. Specificity of binding was confirmed in competition with DrafSTATwt and its base-substituted derivative DrafSTATmut1. A 2-fold increase of the DNA-protein complex was detected in l(2)mbn nuclear extracts 1 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 9), indicating that D-STAT is activated in response to treatment with LPS. To further examine the role of the Draf-STAT site in the immune response in vivo, larvae carrying one copy of the p5′-663Drafwt-lacZ fusion gene or p5′-663DrafSTATmut1-lacZ fusion gene were injured with fine needles, and after 3 h, corresponding to the time of maximum induction of the D-raf gene in larvae (34.Ha H.-Y. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Genet. 1997; 19: 267-276Google Scholar), quantitative analysis of β-galactosidase activity in total crude extracts of the larvae was carried out. After injury, the level of β-galactosidase activity in larvae carrying one copy of the p5′-663Drafwt-lacZ fusion gene was induced 1.7-fold, but that in larvae carrying the p5′-663DrafSTATmut1-lacZ gene did not change as shown in Fig. 10 A. Since activation of the D-raf gene promoter after injury was most prominent in the larval fat body, known to be involved in innate immunity, serving as the functional homologue of the vertebrate liver (34.Ha H.-Y. Yoo M.-A. Korean J. Genet. 1997; 19: 267-276Google Scholar), expression of the Draf-lacZ fusion gene in this tissue was examined by histochemical staining. lacZstaining signals in larval fat bodies carrying the p5′-663Drafwt-lacZ after injury were dramatically increased, whereas lacZ expression was not induced in p5′-663DrafSTATmut1-lacZ transgenic larval fat bodies (Fig. 10 B). The D-raf gene promoter contains a D-STAT recognition sequence in the region between −82 and −74 (Fig. 1). In this study, we identified a factor binding to the Draf-STAT site as having almost the same molecular weight as D-STAT and showed that theDraf-STAT site plays an important role in activation of theD-raf gene promoter by HOP/D-STAT. We also observed that theDraf-STAT site is required for D-raf gene promoter activation during development and in response to injury. These results lead us to suggest that the D-raf gene is a target of activated D-STAT protein through which the latter can participate in regulation of the MAPK cascade. In the embryos homozygous for null alleles of D-raf, the embryogenesis proceeds normally depending on the maternalD-raf activity. However, the proliferation in imaginal discs and other proliferating tissues is severely affected during larval stages, indicating that the zygotic D-raf activity is essential after hatching (6.Nishida Y. Hata M. Ayaki K. Ryo H. Yamagata M. Shimizu K. Nishizuka Y. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7.Ambrosio L. Mahowald A.P. Perrimon N. Nature. 1989; 342: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is remarkable that expression ofD-raf during larval stages, especially in early stages, is largely dependent on the transcriptional activation through the D-STAT-binding site (Fig. 7). It has been reported that mutants defective in hop or D-STAT showed the similar proliferation defects (19.Hou X.S. Melnick M.B. Perrimon N. Cell. 1996; 84: 411-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 43.Perrimon N. Mahowald A.P. Dev. Biol. 1986; 118: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the HOP/D-STAT signaling pathway contributes to the D-raf gene activation at significant stages of development. Recently, the mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) STATgene was cloned (44.Barillas-Mury C. Han Y.-S. Seeley D. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that bacterial challenge results in nuclear translocation of A. gambiae STAT protein in mosquito fat bodies and induction of DNA binding activity that recognizes an A. gambiae STAT target site (44.Barillas-Mury C. Han Y.-S. Seeley D. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore,in vitro treatment with vanadate/peroxide enhances translocation of A. gambiae STAT into the nucleus in midgut epithelial cells (44.Barillas-Mury C. Han Y.-S. Seeley D. Kafatos F.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These observations provide evidence of direct participation of the STAT pathway in the immune response in insects and are in agreement with our conclusion that the Draf-STAT site is required for D-raf gene promoter activation after injury, which is supported by the results from the band mobility shift assays with the LPS-treated l(2)mbn cells (Fig. 9) and the injury experiment using transgenic flies (Fig. 10). In addition, it is well known that some STAT family members in mammals participate in the immune response (45.Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) so that a function in immunity appears to have been conserved during evolution in mammals and insects. In mammals, several lines of evidence pointing to cross-talk between JAK/STAT, the mammalian homologues of Drosophila HOP/D-STAT, and MAPK pathways have been reported. First, MAPKs activate some STAT family members, STAT1a, STAT3, and STAT4, by direct phosphorylation on the serine residue of STAT proteins, participating in the mechanism by which interferon stimulated ligand-induced early response genes (46.Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang C. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar,47.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). MAPKs also directly phosphorylate the interferon-α/β receptor and stimulate the JAK/STAT pathway (48.David M. Petricoin E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was recently shown that epidermal growth factor receptor is phosphorylated by Jak2 in signaling by growth hormone, thereby providing docking sites for Grb2 and activating MAPKs and their target gene expression, independently of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (49.Yamauchi T. Ueki K. Tobe K. Tamemoto H. Sekine N. Wada M. Honjo M. Takahashi M. Takahashi T. Hirai H. Tushima T. Akanuma Y. Fujita T. Komuro Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Nature. 1997; 390: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that the two signaling pathways are activated by mutual stimulation. Direct activation of the raf gene by STAT has not been reported. However, the human A-raf-1 gene promoter contains putative STAT binding sites (31.Lee J.-E. Beck T.W. Brennscheidt U. Degennard L.J. Rapp U.R. Genomics. 1994; 20: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although further analyses are necessary to generalize our findings to include mammals, the present study, for the first time, suggests a novel mechanism by which STAT can participate in regulation of the MAPK cascade through raf gene activation.

Moore for helpful comments on the English language in the manuscript."

Furthermore, nonsecretory cells can release ATP under certain experimental conditions. To measure ATP release and membrane currents from a single cell simultaneously, we usedXenopus oocytes. We simultaneously recorded membrane currents and luminescence. Here, we show that ATP release can be triggered in Xenopus oocytes by hyperpolarizing pulses. ATP release (3.2 ± 0.3 pmol/oocyte) generated a slow inward current (2.3 ± 0.1 μA). During hyperpolarizing pulses, the permeability for ATP4– was more than 4000 times higher than that for Cl–. The sensitivity to GdCl3 (0.2 mm) of hyperpolarization-induced ionic current, ATP release and E-ATPase activity suggests their dependence on stretch-activated ion channels. The pharmacological profile of the current inhibition coincides with the inhibition of ecto-ATPase activity. This enzyme is highly conserved among species, and in humans, it has been cloned and characterized as CD39. The translation, in Xenopus oocytes, of human CD39 mRNA encoding enhances the ATP-supported current, indicating that CD39 is directly or indirectly responsible for the electrodiffusion of ATP.

In addition, exocytosis of a variety of granules or vesicles results in ATP release, such as in the neuromuscular junction (1.Silinsky E.M. J. Physiol. Lond. 1975; 247: 145-162Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar), in rat cerebral cortex synaptosomes (2.White T.D.

Because cells of this type contain few secretory granules or secretory vesicle-like structures, it has also been suggested that ATP may not be released through a membrane fusion pathway.Indirect evidence has been obtained in support of the hypothesis of nonsecretory exocytotic release of ATP. In patch clamp experiments (13.Abraham E.H. Prat A.G. Gerweck L. Seneveratne T. Arceci R.J. Kramer R. Guidotti G. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Direct measurement of ATP release by myosin functionalized tips of atomic force microscope reveals hot spots of ATP release on the surface of epithelial cells expressing CFTR (16.Schneider S.W.

However, in this type of experiment, it is impossible to measure ATP release and ionic currents simultaneously in an individual cell, and so it was impossible to establish a direct relationship between the current activation and the release of ATP.We have developed a simple method to detect ATP release in oocytes subjected to a two-electrode voltage-clamp (Fig. 1 A). We monitored, on line and simultaneously, the release of ATP and the currents flowing across the plasma membrane in a single cell.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn defolliculated Xenopus oocytes, hyperpolarizing square pulses (Fig. 1 B) generated a slow inward current of varying amplitude (2.3 ± 0.1 μA; τ = 1.8 ± 0.6 s; n = 191), depending on the oocyte batch. ATP release during the generation of this current, measured in 40 oocytes, was 3.2 ± 0.3 pmol of ATP/oocyte, in pulses from –60 to –200 mV. The amount of ATP released was proportional to the amplitude of the hyperpolarizing pulse. The pulses from –60 to –180 mV gave a significantly (p < 0.001) lower ATP peak (54 ± 9%; n = 10) and a significantly (p < 0.001) lower inward current (54 ± 8%; n = 12) than pulses from –60 to –200 mV. There were no significant differences between these values. Sometimes, for a few minutes after the end of the hyperpolarizing pulse, a small residual current continued.We ruled out the exocytotic origin of ATP release from cortical granules (23.Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar) of oocytes because it was independent of the external calcium concentration (2.4 ± 0.2 pmol of ATP in the presence of 1.8 mm CaCl2 and 2.6 ± 0.3 pmol in solutions to which CaCl2 was not added; n = 4). Cortical granules fuse with the plasma membrane during fertilization, the oocyte membrane becomes depolarized and calcium enters through voltage-sensitive channels. The hyperpolarizing pulses did not open the voltage-dependent calcium channels at the range used in these experiments. Furthermore, the membrane capacitance of the oocytes (24.Kado R.T. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 273-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) did not change significantly (203 ± 8 nanofarads before and 194 ± 7 nanofarads after applying the hyperpolarizing pulse; n = 8). However, the increase in capacitance due to the fusion of granules may have been below the sensitivity of the recording techniques (between 10–15 nanofarads). If we assume that ATP release is supported by the exocytosis of small granules with a diameter of 100 nm containing 100–200 mmATP, such as synaptic vesicles, which are also present in the oocyte, it would induce an increase of 50–90 nanofarads, which would release 2–3 pmol of ATP. Such an increase would be detectable by the recording methods used. We conclude, therefore, that ATP release is not directly related to the exocytosis of secretory granules from the oocyte cytoplasm. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a few membranous structures, such as secretory granules or caveolae, may be incorporated into the oocyte plasmalemma. These structures could contain a high density of a membrane protein that transport ATP out of the cell. This mechanism of incorporation of ion channels to the cell plasma membrane has been suggested for CFTR (25.Devidas S. Guggino W.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).We also examined the ionic permeability associated with the slow inward current previously described in Xenopus (26.Kowdley G.C. Ackerman S.J. John J.E. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27.Zhang Y. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 523.1: 83-99Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and inRana perezi (28.Ivorra I. Morales A. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 434: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) oocytes. Both groups concluded that the current was not generated by microruptures of the plasma membrane, which should cause an entry of Na+. The inward current was still present when external NaCl was replaced byN-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl (26.Kowdley G.C. Ackerman S.J. John J.E. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We replaced 83% of external NaCl (15 mm) with urea (200 mm), and the current did not change significantly (–903 ± 33 nA in oocytes bathed in urea-containing medium, –833 ± 23 nA in oocytes bathed in physiological solution; n = 4). We ruled out the participation of K+ in this current, considering that substitution of Na+ by K+ in the recording solution did not change the amplitude of the current (–1767 ± 80 nA in oocytes recorded in Na+substituted medium; –1835 ± 53 nA in oocytes bathed in physiological solution; n = 5). In addition, tetraethylammonium (10 mm) did not change the amplitude of the current (1.5 ± 0.1 μA in 10 mmtetraethylammonium-treated oocytes, 1.5 ± 0.6 μA in physiological solution; n = 8), nor was this current sustained by Cl−; the substitution of Cl− by other anions did not change the amplitude of the inward current, (2.1 ± 0.3 μA (n = 5) for sodium gluconate; 2.3 ± 0.3 μA (n = 5) for sodium thiocyanate; 1.9 ± 0.5 μA for SO42–). The blocking drug of voltage-dependent chloride channels (anthracene-9-carboxylic acid) did not change the amplitude of the inward current (1.8 ± 0.1 μA in both anthracene-9-carboxylic acid-treated oocytes and oocytes bathed with physiological solution;n = 4).Alternatively, it has been suggested that ATP can cross the plasma membrane through a hydrophobic channel, although the results are controversial (12.Grygorczyk R.

The reversal potential varied considerably from one oocyte batch to another, ranging from 17 to 124 mV, with a mean of 101 ± 19 mV (n = 10). According to the Nernst equation, this reversal potential is in the range of the equilibrium potential for ATP4–. Ionic ATP crossing the plasma membrane may have generated this current. This was supported by the finding that, using the Goldman-Hodgkin and Katz equation, the calculated permeability of ATP4– was 4531 times higher than that of Cl− (in the residual current ATP4– is 4.5 times more permeable than Cl−). In addition, the number of ATP molecules detected by the luciferin-luciferase reaction was of the same order of magnitude as the number calculated (see under “Experimental Procedures”) from the current (Fig. 2).Figure 2Release of ATP from defolliculatedXenopus oocytes. A, to estimate the amount of ATP released during a hyperpolarizing pulse, we added a known dose of ATP near to the oocyte bathed in the luminescent mixture.A1, voltage command; A2, current trace;A3, light emitted by ATP release. A known quantity of an ATP solution was ejected to estimate the amount of ATP released by a single oocyte. B, comparison of the number of ATP molecules detected by the chemiluminescent reaction of luciferin-luciferase and the calculated number of molecules of ATP with four negative charges that can cross the plasma membrane and thus produce the current elicited by hyperpolarizing pulses. The number of chemiluminescently detected molecules fits with the calculated number of molecules of ATP4– flowing through the plasma membrane. This figure also illustrates the variability of ATP release and currents in different oocytes. C, relationship between the number of molecules of ATP detected by the luciferin-luciferase reaction and the calculated number of ATP4– molecules crossing the plasma membrane.

Xenopus oocytes contained 180 ± 30 pmol ATP per oocyte; n = 7. However, we were unable to determine what proportion of this ATP was present in the free form in the cytosol, ready to be released or entrapped into granules or vesicles, and what proportion was bound to proteins. Divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) and pH determine the ionic derivatives that can be formed from the ATP molecule. The intracellular calcium concentration of Xenopusoocytes has been estimated to be 35 nm (29.Yao Y. Parker I. J. Physiol. Lond. 1992; 458: 319-333Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar); in this range of Ca2+ concentration and at pH 7.4, the ATP inside the cell must be in the form of ATP4–. The extracellular level of ATP per oocyte was 404 ± 55 fmol/ml (n = 3). Nevertheless, the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of ATP fluctuate because of the activation of intracellular ATPases and extracellular ATP degradation by ectonucleotidases.Decreasing the ATP content with cyanide treatment induced both the inhibition of ATP release and a decrease in the charge carried by the inward current elicited by hyperpolarizing pulses (Fig.3). When ATP (10 mm) was added to the extracellular solution, the inward current increased when negative potentials were applied (Fig. 4,A and B). This effect might be related to an endogenous type P2x purinoceptor, but Xenopusoocytes are completely devoid of P2x purinoceptors 48 h after defolliculation (30.Arellano R.O. Garay E. Miledi R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C333-C340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experimental conditions with 48–72 h defolliculated oocytes, clamped at –60 mV, ATP (10 mm) did not, as expected, evoke any current in the presence of P2x purinoceptors (data not shown). The ectonucleotidase described in Xenopus oocytes (22.Ziganshin A.U. Ziganshina L.E. King B.E. Burnstock G. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) belongs to the group of E-type ATPases (ecto-ATPase or ecto-apyrase). These are structurally related to the CD39 lymphocyte antigen, which has recently been cloned (31.Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9898-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). ATPases usually need Mg2+ as a cofactor, whereas E-type ATPases can hydrolyze ATP or ADP using either Ca2+or Mg2+ as cofactor. The amount of ATP released from an oocyte under hyperpolarization pulses did not change when soluble apyrase (from potato) was added to the recording medium (data not shown). The hyperpolarization may have blocked the E-ATPase activity and enhanced the light signal by preventing ATP degradation. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that soluble luciferase does not pick up a transient phase of ATP release from platelets (32.Beigi R. Kobatake E. Aizawa M. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C267-C278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except when luciferase was placed on the surface of activated platelets through a chimeric antibody-containing luciferase.Figure 3Effect of cyanide on ATP release from oocytes induced by hyperpolarization.

Unfortunately, no specific inhibitors of this enzymatic activity are available. Suramin, an antimalarial agent with a K iin the micromolar range for E-ATPase activity (33.Martı́ E. Cantı́ C. Gómez de Aranda I. Miralles F. Solsona C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), abolishes either the slow inward current or the E-ATPase activity of Xenopusoocytes. Table I summarizes the relationship between the generation of the slow inward current and the E-ATPase activity. The degradation of ATP by E-ATPase (34 ± 2 pmol of Pimin−1 oocyte−1;n = 13) was similar to that previously described (22.Ziganshin A.U. Ziganshina L.E. King B.E. Burnstock G. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The E-ATPase activity and the inward current were insensitive to Cl− and K+ channel blockers, but they were both inhibited by suramin. Zn2+ and a high concentration of Ca2+ also inhibited the E-ATPase activity and the induced hyperpolarizing inward current. DIDS and SITS (1 mm), which are commonly used as Cl− blockers, also inhibited the E-ATPase activity and the elicited current. The inhibition induced by DIDS (1 mm) was reversible, whereas that induced by SITS was irreversible. A lower concentration of DIDS (0.1 mm) partially inhibited the luciferin-luciferase reaction, in a such a way that it was possible to detect ATP release from stimulated oocytes. DIDS (0.1 mm) inhibited the current, the E-ATPase activity, and ATP release by the same order of magnitude (Table I). In addition, the lack of action of glibenclamide indicates that the protein that supports ATP release is not of the ABC type. In summary, the inhibition of E-ATPase always correlated with the inhibition of the inward current. However, it has recently been reported that Gd3+(200 μm) inhibits ATP release from rat hepatoma cells (34.Roman R.M. Feranchak A.P. Davison A.K. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. Am J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1222-G1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In those experiments, ATP release was induced by hypotonic solution, suggesting that it is sensitive to cell volume changes. It has also been demonstrated that gadolinium blocks stretch-activated ion channels (35.Franco Jr., A. Winegar B.D. Lansman J.B. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 1164-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We show (Table I) that solutions containing Gd3+ (200 μm) inhibited the hyperpolarization-induced current, E-ATPase, and ATP release. Again, there is an association between current, E-ATPase activity and ATP release. We suggest that ATP release from oocytes can be triggered by the activation of stretch-sensitive ion channels, which in turn may be directly associated to E-ATPases. Indeed, mechanically gated channels are present in Xenopus oocytes (27.Zhang Y. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 523.1: 83-99Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Table IRelationship between activation current, ecto-ATPase activity, and ATP releaseConditionCurrent inhibitionE-ATPase activity inhibitionATP release inhibition (n = 4)%n%nAnthracene-9-carboxylic acid, 2 mm3 ± 344 ± 24i.r.Tetraethylammonium, 10 mm2 ± 7811 ± 440Glibenclamide, 1 mm5 ± 1211 ± 440CaCl2, 12 mm34 ± 7ap < 0.001.560 ± 6bp < 0.01.4i.r.Suramin, 50 μm51 ± 6bp < 0.01.352 ± 4ap < 0.001.4i.r.SITS, 1 mm67 ± 7ap < 0.001.595 ± 2bp < 0.01.4100DIDS, 1 mm87 ± 7ap < 0.001.293 ± 2bp < 0.01.4i.r.DIDS, 0.1 mm63 ± 1cp < 0.05.461 ± 4bp < 0.01.370 ± 1cp < 0.05.GdCl3, 0.2 mm76 ± 3bp < 0.01.4100 ± 0ap < 0.001.374 ± 7cp < 0.05.ZnCl2, 5 mm86 ± 6ap < 0.001.5100 ± 6ap < 0.001.4i.r.Currents were evoked by hyperpolarizing pulses from −60 to −200 mV, before and after perfusing the oocyte with the test solutions. The inhibition of these agents was reversible after 15 min of washing, except in the case of SIDS, for which the inhibition was irreversible. The E-ATPase activity was determined in groups of 10 defolliculated oocytes. Most of the agents that inhibited E-type ATPase activity also inhibited the luminescent reaction of luciferin-luciferase: a known dose of ATP was applied to the bath, and no response was recorded. The inward current was inhibited in oocytes treated with SIDS and extensively washed. In these treated oocytes, we measured ATP release without any interference of SIDS with chemiluminescent enzymes; in this case, oocytes were not able to release ATP under hyperpolarising conditions. i.r., this condition interferes with the reaction.a p < 0.001.b p < 0.01.c p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Translation of the mRNA of human CD39 enhanced the inward current (Fig. 4 C), thus demonstrating a direct relationship between E-type ATPase and the inward current. In 26 oocytes injected with a truncated form (nucleotides 640–750), the current was not enhanced. Indeed, it has been suggested (36.Wang T.F. Ou Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) that E-type ATPases such as CD39 might be able to form membrane channels. The antigen CD39, like P2x receptors and inwardly rectifying potassium channels, is an integral membrane protein, with two transmembrane domains and a large extracellular region that become active when tetramers are formed (36.Wang T.F. Ou Y. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24814-24821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This protein may participate in two apparently contradictory functions: the release of ATP and its degradation. However, two different activity states have been suggested (37.Beeler T.J. Gable K.S. Keffer J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 734: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) for E-ATPases, both of which can account for our results: the E-type molecule acts as an ionic channel or a membrane transporter of ATP in response to hydrolysis or binding of ATP. The E-type ATPases may, in resting conditions, be involved in some kind of transport process, by consuming extracellular ATP; the voltage or stretch stimulus would change the protein conformation, inducing ATP transport out of the cell. In physiological conditions, cells do not reach the low levels of voltage fixed in our experiments. The physiological stimulus for ATP release may be stretching.Different cells, such as muscle fibers, neurons, or lining epithelial cells secrete ATP (see the Introduction). ATP release from epithelial cells may be relevant to genetic diseases. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease caused by amino acid mutations in the sequence of the CFTR protein. CFTR is a membrane protein that is permeant for chloride anions (18.Reddy M.M. Quinton P.M. Haws C. Wine J.J. Grygorczyk R. Tabcharani J.A. Hanrahan J.W. Gunderson K.L. Kopito R.R.

https://openalex.org/W2054599024,"SHP-1, an SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase, has a crucial role in hematopoiesis. Here we report that SHP-1 is associated with two major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in hematopoietic cells treated with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate. One of the proteins corresponds to leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1), a recently cloned transmembrane protein. Molecular cloning revealed four isoforms of the protein. LAIR-1 is hyper-phosphorylated on tyrosyl residues in cells overexpressing a catalytically inactive mutant form of SHP-1 as well as in pervanadate-treated cells. An antibody against the extracellular domain of the protein also induced its tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated LAIR-1 specifically interacts with SHP-1 but not with SHP-2, a structurally related tyrosine phosphatase. Using site-specific mutagenesis, we demonstrated that Tyr233 and Tyr263, each embedded in an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, are responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 and recruitment of SHP-1. Both tyrosyl residues are required for SHP-1 binding. Protein kinases responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 may belong to the Src family since PP1, a Src family kinase inhibitor, significantly inhibited its phosphorylation.

It is intriguing that the ligands of these growth factor receptors promote cell signaling and activate SHP-1 as a very early event, which presumably turns off the signal. Furthermore, in most cases, only a very small fraction of SHP-1 is bound to these receptors. Therefore, the complete mechanism of action following the association of SHP-1 with these receptors is still not fully understood (9.Yi T. Mui A.L. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

To better understand the regulation and function of SHP-1, we have investigated the association of SHP-1 with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in cells treated with pervanadate, a powerful protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)1 inhibitor that induces robust tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Our results demonstrate that SHP-1 is associated with two major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in hematopoietic cells, including Jurkat T-cells, HL-60 cells, and human peripheral T-cells. We further identified that one of the proteins corresponds to leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1), a recently cloned immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-containing transmembrane protein that is implicated in NK cell and T-cell functions (24.Meyaard L. Adema G.J. Chang C. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 25.Meyaard L. Hurenkamp J. Clevers H. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5800-5804PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular cloning revealed four isoforms of this protein, presumably resulting from alternative splicing, and these isoforms of LAIR-1 have distinct expression in hematopoietic cells. More importantly, we have generated an antibody that induces tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 and consequent recruitment and activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. We also have characterized the mechanism by which LAIR-1 interacts with SHP-1. As a specific and a major anchor protein of SHP-1 in plasma membrane, LAIR-1 may have an important role in hematopoietic cell signaling. Human 293 embryonic kidney cells, Jurkat T cells, and HL-60 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Jurkat and HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI, and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All the media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 unit/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin antibiotics. Human T lymphocytes were purified from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers as previously reported (26.Sui X. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z. Blood. 1997; 90: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, heparinized blood was layered onto Ficoll-Hypaque, and light-density mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation. The collected mononuclear cells were then centrifuged through 10% bovine serum albumin to delete platelets. T lymphocytes were obtained by sheep erythrocyte rosetting followed by red cell hemolysis. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and rabbit polyclonal anti-SHP-1, anti-SHP-2, and anti-SHIP antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Different maltose-binding protein fusion proteins containing the full-length Cys-455-to-Ser mutant, tandem SH2 domains, and N-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-1 were purified by using amylose resin as described previously (27.Law C.L. Sidorenko S.P. Chandran K.A. Zhao Z. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The catalytically inactive Cys-455-to-Ser SHP-1 mutant used for transfection of 293 cells was constructed with the pRC/CMV vector (Invitrogen). Buffer A consisted of 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate (pH 7.3), 10 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Human LAIR-1 cDNAs were amplified from human bone marrow, Jurkat cell, and HL-60 cell Marathon-ready cDNA libraries (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) by polymerase chain reaction with primers 5′-GCCATGTCTCCCACCCCAC-3′ and 5′-GTCAGTGTCTGGCAACGGCTGC-3′ derived from the 5′- and 3′-coding regions of LAIR-1, respectively (24.Meyaard L. Adema G.J. Chang C. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction was performed with thermo-DNA polymerase Pfu (Stratagene), and the products were cloned into the pBluescript KS vector (Stratagene), which was digested withEcoRV. The cDNA clones were sequenced using the automated DNA sequencing facilities of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center. The intracellular and extracellular portions of LAIR-1c (see below), corresponding to amino acid residues 170–269 and 1–141, respectively, were expressed inEscherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins by using the pGex-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose. For antibody production, rabbits were injected with the fusion proteins mixed with Freund's adjuvant (Pierce). Anti-sera raised against the intracellular part of LAIR-1 was designated 145, whereas that against the extracellular fusion protein was named 148. Unless otherwise noted, immunoprecipitation was carried out with 145, whereas immunoblotting and cell treatment were performed with 148. LAIR-1c was subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Tyr233 → Phe and Tyr263 → Phe mutations of LAIR-1c were performed by polymerase chain reaction with primers containing the desired mutations. All these clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell transfection was carried out according to the standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique as described (28.Zhao R. Zhao Z.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 35-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 cells were grown to ∼30% confluence, and 25 μg plasmid DNAs were used for transfecting cells in each 10-cm plate. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. To induce tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1, cells were treated with 0.1 mm pervanadate for 30 min. A 50 mm stock solution of pervanadate was made by mixing equal volumes of 0.1m sodium vanadate and 0.2 mH2O2 and incubating at room temperature for 20 min before the addition to the cells (29.Zhao Z. Tan Z. Diltz C.D. You M. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22251-22255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). When cells were stimulated with anti-LAIR-1 antibody 148 or its pre-serum, they were serum-starved for 5 h at 37 °C before treatment. Stimulated cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline immediately and then were subjected to extraction as described below. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in Buffer A supplemented with 0.1 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation and then were immunoprecipitated with the specific antibodies pre-bound to protein A-Sepharose. Following overnight incubation, the beads were washed three times with the extraction buffer supplemented with 0.15m NaCl. For Western blot analyses, samples were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with various primary antibodies and were detected by using the ECL system with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were lysed in Buffer A by using a Dounce homogenizer (23.Zhao Z. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5007-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To avoid nonspecific protein binding, 0.1 m NaCl was added to the homogenate. This was followed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 20 min to remove the nuclear pellets. The postnuclear extracts were further centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min to give rise to a clear cytosolic supernatant and a pelleted membrane fraction. The pellets, washed once with buffer A and then dissolved in Buffer A supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, were referred to as membrane extracts. Equal proportions of membrane and cytosol fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-LAIR-1 or anti-SHP-1 and to Western blotting analyses with anti-SHP-1. For PTP activity assays, sodium vanadate was omitted from the buffers. Assays were performed with anti-SHP-1 and anti-LAIR-1 immunoprecipitates by using the ENDpYINASL (where pY is phosphotyrosine) peptide as the substrate as described previously (30.Zhao Z. Larocque R. Ho W.-T. Fischer E.H. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8780-8785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although SHP-1 has been shown to bind a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins on the cell surface, the stoichiometry appeared very low. We recently isolated a major SHP-2-binding protein designated PZR, and we demonstrated a near stoichiometric association of PZR with SHP-2 in pervanadate-stimulated cells (31.Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We used the same strategy to identify SHP-1-binding proteins. We chose Jurkat cells, HL-60 cells, and primary peripheral T cells together with several non-hematopoietic cells for our study. As a powerful inhibitor of PTPs, pervanadate, induced robust tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. SHP-1-binding proteins were co-immunoprecipitated by anti-SHP-1 antibody, and tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 1, SHP-1 is co-precipitated with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 40 and 95 kDa in Jurkat cells, of 45 and 95 kDa in HL-60 cells, and of 40, 45, and 95 kDa in peripheral T cells. However, in non-hematopoietic cell lines including 293, HepG2, A431, HT-1080, and HeLa cells, only the 95-kDa protein was co-immunoprecipitated with SHP-1 (data not shown, see Ref. 31.Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This suggests that the 95-kDa SHP-1-binding protein may be widely expressed, whereas the 40- and 45-kDa proteins seem to be restricted to hematopoietic cells. The 68-kDa phosphoprotein shown in Fig. 1 was SHP-1 as revealed by immunoblotting with anti-SHP-1. As a powerful, non-selective inhibitor of PTPs, pervanadate induces robust tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins. In this regard, the 40-kDa, 45-kDa, and 95-kDa proteins may be major SHP-1-binding proteins in the three types of hematopoietic cells examined. Next, we tried to identify the 40-kDa and 45-kDa proteins associated with SHP-1. We used antibodies to search for candidate phosphotyrosine-containing signaling molecules in this molecular weight range. We ruled out PZR, conexin 43, FcγRIIB (CD32), and CD7 by doing Western blotting analyses with their specific antibodies. Our last candidate was LAIR-1, a recently cloned leukocyte-specific ITIM-containing protein of ∼40 kDa (24.Meyaard L. Adema G.J. Chang C. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 25.Meyaard L. Hurenkamp J. Clevers H. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5800-5804PubMed Google Scholar). Since antibody for Western blotting analyses of LAIR-1 was not available, we first generated an antibody in rabbits by using glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins containing the intracellular or extracellular domain of LAIR-1. Re-blotting of membranes with anti-LAIR-1 antibody indeed indicated that the 40-kDa protein in Jurkat and primary T-cells and the 45-kDa protein in HL-60 cells and primary T cells both corresponded to LAIR-1 (Fig. 1). Anti-LAIR-1 immunoprecipitation further verified the results by showing not only tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 but also co-immunoprecipitation with SHP-1 that was also phosphorylated on tyrosine (Fig.2). When probed for the presence of other phosphatases including SHP-2 and SHIP, using their specific antibodies in anti-LAIR-1 immunoprecipitates from these three kinds of cells, neither SHP-2 nor SHIP was associated with LAIR-1 following pervanadate stimulation (data not shown). We thus identified that one of the major binding proteins of SHP-1 corresponded to LAIR-1. SHP-1, but neither SHP-2 nor SHIP, was specifically associated with LAIR-1 upon pervanadate stimulation. The fact that LAIR-1 from Jurkat and HL-60 cells ran at different molecular sizes may suggest different degrees of glycosylation at the protein level and/or alternate splicing at the mRNA level. We then tried to clone LAIR-1 by using polymerase chain reaction with primers designed according to the published LAIR-1 sequence (24.Meyaard L. Adema G.J. Chang C. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Immunity. 1997; 7: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). From Jurkat T cells and human bone marrow libraries, we pulled out predominantly a cDNA clone with a sequence that was different from the published sequences of LAIR-1a and 1b. We designated our sequence as LAIR-1c. We also cloned LAIR-1b as a minor form (three out of 50 clones) from Jurkat cell cDNAs. From HL-60 cells, we cloned LAIR-1a as the major form and LAIR-1b as a minor form. We also isolated a minor form that we designated LAIR-1d from HL-60 cell cDNAs. The DNA sequences of LAIR-1c and LAIR-1d were deposited in the GenBank™ data base under accession numbers AF251509 and AF251510, respectively. Sequence alignment showed that these four different forms of LAIR-1 are identical except for certain gaps and inserts characteristic of alternative RNA splicing (data not shown). These different cDNA sequences give different protein products as shown in Fig.3. LAIR-1c differs from LAIR-1b by a single amino acid residue, but LAIR-1d lacks essentially the entire intracellular segment and, thus, has no ITIMs. We focused on LAIR-1c in our continued studies since it is a major form in bone marrow and in T-cells. Embedded in the ITIM sequence, Tyr 233 and Tyr 263 are the two unique tyrosyl residues in the cytoplasmic domain of LAIR-1c. They most likely represent the tyrosine phosphorylation sites. To verify this, we mutated one or both of these residues to phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis. All the cDNA constructs were made with the pcDNA 3 vector. The mutant constructs (LAIR-1cF233, F263, and F233/F263) together with the control vector and the native LAIR-1c construct were used to transfect 293 cells, and the transfected cells were treated with pervanadate. The cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-LAIR-1 145 and Western blot analyses with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-LAIR-1 148, and anti-SHP-1. As shown in Fig. 4, although anti-LAIR-1 immunoblotting revealed expression of equivalent amounts of LAIR-1c or its mutants in the cells, mutation of either Tyr233 or Tyr263 significantly reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas mutation of both residues totally abolished the tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1c. More importantly, any of the mutations caused a total loss of SHP-1 association with LAIR-1c. These results indicate that Try233 and Tyr263 are responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1c. The fact that binding of SHP-1 with LAIR-1c was abolished by mutation of a single site indicates that simultaneous phosphorylation of both sites is required for recruitment of SHP-1 to LAIR-1c. The last lane on the right of Fig. 4 shows inhibition of pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 by Src family kinase inhibitor PP1. This indicates that protein kinases responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 may belong to the Src family. The binding of SHP-1 with LAIR-1c is presumably mediated by the interaction between SH2 domains of SHP-1 and the ITIMs of LAIR-1c. To verify this, we determined the binding of LAIR-1 to different maltose-binding protein fusion proteins containing the full-length catalytically inactive mutant (SHP-1M), tandem SH2 domains (2SH2), and N-terminal SH2 domain (N-SH2) of SHP-1. These fusion proteins and control maltose-binding protein immobilized on amylose resin beads were incubated for 1 h with extracts obtained from pervanadate-treated or non-treated Jurkat cells. Western blot analyses with anti-LAIR-1 and anti-phosphotyrosine revealed that only the full-length SHP-1M and the 2SH2 domain fusion proteins could efficiently bind LAIR-1 (Fig.5), whereas the fusion proteins with a single SH2 domain could not. This study indicates that SH2 domains of SHP-1 mediate the interaction with LAIR-1 and that the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-1 are both required for efficient binding. Our previous studies showed that the Cys-to-Ser mutant of SHP-1 displays dominant negative effects and causes hyperphosphorylation of specific cellular proteins on tyrosine (31.Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To further reveal the specific interaction of LAIR-1 with SHP-1 inside the cells, LAIR-1c cDNA constructs were co-transfected into 293 cells with the plain vector or with dominant negative mutant SHP-1M(C-S). Cell lysates were prepared from the transfected cells, and Western blot analyses were performed with the cell extracts or anti-SHP-1 and anti-LAIR-1 immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 6, strong tyrosine phosphorylation of a 40-kDa protein that corresponded to LAIR-1c was seen by direct Western blotting analysis of cell extracts obtained from cells co-transfected with LAIR-1c and SHP-1(C-S). Phosphorylation of this protein was not detected in cells co-transfected with LAIR-1c and the plain vector. This indicates that dominant negative SHP-1(C-S) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1c in intact cells, presumably by binding through the SH2 domain to the tyrosine phosphorylation site of LAIR-1, thereby preventing the latter from being dephosphorylated. Immunoprecipitation with LAIR-1 and SHP-1 antibodies further confirmed the results. The fact that SHP-1(C-S), but not native SHP-1, causes hyperphosphorylation of LAIR-1 also suggests that LAIR-1 is a physiological substrate of SHP-1in vivo. In the studies we have described so far, tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 was induced either by treating cells with pervanadate or by expressing the dominant negative mutant of SHP-1. As a cell surface molecule, tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 might be induced by its dimerization. To confirm this possibility, we investigated whether LAIR-1 is phosphorylated by anti-LAIR-1 antibody 148, which was raised against the extracellular portion of LAIR-1. Jurkat cells were pre-starved and then treated with 148 sera or 148 pre-immune sera. Cell lysates were precipitated by anti-SHP-1 or anti-LAIR-1 antibodies, and the precipitates were then subjected to Western blot analyses sequentially with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-LAIR-1, and anti-SHP-1. As shown in Fig.7 A, upon stimulation with 148, strong tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 was detected that was accompanied by association of SHP-1 with LAIR-1. In contrast, cells treated with pre-immune serum displayed no tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1, indicating that the antibody-induced phosphorylation is specific. Tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 resulted in the association of SHP-1, and the amount of SHP-1 co-precipitated with LAIR-1 correlated with the degree of LAIR-1 phosphorylation. We did not detect the association of LAIR-1 with other phosphatases, including SHP-2 and SHIP by Western blotting using specific antibodies. These results indicate that cross-linking of LAIR-1, with its antibodies against its extracellular segment, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 and recruitment of SHP-1. When the time course of antibody-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 was studied (Fig. 7 B), tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 was clearly observed at 5 min of stimulation, peaked at 10 min, and gradually decreased after 1 h. This transient tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 induced by its antibody is similar to that of growth factor and cytokine receptors induced by their ligands. SHP-1 stays inactive during the resting states of cells and is activated upon cell stimulation by binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors on the plasma membrane. Since our data showed that anti-LAIR-1 148 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1 and resulted in recruitment of SHP-1, these changes should alter SHP-1 activity as well as its localization. To verify this, Jurkat cells were starved for 5 h, then stimulated with 148 or 148 pre-serum. Cell lysates were fractionated into cytosolic and membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation. Equal proportions of extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-SHP-1. As shown in Fig. 8 A, most of the SHP-1 in pre-serum-treated Jurkat cells was distributed in the cytosolic fraction, with a marginal amount in the membrane fraction. However, about 30% of SHP-1 was found in the membrane fraction in anti-serum 148-treated cells. We further measured the activity of SHP-1 in the anti-LAIR-1 and anti-SHP-1 immunoprecipitates from the membrane fraction by using a 32P-labeled peptide substrate (Fig.8 B). Stimulation with LAIR-1 antibody caused a 5-fold increase in total SHP-1 activity in the membrane fraction. The majority of this activity is associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated LAIR-1. These results indicate that phosphorylation of LAIR-1 may produce a major SHP-1 activator in hematopoietic cells. In the present study, we have demonstrated that one of the major binding proteins of SHP-1 in hematopoietic cells corresponds to LAIR-1, and we have cloned two new isoforms of the protein. As an Ig-superfamily protein with two ITIMs, LAIR-1 specifically recruits SHP-1 but not SHP-2 or SHIP. This interaction is mediated by Tyr233 and Tyr263 embedded in the ITIMs that account for the entire tyrosine phosphorylation of LAIR-1. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of both sites is required to interact with SHP-1 through its SH2 domains. Although SHP-1 has been shown to bind a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor proteins, in many cases the binding is mediated through a single SH2 domain, and the stoichiometry of binding is relatively low. In fact, the same binding sites may also mediate interaction with SHP-2. By binding through both SH2 domains, LAIR-1 confers great specificity to SHP-1. This is reminiscent of the specific interaction of PZR to SHP-2 (31.Zhao Z.J. Zhao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29367-29372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32.Zhao R. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5453-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures suggest mechanisms by which tandem SH2 domains may display higher specificities than individual SH2 domains (33.Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). In vitro studies with phosphopeptides reveal that tandem SH2 domains bind bisphosphotyrosyl peptides 20–50-fold stronger than individual SH2 domains (34.Ottinger E.A. Botfield M.C. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 729-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the isoforms of LAIR-1, namely LAIR-1d, has no intracellular ITIMs and, thus, lacks the ability to bind SHP-1. We think that LAIR-1d may have a dominant negative role in the signaling mediated by ITIM-bearing isoforms of LAIR-1. The ITIM was initially defined by Burshtyn et al. (17.Burshtyn D.N.

Long E.O. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 473-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as a V/IXYXXL consensus sequence. This motif is generally believed to play a negative role in signal transduction by recruiting terminating enzymes such as protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and SHP-2 and inositol phosphatase SHIP (37.Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 38.Vely F. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2075-2077PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Isakov N. Immunol.

Recently, emergence of an increasing number of ITIM-bearing receptors has further emphasized the important regulatory role of this motif in various signal transduction pathways and subsequent cellular responses (41.Izzi L.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and we believe that its inhibitory function is mediated by recruiting SHP-1. As a major negative regulator of hematopoietic cell signaling, SHP-1 remains in an inactive state in resting cells and is activated by binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins on the plasma membrane (19.Zhao Z. Bouchard P. Diltz C.D. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2816-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of SHP-1 is important because it presumably turns off signal transduction, which may lead to cellular growth arrest. In fact, motheaten and viable motheaten mice develop a severe autoimmune and immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by an extremely high proliferation rate of all hematopoietic cells due to disruption of SHP-1 activity (7.Tsui H.W. Siminovitch K.A. Souza L. Tsui F.W.L. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 8.Shultz L.D. Schweitzer P.A. Rajan T.V. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Matthews R.J. Thomas M.L.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), LAIR-1 may be a major upstream activator of SHP-1 and, thereby, modulate hematopoiesis. Although SHP-1 is believed to be a potential target for therapeutic drug development, how to specifically induce its activation has remained a major challenge. By treating cells with anti-LAIR-1 antibody, we have provided a way to specifically activate SHP-1. The physiological meaning of the antibody-induced LAIR-1 phosphorylation, with concurrent activation of SHP-1, are under study and may have therapeutic implications. We are grateful to Dr. Sanford B. Krantz for his critical review of the manuscript."

Like atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), it possesses potent natriuretic, diuretic, and vasorelaxant activities, properties that position it physiologically as a potential antagonist of vasoactive systems (e.g. the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems) associated with intravascular volume expansion and increased blood pressure (1.Kamabayshi Y. Nakao K. Kimura H. Kawabata T. Nakamura M. Inouye K. Yoshida N. Imura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Like ANP, BNP is expressed in both atrial and ventricular myocardia, although differential expression is not so marked as that for ANP (the atrial/ventricular ratio for BNP expression is ∼3:1, whereas that for ANP is in the range of 40:1) (2.Gerbes A.L. Dagnino L. Nguyen T. Nemer M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 78: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As with ANP, ventricular expression of BNP is activated in pathophysiological states associated with hemodynamic overload in vivo (3.Kohno M. Horio T. Yoshiyama M. Takeda T.

In the latter group are a number of biochemical (e.g.α-adrenergic agonists, endothelin, angiotensin II, and cardiotrophin-1) as well as physical (e.g. mechanical strain and hypoxia) stimuli that trigger increases in cell size and protein synthesis, reactivate a program of fetal gene expression, and reorganize sarcomeric structure of myocytes in culture. These phenotypic changes closely resemble those associated with myocyte hypertrophy in vivo (11.Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). A number of recent studies have documented the importance of the extracellular matrix in establishing cellular responses, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to a variety of biochemical and physical stimuli (12.Simpson D.G.

J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In the case of mechanical strain, it has been hypothesized that key matrix-integrin attachments may participate in the signal transduction process linking the strain signal to changes in gene expression, cytoskeletal reorganization, and DNA synthesis (14.Davies P.F. Tripathi S.C. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 239-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that application of cyclical, passive mechanical strain (i.e. stretch) to cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in vitro results in stimulation of immunoreactive BNP secretion, increased steady-state levels of the BNP gene transcript, and activation of a transfected human BNP (hBNP) gene promoter (8.Liang F. Wu J. Garami M. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28050-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that both basal and strain-activated BNP promoter activities are dependent upon specific contacts that the ventricular myocyte makes with proteins in the extracellular matrix, implying a potential signaling function for these contacts in the subsequent activation of gene expression.

These vectors link the DNA sequence encoding the intracellular domains of the individual integrins to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the interleukin-2 receptor (gp55 subunit). Plasmid containing the Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase reporter was provided by Weijun Feng (University of California, San Francisco). Ventricular myocytes were prepared from 1–2-day-old neonatal rat hearts by alternate cycles of 0.05% trypsin digestion and mechanical disruption as described previously (19.Wu J.P. LaPointe M.C. West B.L. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6472-6479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 106) were cultured on collagen-coated FLEX plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/H-21 medium containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. A glass cloning cylinder (1-cm diameter) was placed in the middle of each well to preclude cell attachment, thereby placing the majority of adherent cells on the outer 75% of the culture surface where distension is maximal (20.Banes A.J. Gilbert J. Taylor D. Monbureau O. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used the Flexcell Strain apparatus to apply mechanical strain to our cultured myocytes. This is a commercially marketed device that applies vacuum (at variable levels) to the undersurface of a collagen-coated silicone elastomer disc positioned in the bottom of a six-well culture dish, which, in turn, is secured in an airtight manifold. Computer-regulated application of negative pressure to the underside of the culture dish results in downward displacement of the disc and stretch of adherent cells cultured on its upper surface (21.Gilbert J.A. Banes A.J. Link G.W. Jones G.J. Dietrich D.E. ANSYS Conference Proceedings. Swanson Analysis Systems, Houston, PA1989: 13.2-13.7Google Scholar, 22.Wilson E. Mai Q. Sudhir K. Weiss R.H. Ives H.E. J.

The medium was changed 24 h prior to initiation of the experiment. Cells were subjected to cyclical strain (60 cycles/min) on the Flexcell Strain apparatus at a level of distension sufficient to promote ∼20% increment in surface area at the point of maximal distension on the culture surface (20.Banes A.J. Gilbert J. Taylor D. Monbureau O. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments indicated that this level of distension provided near-maximal induction of BNP gene promoter activity (data not shown). Freshly prepared ventricular myocytes were transiently transfected with the indicated reporters and expression vectors by electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) at 280 mV and 250 microfarads. DNA content in individual cultures was normalized with pUC18. After transfection, cells were plated and cultured as described above. Cells were harvested and lysed in 100 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Protein concentration of each cell extract was measured using Coomassie protein reagent (Pierce). Cell lysates were processed (20 μg of protein/sample) and assayed for luciferase as described using a commercially available kit (Promega). Measurements of β-galactosidase activity were made using the Galacto-Light Plus kit from Tropix Inc. (Bedford, MA). To ensure reproducibility, experiments were repeated three to seven times. Varying concentrations (0.0001–1 μg/cm2) of fibronectin in aqueous solution were overlaid onto FLEX plates and allowed to air-dry in a laminar flow hood. All plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and rinsed with 10% enriched calf (EC) serum-containing medium to remove unadsorbed protein prior to addition of cells. Cells were harvested in 0.005% trypsin (1:10 dilution) and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/H-21 medium containing 10% enriched calf serum. Cells were pelleted, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the anti-integrin antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and incubated with FITC-labeled anti-hamster IgG or phycoerythrin-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The cells were harvested in lysis buffer (0.1 ml/well; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. 200 μg of supernatant protein was incubated with 1 μg of anti-ERK2, anti-JNK1, or anti-p38 antibody and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with cell lysis buffer and once with kinase reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The activities of ERK and p38 were measured by adding 20 μg of myelin basic protein to the immunoprecipitates in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The activity of JNK was measured by adding 5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun to the immunoprecipitates in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The samples were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Signals were identified and quantified by NIH Image. Data were subjected to analysis of variance, and the Newman-Keuls test was used to assess statistical significance. Results are presented as means ± S.D. As noted above, there is a growing body of evidence that the cell may sense physical distortion and signal downstream events in response to this distortion through perturbation of matrix-integrin interactions at the cell surface (14.Davies P.F. Tripathi S.C. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 239-245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibronectin, one of the major matrix proteins in the myocardium (25.Ahumada G.G. Saffitz J.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1984; 32: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26.Samuel J.L. Barrieux A. Dufour S. Dubus I. Contard F. Koteliasky V. Farhadian F. Marotte F. Thiery J. Rappaport L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1737-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), has been shown to exert profound effects on gene expression in other systems (27.Esparza J. Vilardell C. Calvo J. Juan M. Vives J. Urbano-Marquez A. Yague J. Cid M.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 2754-2766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Saito S. Yamaji N. Yasunaga K. Saito T. Matsumoto S. Katoh M. Kobayashi S. Masuho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30756-30763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we explored the effects of exogenous fibronectin on the activity of the BNP gene promoter in our myocyte cultures. When culture surfaces were precoated with increasing concentrations of fibronectin, a dose-dependent increase in basal hBNP luciferase activity and amplification of the strain-dependent response (Fig.1 A) were observed, implying that interaction of the myocyte with this matrix component is an important determinant of the magnitude of the response to mechanical strain. Disruption of cell-matrix interactions in the myocyte cultures negatively impacted the magnitude of the BNP promoter response to strain. Addition of a soluble peptide containing the matrix protein sequence RGD (i.e. GRGDSP) to the myocyte cultures, a maneuver that is known to interfere with selected matrix-integrin interactions, effected a dose-dependent reduction in strain-stimulated BNP gene promoter activity (Fig. 1 B). When the same experiment was carried out with the functionally inert RGE peptide (i.e. GRGESP), no reduction in promoter activity was observed. Similar inhibition was observed when soluble fibronectin was included in the culture medium (Fig. 1 C). As with the RGD peptide, a dose-dependent reduction in BNP promoter activity was seen, presumably reflecting impaired generation of matrix-integrin contacts in the cultures. Collectively, these findings imply that intact matrix-integrin attachments are required for strain-dependent induction of BNP gene transcription. Next, we examined the nature of the integrins expressed in our cultured cells using antibody-driven fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, we detected the presence of β1, β3, and αvβ5 integrins in our primary cultures of ventricular myocytes. Since these cultures are routinely contaminated to some degree with non-myocytes (primarily fibroblasts), we reexamined the integrin profile in myocytes cultured in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine. In addition, we examined the profile in non-myocytes (predominantly fibroblasts) isolated from the same neonatal hearts and cultured in parallel. The myocytes cultured in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine displayed a nearly identical integrin profile when compared with cells cultured in the absence of the drug, indicating that the integrins identified in these cultures reside almost exclusively on the cardiac myocytes. Non-myocytes also expressed β1 and β3 integrins in abundance. β3 integrin expression was actually more pronounced in non-myocytes than in the myocyte population. They also expressed αvβ5 and α1 integrins; α1 integrins were not demonstrated in the myocyte cultures. Addition of these same antibodies to viable transfected myocyte cultures revealed differential effects on hBNP promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 3, antibodies against β1, β3, and αvβ5 clearly inhibited the promoter response to mechanical strain. Antibody against the α5integrin effected a modest reduction in the response to strain, whereas antibody against α1, α2, or cadherin was without effect. These results were supported by additional studies employing transient overexpression of chimeric integrin molecules that link the extracellular and transmembrane domains of interleukin-2 to the intracellular domains of different integrin monomeric proteins. The latter, in the absence of a bona fide extracellular domain, do not respond to stimuli requiring engagement of the extracellular matrix, but continue to associate with and compete for intracellular proteins responsible for signaling integrin-dependent activity. In effect, when the chimeric proteins are expressed at high levels, such competition promotes a dominant-negative inhibition of integrin-dependent activity in the cell (17.Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. LaFlamme S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15961-15964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.LaFlamme S.E. Tomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, cotransfection of increasing amounts of vector encoding chimeric β1 or β3 integrin was effective in reducing basal promoter activity and partially blocking the response to mechanical strain. Forced expression of β5, α5, or a carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant of β3(β3B) that is defective in the signaling functions normally attributed to β3 failed to effect a systematic reduction in BNP promoter activity. These findings lend additional credence to the hypothesis that β1 and β3play key roles in signaling strain-dependent activity in these cultures. We have previously demonstrated that the response to mechanical strain is heavily dependent upon signaling activity transduced through the ERK (8.Liang F. Wu J. Garami M. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28050-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), p38 (29.Liang F. Gardner D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and, to a lesser extent, JNK (8.Liang F. Wu J. Garami M. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28050-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) pathways. To probe the connection between the integrins and activation of these different pathways, we examined the relative abilities of the antibodies described in the legend to Fig. 3 to prevent activation of these signaling cascades. As shown in Fig.5 A, antibodies against β1, β3, and αvβ5, all of which display the ability to suppress the strain-dependent activation of the BNP gene promoter (see Fig. 3), each effected a significant reduction of strain-dependent ERK activity. Antibody directed against cadherin, which failed to perturb strain-dependent BNP gene promoter activity, similarly was without effect on ERK. A similar inhibition was observed when p38 MAPK (Fig. 5 C) and, to a lesser extent, JNK (Fig. 5 B) were examined in parallel. Thus, interference with integrin function cannot be linked to suppression of BNP gene promoter activity exclusively through any one downstream MAPK signaling pathway. Rather, it appears that multiple pathways are impacted, supporting the hypothesis (29.Liang F. Gardner D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 30.Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) that there is a functional cooperativity among these pathways that links hypertrophic stimuli to enhanced transcriptional activity of the BNP gene. A number of studies (27.Esparza J. Vilardell C. Calvo J. Juan M. Vives J. Urbano-Marquez A. Yague J. Cid M.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 2754-2766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Saito S. Yamaji N.

Such regulation has important implications for development where cell movement and, by inference, sequential formation and disruption of matrix attachments play a major role in morphogenesis. It is also important in differentiated cells where physiological function is dependent upon specific cell-matrix attachments (e.g.leukocyte adhesion to blood vessel walls or osteoclast attachment to remodeling bone surfaces). In the cardiovascular system, the extracellular matrix is known to play an important role in modulating cellular function (12.Simpson D.G. Terracio L. Terracio M. Price R.L. Turner D.C. Borg T.K. J.

In addition, because of the dynamic (i.e. pulsatile) environment in which these cells reside, considerable interest has focused on the possibility that formation/disruption of cell-matrix attachments could play an important role in signaling information regarding cellular deformation (e.g. that resulting from increased stretch or shear stress) from the cell surface/cytoskeletal apparatus to the nuclear compartment. The major findings of this study include demonstration that 1) matrix proteins, including fibronectin, play an important role in supporting both basal and strain-induced BNP gene transcription in ventricular myocytes; 2) selected integrins present on the surface of cardiac myocytes participate in the activation of a number of signaling pathways that have been linked to the strain response as well as myocyte hypertrophy; and 3) interference with the function of these integrins leads to suppression of strain-dependent BNP gene transcription. A number of integrins have been identified previously on cardiac cells or in myocardial tissue. β1 (33.Ross R.S. Pham C. Shai S. Goldhaber J.I. Fenczik C. Glembotski C.C. Ginsberg M.H. Loftus J.C.

We have identified two cis-acting elements involved in the transcriptional regulation of TIMP-2. The first is an inverted CCAAT box located at position −73 to −69 in the TIMP-2 promoter that binds the transcription factor NF-Y. The second is a GAGGAGGGGG motif located at position −107 to −98, that binds the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. NF-Y and Sp1 cooperate for the basal transcription activity of the promoter. We then determined that TIMP-2 is transcriptionally up-regulated by cAMP analogs. Up-regulation of TIMP-2 by dibutyryl cAMP is a delayed response that requires de novo protein synthesis and does not affect RNA stability. The NF-Y and the Sp1 binding site are both involved in cAMP-dependent up-regulation of TIMP-2. Whereas NF-Y is essential for cAMP mediated regulation, Sp1 alone is not sufficient but enhances the activity of NF-Y. Dibutyryl cAMP has no effect on the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and switches the MMP-TIMP balance in favor of the inhibitor.

These inhibitors play an important role in the control of the homeostasis of the ECM under conditions that are associated with intense connective tissue remodeling such as implantation, embryogenesis, organogenesis, wound repair, arthritis, and cancer invasion (2.Birkedal-Hansen H.

Four members of the TIMP family, designated TIMP-1 to TIMP-4, have been identified so far in many species including human (4.Docherty A.J. Lyons A. Smith B.J. Wright E.M. Stephens P.E. Harris T.J.

These inhibitors differ in many aspects such as tissue-specific expression, solubility, and regulation but share a common antiprotease function because of their ability to form stable enzyme-inhibitor complexes with all members of the MMP family. The balance between MMPs and TIMPs is a key element that controls the turnover of the ECM and is itself under the influence of a large variety of growth factors and cytokines that transcriptionally regulate MMP and TIMP expression. Whereas some of these factors such as transforming growth factor β have a coordinated effect that decreases ECM degradation by up-regulating TIMP and down-regulating MMP expression (9.Kerr L.D. Miller D.B. Matrisian L.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 267-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 10.Campbell C.E. Flenniken A.M. Skup D. Williams B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7199-7206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), other factors such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, or oncostatin M have a much less predictable effect on the ECM because they simultaneously up- or down-regulate MMP and TIMP expression (11.Bugno M.

Eye Res. 1998; 17: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the transcriptional regulation of MMP and TIMP expression has been investigated, and several cis-acting elements in the promoter of many MMPs and TIMPs responsible for transcription control have been identified. In particular, a PEA-3 motif and an AP-1 motif located in close proximity in the promoter of many MMPs and TIMPs have been shown to mediate their enhanced expression by phorbol esters and serum factors (15.Benbow U. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), and a transforming growth factor β inhibitory element involved in the down-regulation of MMP-3 by transforming growth factor-β1 has been identified (9.Kerr L.D. Miller D.B. Matrisian L.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 267-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways involved in MMP and TIMP regulation have only recently begun to be explored. The mitogen-activated protein kinase and JACK/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathways have been implicated in the regulation of MMP-1 expression by oncostatin M (13.Korzus E. Nagase H. Rydell R. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1188-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are up-regulated by 8-bromo-cAMP in HT1080 cells, but the signaling pathway involved has not been entirely defined (16.Tanaka K. Iwamoto Y. Ito Y. Ishibashi T. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Sugioka Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2927-2935PubMed Google Scholar). In our laboratory we have previously isolated and characterized the human TIMP-2 gene and partially characterized its promoter (17.Hammani K. Blakis A. Morsette D. Bowcock A.M. Schmutte C. Henriet P. DeClerck Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25498-25505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This promoter has many features classically observed in housekeeping genes including a typical CpG island and several Sp1 motifs, suggesting that in contrast to TIMP-1 or TIMP-3, which respond to a large variety of cytokines and growth factors, TIMP-2 functions predominantly in providing a basal level of inhibitory activity. We demonstrate here that TIMP-2 is transcriptionally up-regulated by cAMP in a manner that specifically alters the MMP/TIMP balance in favor of the TIMP. Moreover we show that up-regulation of TIMP-2 by cAMP involves a cooperative action between NF-Y and Sp1. Human breast epithelial cancer cells MDAMB, human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, and murine NIH3T3 cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium (MDAMB, HT1080) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (NIH3T3) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 200 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. The full-length 2243 base pairs (pTIMP2–2.3K) and 276 base pairs (pTIMP2–276) TIMP-2 promoters cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL-2 (Promega, Madison, WI) have been previously described (17.Hammani K.

Both plasmids served as a template for deletion and site-directed mutagenesis studies in the TIMP-2 promoter. Mutational deletions were performed by PCR cloning, using a PCR core kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), 10 ng of DNA template, and 10 pmol of sense and antisense primers. The sequence of the sense primer for TIMP2–187 is 5′-GCGGGTCGCCCCGGGCAGGTGGTGC-3′, for TIMP2–131 5′-GCGCGGCCCGGGGGGAGGCGCGGGC-3′, for TIMP2–112 5′-GGCGCGGGCCCGGGGGGAGGAGGGGGC-3′, for TIMP2–100 5′-GGGGGAGGCCCGGGCTGCTGGGAG-3′, for pTIMP2–86 5′-AGGGGGCTGCTGCCCGGGCCCAGA-3′, for pTIMP2–73, 5′-GGGAGCGCCCAGACCCGGGATTGGCC-3′, and for pTIMP2–63 5′-GCCTGCATTGCCCGGGAGCCACCGGG-3′. The number in these plasmids indicates the number of bases located upstream of the transcription initiation site. The sequence of the antisense primer used for the generation of all the deletion mutants is 5′-CCATCCTCTAGAGGATAGAATGGCG-3′. All sense primers contain an SmaI site (underlined), and the antisense primer contains a XbaI site (underlined). The PCR reactions consisted of 39 cycles, and each cycle included a denaturation step at 94 °C for 1 min, a primer annealing step at 68 °C for 1.5 min, and an extension step at 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR-generated fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and inserted and amplified into T-Vectors (Promega). These vectors were digested with SmaI andXbaI, and the digested fragments containing the promoter were ligated back in the pGL-2 vector (Promega) linearized withSmaI and XbaI. Site-directed mutations within plasmid pTIMP2–86 were generated by PCR with the above-mentioned conditions using mutated sense primers. The sequence of the sense primer for pTIMP2–86M1 is 5′-AGGGGGCTGCTGCCCGGGCCCAGAGCCTGCA(C)TTGGCCGCC-3′; for pTIMP2–86M2, 5′-CTGCCCGGGCCCAGAGCCTGCGAGCCTGCA(T)TTG(A)GCCGCC-3′; and for pTIMP2–86M5, 5′-CTGCCCGGGCCCAGAGCCTGCG AGCCTGCA(C)T(C)T(C)G(C)G(C)CCGCC-3′, where the nucleotide replacing the constitutive nucleotide (underlined) is shown in parentheses. Site-directed mutagenesis within plasmid pTIMP2–2.3K were performed with QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene®, La Jolla, CA). The sequence of the mutagenic primers for pTIMP2-NF-Ymt are 5′-CTGCCCGGGCCCAGAGCCTGCT(A)TTA(G)GCCGCCAGCCACCGGG-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-CCCGGTGGCGGCT(C)AAA(T)GCAGGCTCTGGGCCCGGGCAG-3′ (antisense primer) and for pTIMP2-Sp1mt are 5′-GGGCGGAGGGGGAT(G)T(G)AGGGGGCTGC (sense primer) and 5′-GCAGCCCCCTA(C)A(C)TCCCCCTCCGCCC-3′ (antisense primer). The plasmid pTIMP2-Sp1mt was used as a template for constructing pTIMP2-Sp1/NF-Ymt. The mutagenic primers used for this construct are the same as those for pTIMP2-NF-Ymt. The PCR reaction consisted of 16 cycles, and each cycle included a denaturation step at 95 °C for 1 min, a primer annealing step at 55 °C for 1 min, and an extension step at 68 °C for 18 min. The methylated, nonmutated parental DNA templates were digested with DpnI at 37 °C for 2 h. The presence of these mutations was verified by sequence analysis. Cells were transiently transfected by lipofection using the DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium salts) liposomal transfection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To normalize the data for transfection efficiency, the pRL-SV40 (Promega), which contains the Renilla luciferase reporter cDNA under the transcriptional control of the SV40 promoter, was co-transfected with each test plasmid. Cells were transfected at 80% confluency 24 h after being plated into 6-well tissue culture clusters. Four μg of test plasmid was mixed with 10 ng of pRL-SV40 and 20 μl of DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent, and the mixture was added to the cells in the presence of 4 ml of culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When indicated, cultures were treated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP, Sigma) 15 h after transfection. The cells were further maintained for 48 h before being washed and lysed in the presence of 100 μl of lysis buffer (Dual-LuciferaseTM reporter assay system, Promega). The activity of firefly luciferase (test plasmid) andRenilla luciferase (control plasmid) was measured in 20-μl aliquots of cell lysate using the Dual-LuciferaseTMreporter assay system and a Lumat LB950 luminometer (Berthold, Germany). Transfection experiments were done in triplicate dishes and repeated at least three times. When indicated, stably transfected clones were obtained by co-transfecting cells with 8 μg of Psf/Neo plasmid (a gift of Dr. W. E. Laug, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA) and selecting cells against G-418 (600 μg/ml). Nuclear extracts from MDAMB cells were prepared according to the method of Dignamet al. (18.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The sense sequences of the DNA probes generated from hTIMP-2 are the following. The wild type probe containing NF-Y binding site is GCGCCCAGAGCCTGCATTGGCCGCCAGCCA, and its mutant probe is GCGCCCAGAGCCTGCT(A)TTA(G)GCCGCCAGCCA; the wild type probe containing the Sp1 binding site is GGGGGAGGAGGGGGCTGCTGGGAGC, and its mutant probe is GGGGGAT(G)T(G)AGGGGGCTGCTGGGAGC. Synthetic double-stranded DNA probes were labeled with [γ32P]ATP using the T4 polynucleotide kinase. Six μg of the nuclear extracts were mixed with these radiolabeled DNA probes (20,000 cpm) in the presence of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), containing 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 9% glycerol, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm spermidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before being loaded and electrophoresed in a 4% polyacrylamide gel under constant voltage (150 volts) in 0.4× TBE buffer (36 mm Tris borate (pH 8.0) and 0.8 mm EDTA). When indicated, non-radiolabeled (cold) double-stranded nucleotides or monoclonal antibodies against NF-YA (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were pre-incubated with the nuclear extracts for 15 min at room temperature before the addition of the radiolabeled probes. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from MDAMB cells using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (19.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in Trizol® (Life Technologies, Inc.) and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm to remove nuclei. The RNA in the supernatant was precipitated in isopropanol, washed in 75% ethanol, and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Twenty μg of RNA for each lane was electrophoresed on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted onto Zeta-probe membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were sequentially hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA probes for 16 h at 65 °C in 0.5 mNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 15.4% formamide. Human TIMP-2 cDNA was available in our laboratory, and the human rRNA 28 S cDNA (control) was purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). After hybridization, the blots were washed 2 times in 40 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS at 65 °C before to autoradiography at −80 °C. Western blot analysis was performed according to the method of Burnette (20.Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against human TIMP-2. Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with luminol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody. Analysis of MMP expression in serum-free culture medium of cell lines was performed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel zymography as described previously (21.Lim Y.T. Sugiura Y. Laug W.E. Sun B. Garcia A. DeClerck Y.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 167: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When needed, samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Microcon filters (Amicon, Beverly, MA; molecular weight cutoff, 10,000). In these gels, a clear zone indicated the presence of a protein with gelatinolytic activity. Similar gels were used to detect the presence of TIMP with the exception thatp-aminophenylmercuric acetate (Sigma)-activated crude gelatinase from cultured rabbit fibroblasts was incorporated into the gelatin-polyacrylamide mixture before polymerization. In these conditions, the presence of a stained zone of undigested gelatin indicated the presence of an inhibitor of gelatinases. For invasion assays we used transwells (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) in which the 8-μm pore filter of the upper chamber had been precoated with 100 ng of Matrigel® (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA). After drying overnight at room temperature, 100 μl of serum free medium was added to keep the filter wet for 2 h at room temperature. The upper chamber, to which 50,000 cells suspended in 200 μl of serum free medium were added, was then inserted into a well containing 500 μl of medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 36 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of Bt2cAMP, the cells in the upper chamber were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik® Stain Set (Dade International Inc., Miami, FL). The cells on the upper side of the filter were gently eliminated with a Q-tip before the filters were removed and mounted on glass slides. The cells attached to the lower side of the filter were counted under a microscope using a 20× objective. For migration assays we used similar experimental conditions, but the upper side of the filters in the transwells was not coated with Matrigel®. We had previously shown that the basal TIMP-2 promoter was located within 276 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site (17.Hammani K. Blakis A. Morsette D. Bowcock A.M. Schmutte C. Henriet P. DeClerck Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25498-25505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To further locate element(s) responsible for basal expression in this promoter, we created a series of deletion mutants by PCR cloning of the pTIMP2–276 plasmid. These constructs were transiently transfected into MDAMB cells and tested for luciferase activity. The data (Fig. 1) indicated an almost complete loss of basal activity when a segment of the promoter located between positions −63 and −73 was deleted, whereas deletions of DNA segments located up-stream of position −73 had no significant effect on basal activity. This 10-nucleotide-long DNA fragment (ATTGGCCGCC) appears essential for transcription activity and is located 39 nucleotide upstream of the TATA box. It contains an inverted CCAAT motif (ATTGG) between position −73 and −69. Evidence that the ATTGG motif is responsible for basal promoter activity was then obtained by directed site mutagenesis. These experiments (Fig.2) indicated a progressive loss of activity as the number of mutations in the motif increased from one (GTTGG) to two (TTTAG) and five (CCCCC) nucleotides. Thus the data demonstrate that the inverted CCAAT box is an essential motif in maintaining the basal expression of the TIMP-2 promoter.Figure 2Direct site mutagenesis of the inverted CCAAT box. Point mutations on the ATTGG (inverted CCAAT) motif were performed by PCR cloning as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” (left panel). The activity of these mutants driving a firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene was determined in transient transfection assays in MDAMB cells co-transfected with the pRL-SV40 plasmid. The data (right panel) represent the mean (+S.D.) firefly luciferase/Renilla luciferase (FFL/RL) ratio of three separate samples. The data shown are representative of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We used electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to identify in MDAMB cells nuclear protein(s) binding to the inverted CCAAT motif (Fig. 3). In a first set of experiments, nuclear extracts from MDAMB cells were incubated in the presence of a 30-mer radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the TIMP-2 promoter region extending from position −89 to −59 and containing the ATTGG motif. These experiments demonstrated the presence of 2 shifted radioactive bands (Fig. 3, left panel). The specificity of the upper band was demonstrated in the presence of increased amounts of a non-radiolabeled (cold) double-stranded oligonucleotide. To determine that the binding involved the inverted CCAAT box, we used a two-point mutation in the ATTGG motif (TTTAG) and demonstrated an absence of competition in the presence of this non-radiolabeled mutated oligonucleotide. NF-Y proteins have been identified as the major proteins binding to the inverted CCAAT motif (22.Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 23.Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The NF-Y complex is composed of three subunits (A, B, and C) of transcription factors. The subunit A is the subunit interacting with DNA, and subunits B and C form a binary complex that interacts with subunit A to promote DNA binding (23.Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 24.Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To determine whether NF-Y binds to the inverted CCAAT motif of the TIMP-2 promoter, we performed a second set of EMSA in the presence of an anti-NF-YA monoclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The data (Fig. 3, right panel) showed the presence of a super-shift in the presence of the antibody at the level of the upper band, which was not observed in the presence of nonspecific murine IgG. The data indicate that the NF-Y complex binds to the inverted CCAAT box in the TIMP-2 promoter and controls basal expression. The CCAAT motif is a bidirectional cis-acting element present in many eukaryotic promoters (22.Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 25.Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This motif has been recently reported to mediate the response of several genes that are up-regulated by an increase in cAMP (27.Reed G.E. Kirchner J.E. Carr L.G. Brain Res. 1995; 682: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28.Roder K. Wolf S.S. Beck K.F. Sickinger S. Schweizer M. Gene. 1997; 184: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29.Pittman N. Shue G. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28848-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CAMP-mediated regulation of these genes however differs from the rapid (within minutes) cAMP response seen in genes that contain the typical cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) by a delayed (within hours) response to changes in cAMP (30.Daniel P.B. Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In view of a previous report indicating that cAMP up-regulates TIMP-2 expression in HT1080 cells (16.Tanaka K. Iwamoto Y. Ito Y. Ishibashi T. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Sugioka Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2927-2935PubMed Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that the inverted CCAAT motif in the TIMP-2 promoter is involved in cAMP response. We first examined the effect of an increase in cAMP concentration on TIMP-2 expression in MDAMB cells by testing the effect of Bt2cAMP treatment on TIMP-2 mRNA and protein expression. The data (Fig.4 A) indicated a dose-dependent increase in TIMP-2 mRNA and TIMP-2 protein expression upon treatment of these cells with 2 and 10 mm Bt2cAMP. To determine whether the increase in TIMP-2 mRNA represents a net increase in transcriptional activity or a change in RNA stability, we performed similar experiments in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DBR), which was added to the culture medium 40 h after exposure to Bt2cAMP. The data (Fig. 4 B) revealed a similar decay of the 3.8- and 1.7-kb TIMP-2 mRNAs in the presence or absence of Bt2cAMP. These observations indicate that cAMP up-regulates TIMP-2 expression at a transcriptional level by affecting de novo RNA synthesis rather than RNA stability. We next conducted a time course analysis of TIMP-2 mRNA expression on Bt2cAMP-treated MDAMB cells to evaluate the timing of the response of TIMP-2 to an increase in cAMP. The data (Fig.5 A) indicated a progressive increase in mRNA expression starting 5 h after treatment and lasting beyond 48 h. There was therefore a 5-h delay between Bt2cAMP treatment and transcriptional up-regulation of TIMP-2, suggesting the presence of an intermediate regulatory mechanism. We therefore examined whether transcriptional up-regulation of TIMP-2 required de novo protein synthesis by testing the effect of cycloheximide on endogenous TIMP-2 mRNA expression in Bt2cAMP-treated MDAMB cells. The data (Fig. 5 B) revealed that cycloheximide at a concentration of 2.5 μminhibited the up-regulation of TIMP-2 mRNA induced by Bt2cAMP by 94% and 100% (3.8-kb and 1.7-kb mRNA, respectively). These observations and the absence of a typical CRE motif in the TIMP-2 promoter (17.Hammani K. Blakis A. Morsette D. Bowcock A.M. Schmutte C. Henriet P. DeClerck Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25498-25505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) are consistent with the concept that the up-regulation of TIMP-2 by cAMP involves a CRE-independent mechanism recently described for several cAMP-responsive genes such as the fatty acid synthase gene or the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (28.Roder K. Wolf S.S. Beck K.F. Sickinger S. Schweizer M. Gene. 1997; 184: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29.Pittman N. Shue G. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28848-28857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Typically, these genes have delayed response to cAMP mediated by NF-Y binding to the inverted CCAAT box.Figure 5Time course analysis of TIMP-2 mRNA expression in Bt2cAMP-treated MDAMB cells and effect of cycloheximide. A, MDAMB cells were incubated with 10 mm Bt2cAMP (dbcAMP) at 37 °C for various lengths of time. At indicated times, the cells were collected, and the total RNA was isolated. Top, TIMP-2 mRNA and 28 S rRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blot.Bottom, the signal intensity in the autoradiography was determined by scanning densitometry, and the amount of TIMP-2 mRNA at each time point was normalized for the amount of 28 S rRNA detected. The data represent the ratio TIMP-2/28S rRNA over time, for the 3.8- and 1.7-kb mRNAs. The signal of the 1.2-kb mRNA was too weak to generate meaningful data. B, MDAMB cells were treated with 10 mm Bt2cAMP in the absence or presence of 2.5 μm of cycloheximide (CHX) at 37 °C for 48 h. Top, analysis of TIMP-2 and 28 S rRNA expression by Northern blot.

The data represent the ratio TIMP-2 mRNA/28 S rRNA treated over untreated with cAMP for each experimental condition (with and without cycloheximide).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We therefore determined whether the 276-nucleotide-long TIMP-2 promoter, which contains the inverted CCAAT motif, could mediate a cAMP response. MDAMB cells were transfected with the plasmid pTIMP2–276, and stably transfected cells were selected in the presence of G-418. These cells were tested for the effect of Bt2cAMP on luciferase expression. These experiments (Fig.6) indicated that Bt2cAMP stimulated the expression of luciferase in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations ranging between 0.05 mm and 10 mm with a 2-fold increase in luciferase expression achieved in the presence of 0.5 mm Bt2cAMP (inset) and a 4-fold increase in the presence of 10 mm Bt2cAMP. To further localize the cAMP-responsive element in this segment of the promoter, we tested the effect of Bt2cAMP on MDAMB cells transiently transfected with TIMP-2 promoter deletion mutants. These experiments indicated a partial loss of cAMP resp"

R129H and R129Q antithrombins bound pentasaccharide and full-length heparins containing the antithrombin recognition sequence with similar large reductions in affinity ranging from 400- to 2500-fold relative to the control serpin, corresponding to a loss of 28–35% of the binding free energy. The salt dependence of pentasaccharide binding showed that the binding defect of the mutant serpin resulted from the loss of ∼2 ionic interactions, suggesting that Arg129 binds the pentasaccharide cooperatively with other residues. Rapid kinetic studies showed that the mutation minimally affected the initial low affinity binding of heparin to antithrombin, but greatly affected the subsequent conformational activation of the serpin leading to high affinity heparin binding, although not enough to disfavor activation. Consistent with these findings, the mutant antithrombin was normally activated by heparin for accelerated inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin. These results support an important role for Arg129 in an induced-fit mechanism of heparin activation of antithrombin wherein conformational activation of the serpin positions Arg129 and other residues for cooperative interactions with the heparin pentasaccharide so as to lock the serpin in the activated state.

Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Antithrombin inactivates these enzymes by trapping them in equimolar, SDS-stable complexes through a novel mechanism shared by other serpin family proteinase inhibitors. The inactivation is initiated by the proteolytic enzyme recognizing a reactive bond in an exposed loop of the serpin as a regular substrate. The proteinase proceeds to attack this bond and generate an acyl-intermediate in which the P1′ residue of the bond has been released and the proteinase is joined in acyl linkage to the P1 residue through its active-site serine (3.Lawrence D.A.

The cleavage of the reactive-bond loop is believed then to trigger a massive conformational change in which the loop, with the proteinase covalently-linked, is inserted into the center of β-sheet A of the serpin, resulting in the translocation of the enzyme to the opposite end of the inhibitor and its consequent trapping as a stable acyl-intermediate complex (1.Björk I.

Unlike most other serpins, which inhibit their target enzymes at diffusion limited rates, the rates of antithrombin inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin are several orders of magnitude slower than the diffusion limit. However, these rates can be accelerated several thousandfold to approach the diffusion limit by the highly sulfated polysaccharide, heparin (1.Björk I. Olson S.T. Church F.C. Cunningham D.D.

The ability of heparin to accelerate antithrombin-proteinase reactions is dependent on the binding to the inhibitor of a unique pentasaccharide sequence in the polysaccharide chain (10.Lindahl U.

Heparin chains containing this sequence bind the fully glycosylated α-form of antithrombin with high affinity (KD of 10–20 nm at physiological ionic strength and pH) and induce an activating conformational change in the inhibitor. Whereas this conformational change is sufficient to activate antithrombin to rapidly inhibit factor Xa, the acceleration of antithrombin inhibition of thrombin requires in addition a longer heparin chain to bridge the inhibitor and proteinase in a ternary complex.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have suggested that heparin activates antithrombin by expelling the reactive bond loop from the center of β-sheet A of the protein core in which it is partially buried in the native structure. This results in the complete exposure of the loop in a manner similar to that found in other native serpin structures and presumably in a conformation optimal for proteinase interaction (15.Jin L.

The recent x-ray crystal structure of an antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex identified the interacting basic residues as Lys11, Arg13, Arg46, Arg47, Lys114, Lys125, and Arg129 (15.Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). However, the relative contributions of these residues to pentasaccharide binding and activation of antithrombin has not been established in most cases. Our recent studies showed that Arg46 and Arg47 make very different contributions to the binding, with Arg47being much more important than Arg46 in this respect (21.Arocas V. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10196-10204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Lys125 has been shown to be an even more important contributor to heparin binding than Arg47 (20.Fan B. Turko I.V. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14156-14161Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, neither Arg47 nor Lys125 was found to be essential for activation of the serpin, although Arg47 did contribute to stabilizing the activated conformation (20.Fan B. Turko I.V. Gettins P.G.W.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10196-10204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The present report concerns the role of Arg129 in the heparin activation mechanism. The importance of this residue was first suggested from chemical modification studies (22.Sun X.J. Chang J.-Y. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8957-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and later more firmly established by the isolation of an abnormal antithrombin from a patient with thrombosis, in which Arg129 was mutated to Gln (18.Gandrille S. Aiach M. Lane D.A. Vidaud D. Molho-Sabatier P. Caso R. de Moerloose P. Fiessinger J.N. Clauser E. J. Biol.

Haemostas. 1987; 57: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the importance of Arg129 in heparin activation was difficult to assess in this study since the variant antithrombin was found to be unstable (18.Gandrille S. Aiach M. Lane D.A. Vidaud D.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1225: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To determine the role of Arg129 in heparin binding and activation of antithrombin, we have engineered recombinant antithrombins in which this residue was mutated to His to allow modulation of the charge of this residue in the neutral pH range and thereby to assess the importance of charge, or changed to Gln to replicate the natural mutation. Our findings clearly establish that Arg129 is critical for high affinity binding of the heparin pentasaccharide and much more important in this binding than Arg47. Arg129 is further shown to play an important role in heparin activation of antithrombin by binding the pentasaccharide cooperatively with other antithrombin residues only in the activated state, and thereby stabilizing the serpin in the activated conformation. Recombinant antithrombins were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells as described previously (19.Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Zuo Y. Picard V. Bock S.C. J. Biol.

R129H/N135A and R129Q/N135A antithrombins were constructed by additional Arg → His and Arg → Gln mutations, respectively, of the N135A antithrombin cDNA. Mutations were verified both prior to recombination of cDNAs into viral DNA as well as after viral integration. All recombinant antithrombins were purified by heparin affinity chromatography at pH 7.4 on 5-ml HiTrap Heparin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) or EconoPac Heparin (Bio-Rad) columns, as described previously (19.Ersdal-Badju E.

The R129H/N135A and R129Q/N135A antithrombin variants were further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a 1-ml MonoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluted with a 30–45-ml gradient from 0 to 0.6 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mmEDTA and 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. The purity of antithrombins was assessed by SDS-PAGE1 and nondenaturing PAGE using the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar) or by the SDS-Tricine gel system (28.Schægger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Molar concentrations of the three variants were calculated from absorbance measurements at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficient of 37,700m−1 cm−1determined for plasma antithrombin (29.Nordenman B.

Concentrations of full-length, pentasaccharide, and tetrasaccharide DEFG* heparins were determined from the end points of stoichiometric fluorescence titrations of plasma antithrombin with the saccharides (12.Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of tetrasaccharide EFGH′ was determined by weight. All experiments were conducted at 25 °C and in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, adjusted to either pH 7.4 or pH 6.0. In the absence of added salt, the ionic strength (I) of the buffer was 0.05 (pH 7.4) or 0.025 (pH 6.0). Sodium chloride was added to achieve higher ionic strengths at either pH. Recombinant antithrombin was added to identical samples of thrombin (50–500 nm) to give molar ratios of inhibitor to proteinase ranging from 0 to ∼2. Following incubation for 5–18 h, residual thrombin activity was determined by dilution of aliquots 100-fold into 100 μm S-2238 substrate (Chromogenix, Franklin, OH) inI 0.15, pH 7.4 buffer and measurement of the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis at 405 nm. Linear regression fitting of the residual thrombin activities as a function of the molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme yielded the apparent inhibition stoichiometry from the abscissa intercept (32.Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Binding of oligosaccharide or full-length heparins to recombinant antithrombins was measured by titrating the saccharides into a solution of antithrombin and monitoring the increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence which signals the binding interaction, as described previously (12.Olson S.T.

Measurements were made at 25 °C with an SLM 8000C or 4800S spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments, Rochester, NY) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 340 nm, respectively. Stoichiometric titrations of antithrombin variants with full-length heparin were done at pH 6.0, I 0.025 for R129Q/N135A antithrombin, at pH 7.4,I 0.05 for R129H/N135A and N135A antithrombins and also at pH 7.4, I 0.15 for N135A antithrombin. Titrations were done at least in duplicate with 0.1–0.5 μm antithrombin, based on absorbance measurements. Equilibrium titrations at pH 6 and 7.4 and different ionic strengths were performed at least in duplicate at antithrombin concentrations (based on heparin binding or thrombin inhibition titrations) less than or equal to KD and were carried out to a saturation of >95% with the saccharide in each case. The fluorescence titration data was fit by nonlinear regression analysis to the quadratic equilibrium binding equation for a 1:1 binding interaction to yield KD and the maximal fluorescence change (12.Olson S.T.

The rates of binding of pentasaccharide or full-length high affinity heparins to recombinant R129H/N135A antithrombin were measured in pH 7.4, I 0.15 buffer at 25 °C in an SX-17MV stopped-flow fluorometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, United Kingdom), as described previously (12.Olson S.T.

Pseudo-first-order conditions in which molar concentrations of saccharide and antithrombin (the latter based on thrombin inhibition titrations) were maintained at a ratio of at least 5:1 and in most cases ≥10:1 were employed. The interaction was monitored from the increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission cutoff filter with ∼50% transmission of light at 320 nm. The fluorescence traces were acquired for about 10 half-lives and fit by a single exponential function to give the observed pseudo-first-order rate constant (k obs). Typically, 12–18 fluorescence traces were acquired for each saccharide concentration andk obs values from these traces averaged. Second-order association rate constants for antithrombin or antithrombin-heparin complex inhibition of thrombin or factor Xa were measured under pseudo-first-order conditions at pH 7.4, I 0.15, 25 °C with catalytic levels of heparin, as described previously (21.Arocas V.

Reactions containing antithrombin (25–100 nm), heparin (0–5 nm), and proteinase (5–10 nm) were quenched at varying times by dilution into 100 μm S-2238 for thrombin or 100–200 μm Spectrozyme FXa (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) for factor Xa and residual enzyme activity determined from the initial rate of substrate cleavage at 405 nm. The time dependence of enzyme activity loss was fit by a single exponential function with an end point of zero activity to givek obs. Second-order association rate constants were obtained by dividing k obs by the inhibitor concentration in the case of the uncatalyzed reactions or determined from the slope of linear regression fits of the dependence ofk obs on the heparin concentration for heparin-catalyzed reactions, as described (26.Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31.Desai U.R. Petitou M. Björk I. Olson S.T. J. Biol.

The inhibitor concentrations used were those determined from thrombin stoichiometric titrations described above. As in our previous studies of heparin binding site variants of antithrombin, N135A antithrombin served as the reference because this variant lacks the Asn135 carbohydrate chain adjacent to the heparin binding site and as a result exhibits enhanced affinity for heparin (25.Ersdal-Badju E.

We have previously shown that the properties of N135A antithrombin resemble those of the natural β-form of antithrombin, which similarly lacks an oligosaccharide chain at Asn135(25.Ersdal-Badju E.

R129H/N135A and R129Q/N135A antithrombins showed a significant heparin binding defect, based on the significantly lower salt concentration required to elute the variants from a heparin affinity column (∼0.5m) as compared with that needed to elute the reference N135A antithrombin (∼2 m). Nevertheless, reasonably pure preparations of both Arg129 variants were obtained after the affinity chromatography. Further purification of the variants on Mono Q yielded an essentially homogeneous preparation in the case of the R129H/N135A variant, whereas some residual impurities were still detectable in the R129Q/N135A variant, based on SDS-PAGE analysis of the two variants. The electrophoretic mobilities of R129H/N135A and R129Q/N135A were indistinguishable from that of N135A on SDS-PAGE. Nondenaturing PAGE at alkaline pH showed an increased mobility of the Arg129 variants relative to the reference N135A antithrombin, consistent with the mutation of Arg129resulting in the loss of a positive charge. The latter gel further showed that the preparations were free of inactive polymeric forms of the serpin (41.Wardell M.R. Chang W.S.W. Bruce D. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13133-13142Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). R129H/N135A and N135A antithrombins additionally showed equivalent abilities to form SDS-stable complexes with thrombin on SDS-PAGE, indicating that these recombinant antithrombins exhibited the functional properties characteristic of the properly folded serpin. The stoichiometry of full-length heparin binding to the mutant antithrombins was assessed by fluorescence titrations at low ionic strength and at antithrombin concentrations greatly exceedingKD (>20-fold). R129Q/N135A antithrombin gave low heparin binding stoichiometries ranging from ∼0.2 to 0.31 ± 0.02 mol of heparin/mol of antithrombin for two preparations. By contrast, the R129H/N135A variant showed much higher heparin binding stoichiometries of 0.78 ± 0.01 to 0.86 ± 0.02 for two preparations, values comparable to those observed for several preparations of the N135A reference antithrombin (0.79–0.85) (25.Ersdal-Badju E.

Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), indicating that the preparations were nearly fully active. Confirming these findings, three preparations of R129H/N135A antithrombin inhibited thrombin with close to equimolar stoichiometries (1.2–1.3 mol of inhibitor/mol of enzyme), comparable to those measured for N135A antithrombin, indicating a similar fraction of active inhibitor (77–83%). Fluorescence enhancements were somewhat low in titrations of R129Q/N135A antithrombin (24–25%), whereas they approached normal values for titrations of the R129H/N135A variant (31–34%) when compared with the reference N135A antithrombin (34–43%). These results suggest that the R129Q/N135A variant contained a substantial fraction of inactive, probably latent inhibitor, formed by the spontaneous insertion of the reactive center loop int"

High affinity multivalent ligand binding sites could be formed through two possible mechanisms: the interaction of two Man-6-P binding domains within one Man-6-P/IGF2R molecule or by receptor oligomerization. To discriminate between these mechanisms, truncated FLAG epitope-tagged Man-6-P/IGF2R constructs, containing one or both of the Man-6-P binding domains, were expressed in 293T cells, and characterized for binding of pentamannose phosphate-bovine serum albumin (PMP-BSA), a pseudoglycoprotein bearing multiple Man-6-P residues. A construct containing all 15 repeats of the Man-6-P/IGF2R extracytoplasmic domain bound PMP-BSA with the same affinity as the full-length receptor (K d = 0.54 nm) with a curvilinear Scatchard plot. The presence of excess unlabeled PMP-BSA increased the dissociation rate of pre-formed125I-PMP-BSA/receptor complexes, suggesting negative cooperativity in multivalent ligand binding and affirming the role of multiple Man-6-P/IGF2R binding domains in forming high affinity binding sites. Truncated receptors containing only one Man-6-P binding domain and mutant receptor constructs, containing an Arg1325 → Ala mutation that eliminates binding to the repeats 7–9 binding domain, formed high affinity PMP-BSA binding, but with reduced stoichiometries.

Most lysosomal enzymes are modified in the Golgi to contain multiple Man-6-P groups as a part of their glycosylation repertoire (for review see Ref.1.Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although multiple pathways may participate in lysosomal targeting of proteins, disruption of the Man-6-P sorting pathway has been found in several human diseases, including lysosomal enzyme storage diseases such as Pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy and I-cell disease (2.Lemansky P.

In addition, increased secretion of Man-6-P-bearing lysosomal enzymes has been associated with cancers of the breast and prostate (5.Ross J.S. Nazeer T. Figge H.L. Fisher H.A. Rifkin M.D. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1995; 104: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 6.Sleat D.E. Chen T.L. Raska Jr., K. Lobel P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3424-3430PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Mathieu M. Vignon F.

It is not yet fully understood why mammals produce two different MPRs. Whereas both the CD-MPR and Man-6-P/IGF2R can recognize proteins containing Man-6-P residues, they have overlapping but distinct functions in the sorting of specific hydrolases. Many studies have shown that the expression of only one or the other MPR is insufficient for targeting all Man-6-P-bearing hydrolases to the lysosomal compartment (9.Kasper D.

Furthermore, studies using antibodies against the ligand binding domains of the CD-MPR and the Man-6-P/IGF2R have shown that the Man-6-P/IGF2R participates in the endocytosis of lysosomal enzymes from the cell surface, whereas the CD-MPR does not (15.Stein M. Zijderhand Bleekemolen J.E. Geuze H. Hasilik A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2677-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the two receptors appear to have distinct functions, the CD-MPR and Man-6-P/IGF2R are likely to have shared a similar ancestral origin, as each of the 15 extracytoplasmic repeats of the Man-6-P/IGF2R shares 14 to 28% sequence identity with the entire extracytoplasmic domain of the CD-MPR (16.Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CD-MPR is a 46-kDa membrane glycoprotein that binds monophosphomannosylated ligands with low affinity (K d = 6–8 μm) and forms a high affinity bivalent Man-6-P-binding site (K d = 200 nm) through receptor oligomerization (17.Tong P.Y.

The Man-6-P/IGF2R is a much larger (300-kDa) type I transmembrane glycoprotein that comprises a short NH2-terminal signal sequence, followed by 15 homologous repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a 167-residue cytoplasmic domain (16.Lobel P.

The Man-6-P/IGF2R binds IGF-II at the cell surface, resulting in the internalization and degradation of this mitogenic growth factor in the lysosomal compartment (21.Oka Y. Rozek L.M. Czech M.P. J.

Finally, the receptor interacts with proteins that bear the Man-6-P marker, resulting in sorting to the lysosomal compartment. Functional mapping studies of the extracytoplasmic domain of the Man-6-P/IGF2R have revealed the location of two distinct binding domains for Man-6-P (28.Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y.

Arg426 in repeat 3 and Arg1325 in repeat 9 of the human receptor are thought to interact non-covalently with the Man-6-P moiety during ligand binding, as mutation of these residues in the bovine receptor eliminates Man-6-P binding to their respective binding domains (28.Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like the CD-MPR, the Man-6-P/IGF2R binds monovalent Man-6-P ligands with low affinity (K d = 6–7 μm) and divalent phosphomannosylated ligands with high affinity (K d = 1–20 nm) (31.Tong P.Y. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanism for the formation of two unique high affinity sites is not understood. Two models have been proposed to explain the Man-6-P/IGF2R's ligand binding characteristics. Intramolecular interactions between the two extracytoplasmic Man-6-P binding domains could account for high affinity binding (31.Tong P.Y. Gregory W. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, receptor oligomerization could result in the formation of two unique high affinity sites, which may explain observations of functional differences between the repeat 3 and repeat 9 Man-6-P binding domains with respect to their preference for sorting specific hydrolases (30.Marron-Terada P.G. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22358-22366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Studies of the oligomeric state of the receptor, however, have led to paradoxical results. Sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration chromatography of purified bovine receptors in the absence of exogenous ligands suggest that the receptor exists in solution in the monomeric state (32.Perdue J.F. Chan J.K. Thibault C. Radaj P. Mills B. Daughaday W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7800-7811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas cross-linking analysis of the receptor in cell culture suggests that the receptors form oligomeric structures (19.Stein M. Braulke T. Krentler C. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, the addition of exogenous multivalent phosphomannosylated ligands has been shown to increase the internalization rate of the Man-6-P/IGF2R in cell culture models and to result in the presence of receptor dimers as determined by gel filtration chromatography (33.York S.J. Arneson L.S. Gregory W.T. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1164-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In order to discriminate between the intramolecular and intermolecular models of high affinity multivalent phosphomannosylated ligand binding to the Man-6-P/IGF2R, we have characterized wild-type and mutant receptor constructs for the ability to interact with a multivalent Man-6-P ligand. Our data indicate that the Man-6-P/IGF2R displays negative cooperativity in binding the multivalent ligand, and that receptors containing only one functional Man-6-P binding domain, either repeat 3 or repeat 9, are capable of forming a high affinity Man-6-P binding site. Truncation of the Man-6-P/IGF2R, however, revealed that multiple regions outside of the minimal Man-6-P binding domains in repeats 3 and 9 play a role in both the formation of bivalent Man-6-P binding sites and the resultant affinity of these sites toward PMP-BSA. These observations suggest that receptor oligomerization is the mechanism for the formation of high affinity Man-6-P binding in the extracytoplasmic domain of this receptor. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) or the University of Nebraska Medical Center Molecular Biology Core Facility (Omaha, NE). Recombinant human IGFs were provided by M. H. Niedenthal (Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN). The native Y-2448O-phosphomannan of Hansenula holstii was a gift from Dr. M. E. Slodki (Midwest Area Northern Regional Research Center, Peoria, IL, retired). Carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for radioiodination of IGF-II and pentamannose phosphate-bovine serum albumin (PMP-BSA) to specific activities between 40 and 80 Ci/g by Enzymobead reagent (Bio-Rad) and IODOGEN™ reagent (Pierce), respectively. The pCMV5 vector (34.Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. David W. Russell (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), and the 8.6-kilobase pair human Man-6-P/IGF2R cDNA (20.Oshima A. Nolan C.M. Kyle J.W. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2553-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. William S. Sly (St. Louis University Medical Center, St. Louis, MO). Other reagents and supplies were obtained from sources as indicated. A minireceptor construct, termed 15F, encompassing all 15 repeats of the extracytoplasmic domain of the Man-6-P/IGF2R followed by a FLAG epitope tag, was created from a full-length human Man-6-P/IGF2R cDNA (20.Oshima A. Nolan C.M. Kyle J.W. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2553-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (35.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The R1325A mutant was created using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and a two-step cassette strategy described previously (35.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Complementary mutagenic primers were designed for that procedure corresponding to nt 4103–4140, changing CGC to GCG at nt 4120–4122 to create the R1325A missense mutation and a C to G silent mutation at nt 4125, which incorporated a novel SalI site for diagnostic purposes. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing across the mutated region. A set of eight carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged minireceptor constructs was engineered in a pCMV5RIX expression vector using a strategy developed previously in our laboratory (36.Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the full-length Man-6-P/IGF2R and 15F(R1325A) cDNAs as templates, the following constructs encompassing truncated forms of the extracytoplasmic domain of the Man-6-P/IGF2R were made by amplification with Ventpolymerase (New England Biolabs): repeats 1–3F (nt 148–1554, corresponding to residues 1–469), 1–8F (nt 148–3807, corresponding to residues 1–1220), 1–9F (nt 148–4242, corresponding to residues 1–1365), 1–11F (nt 148–5100, corresponding to residues 1–1651), 7–9F (nt 2926–4242, corresponding to residues 927–1365), 7–15F (nt 2926–7002, corresponding to residues 927–2285), 1–9F with the R1325A mutation, and 1–11F with the R1325A mutation. To ensure consistent translation, the signal sequence containing the amino-terminal 71 residues of the first repeat was fused to the beginning of the 7–9F and 7–15F constructs as described (36.Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the constructs contained a 3′ 24-nt sequence encoding an eight-residue FLAG tag, DYKDDDDK, followed by a stop codon and an XbaI restriction site. The nucleotide sequences of the Man-6-P/IGF2R cDNA constructs that passed through mutagenesis or amplification procedures were verified by sequence analysis. In addition, the constructs that demonstrated unexpected or interesting ligand binding properties (i.e. 1–8F, 1–9F, and 7–15F) were prepared again in a new amplification reaction using the strategy discussed above, and the ligand-binding properties were confirmed using both constructs. Transient expression of the constructs was carried out in 293T human embryonic kidney cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum plus 5 μg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The transfections were done by a modification of the calcium phosphate method described previously (37.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). Cells were fed with fresh medium 24 h after transfection, and cell lysates were prepared on the 5th to 6th day after transfection by solubilization with 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, as described earlier (36.Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once the lysates were collected, 20 μl aliquots were electrophoresed on an 8–18% gradient SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions and electroblotted to BA85 nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody (VWR Scientific, Chicago, IL) (1:1000 dilution) followed by a secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). The resultant antibody complex was developed with 125I-protein A (NEN Life Science Products) and detected with autoradiography followed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) to quantify relative expression of the receptor constructs. PMP, containing a Man-6-P group as the terminal mannose residue, was hydrolyzed and purified from a yeast cell wall phosphomannan following the procedure of Murray and Neville (38.Murray G.J. Neville Jr., D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11942-11948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conjugation of PMP to BSA was carried out following the procedure of Braulke et al. (39.Braulke T. Causin C. Waheed A. Junghans U. Hasilik A. Maly P. Humbel R.E. von Figura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). BSA (15 mg/ml) was incubated in the presence of 0.2 m PMP and 160 mmNaCNBH3 at 37 °C for 4–5 days. The resultant product was purified on a 30-ml G-50 Sephadex column in phosphate-buffered saline. The flow-through fractions were collected, pooled, and stored at −20 °C. Aliquots (25 μg) of the protein were iodinated to specific activities of approximately 50 Ci/g by incubation in 0.3m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 2 mCi Na125I using pre-coated IODOGEN tubes for 25 min. The product was separated from free iodine on a G-50 Sephadex column. The iodinated PMP-BSA was collected from the flow-through fractions and stored at −20 °C until use. The minireceptor constructs were routinely immunoadsorbed to anti-FLAG M2 resin (Sigma) to separate them from other proteins, especially the endogenous 293T Man-6-P/IGF2R, present in the cell lysates. Aliquots (20–30 μl) of Triton X-100 cell lysates containing equal amounts of FLAG-tagged construct, based on PhosphorImager analysis of anti-FLAG immunoblots, were incubated with 12 μl of packed M2 resin in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 1% BSA and 5 mm Man-6-P at 3 °C for 14–16 h. Addition of 5 mm Man-6-P at this stage prevented co-precipitation of endogenous phosphomannosylated ligands. The construct-laden resin was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for approximately 10–12 s. Finally, the resin pellets were washed twice with 0.75 ml of HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (HBST) and then subjected to the studies described below. The ability of the constructs to bind 125I-PMP-BSA or125I-IGF-II was first measured by incubating the immunoadsorbed constructs, or resin exposed to CMV5-transfected control lysates, with 1 nm125I-PMP-BSA or 2 nm125I-IGF-II in binding buffer (HBST + 0.5% BSA) at 3 °C for 3–5 h. Three hours of incubation was adequate for the constructs to reach binding equilibrium, as determined by affinity chromatography experiments (35.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and by replicate binding reactions incubated for 16 h, in which the amount of binding was identical to reactions incubated for only 3 h (data not shown). Following the binding reaction, the resin pellets were washed twice with 0.75 ml of HBST to remove unbound ligand, collected by centrifugation, and counted in a γ counter. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the counts/min ligand bound in replicate reactions carried out in the presence of 5 mm Man-6-P or 1 μmIGF-II. Affinity measurements were carried out by competitive binding analysis. Equal amounts of the receptor constructs were immunoadsorbed to M2 resin and incubated with 1 nm125I-PMP-BSA in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled PMP-BSA (from 0 to 500 nm) at 3 °C for 4–5 h. The resins were washed and counted as described above. The data were then fit to a model for one-site competitive binding using GraphPad Prism™ software. In addition to PMP-BSA binding, the ability of 1–3F, 7–9F, 1–9F, 15F, and 15F(R1325A) receptor constructs to interact with immobilized Man-6-P was determined using a PMP-Sepharose affinity depletion assay developed previously (35.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine if the Man-6-P/IGF2R displays negative cooperativity in binding PMP-BSA, the rate of 125I-PMP-BSA dissociation from immunoadsorbed 15F construct was measured in the presence of 25 nm unlabeled PMP-BSA or Man-6-P. Equal amounts of immunoadsorbed 15F were incubated in the presence of 250 pm125I-PMP-BSA in binding buffer. Following a 3-h incubation at 3 °C, the resin pellets were washed twice with 0.75 ml of HBST at 3 °C, and then diluted 75-fold with HBST only, HBST with 25 nm PMP-BSA, or HBST with 25 nm Man-6-P and incubated at 3 °C. At time intervals (from 0 to 100 min), the amount of remaining bound ligand was determined by collecting and counting the resin pellets. The increase in dissociation rate was also assayed in the presence of increasing concentrations of Man-6-P (0–50 mm) or PMP-BSA (0–150 nm) in a similar fashion. Equal amounts of the pre-formed125I-PMP-BSA·15F complex were diluted with 1 ml of HBST containing increasing concentrations of either Man-6-P or PMP-BSA, and dissociation was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 3 °C. The resin pellets were collected and counted to determine the amount of bound radioligand remaining. To study the ability of the Man-6-P/IGF2R to interact with multivalent Man-6-P-bearing proteins, a wild-type soluble receptor construct, called 15F, was engineered and expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (293T cells). This construct comprised the entire extracytoplasmic domain followed by a FLAG-epitope tag, which allowed separation of the constructs from the endogenous 293T Man-6-P/IGF2R and other cellular proteins. Interestingly, the 15F construct was expressed as a homogeneous 250-kDa protein, which was not secreted into conditioned medium, but was soluble in cell lysates prepared by a freeze/thaw method (35.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, Triton X-100 cell extracts were used to prepare the constructs for the analysis of Man-6-P binding. PMP-BSA, a pseudoglycoprotein containing multiple Man-6-P residues, was synthesized and iodinated for use as a multivalent ligand to measure the ability of the 15F construct to bind phosphomannosylated ligands. Competitive binding analysis with PMP-BSA revealed that the wild-type 15F construct bound with high affinity (K d = 0.54 ± 0.18 nm, mean ± S.E., n= 8) with a Hill slope of −0.75 ± 0.03, mean ± S.E. (n = 8, data not shown). Analysis of the data by Scatchard plot revealed a curvilinear plot consistent with the Hill slope of −0.75 (Fig. 1 A). The curvilinear nature of the plot is similar to previously reported binding analyses of full-length Man-6-P/IGF2R employing both naturally occurring and synthetic multivalent phosphomannosylated ligands (30.Marron-Terada P.G.

Chem. 1989; 264: 7962-7969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, IGF-II affinity analysis using an analogous competitive binding assay demonstrated that the extracytoplasmic domain of the receptor is capable of binding IGF-II with the same affinity as the full-length receptor (36.Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (K d = 2.8 ± 0.44 nm, n = 8) and a slope factor consistent with the presence of a single class of binding sites (Hill slope = −1.01 ± 0.05 S.E., n = 8) (35.Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. De Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine if the curvilinear Scatchard plot for PMP-BSA binding observed for the wild-type 15F construct was due to negative cooperativity, we used an experimental approach developed by De Meyts and colleagues, who addressed the rate of dissociation of radiolabeled insulin from the insulin receptor in the presence of unlabeled ligand (40.De Meyts P. Roth J. Neville Jr., D.M. Gavin J.R. Lesniak M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 55: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). If the Man-6-P/IGF2R displays negative cooperativity in binding PMP-BSA, we would predict that the dissociation rate of PMP-BSA would increase with increasing ligand occupancy of the receptor. First, the rate of 125I-PMP-BSA dissociation from a pre-formed 125I-PMP-BSA·15F complex was measured in the presence or absence of 25 nm Man-6-P or PMP-BSA (Fig. 1 B). The presence of 25 nm PMP-BSA dramatically increased the rate of dissociation in comparison to the control and 25 nm Man-6-P reactions, causing 50% of the radioligand/receptor co"

Alignment of the primary sequence of gyrase B (GyrB) from various species shows that they can be grouped into two classes. The GyrB of Gram-negative eubacteria has a stretch of about 165 amino acids in the C-terminal half, which is lacking in other GyrB subunits and type II topoisomerases. In Escherichia coli, no function has so far been attributed to this stretch. In this study, we have tried to assess the function of this region both in vivo and in vitro. A deletant (GyrBΔ160) lacking this region is non-functional in vivo. The holoenzyme reconstituted from gyrase A (GyrA) and GyrBΔ160 shows reduced but detectable supercoiling and quinolone-induced cleavage activity in vitro. GyrBΔ160 retains its ability to bind to GyrA and novobiocin. However, when reconstituted with GyrA, the deletant shows greatly impaired DNA binding. The intrinsic ATPase activity of the GyrBΔ160 is comparable to that of wild type GyrB, but this activity is not stimulated by DNA. These studies indicate that the additional stretch present in GyrB is essential for the DNA binding ability of E. coli gyrase. DNA gyrase is the only enzyme known to negatively supercoil DNA.

DNA gyrase A protein DNA gyrase B protein GyrB protein lacking 160 amino acids polymerase chain reaction electrophoretic mobility shift assay Topoisomerases are a ubiquitous class of enzymes that catalyze the interconversion between different topological isomers of DNA (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Among these enzymes, DNA gyrase is the only enzyme that has the ability to negatively supercoil DNA (3Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 4Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In addition to supercoiling, gyrase can relax both positively and negatively supercoiled DNA and catalyze catenation/decatenation as well as knotting/unknotting reactions (4Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Gyrase performs these topological transformations by creating transient double-stranded breaks in DNA and resealing the break after passing another DNA duplex through it (2Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Hence, mechanistically the enzyme is a type II topoisomerase. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme and belongs exclusively to the prokaryotic kingdom. Although gyrases from various species show resemblance to eukaryotic type II topoisomerases, they have diverged significantly during evolution and have enzymatic properties distinct from other members of this class. Therefore, the enzyme is an effective target for many antibacterial agents (5Lewis R.J. Tsai F.T.F. Wigley D.B. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Maxwell A. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 102-109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), some of which are used clinically as drugs. Two major classes of drugs that inhibit gyrase are quinolones and coumarins. DNA gyrase is a heterotetramer consisting of two GyrA1 and two GyrB polypeptides (4Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The gyrA and gyrB genes have been cloned and sequenced from a variety of bacterial species (7Huang W.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 79-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but most of the biochemical as well as the structural studies have centered on the enzyme from Escherichia coli. The GyrA and GyrB proteins have been shown to be organized as functional domains (4Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The GyrA protein consists of an N-terminal domain (59–64 kDa) that harbors the DNA cleavage-reunion activity (8Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19648-19653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reece R.J. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3540-3546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a C-terminal 33-kDa region involved in wrapping the DNA (10Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The GyrB protein consists of an N-terminal domain (43 kDa) that hydrolyzes ATP and binds to coumarin drugs (11Gellert M. Fisher L.M. O'Dea M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6289-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The intrinsic ATPase activity of GyrB is stimulated by the presence of GyrA and DNA (13Staudenbauer W.L. Orr E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3589-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Maxwell A. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14472-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal 47-kDa fragment of GyrB can complement the intact GyrA to form a complex that retains the ability to relax supercoiled DNA in the absence of ATP (11Gellert M. Fisher L.M. O'Dea M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6289-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6110-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore this part of the protein has been postulated to bind to GyrA and DNA. The exact region(s) involved in these functions have yet to be characterized. Sequence alignment of GyrB proteins from different organisms (Fig. 1) reveals the absence of a stretch of about 165 amino acids from Gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasma (7Huang W.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 79-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29: 271-297Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Madhusudan K. Nagaraja V. J. Biosci. 1996; 21: 613-629Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This stretch is also missing from eukaryotic topoisomerase II enzymes as well as from the homologues of GyrB in topoisomerase IV from different species. The structural information about type II topoisomerases is derived from the structure of an internal fragment of yeast topoisomerase II (18Berger J.M. Gamblin S., J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), the N-terminal ATPase domain of E. coli GyrB (19Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E., J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal two-thirds of the E. coli GyrA (20Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, none of the structures include the 165-amino acid region. Furthermore, this region has not been implicated in any specific function. In the present study, we have tried to assess whether the additional amino acid stretch present in GyrB of E. coli is essential for the function of the enzyme. We have created a truncated GyrB by deleting 160 amino acids within the extra 165-amino acid region in the full-length protein. The deletant GyrB (GyrBΔ160) has been purified, and its enzyme activities have been compared with GyrB. We have determined the maximal dispensable region in this particular stretch of amino acids without changing the ability of the protein to rescue the temperature-sensitive strain of GyrB. We find that the region is essential for the DNA binding ability of the active gyrase tetramer. Deletion of this stretch impairs the activity of the protein bothin vivo and in vitro. E. coli DH10B was used for all cloning experiments. The strain N4177 (gyrBts cour) was a kind gift from M. Gellert (21Menzel R. Gellert M. Cell. 1983; 34: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Overexpression plasmids pPH3 and pAG111 (22Hallett P. Grimshaw A.J. Wigley D.B. Maxwell A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were used for GyrA and GyrB purification, respectively. The plasmid pJW312-SalI used in the purification of E. colitopoisomerase I was obtained from J. C. Wang (23Lynn R.M. Wang J.C. Proteins. 1989; 6: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GyrBΔ160 was generated by PCR amplifying parts of the gene upstream and downstream of the 160-amino acid stretch using the primers P1 and P2 and primers P3 and P4, respectively. The primer sequences are as follows: P1, 5′-ACAGCGATGTCGAATTCTTATG; P2, 5′-TTGCGCCCTCGAGCGCGATAGAGATC; P3, 5′-GTAGCCAGCCTCGAGCAGGCGCT; P4, 5′-GGCCAGTGCCAAGCTTGCATG. The PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned (pMCN1 and pMCN2) separately in pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene). The relevant portions were sequenced, and then the fragments were brought together in pBluescript KS(+) (pMCN3) resulting in the generation of an XhoI site at the junction. The SalI-HindIII region of GyrB present in pAG111 was replaced with the SalI-HindIII fragment from pMCN3, which encompasses the deletion to generate GyrBΔ160 (pMCN4, Fig. 2). Two more deletions mutant of GyrB were created, one lacking the first 78 amino acids of the 160-amino acid stretch and the other where the following 84 amino acids were removed (pMCN6 and pMCN5, Fig. 2). pMCN5 and pMCN6 were generated by replacing appropriate (SalI-XhoI and XhoI-HindIII, respectively) fragments in pMCN4 with fragments from pAG111-XhoI. For the purpose of generating a range of exonuclease III-mediated deletions (within the 160-amino acid stretch), an XhoI site was engineered near the center of the region in the full-length GyrB (pAG111-XhoI) (Fig. 2) using the QuikChangeTMmutagenesis method (Stratagene). The mutagenesis was carried out using the following primers: 5′-GTCAGCGAACTCGAGGACAAAGAACAG and 5′-CTGTTCTTTGTCCTCGAGTTCGCTGAC with pAG111 as the template. pAG111-XhoI linearized with XhoI was used as the substrate for the exonuclease III reaction (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken out at different time intervals (15–120 s), and the DNA ends were blunted using S1 nuclease and Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. After ligation, the DNA was transformed into strain N4177 for complementation studies. gyrBts strain N4177 was used for all complementation studies. After transformation, the cells were recovered at 30 °C and plated at the permissive (30 °C) or restrictive temperature (42 °C). In all the complementation experiments, cells transformed with pAG111 were used as a positive control and pTTQ18 as the negative control. GyrA and GyrB were purified as described previously (25Maxwell A. Howells A.J. Bjornsti M.-A. Osheroff N. Protocols for DNA Topoisomerases I: DNA Topology and Enzyme Purification. Humana Press Inc., Towata, NJ1999: 135-144Google Scholar). GyrBΔ160 was purified using the similar purification scheme as used for GyrB except that a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl was used to elute the protein from the Hi-Trap heparin-Sepharose column. GyrBΔ160 was also purified using a novobiocin-Sepharose affinity column as described previously (25Maxwell A. Howells A.J. Bjornsti M.-A. Osheroff N. Protocols for DNA Topoisomerases I: DNA Topology and Enzyme Purification. Humana Press Inc., Towata, NJ1999: 135-144Google Scholar). The protein was purified from N4177 cells harboring pMCN4. Supercoiled pUC18 and pBR322 were prepared by standard DNA purification protocols (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli topoisomerase I was purified, and relaxed pUC18 was prepared as described by Lynn and Wang (23Lynn R.M. Wang J.C. Proteins. 1989; 6: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Supercoiling assays were carried out as described by Mizzuuchi et al. (26Mizzuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5960-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Ciprofloxacin-induced cleavage was performed in supercoiling buffer except that ATP was omitted and supercoiled pBR322 was used as the substrate. Ciprofloxacin was added at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and the drug-gyrase-DNA complex was trapped by adding 0.2% SDS. After 5 min, proteinase K was added at a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml and incubated for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were resolved on 0.8% agarose gel in 40 mm Tris acetate buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. The gel was run at 1.5 V/cm for 6 h. ATPase assays were performed as described previously (27Hadi S.A. Bickle T.A. Yuan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4159-4164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions (30 μl each) were carried out in supercoiling buffer containing 2 mm ATP and 0.04 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 30 min and terminated by adding chloroform. 5 μl of the aqueous layer was resolved on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plate (Merck), which was developed with 1.2 mm LiCl and 0.1 mmEDTA. The spots corresponding to ADP and ATP were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Fuji Film FLA2000). Sonicated salmon sperm DNA (150 μg/ml) was used wherever indicated. EMSA was performed using a PCR-amplified 240-base pair fragment encompassing the preferred gyrase cleavage site in pBR322 (28Fisher L.M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Ohmori H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4165-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The primers used for the amplification were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase prior to PCR. The labeled DNA fragment was gel-eluted and purified through Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gyrase was reconstituted in supercoiling buffer (tRNA and ATP were omitted) and incubated with labeled DNA at 4 °C for 1 h. The free DNA and the gyrase-DNA complex were separated using 5% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) in 90 mmTris borate, 5 mm MgCl2. The gel was run at 4 °C at 5 V/cm for 8 h, autoradiographed, and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Novobiocin was coupled to Sepharose as described before (25Maxwell A. Howells A.J. Bjornsti M.-A. Osheroff N. Protocols for DNA Topoisomerases I: DNA Topology and Enzyme Purification. Humana Press Inc., Towata, NJ1999: 135-144Google Scholar). GyrB was loaded, and the column was washed with TGED (TGED, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). GyrA was loaded, and the column was successively washed with TGED containing 0 m KCl, 1 m KCl, 2 murea, and 6 m urea. Samples from each wash were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine the elution of GyrB and GyrA. GyrBΔ160 was also analyzed under similar experimental conditions. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore). GyrA was immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip via amine coupling in acetate buffer (pH 4.5). The surface was blocked with ethanolamine hydrochloride. The interaction was assessed in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins used for the experiment were dialyzed against running buffer prior to the experiment. Different concentrations of GyrB and GyrBΔ160 were passed over the immobilized GyrA, and the subsequent changes in resonance units were recorded. Buffer containing 1 m KCl was used to dissociate bound GyrB or GyrBΔ160 from GyrA after each run. Alignment of the primary sequences of type II topoisomerases shows the presence of an extra 165-amino acid stretch in GyrBs of Gram-negative organisms (Fig. 1). ParE, the GyrB homologue in topoisomerase IV from E. coli, however, lacks this region. GyrB from archaea as well as topoisomerase II from eukaryotes also do not have this region. To assess the function of this stretch, we created a deletant of E. coli GyrB that lacked 160 amino acids from the C-terminal domain of the protein (pMCN4, Fig. 2 a). In addition we also generated two “partial” deletants that lack either the N-terminal (pMCN6) or the C-terminal (pMCN5) halves of the 160 amino acids. The E. coli strain N4177 carries a temperature-sensitive allele of gyrB. pAG111 (plasmid expressing full-length GyrB) is able to rescue the cells at the restrictive temperature. On the other hand, cells expressing any of the three deletants were unable to grow at restrictive temperature (Fig.3 a) even when the expression was induced with isopropylthiogalactoside. Comparable amounts of the deletant proteins were present in cells with respect to the expression of full-length GyrB (Fig. 2 b), and around 90% of the proteins were soluble after induction (data not shown). Furthermore, immunoblots using monoclonal antibody against GyrB showed that the steady state level of the deletants was very similar to GyrB in the uninduced state. Thus the deletants were being expressed and had similar stability in vivo as the full-length GyrB. These results imply that the inability to rescue the gyrBts strain was due to the impaired activity of the deletants in vivo and not because of their lack of expression, solubility, or rapid degradation. A range of deletions within the 165-amino acid region was generated using exonuclease III. Restriction analysis and the protein expression profile indicated that a large range of in-frame deletions was obtained. Under our experimental conditions, no clones were obtained that had the entire 165-amino acid region removed and yet was able to rescuegyrBts strain (Fig. 3 b). Among the clones that rescued the gyrBts strain, those harboring the largest deletions were sequenced to determine the precise junctions. The largest region that could be removed without hampering the protein function in vivo was comprised of the central 50 amino acids (621–670, Fig. 3 a, segment 8). The GyrBΔ160 protein was purified from N4177 cells harboring pMCN4 (see “Experimental Procedures,” Fig.2 b). The ability of the purified GyrBΔ160 to support supercoiling in the presence of GyrA and ATP was assessed at 30 and 42 °C. The protein showed extremely reduced (<2% of the wild type) supercoiling activity at both temperatures. Fig.4 a depicts one such supercoiling assay performed at 42 °C. In addition, the activity was inhibited in the presence of novobiocin. It is noteworthy that the strain N4177 harbors a temperature-sensitive allele of gyrB, which shows no detectable activity at 42 °C (21Menzel R. Gellert M. Cell. 1983; 34: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 29Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and is resistant to novobiocin at 30 °C (21Menzel R. Gellert M. Cell. 1983; 34: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, the above results clearly demonstrate that the supercoiling activity is specific to the holoenzyme composed of GyrA and GyrBΔ160. Quinolones (e.g.ciprofloxacin) are known to trap the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate in the topoisomerization reaction and have been used to assess the cleavage activity of DNA gyrase holoenzyme (30Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4772-4776Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The deletant showed 80-fold reduction in ciprofloxacin-induced cleavage, paralleling the results obtained with the supercoiling assay (Fig. 4 b). To ensure that the reduced specific activity was not due to improper folding of the deletant, the other properties exhibited by GyrB were examined. The N-terminal region of GyrB is known to bind to coumarins (e.g. novobiocin). GyrB interacts very tightly to novobiocin, and this has proved useful in the purification of the protein (13Staudenbauer W.L. Orr E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3589-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Novobiocin coupled to epoxy-activated Sepharose serves as an affinity handle to assess the binding of gyrB to the drug. Moreover, GyrB bound to novobiocin on the column retains its ability to interact with GyrA. The deletant was retained, when passed through such a novobiocin-affinity column, exhibiting the property characteristic of wild type GyrB. In addition, GyrA interacted with the deletant bound to the column (not shown) indicating that the overall tertiary structure of the deletant was unaltered. The GyrBΔ160 and GyrA interaction was quantitatively evaluated using the BIAcore system. For this purpose, GyrA was immobilized on a CM-5 sensor chip. Various concentrations of analyte (GyrB or GyrBΔ160) were passed over the sensor surface, and the subsequent changes in resonance units were recorded. The kinetic parameters obtained show that the deletant bound to GyrA with an affinity comparable to the full-length GyrB (TableI). Furthermore, when GyrB was immobilized and GyrA was passed over the surface, similar results (KD = 2.1 × 10−7m) were obtained, substantiating the authenticity of the interaction.Table IKinetic parameters of the interaction of GyrA with GyrB and GyrBΔ160ProteinkonkoffKDm−1s−1s−1mGyrB1.73 × 103 ± 0.21 × 1031.17 × 10−3 ± 0.12 × 10−36.83 × 10−7 ± 1.63 × 10−7GyrΔ1600.93 × 103 ± 0.19 × 1030.32 × 10−3 ± 0.07 × 10−33.47 × 10−7 ± 0.21 × 10−7 Open table in a new tab EMSAs were carried out to assess the binding of gyrase to DNA. The holoenzyme comprising GyrA and GyrB bound to DNA in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.5 a). However, the enzyme reconstituted from GyrA and GyrBΔ160 showed no detectable stable complex even when much higher amounts of protein were used (Fig.5 b). Thus, it appears that the removal of the 165-amino acid region from GyrB affects the DNA binding ability of the holoenzyme. Since the deletant binds to GyrA, we wanted to assess its effect on the formation of A2B2 holoenzyme in an EMSA reaction. When GyrA was mixed with fixed and limiting amount of GyrB and varying amounts of GyrBΔ160, there was a concentration-dependent increase in the amount of complex formed (Fig. 6 a). However, with limiting GyrA, there was reduction in the amount of gyrase-DNA complex formed with the increase in GyrBΔ160 (Fig. 6 b). These results are in accordance with a scenario where GyrBΔ160 is defective in DNA binding but not in its interaction with GyrA (see “Discussion”).Figure 6The presence of GyrB Δ160 alters the complex formation by wild type gyrase. a, EMSA in the presence of excess GyrA, 300 fmol of DNA, and 200 nm GyrA was used in all reactions. 50 nm of GyrB was used wherever indicated. b, EMSA in the presence of limiting GyrA, 30 fmol of DNA, and 30 nm GyrA was used in all reactions. 150 nm GyrB was used wherever indicated. Varying amounts of GyrBΔ160 were added as mentioned.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ATPase activity of GyrB and GyrBΔ160 was assessed in the absence and presence of DNA. The intrinsic ATPase activity of the enzymes in the absence of DNA was similar (Fig. 7, Km, GyrB, 1.4 mm and GyrBΔ160, 1.6 mm). In the presence of DNA, there was stimulation in ATP hydrolysis by GyrB, whereas the deletant showed no appreciable change in activity. Taken together, these findings agree well with the failure of the A2ΔB2 holoenzyme to bind DNA. The present study is an attempt to understand the function of the extra 165 amino acids present in GyrB of E. coli. We find that the region plays an essential role in the functioning of E. coli DNA gyrase. This region is present only in Gram-negative organisms. In contrast, other homologues of GyrB in all three kingdoms (eukarya, archaea, and Gram-positive eubacteria) lack this region. It is also absent from topoisomerase IV belonging to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative eubacteria. Our analysis shows that truncated E. coli GyrBs, lacking the stretch (GyrBΔ160), or lacking half of the region are unable to rescue a gyrBts strain (Fig. 3). Thus the deletants appear to be non-functional in vivo despite being expressed at high levels with >90% in the soluble form. In addition, exonuclease III-mediated deletion analysis revealed that deletions greater than 50 amino acids (near the center of the stretch) rendered the protein inactive in vivo. This further confirms that the stretch is essential for the functioning of GyrB in E. coli. We purified GyrBΔ160 to analyze its biochemical properties in vitro. The purified GyrBΔ160 retains novobiocin binding (not shown), GyrA binding (Table I), and has similar intrinsic ATPase activity to full-length GyrB (Fig. 7 a). Thus, it appears that the removal of 160 amino acids within the 165-amino acid stretch does not grossly disturb the overall conformation of the protein. In contrast, GyrBΔ160 (in presence of GyrA) is severely compromised in both supercoiling activity and drug-induced cleavage activity (Fig. 4). Therefore, it appears that the deletant is dysfunctional in cleavage or a step prior to it. In the supercoiling reaction cycle of DNA gyrase, prior to cleaving DNA, GyrB has to bind to GyrA and form an active heterotetramer. Thus, the reduced cleavage by the deletant may be due to its inability to bind GyrA, inefficient heterotetramer formation, reduced DNA binding ability, or poor cleavage activity per se. We find that the deletion does not affect the interaction of GyrB with GyrA (Table I); however, the deletant shows a drastic reduction in DNA binding. There is no detectable stable gyrase-DNA complex seen in EMSAs with the gyrase (A2ΔB2) holoenzyme (Fig. 5 b). Under similar conditions, the wild type (A2B2) holoenzyme is able to bind DNA and form a stable complex (Fig. 5 a). Previous work has suggested that GyrB readily forms heterodimers when two populations are mixed (31Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26305-26309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32O'Dea M.H. Tamura J.K. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9723-9729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible to calculate the proportions of wild type homodimers, mutant homodimer, and heterodimer in a mixed population. This provides an explanation for the data shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6 a, where the concentration of GyrA is high, increasing amounts of ΔB lead to an increase in the percentage of DNA-protein complex. If we assume that A2BΔB can bind DNA, then the increase in the amount of this complex will lead to an increase in the total amount of DNA bound. In Fig. 6 b, where the concentration of GyrA is limiting, there will be a competition between the B dimers for GyrA. With increasing amounts of ΔB, A2ΔB2 will predominate. As this species is known to be incapable of binding to DNA (Fig. 5), the amount of DNA bound will decrease, as observed. Therefore, these data support the idea that GyrB exists as a monomer-dimer equilibrium and suggest that the heterodimer (A2BΔB) is capable of binding to DNA. Taken together, these results indicate that the deletant is able to bind GyrA but is defective in DNA binding. It has been shown earlier that the ATPase activity of GyrB is stimulated in the presence of GyrA and DNA (13Staudenbauer W.L. Orr E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3589-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,14Maxwell A. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14472-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intrinsic ATPase activity of the deletant is similar to the wild type (Fig. 7 a). However, this activity is not stimulated in the presence of GyrA and DNA, supporting the above conclusion. Topoisomerization reaction, especially supercoiling, involves a series of complicated steps. In the case of gyrase, strand transfer requires a duplex to pass through the entire dimer interface of the protein. During this passage, one would expect a series of transient DNA-protein interactions. Thus, it is not surprising that more than one region in DNA gyrase participates in DNA binding. Full-length GyrA, as well as the C-terminal domain of GyrA alone, can bind to DNA in the absence of GyrB, albeit with low affinity (10Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 33-kDa region of GyrA is known to wrap DNA in a positive superhelical sense. In addition, the N-terminal two-thirds of GyrA contains the active site tyrosine (4Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and is implicated in both covalent and non-covalent interactions with DNA (20Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In the case of GyrB, there is indirect evidence for DNA binding from at least three different observations. First, the ATPase activity of GyrB is stimulated by the presence of DNA in the central cavity within the GyrB dimer (33Tingey A.P. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4686-4873Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Second, GyrB not only enhances the stability of the protein-DNA complex but its presence is essential for the manifestation of the cleavage activity by GyrA. In accordance with this, the B′ region of yeast topoisomerase II (equivalent to the C-terminal half of GyrB) has been shown to harbor amino acids crucial for the cleavage-reunion activity of the enzyme (34Liu Q. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Third, the C-terminal 47 kDa of GyrB in the presence of GyrA can support ATP-independent relaxation (15Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6110-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed to be involved in binding both DNA and GyrA. However, no precise region(s) in GyrB has been allocated these functions. Our findings indicate that the domain/region within the 165-amino acid stretch may, directly or indirectly, be involved in DNA binding. The 165-amino acid region in GyrB is a characteristic of Gram-negative eubacteria. Our extensive sequence analysis has failed to reveal any significant homology with other proteins. Although the stretch shows moderate conservation among different species, we failed to detect any sequence motif, which would be indicative of its function. The occurrence of other functional gyrases lacking this stretch seems to imply that this region may be dispensable. On the contrary, we find that the 165-amino acid stretch is essential in E. coli GyrB both in vivo and in vitro. This raises the possibility that among gyrases there may be two classes of enzymes that show subtle differences in their interaction with DNA. A detailed comparative analysis of gyrase from Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms needs to be done to understand better the functioning of these proteins and their evolutionary history. It would also be interesting to look for the types of compensatory mechanisms/mutations operating in gyrases lacking this stretch. We thank J. C. Wang for the plasmid pJW312-SalI and M.

https://openalex.org/W2103901567,"In Drosophila melanogaster andCaenorhabditis elegans, kinasesuppressor of Ras (KSR) functions as a positive modulator of Ras-dependent signaling either upstream of or parallel to Raf. Attempts to characterize the biochemical and biological properties of mammalian KSR, however, have had limited success. Although some studies demonstrated a requirement of KSR kinase activity for its action, others indicated the kinase function of KSR is dispensable and suggested that KSR acts primarily as a scaffold protein. Interpretations of KSR function are further hampered by the lack of a standardized assay for its kinase activity in vitro. To address this issue, we established a two-stage in vitro kinase assay in which KSR never comes in contact with any recombinant kinases other than c-Raf-1. Using this assay, we show that KSR immunoprecipitated from quiescent COS-7 cells overexpressing Flag-tagged KSR was inactive, but its activity was rapidly and markedly induced upon epidermal growth factor treatment. Moreover, KSR-reconstituted mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was detected in KSR immunoprecipitates depleted of all contaminating kinases (c-Raf-1, MEK1, ERK2) by multiple high salt washes. Only full-length kinase-active KSR was capable of signaling c-Raf-1-dependent activity as kinase inactive and C- and N-terminal deletion mutants were without effect. Furthermore, endogenous KSR isolated from A431 cells, which contain high levels of activated EGF receptor, displays constitutively enhanced kinase activity. Hence, KSR kinase activity is not an artifact of overexpression but a property intrinsic to this protein. The recognition of EGF as a potent activator of KSR kinase activity and the availability of a well defined in vitro kinase assay should facilitate the definition of the function of KSR as a Ras-effector molecule. In Drosophila melanogaster andCaenorhabditis elegans, kinasesuppressor of Ras (KSR) functions as a positive modulator of Ras-dependent signaling either upstream of or parallel to Raf. Attempts to characterize the biochemical and biological properties of mammalian KSR, however, have had limited success. Although some studies demonstrated a requirement of KSR kinase activity for its action, others indicated the kinase function of KSR is dispensable and suggested that KSR acts primarily as a scaffold protein. Interpretations of KSR function are further hampered by the lack of a standardized assay for its kinase activity in vitro. To address this issue, we established a two-stage in vitro kinase assay in which KSR never comes in contact with any recombinant kinases other than c-Raf-1. Using this assay, we show that KSR immunoprecipitated from quiescent COS-7 cells overexpressing Flag-tagged KSR was inactive, but its activity was rapidly and markedly induced upon epidermal growth factor treatment. Moreover, KSR-reconstituted mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was detected in KSR immunoprecipitates depleted of all contaminating kinases (c-Raf-1, MEK1, ERK2) by multiple high salt washes. Only full-length kinase-active KSR was capable of signaling c-Raf-1-dependent activity as kinase inactive and C- and N-terminal deletion mutants were without effect. Furthermore, endogenous KSR isolated from A431 cells, which contain high levels of activated EGF receptor, displays constitutively enhanced kinase activity. Hence, KSR kinase activity is not an artifact of overexpression but a property intrinsic to this protein. The recognition of EGF as a potent activator of KSR kinase activity and the availability of a well defined in vitro kinase assay should facilitate the definition of the function of KSR as a Ras-effector molecule. kinase suppressor of Ras kinase-inactive KSR mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase myelin basic protein epidermal growth factor antibody glutathioneS-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Recent investigations have identified a new class of upstream signals necessary for normal development and/or oncogenesis via Ras (1.Therrien M.

These latter findings have been interpreted as evidence that the kinase function of KSR is dispensable under physiologic conditions.The interpretation of KSR function is further hindered by the lack of a standardized assay for its kinase activity in vitro. We first reported that the kinase activity of KSR was required to signal c-Raf-1 activation in an in vitro reconstitution assay using recombinant c-Raf-1, MEK1, and ERK2/MAPK, employing myelin basic protein (MBP) phosphorylation as a readout (10.Zhang Y.

Based on the inability to detect KSR kinase activity in reconstitution assays and the fact that numerous kinases co-immunoprecipitated with KSR, other groups have proposed that the observed activity was not intrinsic to KSR but rather that the primary mode of KSR signaling is via protein-protein interaction (the Scaffolding Hypothesis). To address this issue directly, we have established a new two-stage in vitro assay for KSR activity in which KSR never comes in contact with any recombinant kinases other than c-Raf-1. We demonstrate that extensive washing of the KSR immunoprecipitate with high salt (1 mNaCl) removes contaminating kinases but retains KSR activity. Using this assay, we show that Flag-KSR is virtually inactive in resting COS-7 cells, but its activity is markedly increased by EGF treatment. Furthermore, endogenous KSR isolated from A431 cells, which contain high levels of activated EGF receptor, displays constitutively enhanced kinase activity.DISCUSSIONThe present investigations use an improved KSR kinase assay to demonstrate c-Raf-1-dependent reconstitution of the MAPK signaling cascade in vitro. KSR activity could not be reconstituted in assays lacking recombinant c-Raf-1, and KSR conferred MEK1 activation capabilities onto c-Raf-1 in a two-stage assay. Only full-length kinase-active KSR appeared capable of signaling c-Raf-1-dependent activity as C- and N-terminal deletion mutants were without effect. Further, functional integrity of the KSR kinase domain appeared necessary because substitution of conserved aspartates involved in phospho-transfer with alanines (KI-KSR) abrogated MAPK signaling. KSR-dependent Raf-1 activation appears to involve threonine phosphorylation of Raf-1 as measured using an anti-phosphothreonine Ab, 2H. R. Xing and R. Kolesnick, unpublished data. consistent with prior observations (18.Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Multiple readouts for MAPK signaling were employed including the incorporation of labeled (autoradiographic detection) or unlabeled (Western detection) phosphate into MBP or Elk-1. Using Elk-1 as the ERK2/MAPK substrate reduced background activity, consistent with its specificity as a substrate for ERK/MAPKs. Multiple high salt washes were used to deplete the KSR immunoprecipitate of co-immunoprecipitating proteins, many of which in intact cells may be contained in a multiprotein complex comprised of Ras/MAPK signaling components. Nevertheless, the KSR protein and its activity were quantitatively retained within the washed immunoprecipitate, indicating that the detected kinase activity is inherent to KSR. KSR contamination by quantities of an unknown kinase below the limits of detection of our assays, nevertheless, remains a remote possibility. Critically, endogenous human KSR was capable of signaling c-Raf-1-dependent activation of the MAPK pathwayin vitro, showing that KSR kinase activity is not an artifact of overexpression but a property intrinsic to this protein.The present studies define EGF as a powerful activator of KSR kinase activity, consistent with the genetic data. EGF treatment induced rapid and marked KSR activation. However, in the absence of stimulation, KSR activity was low in COS-7 cells, consistent with our prior publication, which demonstrated that KSR activity was observed in the one-stage reconstitution assay only upon overnight autoradiography (10.Zhang Y.

A comparison to ceramide and tumor necrosis factor treatments in COS-7 cells, which also activate KSR, showed that EGF induced at least 3–5 times greater activity and the activities were additive. 3Y. Zhang and R. Kolesnick, unpublished observation. These studies suggest that KSR may be activated by more than one mechanism. Consistent with this proposal, EGF treatment does not appear capable of inducing rapid elevation in cellular ceramide levels (19.Payne S.G. Brindley D.N. Guilbert L.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Additional studies are required to evaluate the biologic relevance of KSR in ceramide/tumor necrosis factor and EGF signaling through the Ras/MAPK system.These investigations do not address the relative contribution of KSR kinase activity and scaffolding capabilities in KSR signaling. However, the recognition of the EGF pathway as a powerful activator of KSR kinase activity and the availability of a well defined kinase assay should permit investigations to address this issue and facilitate the definition of the function of KSR as a Ras-effector molecule.

However, the recognition of the EGF pathway as a powerful activator of KSR kinase activity and the availability of a well defined kinase assay should permit investigations to address this issue and facilitate the definition of the function of KSR as a Ras-effector molecule. The present investigations use an improved KSR kinase assay to demonstrate c-Raf-1-dependent reconstitution of the MAPK signaling cascade in vitro. KSR activity could not be reconstituted in assays lacking recombinant c-Raf-1, and KSR conferred MEK1 activation capabilities onto c-Raf-1 in a two-stage assay. Only full-length kinase-active KSR appeared capable of signaling c-Raf-1-dependent activity as C- and N-terminal deletion mutants were without effect. Further, functional integrity of the KSR kinase domain appeared necessary because substitution of conserved aspartates involved in phospho-transfer with alanines (KI-KSR) abrogated MAPK signaling. KSR-dependent Raf-1 activation appears to involve threonine phosphorylation of Raf-1 as measured using an anti-phosphothreonine Ab, 2H. R. Xing and R. Kolesnick, unpublished data. consistent with prior observations (18.Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Mathias S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Multiple readouts for MAPK signaling were employed including the incorporation of labeled (autoradiographic detection) or unlabeled (Western detection) phosphate into MBP or Elk-1. Using Elk-1 as the ERK2/MAPK substrate reduced background activity, consistent with its specificity as a substrate for ERK/MAPKs. Multiple high salt washes were used to deplete the KSR immunoprecipitate of co-immunoprecipitating proteins, many of which in intact cells may be contained in a multiprotein complex comprised of Ras/MAPK signaling components. Nevertheless, the KSR protein and its activity were quantitatively retained within the washed immunoprecipitate, indicating that the detected kinase activity is inherent to KSR. KSR contamination by quantities of an unknown kinase below the limits of detection of our assays, nevertheless, remains a remote possibility. Critically, endogenous human KSR was capable of signaling c-Raf-1-dependent activation of the MAPK pathwayin vitro, showing that KSR kinase activity is not an artifact of overexpression but a property intrinsic to this protein. The present studies define EGF as a powerful activator of KSR kinase activity, consistent with the genetic data. EGF treatment induced rapid and marked KSR activation. However, in the absence of stimulation, KSR activity was low in COS-7 cells, consistent with our prior publication, which demonstrated that KSR activity was observed in the one-stage reconstitution assay only upon overnight autoradiography (10.Zhang Y.

Our results give support to the notion that GAGA can function as a transcription activating factor. DNA binding region glutamine-rich domain soluble nuclear fraction Transcription of the homeotic and segmentation genes is a highly regulated process in Drosophila in which many different factors exert positive and negative effects. Some of those genes, including engrailed (en), Ultrabithorax (Ubx), even-skipped (eve), fushi tarazu (ftz), and Krüppel (Kr), characteristically present multiple binding sites clustered in their promoters (with a consensus sequence GAGAG) for a factor named GAGA. The expression of Ubx, en, and ftz has been shown to be clearly regulated by GAGA in vivo (1.Farkas G. Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H. Karch F. Nature. 1994; 371: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 2.Bhat K.M. Farkas G. Karch F. Gyurkovics H. Gausz J. Schedl P. Development. 1996; 122: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is also likely for the other genes listed above. The promoters of some of the heat shock protein gene family also contain GAGA binding sites (some of them remarkably long) and are also expected to be under GAGA factor regulation. GAGA is a sequence-specific transcription factor organized in several domains. At the N terminus there is a BTB/POZ domain (POZ), which is required for oligomerization (3.Espinás M.L.

In a central position, a single Zn2+ finger surrounded by three short basic regions conforms the DNA binding region (DBD)1 that specifically recognizes the GAGA binding sites (5.Pedone P.V. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Felsenfeld G. Omichinski J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 2822-2826Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6.Omichinski J.G. Pedone P.V. Felsenfeld G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). At the C terminus there is a glutamine-rich domain (herein referred as Q-domain), still without a defined function. It was speculated to be a transactivation domain because its composition resembles that of the glutamine-rich family of transactivation domains (7.Granok H. Leibovitch B.A. Shaffer C.D. Elgin S.C.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 238-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). More recently, however, functions on DNA distortion and protein multimerization have been attributed to the Q-domain (8.Agianian B. Leonard K. Bonte E. Van der Zandt H. Becker P.B. Tucker P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 527-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9.Wilkins R.C. Lis J.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). GAGA is encoded by the essential Trithorax-like(Trl) gene and is of maternal effect (1.Farkas G. Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H. Karch F. Nature. 1994; 371: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Expression ofTrl gives rise to at least two different proteins generated by alternative splicing. These two isoforms (GAGA519 and GAGA581) share the initial 381 residues and only diverge at the C terminus, where both proteins still present a similar glutamine-rich domain but of different lengths (10.Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At the genetic level, Trl mutants down-regulate the expression of homeotic genes, as for instance Ubx (1.Farkas G. Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H. Karch F. Nature. 1994; 371: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and some of the mutants display an enhancement in position effect variegation. On the other hand, transient transfection experiments demonstrated a stimulation of transcription only from reporters containing GAGA binding sitesin vivo (10.Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11.Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In vitro, GAGA was shown to stimulate transcription from several promoters only when bearing GAGA binding sites (12.Soeller W.C. Poole S.J. Kornberg T. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13.Read D. Nishigaki T. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4334-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the addition of GAGA to some fly embryo extracts did not result in an increase in transcriptional activity. This fact, along with the lack of net activation observed with hsp promoters, prompted the suggestion that GAGA was acting as an antirepressor (14.Kerrigan L.A. Croston G.E. Lira L.M. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 574-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Lee H.-S. Kraus K.H. Wolfer M.F. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). GAGA was also shown to have an effect in remodeling the chromatin structure of the hsp70, hsp26, and ftzpromoters (16.Okada M. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2455-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17.Lu Q. Wallrath L.L. Granok H. Elgin S.C.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 2802-2814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Tsukiyama T. Becker P.B. Wu C. Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). However, this nucleosome remodeling does not appear to be tightly associated to the presence of GAGA, since it can take place with Gal4BD alone on synthetic promoters carrying Gal4 binding sites. Moreover, if Gal4BD is fused to a transactivation domain, then stimulation can occur, thus separating both processes (19.Mizuguchi G. Tsukiyama T. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 141-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Here we report the biochemical characterization of the GAGA domains functional in transcription. Our results indicate that deletion of the glutamine-rich C-terminal domain (Q-domain) abolishes the transcriptional activity in vitro and in vivo. The Q-domain presents a modular structure in which the glutamine residues are dispensable for the stimulatory activity. The transcriptional activity of GAGA is reduced but not abolished by deletion of the POZ domain in vitro. Constructs for recombinant protein expression inEscherichia coli were cloned as His6-tagged fusions into pET14b expression vector (Novagen). Constructs expressing full-length GAGA, ΔPOZ, and DBDGAGA have been recently described (3.Espinás M.L. Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Canudas S. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J. Biol.

Construct pET14b-GAGA-ΔQ lacking the Q-rich C-terminal domain was obtained by inserting anNdeI-EcoRV fragment from the pET14b-GAGA into NdeI and BamHI (filled-in with Klenow enzyme) sites of pET14b. pET14b-GAGA-Δ3 was obtained by replacing theSfiI-HindIII fragment of pET14b-GAGA by theSfiI-HindIII fragment from pET14b-Gal4Q. pET14b-GAGA-Δ4 was constructed by inserting at the EcoRV site in the GAGA sequence a blunt-ended DNA fragment generated by polymerase chain reaction and spanning Pro-445 to Gln-519 residues of GAGA. pET14b-GAGAΔQ-VP16 was constructed by ligation of the VP16 transactivation domain obtained by polymerase chain reaction from pJL2 to the pET14b-GAGA-ΔQ. Gal4BD was subcloned into pET14b using a polymerase chain reaction. Gal4BD-Q was obtained by inserting an EcoRV-EcoRV fragment from pET14b-GAGA at the SmaI site of the pET14b-Gal4BD construct. Constructs Gal4BD-QΔ1, -QΔ2, -QΔ3, and -QΔ4 were obtained by polymerase chain reaction from the Gal4BD-Q construct and are described in Fig. 3 A. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pJL2 expressing Gal4-VP16 fusion was kindly provided by M. Carey and M. Ptashne (Harvard University). Constructs AdML50[180], (CT)22-AdML50[180], WT[180], and 8×Gal4-WT[180] have been previously described (20.Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Espinás M.L. Soliva R. Orozco M. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J.

Expression and purification of His6-tagged recombinant proteins was carried out in E. coli BL21(DE3) strains essentially as described before (20.Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Espinás M.L. Soliva R.

Ptashne M. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4746-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription assays using unfractionated HeLa cell nuclear extracts contained 30–50 μg of protein extract, variable amounts of recombinant proteins, and 200 ng of supercoiled DNA template. Templates used contained either a CT22 sequence or 8 Gal4 binding sites cloned immediately upstream of a minimal TATA box and fused to a G-less cassette. Reactions were in a final volume of 25 μl and contained 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm3′-O-methyl-GTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.4 mm ATP, 0.4 mm CTP, 20 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) adjusted to 1 μmwith cold UTP, 3 units of RNase T1, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 mm EGTA, 33 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9; nuclear extract was added up to 10 μl in D-buffer (0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9). Reactions were typically incubated for 60 min at 30 °C and terminated by SDS addition, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation as described before (23.Bernués J. Simmen K.A. Lewis J.D. Gunderson S.I. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3573-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the study of GAGA deletion mutants and since we observed some variability from experiment to experiment, all experiments were run alongside with GAGA titrations to correct for potential deviations. Drosophila embryo nuclear extracts (SNF) prepared as in Kamakaka et al. (24.Kamakaka R.T. Tyree C.M. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were a generous gift from Peter Becker (EMBL). In vitro transcription assays were performed as above except that reactions were allowed to proceed for 35 min at 26 °C. All the in vitro transcription results were quantified from the corresponding autoradiographs using a Molecular Dynamics laser microdensitometer. Drosophilaexpression plasmid Act5CPPA (kindly provided by G. Jiménez, Institut de Biologia Molecular de Barcelona (IBMB)) was used to subclone in its polylinker region GAGA, GAGA-ΔQ, GAGA-ΔPOZ, GAGAΔQ-VP16, Gal4BD, Gal4BD-Q, and Gal4BD-VP16 constructions reported above. To study the effects of the Gal4-fusions, reporters 5×Gal4-hsp70TATA-βgal and hsp70TATA-βgal were constructed by inserting either 5×Gal4 binding sites-hsp70 TATA box (derived from pUAST construct) and a hsp70 TATA box (derived from pWHL construct) in the pβgal-basic vector (CLONTECH), respectively. pUAST and pWHL were kindly provided by S. González (IBMB). To study the effects of GAGA mutants, fragments containing a d(GA·TC)22 sequence were inserted in both orientations in the hsp70 TATA box-βgal construct described above, giving rise to the plasmids named CT22-hsp70TATA-βgal and GA22-hsp70TATA-βgal. A cytomegalovirus-luciferase reporter plasmid was always used in co-transfection assays as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Drosophila S2 cells were grown in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and gentamycin. Cells were kept at 1–8 × 106 cells/ml. For transfection, 2–3 × 106 cells in 5 ml of medium were plated onto 6-cm diameter tissue culture dishes and allowed to stand for 24 h at 25 °C. Cells were then transfected using the calcium phosphate technique as described (25.Krasnow M.A. Saffman E.E. Kornfeld K. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1989; 57: 1031-1043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) using 0–10 μg of test constructs, 5 μg of reporter constructs, 7 μg of pUC19, and 0.5 μg of cytomegalovirus-luciferase construct. The final volume and the total amount of DNA was kept constant at 20 μg by the addition of the Act5PPA vector and water required in each case. After incubation with precipitates for 48 h at 25 °C, cells were lysed, and β-galactosidase activity was measured using the β-galactosidase gene reporter kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). As an internal control, luciferase activities were assayed using the luciferase activity assay kit (Promega). β-Galactosidase activities were corrected with respect to luciferase activities to normalize for transfection efficiency. The study of GAGA as a transcription factor was initially carried out in an heterologous system using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells in vitro. The rationale behind this was to avoid the presence of GAGA in crude fly embryo nuclear extracts. HeLa cells provided a convenient system because the general transcription machinery is rather conserved between human and Drosophilaand also because GAGA is not expected to exist in human cells. In fact, we have previously shown that there are no proteins in HeLa nuclear extracts that can either footprint or stimulate transcription from templates containing GAGA binding sites (3.Espinás M.L. Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Canudas S. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16461-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20.Jiménez-Garcı́a E.

With this approach we tested the activities of several deletion mutants, as outlined in Fig.1 A using a template DNA containing a G-less cassette fused to a promoter that contained a minimal TATA box (derived from the AdML promoter) and a d(CT)22 sequence, which acted as a GAGA binding sequence, inserted shortly upstream of the TATA box (at position −50 with respect to the transcription start site). All experiments were done by titrating the amount of recombinant protein added to a fixed amount of nuclear extract and template DNA. Maximal activation rates observed after normalization to recovery controls were considered. The maximal activation rates obtained with full-length GAGA (GAGA in Fig. 1,A and B) were around 15-fold with respect to the control, which was taken as 100% activation; all other numbers are referred to it and represent the average of at least three independent experiments. In the presence of high amounts of GAGA, a significant drop in transactivation was observed (Fig. 1 B, comparelanes 2–5 in the upper gel, and lanes 10–14 in the lower gel). With this approach we assayed the effect of GAGA mutants deleted in some domains. As controls, DBD(GAGA) and POZ(GAGA), which only retained the binding domain and a long version of the POZ domain, respectively, showed no activation at all (Fig. 1, A and B). Deletion of POZ domain generated a moderate reduction that resulted in a 76% of the maximal activity (Fig. 1, A and B,GAGA-ΔPOZ). A clear drop in transcription was also observed at amounts of GAGA-ΔPOZ higher than GAGA and may reflect squelching in both cases. Deletion of the Q-domain resulted in a much larger reduction but not a complete inactivation, and a residual 23% of maximal activity was obtained (Fig. 1, A andB, GAGA-ΔQ). DNase I footprinting analysis showed that GAGA and GAGA-ΔQ interact with similar intensity and identical specificity to the d(GA·TC)22 sequence, thus ruling out any potential impairment in its binding to the template DNA (results not shown). Therefore, the clear drop in activity can only be attributed to a lack in the transcriptional activity of the GAGA-ΔQ mutant. GAGA-ΔPOZ capabilities to bind the template DNA were previously studied and shown to be of the same specificity and affinity as intact GAGA (3.Espinás M.L. Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Canudas S. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16461-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). From these results, it can be concluded that Q-domain has a major contribution to the observed transcriptional activity. To study the contribution of the Q-domain independently of the other domains of GAGA protein, fusions to the Gal4 DNA binding domain were prepared. This approach also allowed us to determine whether Q was a separable domain that could transactivate from heterologous DNA binding sites, as characteristically described for classical transactivation domains (22.Chasman D.I. Leatherwood J. Carey M. Ptashne M. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4746-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar,26.Lin Y.-S. Carey M.F. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription experiments were carried out in HeLa cell nuclear extracts and used a template DNA containing a G-less cassette fused to an artificial promoter that contained a minimal artificial TATA box and eight tandemly repeated binding sites for Gal4 (inserted upstream of position −50). Reactions were performed as described under “Material and Methods” and are shown in Fig. 2. Gal4BD-Q showed a remarkably strong activity in these assays, reaching 20–25-fold activation from promoters containing Gal4 binding sites (Fig. 2 B,Gal4BD-Q, compare lanes 1 in all threepanels with lanes 8 in the upper andmiddle panels and lane 3 in the lower panel); there was no activation at all when the same promoter lacking the Gal4 binding sites was used (not shown). As a control Gal4BD (comprising residues 1–147) was titrated and showed a marginal activation as noted before (26.Lin Y.-S. Carey M.F. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained when Gal4BD-Q was assayed in aDrosophila embryonic nuclear extract using exactly the same template DNA (Fig. 2 C). Titration of recombinant Gal4BD-Q inDrosophila SNF extracts resulted in a ∼12-fold maximal increase in transcription (Fig. 2 C, lane 3). Gal4BD-VP16 used as a control stimulated transcription up to ∼38-fold (Fig. 2 C, lanes 7–9). In these extracts, however, titration of GAGA factor did not produce any increase in transcription rates (data not shown), in agreement with previously published results (14.Kerrigan L.A. Croston G.E. Lira L.M. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 574-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As it can be appreciated in Fig. 2 A, Q-domain can be roughly subdivided into three regions according to the presence of long runs of glutamine residues. Mutants -QΔ1 to -QΔ3 were generated by progressive deletion of the sequences between glutamine tracks as depicted in Fig. 2 A, and their transcriptional efficiencies were determined in transcription assays in vitro in HeLa nuclear extracts using the same template DNA containing Gal4 binding sequences. As above, quantification of the activity represents the average of at least three independent experiments and is referred to Gal4BD-Q maximal activity taken as 100%. The results showed that Gal4BD-QΔ3 mutant, which only retained 18 residues from the Q-rich domain and none of the long glutamine runs, was still remarkably active (60% of maximal). Shorter deletions (-QΔ2 and -QΔ1) showed increased levels of activity, suggesting that several regions in the Q-domain may contribute to stimulate transcription. This interpretation was further supported by the fact that the internal deletion of the 18 N-terminal residues of the Q-domain (-QΔ4) did not abolish transactivation but only reduced it to a 78% with respect to the entire Q-domain. Similar results were obtained when equivalent mutants in the GAGA context were assayed in HeLa nuclear extract using the template containing the d(CT)22 sequence described above. Fig.3 shows that in the GAGA context, deletion of most of the Q-domain except of the 18 N-terminal-most residues (GAGA-Δ3) still retained more than 50% of the maximal transcriptional activity, whereas the internal deletion of this 18-amino acid region (GAGA-Δ4) retained more than 85% maximal activation. Long glutamine runs do not seem to be directly required. All these results indicated that Q-domain is an independent, transportable transactivation domain with a modular architecture in which the different regions cooperate to reach maximal activity. GAGA was shown earlier to be able to stimulate transcriptionin vivo in transiently transfected Drosophila SL2 cells (10.Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11.Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here, the requirement of the Q-domain for this transcriptional activity was studied in vivo by transient transfection of constructs expressing Gal4BD-Q, GAGA, and GAGA-ΔQ proteins in SL2 cells. Initially, SL2 cells were transiently transfected with constructs expressing Gal4BD-Q, and Gal4BD-VP16 and Gal4BD as positive and negative controls, respectively, under the control of the constitutiveactin5 promoter, and their activities were assayed. The results showed (Fig. 4 A) that Gal4BD-Q stimulated transcription from the 5×Gal4-βgalactosidase reporter up to 8-fold (striped boxes), in good agreement with the in vitro results presented above. Gal4BD-VP16 reached up to ∼571-fold stimulation (cross-hatched boxes) and appeared as a really strong activator in vivo, as described (27.Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Gal4BD alone did not stimulate transcription at all (gray boxes). In a second set of experiments, GAGA and GAGA-ΔQ were similarly assayed using a β-galactosidase reporter bearing a (CT)22sequence just upstream of the minimal hsp70 promoter. In these experiments, a high background level, likely due to the presence of endogenous GAGA, was observed. The results showed that GAGA overexpression stimulated transcription up to ∼2-fold (Fig.4 B, striped boxes). This stimulatory effect is lower than the observed by Kornberg and co-workers (11.Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) but similar to the reported by Elgin and co-workers (10.Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In any case, GAGA-ΔQ did not stimulate transcription at all; instead, a repression of the background level was observed (Fig. 4 B, stippled boxes). As a control for this negative result, a construct expressing GAGAΔQ-VP16 was used and showed up to a ∼10-fold stimulation of transcription (Fig. 4 B, cross-hatched boxes). This result ruled out the possibility that the lack of activity of GAGA-ΔQ could be due to any incorrect intracellular localization, since the VP16 domain used did not include any nuclear localization signal. Additionally, these results also indicated that the folding of the GAGA-ΔQ moiety seemed to be correct in vivo. Finally, GAGA stimulation of transcription was dependent on the presence of GAGA binding sequences in the promoter and was insensitive to heat-shock treatment of the transfected cells (results not shown). All these results indicate that the transcription stimulatory activity of GAGA depends on the Q-domain, which can act independently of the rest of the protein in vitro and in vivo. From the knowledge accumulated to date, GAGA seems to be a multi-purpose factor that is involved in many different nuclear processes, including gene regulation, chromatin remodeling, and nuclear division (2.Bhat K.M. Farkas G. Karch F. Gyurkovics H. Gausz J. Schedl P. Development. 1996; 122: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GAGA is transcribed from the Trl gene into at least two different mRNAs generated by alternative splicing. They give rise to GAGA519 and GAGA581 forms, which only differ at the C-terminal domain. In both cases there is a glutamine-rich domain, but the exact composition and length are different. Initial studies showed that GAGA could stimulate transcription inDrosophila both in vitro and in vivo(11.Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12.Soeller W.C. Poole S.J. Kornberg T. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 14.Kerrigan L.A.

Science. 1991; 251: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that this stimulatory activity depends on the C-terminal Q-domain both in vitro andin vivo. On an empirical basis, we have defined Q-domain of GAGA519as comprising residues 426 to 519, since its deletion causes a major drop in the transcriptional activity of GAGA-ΔQ, and its fusion to the Gal4 binding domain results in an active chimeric protein in vitro and in vivo. GAGA-ΔQ shows a residual 23% of activity that might be due to the uncovering of a cryptic and weak transactivation region. A similar effect has been observed for example with the yeast Gal4 transcription factor (26.Lin Y.-S. Carey M.F. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 659-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). An extended C-terminal deletion up to residue 390 did not reduce it further (not shown). Deletion of the POZ domain has a relatively minor effect on transcription in vitro. POZ domain has been previously shown to be responsible for GAGA oligomerization in vitro (3.Espinás M.L. Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Canudas S. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16461-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 4.Katsani K.R. Hajibagueri M.A.N. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, GAGA-ΔPOZ binding to DNA was shown to be progressive and non-cooperative, as a result of its monomeric state, whereas GAGA bound cooperatively and was present in an oligomeric form. A reduced maximal activation of GAGA-ΔPOZ was also noticed in those experiments using different templates. These results were interpreted as a lack of cooperativity among the GAGA-ΔPOZ molecules, which could not properly reorganize the promoter and render a fully active complex (3.Espinás M.L. Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Canudas S. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16461-16469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 4.Katsani K.R. Hajibagueri M.A.N. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Q-domain has been shown to work independently of the rest of the GAGA protein, since it also works very efficiently in Gal4BD fusions. In this context, Q-domain has been dissected further and, resembling other classical transactivation domains like those of VP16 or Sp1, for instance, has been shown to possess an internal structure. We observe the presence of three different regions that seem to work synergistically, although none of them seems to be absolutely required. This is indicated by the results obtained with the deletion mutants. Those mutants were essentially designed to remove sequence blocks from glutamine run to glutamine run. In this way, Δ1 deleted the C-terminal Q-rich stretch, Δ2 deleted up to the central Q-rich stretch plus the G-run, and Δ3 deleted up to the most N-terminal Q-stretch, leaving a peptide only 18-residues long. All of them retained transactivation potentials ranging from 90 to 60%, respectively. Mutant Δ4, in which the 18-residue-long peptide was deleted while leaving intact the rest of the domain, showed the same transactivating potential as mutant Δ2 (around 75%). The conclusion is that the three regions seem to be functional on their own and work in synergy with each other. Remarkably, the two most relevant mutants, Δ2 and Δ4, showed a very similar behavior in the GAGA protein context, strongly suggesting that Q-domain also works, irrespective of the rest of the protein, as a transactivating domain in GAGA. Homopolymeric stretches of glutamines or prolines fused to Gal4BD can stimulate transcription when they include 10 or more uninterrupted residues (29.Gerber H.-P. Seipel K. Georgiev O. Höfferer M. Hug M. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Science. 1994; 263: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The results obtained with mutant Δ3 suggest that at least the glutamine runs do not seem to be the only activation motif in the Q-domain. In any case, an uninterrupted stretch of 7 glutamine residues (or 12 if we accept two interruptions) is the longest Q-run that can be found in the GAGA activation domain. For the sequence analysis, and as mentioned above, Q-domain was subdivided into three regions of unique sequence, proximal, intermediate, and distal, separated by glutamine runs. Sequence comparisons of these three regions by pairs detected very weak homologies. Similarly, none of those sequences seem to have any clear homologue in other glutamine-rich transcription factors (not shown). However, when the four GAGA factors reported so far (i.e. Drosophila melanogaster 519 and 581 andDrosophila virilis GAGA-A and -B) are compared, reasonably conserved homologies for distal and proximal regions appear but are less apparent for the intermediate region (Fig.5). In addition, homologies to the distal region always appear at the C-terminal part of the domain, whereas homologies to the proximal region always appear to the N-terminal part of the domain. This colinearity is lost for the intermediate region. All these GAGA proteins show a strong sequence conservation at the N-terminal portion, and although they differ at the glutamine-rich C-terminal domain, they also show a similar overall structure and composition (10.Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30.Lintermann K.-G. Roth G.E. King-Jones K. Korge G. Lehmann M. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The fact that the variable region has partially conserved the relevant motifs described above suggests that the other members of this group could also retain some transcriptional activation function. GAGA was put into question as a real activator because of its inability to stimulate transcription in Drosophila SNF extracts devoid of histone H1, whereas it could stimulate transcription when histone H1 was added back. This result, previously reported by Kadonaga and co-workers (14.Kerrigan L.A. Croston G.E. Lira L.M. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 574-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was considered to be the indication that GAGA was acting as an antirepressor rather than a true activator (14.Kerrigan L.A. Croston G.E. Lira L.M. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 574-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Histone H1 was identified in some crude extracts as the repressing factor GAGA was counteracting. The lack of GAGA activity in SNF-like extracts was then correlated with the absence of histone H1 in these extracts (14.Kerrigan L.A. Croston G.E. Lira L.M. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 574-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24.Kamakaka R.T. Tyree C.M. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28.Croston G.E. Kerrigan L.A. Lira L.M. Marshak D.R. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 251: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This antirepression activity was subsequently extended to Gal4BD-VP16 (31.Croston G.E. Laybourn P.J. Paranjape S.M. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2270-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and in general, it can be assumed that all activators have antirepressor activities. Here, we have used a HeLa crude nuclear extract that may contain some histone H1, and therefore, we cannot provide a definite answer to this question. Nevertheless, we have previously shown that the addition of plasmid DNA to compete for histone H1 binding did not reduce GAGA stimulation in HeLa extracts, suggesting that GAGA was not only acting as an antirepressor but also as a true activator (20.Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Espinás M.L. Soliva R. Orozco M. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24640-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In any case, our results clearly show that the stimulatory activity of GAGA depends on the Q-domain. In addition, in using SNF extract fromDrosophila embryos, we found that Gal4BD-Q could also stimulate transcription in vitro, whereas GAGA could not (not shown). Thus, it is conceivable that the lack of activity of added GAGA in these extracts may be due to some blockage of the Q or DNA binding domains by some factor(s) interacting with GAGA in regions other than Q-domain or to some factor(s) competing for binding to the same DNA sequences (e.g. endogenous GAGA). Some recent reports give support to possibilities other than the H1 repression mechanism and should be taken into consideration. In particular, theDrosophila gene pipsqueak encodes a POZ-domain-containing protein that is required in the oogenesis, is highly expressed in the early embryo, and binds GAGAG sequences with high specificity (32.Lehmann M. Siegmund T. Lintermann K.-G. Korge G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28504-28509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33.Horowitz H. Berg C.A. Development. 1996; 122: 1859-1871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of this factor in large amounts in the extracts may compete or at least interfere with GAGA activation. This possibility does not seem to exist in HeLa nuclear extracts, since we have not found any activity that could bind to GAGA sequences or transactivate reporters bearing GAGA binding sites (Ref. 20.Jiménez-Garcı́a E. Vaquero A. Espinás M.L. Soliva R. Orozco M. Bernués J. Azorı́n F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24640-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and results not shown). In summary, the properties described here seem to indicate that Q-domain acts as a bona fide transactivation domain in vitro because it (i) acts irrespective of the rest of the protein and is transportable, ii) presents an internal modular structure, and iii) is functional in SNF extracts in the form of Gal4BD-Q fusions. Additionally, GAGA appears to enhance transcription mainly by stimulating GTF recruitment and reinitiation, 2A. Vaquero, M. L. Espinás, F. Azorín, and J. Bernués, manuscript in preparation. further confirming its properties as a real transactivation factor. In vivo GAGA can stimulate transcription in SL2 cells (Refs.10.Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and 11.Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and this work) in a Q-domain-dependent manner. Deletion of the Q-domain abolishes activation, and even more transcription levels go below the background. This result can be explained by a down-regulation of the endogenous GAGA factor activity present in SL2 (as detected by Western blot analysis and also by comparing the activities of templates bearing and lacking GAGA binding sites, not shown). We have estimated that endogenous GAGA can transactivate templates containing GAGA binding sites ∼5–8-fold relative to the same ones without them (not shown). Thus, expression of GAGA-ΔQ reduced the total levels of activation, probably because it efficiently competes for binding to the GAGA sequences. The presence of the POZ domain may also permit the formation of mixed oligomers of both GAGA forms and, thus, contribute to reduce activation yields. These interpretations are supported in part by the fact that expression of a GAGA mutant in which the Q-domain was replaced by the VP16 transactivation domain stimulated transcription in vivo but to a much lesser extent than observed with Gal4BD-VP16. The activation levels obtained by GAGA overexpression in SL2 cells are modest (2-fold on the average) compared with the levels reported by Kornberg and co-workers (11.Soeller W.C. Oh C.E. Kornberg T.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7961-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) but are similar to the levels reported by Elgin and co-workers (10.Benyajati C. Mueller L. Xu N. Pappano M. Gao J. Mosammaparast M. Conklin D. Granok H. Craig C. Elgin S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3345-3353Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and significantly lower than obtained with Gal4BD-Q or Gal4BD-VP16. The reasons for the differences are not fully understood but might be related to differential responses due to the several promoters used (multimerized engrailed C site versussynthetic (CT)22 sequences) as recently pointed out (34.Pile L.A. Cartwright I.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1398-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). From all the accumulated data, GAGA appears to be a rather complex factor involved in a whole series of nuclear events. To carry out all their functions in the fly, GAGA will probably be under tight regulation by means of posttranslational modifications, association with other factors, etc. Here we have described its potential to stimulate transcription in a simple system. More work is required to define the exact contribution of GAGA in all the processes where it is involved and how it is regulated. We thank Dr. Peter Becker for a generous gift of SNF extract and for advice, and we thank all other members of our group for fruitful discussions and comments."

In the PTS, there is an initial cascade of phosphoryl transfers from phosphoenolpyruvate to sugar-specific permeases through a common pathway. Phosphoenolpyruvate transfers a phosphoryl group to an active site histidine (His-189 in Escherichia coli) of Enzyme I (EI, ∼63 kDa). The phosphoryl group is then transferred to an active site histidine (His-15 in E. coli) of HPr (9 kDa). The phosphoryl group associated with HPr is available for transfer to any available sugar-specific IIA protein. In addition, there is considerable evidence that the common proteins of the PTS (EI, HPr, and enzyme IIAGlc) function not only as phosphocarriers for sugar transport but also as regulatory factors. HPr functions as a regulatory subunit of the E. coli glycogen phosphorylase (GP, ∼92 kDa) complex, resulting in a stimulation of the enzyme activity when the subunit is in the dephospho-form (2.Seok Y.-J.

All three proteins have an effect on the spectrum of HPr: there is selective spectral line broadening from ∼20 Hz (for free HPr) to 28–56 Hz for Ala-19, Phe-48, Lys-49, and Gln-51 (GP > EIN > IIAGlc) and 23–29 Hz for Gln-3 and Glu-85 (for bound HPr) in the 1H dimension, and cross-peak shifts, indicative of specific protein-protein interactions (8.Garrett D.S.

Further, addition of GP to HPr leads to a global decrease in signal intensity and eventually to cross-peak disappearance at a molar ratio of 1:1, due to the formation of a large protein complex of ≥100 kDa. For IIAGlc or EIN, free and bound HPr are in fast exchange on the chemical shift time scale, and the largest chemical shift deviations were observed at a protein-protein molar ratio of 1:1 (Fig.1, b and c) with no significant change after further addition of either EIN or IIAGlc to HPr. To identify the interacting residues on HPr, the cross-peak combined1H and 15N chemical shift differences between the bound and free states of HPr, defined as δ = (δH2 + δN2)1/2, in Hz, are plotted as a function of the residue number (Fig. 2). In the presence of GP, the backbone amide resonances of residues Ala-19 and Gly-54 shift by ∼50 Hz while residues Ala-10, Gly-13, Ala-20, Thr-30, Thr-34, Ala-44, Ser-46, Lys-49, Gln-51, and Leu-55 display shifts of 25–40 Hz (Fig. 2 a). In addition, the lower field side-chain amide proton of Gln-51 shifts by 78 Hz. In the presence of enzyme IIAGlc, the backbone amide signals of residues Leu-14, Thr-16, Gln-21, Val-23, Phe-48, Lys-49, Leu-50, Gln-51, Gly-54, Leu-55, and Ala-82 shift by more than 100 Hz (Fig. 2 b). A similar shift perturbation pattern for HPr can be seen in Fig.2 c in the case of EIN, where the cross-peaks of residues His-15, Thr-16, Gln-21, Lys-24, Ser-43, Lys-49, Leu-50, Gln-51, Leu-55, and Ala-82 show chemical shift perturbations greater than 100 Hz. Further, at least one of the side-chain amide proton resonances of Asn-12, Gln-21, and Gln-51 of HPr is shifted by 50–490 Hz, suggesting their importance in interacting with both IIAGlc and EIN. Clearly, the residues of HPr most influenced by interaction with these proteins are very similar, although not identical. To visualize the interaction surface(s) on HPr, Fig.3 shows the chemical shift perturbations of HPr induced by GP, IIAGlc, and EIN mapped onto ribbon diagram (left) and accessible surface (right) representations of the three-dimensional structure of HPr. The color varies from blue (no chemical shift change) throughyellow (intermediate change) to red (maximum change). It is apparent that, in all three cases, the most perturbed residues are clustered in the three-dimensional structure, forming a contiguous surface composed of helix 1, helix 2, the C terminus of helix 3, and the loops between β-strand 1 and helix 1, β-strand 3 and helix 2, and helix 2 and β-strand 4. Whereas IIAGlcand EIN perturb the same narrow region on the surface of HPr, GP appears to interact with a somewhat wider region on the surface of HPr (Fig. 3, right-hand panels). The narrower HPr surface associated with the interactions with EIN and IIAGlc may be necessary for rapid on and off reactions required by the cascade for sugar transport. The wider surface associated with the GP interaction is consistent with the higher binding affinity (2–3 orders of magnitude) of HPr for GP than for either EIN or IIAGlc (2.Seok Y.-J. Sondej M.

Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4393-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The absence of any shifts in the IIAGlc 1H-15N correlation spectrum following addition of unlabeled GP (data not shown) agrees with previous “fishing” experiments, which identified HPr as the only ligand that interacts with GP (2.Seok Y.-J. Sondej M. Badawi P. Lewis M.S. Briggs M.C. Jaffe H. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26511-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Further, we found that addition of a 2-fold excess of GP to the 1:1 complex of15N-labeled IIAGlc and HPr leads to the restoration of the IIAGlc 1H-15N correlation spectrum to its free state and the disappearance of all the HPr signals because essentially all of the added HPr is bound to GP and is thus not available to interact with IIAGlc. This competition experiment provides further evidence that HPr uses a similar surface to interact with either IIAGlc or GP. Because HPr is present in excess in vivo, it is not likely that its interaction with GP influences its participation in the phosphoryl transfer cascade. In conclusion, we have characterized by NMR the interaction surface of HPr that binds to GP, IIAGlc, and EIN in E. coli. The important finding is that HPr utilizes a similar surface to interact with all three enzymes. The key interacting residues are located in helices 1 and 2 and the loops preceding helix 1 and following helix 2 (see Fig. 3). The mapped surface for HPr has been confirmed in the case of EIN by the structure of the HPr-EIN complex elucidated by NMR (9.Seok Y.-J. Lee B.R. Zhu P.-P. Peterkofsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and is consistent with mutagenesis data (2.Seok Y.-J. Sondej M. Badawi P. Lewis M.S. Briggs M.C. Jaffe H. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Further, there is no difference in the mapped surfaces on HPr contacting EIN (8.Garrett D.S. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4393-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) or EI (18.Van Nuland N.A.J. Boelens R. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), indicating that only the N-terminal region of EI is required for binding HPr. An important consequence of these data is that phosphotransfer in the phosphoryl transfer cascade is achieved by association and dissociation of bimolecular protein complexes rather than by formation of a ternary complex,i.e. the HPr-EI complex must dissociate in order for HPr to pass the phosphoryl group to IIAGlc. Because HPr uses a similar surface to interact with the mannitol-specific enzyme IIA (IIAMtl) from E. coli (15.Van Nuland N.A.J. Kroon G.J.A. Dijkstra K. Wolters G.K. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we conclude that phospho-HPr is equally competent to donate its phosphoryl group to various sugar-specific enzyme IIAs. The interaction surface of HPr with IIAGlc from Bacillus subtilis (14.Chen Y. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Fairbrother W.J Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) is remarkably similar, extending our conclusion to homologous proteins from other species. In other species, HPr performs additional functions (cofactor in catabolite repression in some Gram-positive organisms and substrate for an ATP-dependent kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 fromMycoplasma capricolum). NMR and mutagenesis studies in these systems suggest a similar surface on HPr for these interactions (16.Jones B.E. Dossonne V. Kuster E. Hillen W. Deutscher J. Klevit R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26530-26535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,19.Zhu, P. P., Herzberg, O., and Peterkofsky, A. Biochemistry 37, 11762–11770Google Scholar) as described above. Because the folding topology of HPr from different species has been demonstrated to be identical (3.Herzberg O. Klevit Z. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it appears that HPr uses a consensus surface to interact with proteins of the sugar transport cascade as well as proteins that it regulates.

The direct association of CED-4 with both CED-9 and pro-CED-3 was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assay in mammalian cells and in vitropull-down assays (4.Chinnaiyan A.M. Chaudhary D.

Furthermore, CED-4 was also shown to oligomerize and facilitate the proteolytic activation of CED-3 in mammalian cells (7.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M.

It has been proposed that the EGL-1 protein activates apoptosis by binding to and thereby negatively regulating CED-9 (9.Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The binding of EGL-1 to CED-9 was subsequently shown in the mammalian system to disrupt the association between CED-9 and CED-4 resulting in the CED-4-dependent activation of CED-3 (10.del Peso L.

By isolating mutations that transform the entire animal from one sex to the other, a group of genes that controls the sexual fate of C. elegans has been identified (11.Hodgkin J.

Biol. 1984; 105: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) are essential for male development. Loss-of-function mutations in any one of thefem genes prevent all aspects of male development and transform the animals that are genetically males into females (16.Doniach T. Hodgkin J. Dev.

The predicted product of the fem-1 gene is an intracellular protein that contains ankyrin repeats, which in many other proteins mediate specific protein-protein interaction (17.Spence A.M. Coulson A. Hodgkin J. Cell. 1990; 60: 981-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, despite the vital role of FEM-1 in sex determination, no biochemical function has yet been ascribed to the protein. A human homologue of FEM-1, called F1Aα or FEM1β (18.Chan S.L. Tan K.O.

Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), has recently been identified. F1Aα is pro-apoptotic and shares high homology with FEM-1 (18.Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The percentage identity between the two proteins ranges from 22 to 47% depending on the regions of the proteins that are compared (Fig. 1 A). The degree of homology between FEM-1 and F1Aα is comparable with that between several of the functionally conserved components of apoptosis in C. elegansand mammals. For example, the amino acid identity between CED-9 and Bcl-2 is 23% (20.Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) and that between CED-3 and caspase-3 is 34% (21.Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R.

In this study we evaluated the possible molecular functions of FEM-1 in apoptosis using a mammalian cell line as a model system.

Cell lines were grown according to the directions provided by suppliers. All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics (100 mg of streptomycin/ml and 100 IU of penicillin/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.). The peptide caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk1 was purchased from Enzyme System Products. cDNA for fem-1 was from Dr. Andrew Spence, University of Toronto, Canada; cDNAs forced-3, ced-4, and ced-9 were from Dr. Robert Horvitz, MIT. cDNA for apaf-1 andcaspase-8 were from Dr. Xiaodong Wang, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Dallas, TX and Dr. Marcus E. Peter, German Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany, respectively. Expression plasmids for CED-3C/S (CED-3C358S) (24.Shaham S. Reddien P.W. Davies B. Horvitz R. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1655-1671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), FEM-1, FEM-1-D320A, and FEM-1-D344A were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the TransformerTMSite-Directed Mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). DNA fragments for epitope-tagged constructs containing CED-3C/S, CED-4, CED-9, Apaf-1, FEM-1D320A, FEM-1D344A, FEM-1, and its deletion mutants were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification usingpfu polymerase (Stratagene). Appropriate restriction sites and epitope tags were included in the primers. Amplification products were inserted into the pXJ40 mammalian expression vector driven by the CMV promoter (25.Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5366-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All epitope tags are at the N termini. DNA fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction and the junctions of insertion were confirmed by sequencing. pEGFP-FEM-1 was constructed by releasing the BamI/KpnI fragment from pXJHAFEM-1 and inserting it into the BglII and KpnI sites of the pEGFPC1 vector (CLONTECH). Construction of the pXJHAF1Aα has been described (18.Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Catalytic domain of CED-3 with an N-terminal 6× His tag, His6-CED-3-(221–503), was expressed in E. coli from the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) and purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-agarose. FEM-1 and its mutants were [35S]methionine-labeled using the TnTTM T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 1–2 μl of the in vitro translated product was incubated with 20 μl of recombinant CED-3 enzyme at 30 °C for 2 h. For the control reactions, the in vitro translated products were mixed with 20 μl of Ni-NTA resin slurry that had been incubated with lysate from bacteria containing the expression vector alone. Mammalian cells at approximately 60–70% confluency were transfected with 2 μg of expression plasmids of FEM-1 or its mutants together with 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-Gal using LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.). At defined times after transfection, β-Gal positive cells were counted and the apoptotic cells were scored as described (18.Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells on glass coverslips at 70% confluency were transfected with pEGFP or pEGFP-FEM-1. 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 2 min with Hoescht 33342 dye (Molecular Probes Inc.) to enable nuclear staining. The cells were subsequently visualized using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. For expression constructs of GST fusion proteins, sequences encoding FEM-1 and F1Aα were excised from the respective pXJHA constructs asBamHI-KpnI fragments and cloned in-frame into GST fusion protein vector pGEX-TK4E. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding analyses were performed as described (18.Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding full-length FEM-1 or control vector together with pCMV-β-Gal as a marker for transfected cells. At 24 h post-transfection, a significant percentage of total β-galactosidase-positive (blue) cells co-transfected with FEM-1 became shrunken and rounded, displaying morphological features typical of cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig.1 B). Nuclear condensation, another hallmark of apoptosis, was also observed in cells expressing EGFP-FEM-1, a fusion protein of FEM-1 and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1 C). In the round cell apoptosis assay, extended incubation up to 30 h resulted in a progressive increase in the percentage of total blue cells that exhibited the round cell morphology (Fig. 1 D). Treatment with the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, ZVAD-fmk, abrogated the apoptotic activity of FEM-1 (Fig.1 D) suggesting that FEM-1 mediates apoptosis through caspase-dependent pathways in SH-SY5Y cells. Overexpression of F1Aα in SH-SY5Y cells yielded similar results (Fig.1 D). The apoptotic effect of FEM-1 overexpression is not restricted to SH-SY5Y cells as a similar degree of apoptosis was observed when the protein was overexpressed in L929 fibrosarcoma cells (data not shown). However, FEM-1 was unable to induce apoptosis in the breast carcinoma MCF-7 and NIH3T3 cells (data not shown) suggesting that the apoptotic function of FEM-1 may be cell type-dependent. We (18.Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and others (19.Ventura-Holman T. Maher J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have noted that F1Aα is a member of a gene family. It would be interesting to determine if other members of the F1A gene family may also have a role in apoptosis and whether this activity is cell type-dependent. F1Aα has been demonstrated to be a substrate of caspase-3 in vitro (18.Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the caspase-3 cleavage site in F1Aα, Asp-Asn-Ile-Asp342, is not completely conserved in FEM-1 in which the corresponding site is Ala-His-Thr-Asp344 (Fig.2 B), alternate caspase cleavage site(s) may be present in FEM-1. We tested the ability of theC. elegans caspase, CED-3, to cleave FEM-1 in vitro. Incubation of 35S-labeled FEM-1 with recombinant CED-3 generated a product of approximately 37 kDa (Fig.2 A). The estimated size of the full-length FEM-1 including the N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was 74 kDa; therefore, the cleavage might have occurred in the center of the protein generating two fragments of similar size. To facilitate the visualization of the cleavage products, a radiolabeled N-terminal deletion mutant of FEM-1, FEM-1-(44–656), was subjected to cleavage analysis. A 26-kDa and a 37-kDa fragment was generated (Fig.2 A) supporting the idea that CED-3 cleaved FEM-1 in the central region of the molecule. To determine the cleavage site, the aspartic acid (Asp) residue of two potential caspase cleavage sites (Fig. 2 B), Asp320 and Asp344 were independently mutated to alanine (Ala) in FEM-1. 35S-Labeled FEM-1 and its point mutants were then subjected to cleavage analyses. Whereas the D344A mutant was cleaved as efficiently as FEM-1, the D320A mutant appeared to be resistant to cleavage by CED-3 (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that CED-3 cleaves FEM-1 at Asp320. As FEM-1 was cleaved by CED-3, it was of interest to determine if the cleavage products would be as active as the wild type protein in mediating apoptosis. Overexpression of the N-terminal cleavage product, FEM-1-(1–320) induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig.3). The C-terminal fragment, FEM-1-(321–656), on the other hand, was apoptotically inactive (Fig.3). FEM-1-(1–320) appeared to be more potent in inducing apoptosis than the wild type protein as cell death could be observed at an earlier (18 h) time point when FEM-1-(1–320) was overexpressed (Fig.3). Similar to wild-type FEM-1, the apoptotic activity of FEM-1-(1–320) was inhibited by the caspase inhibitor, ZVAD-fmk (data not shown). Deletion of the C-terminal region up to the border of the ankyrin repeat cluster (FEM-1-(1–257)) rendered the molecule apoptotically inactive (Fig. 3) indicating that the region immediately distal to the ankyrin repeat cluster up to amino acid 320 is important for apoptotic activity. Deletion of the first 83 amino acids of FEM-1 as in FEM-1-(84–656), also abrogated the apoptotic activity of FEM-1 (Fig. 3). The lack of activity of the deletion mutants was not attributable to the lack of protein expression in SH-SY5Y cells. The wild type as well as the deletion mutants of FEM-1 were expressed at similar levels except for FEM-1-(1–320), which was expressed at a relatively low level (data not shown). These data suggest that the minimal effector domain of apoptosis resides in the N-terminal region of FEM-1 (amino acids 1–320). While overexpression of wild-type FEM-1 and the D344A mutant were able to induce apoptosis in SY5Y cells to a similar degree, the cleavage-resistant D320A mutant had no apoptotic activity (Fig. 3). As deletion analysis indicated that the effector domain for apoptosis resides in the N terminus of FEM-1, these results suggest that the C-terminal domain of FEM-1, similar to F1Aα, might serve a regulatory role in suppressing its intrinsic apoptotic activity. As in most physiological pathways, many cell death signaling molecules function by interacting with other proteins in the pathway. To investigate the possibility that FEM-1 may communicate with the core components of the cell death pathway through protein-protein interactions, co-immunoprecipitation analyses were performed. HA-tagged FEM-1 was co-expressed with Myc-tagged CED-3C/S, a catalytically inactive mutant of CED-3 (24.Shaham S. Reddien P.W. Davies B. Horvitz R. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1655-1671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CED-4, or CED-9 in 293T cells. HA-FEM-1 was immunoprecipitated, and the associated Myc-tagged proteins were detected with anti-Myc antibody. CED-4 but not CED-3C/S or CED-9 appeared to interact with FEM-1 (Fig.4 A, lanes 4,2, and 6). HA-FEM-1 also co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-CED-4 in the reciprocal experiment in which the Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated (data not shown). FEM-1 expressed as a GST fusion protein was able to specifically pull down in vitro translated 35S-labeled CED-4 (Fig.4 C) suggesting that the proteins were in direct physical contact. Parallel experiments were performed with F1Aα and Apaf-1, which are the mammalian homologues of FEM-1 and CED-4, respectively (18.Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J.

Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). As predicted, the HA-tagged F1Aα co-immunoprecipitated with the Myc-tagged Apaf-1 (Fig. 4 B, lane 8), and the association appeared to be direct since in vitro translated35S-labeled Apaf-1 was specifically pulled down by GST-F1Aα (Fig. 4 C). The association of CED-4 with FEM-1 in the cells raised the possibility that CED-4 might have a role in modulating the function of FEM-1 or vice versa. In SH-SY5Y cells, overexpression of FEM-1 induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent and saturable manner at a defined time point (data not shown). When the amount of FEM-1 expression plasmid was reduced from 2 to 0.5 μg, no significant apoptosis was observed at the 24-h time point (Fig. 4 D). Consistent with a previously reported observation (6.Wu D. Wallen H.D. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 275: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), overexpression of CED-4 itself did not induce apoptosis in mammalian cells (Fig. 4, D and E). However, CED-4 co-expression significantly enhanced FEM-1-mediated but not caspase-8-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 4 D). Furthermore, CED-4 increased the rate of FEM-1-mediated apoptosis (Fig.4 E), and the effect appeared to be specific because the rate of cell death induced by caspase-8 overexpression in these cells was unaffected by CED-4 co-expression (data not shown). The levels and kinetics of FEM-1 protein expression were not affected by CED-4 co-expression (data not shown) suggesting that CED-4 did not affect the turnover of FEM-1. Whether the effect of CED-4 on the apoptotic activity of FEM-1 depends on direct interaction between the two proteins remains to be investigated. The mammalian counterpart of CED-4, Apaf-1 (26.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar), which was non-apoptotic when overexpressed, was also able to potentiate the apoptotic activities of FEM-1 and F1Aα in SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). This result together with our previous observation that the dominant negative mutant of caspase-9 blocks F1Aα apoptotic activity (18.Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32461-32468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggest that F1Aα is in the Apaf-1-caspase-9 signaling pathway. A recent study has linked the sex determination pathway directly to the core machinery of cell death in the hermaphrodite-specific neurons of C. elegans (27.Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). TRA-1A, the terminal regulator in the C. elegans sex determination pathway, is found to repress the transcription of the cell death activator gene, egl-1, leading to the survival of hermaphrodite-specific neurons during hermaphrodite development. Since FEM-1 is a negative regulator of TRA-1A in the genetic pathway of sex determination, the question arises as to whether the observed apoptotic activity of FEM-1 in mammalian cells is mediated through a TRA-1A-like activity propagating a signal to the cell death pathway. However, tra-1 is known to be one of the most rapidly diverging genes when the homologues in C. elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae are compared (28.de Bono M. Hodgkin J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 587-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it is questionable whether a mammalian protein similar to TRA-1 exists. Our data suggest that FEM-1 is able to communicate directly with the signaling components that constitute the core cell death machinery inC. elegans. Despite its critical role in mediating the male phenotype, FEM-1 protein can be detected in the soma and germ cells of both sexes ofC. elegans throughout development and during adulthood (29.Gaudet J. VanderElst I. Spence A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1107-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that FEM-1 might be involved in apoptosis during sexual development as well as in other developmental and/or physiological pathways. We are grateful to Drs. Andrew M. Spence, Robert H. Horvitz, Xiaodong Wang, and Marcus E. Peter for generous supply of reagents. We thank Dr. Andrew M. Spence for critical reading of the manuscript."

Our results show that I-1 inhibits Glc7p holoenzymes that regulate transcription and mitosis, but holoenzymes responsible for meiosis and glycogen metabolism were unaffected. Additionally, we exploited a genetic screen for mutants that were dependent on I-1 to grow. This scheme can identify processes that are negatively regulated by Glc7p-catalyzed dephosphorylation. In this paper I-1-dependent gfa1 mutations were analyzed in detail. GFA1 encodes glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase. One or more phosphorylated proteins activate GFA1 transcription because the pheromone response and Pkc1p/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways positively regulate GFA1 transcription. Our findings show that an I-1-sensitive Glc7p holoenzyme reduces GFA1transcription. Therefore, GFA1 is a member of a growing list of genes that are negatively regulated by Glc7p dephosphorylation.

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PP1 is encoded by a single gene GLC7, and it has >80% identity at amino acid level with its mammalian counterparts (4.Feng Z.H. Wilson S.E. Peng Z.Y.

Most if not all intracellular PP1 exists in association with noncatalytic regulatory subunits (1.Cohen P Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar, 2.Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 3.Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). At least nine noncatalytic subunits have been identified in S. cerevisiae by molecular genetics (10.Stark M.J. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1647-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11.Tu J. Song W. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The holoenzymes pair the single PP1 catalytic subunit, Glc7p, with alternative noncatalytic subunits. Each Glc7p holoenzyme is likely to have distinctive functions in vivo. PP1 noncatalytic subunits dictate substrate dephosphorylation in part by controlling the subcellular localization of the holoenzyme. The traits of noncatalytic subunit mutations in S. cerevisiaehave provided preliminary evidence about the physiological processes regulated by each Glc7p holoenzyme. For example, the Glc7p/Gac1p holoenzyme regulates glycogen metabolism (12.François J.M. Thompson-Jaeger S. Skroch J. Zellenka U. Spevak W. Tatchell K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), Glc7p/Sds22p governs mitosis (13.Hisamoto N. Frederick D.L. Sugimoto K. Tatchell K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5939-5946Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All Glc7p noncatalytic subunits studied to date act positively because mutations in noncatalytic subunit genes mimic the traits of glc7 loss of function alleles. In mammalian cells, endogenous inhibitors, inhibitor-1 (I-1), DARPP-32, inhibitor-2, ribosomal protein, RIPP-1, and nuclear protein, NIPP-1 also regulate PP1 activity (15.Nimmo G.A. Cohen P. Eur. J.

Phosphorylation of threonine 35 in these inhibitors is critical since they are only functional inhibitors after phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (16.Hemmings H.C. Nairn A.C. Elliott J.I. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20369-20376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Huang F.L. Glinsmann W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Additionally, the N-terminal tetrapeptide sequence KIQF of these inhibitors is also required for PP1 inhibition (21.Aitken A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 147: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22.Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography data of the PP1 catalytic subunit bound to a regulatory subunit identified this tetrapeptide sequence as a recognition motif that is shared by many PP1-binding proteins (23.Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). To date, no negative regulators for Glc7p have been identified inS. cerevisiae. The yeast genome does not encode recognizable homologs to I-1, DARP-32, or NIPP-1. Moreover, Glc8p, which has sequence similarity to inhibitor-2, acts more like a positive regulator of Glc7p in S. cerevisiae (24.Cannon J.F. Clemens K.E. Morcos P.A. Nair B.M. Pearson J.L. Khalil M. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 215-236Google Scholar, 25.Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, Glc7p activity must be tightly regulated in yeast because great alterations are detrimental to cell viability. Depletion of Glc7p leads to arrest in the G1 or M-phase of the cell cycle (7.Hisamoto N. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3158-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25.Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26.Black S. Andrews P.D. Sneddon A.A. Stark M.J.R. Yeast. 1995; 11: 747-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of GLC7 causes hyperpolarized growth and cell death (25.Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 26.Black S. Andrews P.D. Sneddon A.A. Stark M.J.R. Yeast. 1995; 11: 747-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27.Zhang S.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Indeed I-1 inhibition is a defining criteria used to classify protein phosphatases as type 1 protein phosphatases (1.Cohen P Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar, 2.Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 3.Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Furthermore, I-1 interacts with Glc7p in vivo (29.Connor J.H. Quan H.Q. Ramaswamy N.T. Zhang L. Barik S. Zheng J. Cannon J.F. Lee E.Y.C. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27716-27724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the ability of human I-1 to inhibit yeast Glc7p holoenzymes in vivo. Since there are a number ofglc7 traits, some of which can be attributed to specific holoenzymes, these analyses surveyed the ability of I-1 to inhibit a spectrum of Glc7p holoenzymes. Our data indicate that I-1 can inhibit some but not all Glc7p holoenzymes. Finally, we isolated mutants that required I-1 expression to grow. We found that some gfa1mutants required I-1 or some other means of Glc7p inhibition to grow. A thorough analysis revealed that Glc7p activity inhibits transcription of GFA1. By inhibiting Glc7p activity, GFA1transcription increased sufficiently in the isolated gfa1mutants to overcome their glucosamine auxotrophy trait. Yeast strains CH1305 (MATα ade2 ade3 leu2 ura3 lys2 can1), JC746-9D (MATa ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 can1), and JC746 (MATa/MATα ura3/ura3 leu2/leu2 his3/his3 trp1/trp1 can1/can1) have been described previously (5.Cannon J.F.

Strains JC1085-18B (MATα ura3 his3 trp1 lys2::HIS3 ipl1-1) and JC1117-7D (MATa ura3 leu2 his3 trp1 ipl1-1) result from serial backcrosses of ipl1-1 strains (6.Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) to JC746-9D. Yeast were grown in rich YEP-glucose medium or synthetic medium supplemented with amino acids (31.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The alternative carbon sources, galactose, raffinose, or fructose, replaced glucose in some media at 2% (w/v). For scoring the colony-sectoring trait, low adenine synthetic medium was used that contained 6 μg of adenine per ml. For growing gfa1-97 and gfa1::URA3 strains, filter-sterilized d-glucosamine was added to rich or synthetic media at a final concentration between 1 and 5 mg/ml. YEP-glucose medium with increased osmolarity contained 0.8m sorbitol or 0.25 m NaCl. Escherichia coli DH5α (F′/endA1 hsdR17 supE recA1 gyrA relA1Δ(lacZYA argF) U169φ80dlacΔ(lacZ)M15) was used for recovering plasmids from yeast transformants and for DNA manipulations. Plasmids used in this work are summarized in Table I. Plasmid pJZ204 was constructed by transferring a KpnI-SalI I-1 fragment from plasmid pGEM3Zf-I-1 (22.Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) into theKpnI and SalI sites of pG-3 (32.Schena M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), placing I-1 under control of the GPD1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. The SalI-HindIII fragment from pJZ204 carrying a GPD1 promoter-driven I-1gene was further subcloned into pTSV30A, pRS316, and pRS426 to generate pJZ203, pJZ205, and pJZ206 respectively. Cloning the mutant I-1 (T35A) KpnI-SalI fragment from pGEM3Zf-I-1-T35A into the pG-3 vector generated plasmid pJZ207. The SalI-HindIII fragment carryingGPD1-driven I-1-T35A was further subcloned into pRS316 and pRS426 to make pJZ208 and pJZ209. Plasmid p2168 was constructed in several steps. It contains the truncated GLC7 gene from pA26 (9.Wek R.C. Cannon J.F. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell.

Strain CH1305 was transformed with pJZ203 (Table I) and used as the parent strain for the mutant hunt. These transformants were grown to mid-exponential phase (2 × 107 cells/ml) in leucine-deficient medium. Cell suspensions were diluted in water and plated on YEP-glucose plates at approximately 2,000 cells per plate. These cells were mutagenized with UV irradiation to approximately 10% survival and then incubated at 30 oC for 5–7 days to allow the development of red color (see “Results”). As expected, most colonies were white or sectored. Of 2 × 105colonies screened, 330 solid red colonies were identified. Each individual red colony was streaked for single colonies on YEP-glucose to ensure that it was uniformly non-sectoring. The 330 non-sectoring strains were further transformed with pJZ205, a pRS316 plasmid that expresses I-1 but lacks ADE3 (Table I). Transformants were selected on uracil-deficient, low adenine medium. We identified four mutants (JC1007-78,-97,-319, and -323) that formed sectoring pJZ205 transformant colonies. Plasmid pJZ501 was isolated from a YCp50 wild-type yeast library (33.Rose M.D. Novick P.

It complemented the I-1-dependent mutation in strain JC1007-97 based on the colony-sectoring trait. It was isolated twice from approximately 40,000 Ura+transformants. Additionally, YEp13 and YEp24 yeast genomic libraries (34.Nasmyth K.A. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2119-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 35.Carlson M. Botstein D. Cell. 1982; 28: 145-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) were used to transform JC1007-97 strain to isolate high copygfa1-97 suppressors. A DNA fragment containinggfa1::URA3 was generated by a polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers GFA1a (5′-AGG AAT AAC TGT ATT TCT TTT CTT ATA TAG TTA TCA GGG CCT GTG CGG TAT TTC ACA CCG) and GFA1b (5′-ATG GAA GTT CAA AAA TTA AAA GCG AAG GAG AAG TGA TTG TAG ATT GTA CTG AGA GTG CAC) and pRS316 template DNA. Each primer contains 20 3′ bases that flank the pRS316 URA3 gene. The 40 5′ bases of these primers have sequences proximal to the start and end of theGFA1 open reading frame. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was transformed into JC746-9D by selecting transformants on uracil-deficient medium supplemented with 2 mg ofd-glucosamine/ml. Desired transformants were recognized by their glucosamine auxotrophy and confirmed by Southern analysis. Thehxk2::URA3 mutation in p2341 was constructed by insertion of a 1-kilobase pair URA3 HindIII fragment into aHindIII site within HXK2 in a subclone of pBW112 (36.Walsh R.B. Kawasaki G. Fraenkel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 1002-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Correct integration of hxk2::URA3 in yeast transformants was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of yeast genomic DNA. Disruptions reg1::LEU2,reg2::URA3, and mig1::URA3were introduced into yeast by transformation with fragments from pBM1966, BS-reg2::URA3, or pJN41, respectively, as described (37.Ozcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Frederick D.L. Tatchell K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2922-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 39.Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2891-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by dye binding using a bovine serum albumin standard (Bio-Rad). Iodine staining was used for qualitative assessment of glycogen levels (5.Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Lillie S.H. Pringle J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1384-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dry weights and glycogen were assayed from three cultures derived from independent transformants as described (40.Lillie S.H. Pringle J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1384-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assay glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase, cell extracts in 60 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol were prepared by vortexing with glass beads at 4 oC. The assay mixture contained 15 mmd-fructose 6-phosphate (Sigma) and 15 mml-glutamine (Sigma) in extract buffer with 1–2.5 mg/ml protein extract. Incubation was started by addition of extract and terminated after 1 h at 37 oC by heating at 100 oC for 2 min. To measure the background ofd-glucosamine 6-phosphate and other interfering material, the reaction was stopped immediately after adding the extract. After cooling and centrifugation, d-glucosamine 6-phosphate was determined in the supernatant by a modified Morgan-Elson procedure (41.Ghosh S. Roseman S. Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 414-417Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using a d-glucosamine standard. d-Glucosamine 6-phosphate yields 85% of the absorbance obtained withd-glucosamine (41.Ghosh S. Roseman S. Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 414-417Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and this correction factor has been applied. To assay Glc7p protein phosphatase activity, yeast cell extracts were made in 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, at 4 oC and used immediately. Phosphorylase phosphatase activity was assayed using32P-phosphorylase in the presence of 3 nmokadaic acid as described (27.Zhang S. Guha S. Volkert F.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2037-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28.Cohen P. Schelling D.L. Stark M.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells were used to assay β-galactosidase as described (42.Yocum R.R. Hanley S. West R. Ptashne M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 4: 1985-1988Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All enzyme assays were done on cultures derived from three or more independent transformants. Two-tailed t tests were performed on data to determine statistical significance. Cells were grown in synthetic media with or without glucosamine. To determine the effect of growth phase on the level of Glc7p, samples from middle logarithmic to stationary phase were harvested, and crude protein extracts were prepared by vortexing with glass beads. Typically, 50 μg protein per lane was loaded and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% w/v acrylamide). The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% dehydrated skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (8 mg of NaCl, 0.2 mg of KCl, 1.44 mg of Na2HPO4, and 0.24 mg of KH2PO4 per ml, pH 7.4). Overnight incubation at 4 oC with anti-HA (1 μg/ml; 12CA5 Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (0.5 μg/ml, PGK, Molecular Probes), or anti-I-1 (22.Endo S. Zhou X. Connor J. Wang B. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) primary antibodies was followed by anti-mouse IgG-conjugated peroxidase (Cappel) secondary antibodies. Bands were finally visualized using luminol chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) and several exposures to XAR5 (Eastman Kodak Co.) film. Total yeast RNA was isolated, fractionated on formaldehyde-agarose gels, and hybridized with32P-labeled probes as described (31.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The GLC7probe was the 486-base pair EcoRI-SalI fragment from pKC886. The ACT1 probe was from the plasmid pYact1 (43.Ng R. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3912-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Human I-1 was expressed in yeast using the strong, constitutive GPD1promoter in various low and high copy vectors. I-1 inhibits yeast PP1in vivo (28.Cohen P. Schelling D.L. Stark M.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we failed to find any growth impairments, which would be expected if I-1 expression severely inhibited Glc7p activity. Anti-I-1 immunoblot analysis of I-1 yeast transformant proteins confirmed expression of the human I-1 protein (data not shown). Therefore, we compared the traits of strains transformed with I-1 expressing and control plasmids to learn whether any Glc7p holoenzymes were modulated by I-1 in vivo. The Gac1p/Glc7p holoenzyme promotes glycogen synthesis in yeast (12.François J.M. Thompson-Jaeger S. Skroch J. Zellenka U. Spevak W. Tatchell K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Null mutations in GAC1 or missense mutations inGLC7 greatly reduce glycogen accumulation (5.Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Stuart J.S. Frederick D.L. Varner C.M. Tatchell K. Mol. Cell.

Li L. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 57-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, glycogen accumulation provides an assay of the Gac1p/Glc7p holoenzyme in vivo activity. Yeast transformed with plasmids that express I-1 accumulated 20–26% less glycogen than control transformants (Fig. 1 A). However, this reduction was small compared with the greater than 95% reduction caused by some glc7 or gac1 mutations (12.François J.M. Thompson-Jaeger S. Skroch J. Zellenka U. Spevak W. Tatchell K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 46.Ramaswamy N.T. Li L. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 57-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was not statistically significant (p ≥ 0.18). These data indicate that the Gac1p/Glc7p holoenzyme activity is not significantly inhibited by I-1 in vivo. Glc7p regulates two essential functions in the mitotic cell cycle as follows: the G1- to S-phase transition and chromosome segregation (7.Hisamoto N. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3158-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24.Cannon J.F. Clemens K.E. Morcos P.A. Nair B.M. Pearson J.L. Khalil M. Adv.

The former function is poorly understood and has only been observed in pedigree analysis experiments (24.Cannon J.F. Clemens K.E. Morcos P.A. Nair B.M. Pearson J.L. Khalil M. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1995; 9: 215-236Google Scholar). However, chromosome segregation appears to require Glc7p activity to dephosphorylate the kinetochore protein Ndc10p (47.Sassoon I. Severin F.F. Andrews P.D. Taba M.R. Kaplan K.B. Ashford A.J. Stark M.J.R. Sorger P.K. Hyman A.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Ndc10p phosphorylation by protein kinase, Ipl1p, inhibits mitotic spindle attachment (48.Biggins S. Severin F.F. Bhalla N. Sassoon I. Hyman A.A. Murray A.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive lethal mutations inipl1 cause a ploidy increase that can be suppressed by inhibition of Glc7p activity (6.Francisco L. Wang W. Chan C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We found that I-1 expression suppressed the temperature-sensitive trait of ipl1-1 (Fig.1 C). The Sds22p/Glc7p is most likely the holoenzyme that modulates chromosome segregation because sds22 mutants arrest in the cell cycle in preanaphase (13.Hisamoto N. Frederick D.L. Sugimoto K. Tatchell K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3767-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14.MacKelvie S.H. Andrews P, D. Stark M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, theipl1-1 suppression by I-1 suggests that the Sds22p/Glc7p holoenzyme is inhibited by I-1 in vivo. Glc7p holoenzymes participate in at least three distinct steps during sporulation (46."

One of these naturally occurring HIV-1 LTRs contains an insertion termed the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) and exhibited high inducibility upon T cell activation. We found that the protein kinase mixed lineage kinase 3/src-homology 3 domain-containing proline-rich kinase, a specific activator of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK signaling pathway in T lymphocytes, induces high transcriptional activation of this promoter. Promoter inducibility is inhibited by the SAPK/JNK inhibitor, the JNK binding domain of the JNK interacting protein 1, and Tam-67 (N-terminal deletion mutant of c-Jun). In electrophoretic mobility shift assay, several protein complexes were found to bind to the MFNLP sequence in T cells. We identified AP-1 factors c-Fos and JunB as MFNLP-binding proteins, whose binding is abolished by introducing point mutations in the 3′-half of the MFNLP sequence. Introduction of these point mutations into the MFNLP containing HIV-1 LTR reducedsrc-homology 3 domain-containing proline-rich kinase -mediated transactivation. These data indicate that the AP-1-like binding site in the MFNLP sequence gives rise to a higher inducibility of natural HIV-LTRs by the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway.

The sequence in the 5′-HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) region is important for the transactivation and regulation of the HIV-1 gene expression (3.Okamoto T. Benter T. Josephs S.F. Sadaie M.R.

The interactions between different factors with the binding motifs on the 5′-LTR region determine the transactivation level of the HIV-1 promoters. Therefore mutations or insertions in the LTR region may modulate the transactivation and viral replication (12.Hauber J. Cullen B.R. J.

Analysis of 500 HIV-1 LTRs from 42 HIV-1-infected patients showed that 38% of the patients harbor a naturally occurring insertion, which is designated as the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) (16.Estable M.C. Bell B. Hirst M. Sadowski I. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6465-6474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Estable M.C. Bell B. Merzouki A. Montaner J.S. O'Shaughnessy M.V. Sadowski I.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4053-4062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The length of the MFNLP sequence can vary between 15 and 34 base pairs with a consensus sequence of 5′-ctacacagctgctACAAgaACTGCTGA-3′. It locates between positions −120 and −121 of the HIVXB2 sequence, which is upstream of the HIV-1 nuclear factor-κB binding motifs. Because the MFNLP sequence is not correlated with disease stage, CD4 count, or slope for interpatient or intrapatient MFNLP accumulation frequency, the function of the MFNLP sequence remains unclear. In addition, limited reports documented enhanced (13.Golub E.I. Li G.G. Volsky D.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3654-3660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), decreased (14.Koken S.E. van Wamel J.L. Goudsmit J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 4053-4062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, most recent results suggest that MFNLPs with a duplicated Ras-responsive binding factor-2cis element mediate a repressive effect on transcription in activated T cells and monocytes (16.Estable M.C. Bell B. Hirst M. Sadowski I. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6465-6474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Binding of extracellular signals to the cell surface receptors leads to the stimulation of different protein kinase cascades including the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (18.Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar), the stress-induced protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), and the p38 cascades (19.Kyriakis J.M.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade is strongly triggered by agonists such as growth factors and tumor-promoting phorbol esters but is rather weakly responsive to the stress inducers. On the contrary, the SAPK/JNK and p38 protein kinase cascades are more responsive to stress stimuli such as heat and osmotic shock, UV irradiation, DNA-damaging reagents, and proinflammatory cytokines (19.Kyriakis J.M.

One of the protein serine/threonine kinases that transactivates the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway is thesrc-homology 3 domain-containing proline-rich kinase (SPRK) (26.Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is also known as PTK-1 (27.Ezoe K. Lee S.T. Strunk K.M. Spritz R.A.

Transcription factors such as c-Jun, JunD, c-Fos, and ATF-2, which plays a key role in the modulation of HIV-1 gene expression, can be activated by SAPK/JNK. (33.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin.

To simulate these conditions, the T cell activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) is used to activate the Raf- mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-ERK signaling cascade, and when used in combination with ionomycin (ION), the JNK/SAPK and p38 pathways are additionally triggered. Our study demonstrates that MAPK signaling pathways are involved in the transactivation of naturally occurring HIV-1 LTRs from different stages of disease progression. HIV-1 promoter BT94t-B1 with a MFNLP insertion displays synergistic effects upon TPA/ION double stimulation, as well as high SPRK-mediated transactivation. We identified the MFNLP insertion between −121 and −120 of the HIV-1 LTR as a critical determinant of SPRK induction via AP-1 factor c-Fos and JunB containing AP-1 complexes.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we investigated the regulation of naturally occurring HIV-1 LTRs by MAPK signaling cascades. To date studies of transactivation of HIV-1 LTRs by stress pathways were merely focused on the level of JNK and p38 activation (43.Taher M.M. Baumgardner T. Dent P. Valerie K.

Med. 1997; 3: 339-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we focused on the mechanism of SPRK-induced transactivation; in particular, a naturally occurring HIV-1 promoter that contains a naturally occurring insertion named MFNLP. Using the extracellular stimuli TPA, ionomycin, and TPA plus ionomycin to mimic T cell activation leads to transcriptional activation of naturally occurring HIV-1 LTRs to different levels. In addition, the transactivation of naturally occurring HIV-1 LTRs can be partially inhibited by overexpression of intracellular dominant negative kinases such as ERK-B3, ERK-C3, and C4-HA or by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitors PD98059 and UO126 (data not shown). Interestingly, one of the naturally occurring HIV-1 promoters, BT94t-B1, displays a synergistic effect upon double stimulation by TPA/ION. Because the further opening of the (Ca2+) inonophore increases transcriptional activity, we analyzed stress-induced protein kinase cascades to see whether they have an additional effect. In this study, overexpression of SPRK, the specific inducer of SAPK/JNK signaling pathway in T cell (32.Hoffmeyer A. Avots A. Flory E. Weber C.K. Serfling E. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10112-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), transactivates HIV-1 promoters to different degrees. This result suggests that the SPRK-activated JNK signaling pathway in A3.01 T cells is involved in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression.In accordance with the high inducibility of HIV-1 promoter BT94t-B1 by TPA/ION, this promoter also displayed a much higher SPRK-mediated transcriptional activation in comparison with the wild type promoter NL4–3 as well as with other naturally occurring HIV-1 promoters employed in our study. BT94t-B1 contains a 20-base pair-long MFNLP insertion, which has been shown to be precisely located at position −121. No clinical or transcriptional phenotype that is common to all MFNLP LTRs has been found (16.Estable M.C. Bell B. Hirst M. Sadowski I. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6465-6474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although extensive studies have contributed to the identification of cellular transcriptional factors that bind to the 5′-LTR, the relevance of different factors to the HIV-1 replication remains unclear. Previous reports have documented the essential function of the LTR sequence for transcription and replication (17.Estable M.C. Bell B. Merzouki A. Montaner J.S. O'Shaughnessy M.V. Sadowski I.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4053-4062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Connor R.I. Ho D.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4400-4408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Connor R.I. Ho D.D. AIDS Res. Hum.

For instance, a 24-base pair insertion with a 5′-ACTGC-3′ motif upstream of nuclear factor-κB sites has been shown to be responsible for a 3-fold increase in replication and proviral 5′-LTR-driven transcription (13.Golub E.I. Li G.G. Volsky D.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3654-3660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This insertion was later on named as MFNLP by Estable et al. (17.Estable M.C. Bell B. Merzouki A. Montaner J.S. O'Shaughnessy M.V. Sadowski I.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4053-4062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different reports argued positive (13.Golub E.I. Li G.G. Volsky D.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3654-3660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), negative (14.Koken S.E. van Wamel J.L. Goudsmit J. Berkhout B. Geelen J.L. Virology. 1992; 191: 968-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15.Michael N.L. D'Arcy L. Ehrenberg P.K. Redfield R.R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3163-3174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or no effects on transcription (17.Estable M.C. Bell B. Merzouki A. Montaner J.S. O'Shaughnessy M.V. Sadowski I.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4053-4062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with the finding of Golub and co-workers (13.Golub E.I. Li G.G. Volsky D.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3654-3660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed a distinct stress-induced enhancement on transactivation of HIV-1 promoter BT94t-B1, which contains a natural MFNLP insertion.The activation of promoter BT94t-B1 by SPRK can be inhibited by overexpression of JBD and Tam-67, which indicates that JNK and AP-1 factors are the downstream substrates of SPRK in T cells. Tam-67 is an N-terminal deletion (Δ3–122) of c-Jun that lacks the major transactivation domain of c-Jun and inhibits c-Jun-mediated DNA binding (39.Rapp U.R. Troppmair J. Beck T. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3493-3498PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Tam-67 acts as a potent inhibitor of AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation and transformation. Therefore, we used Tam-67 to inhibit SPRK-induced AP-1 transactivation. JIP-1, a JNK interacting protein-1, contains an N-terminal JBD (50.Galcheva-Gargova Z. Konstantinov K.N. Wu I.H. Klier F.G. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1797-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). JIP-1 and JBD have been shown to be the specific inhibitors of JNK signaling, which act as an anchor to induce cytoplasmic retention of JNK (38.Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). However, because Tam-67 and JBD inhibited ∼50% of SPRK-induced transactivation of promoter BT94t-B1, other signaling pathways may also be involved. We observed up to 50% reduction of SPRK-induced BT94t-B1 activity by overexpression of inhibitor kinase Kβ (KD) (results not shown), a dominant negative kinase of the inhibitor κB protein that activates nuclear factor-κB through phosphorylation of inhibitor κB inhibitor proteins (51.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 52.Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 53.Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). Furthermore, co-expression of both JBD and inhibitor kinase Kβ (KD) further reduced the SPRK-induced BT94t-B1 activity up to 80% (results not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that SPRK activates different downstream substrates, which in turn leads to the transcriptional activation of HIV-1 promoter.Extracellular signals that activate ERK- and SAPK/JNK-dependent pathways have been shown to stimulate the transcription of c-fos and c-jun (54.Derijard B.

Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Five protein complexes in the A3.01 T cell nucleus were found to bind to the BT94t-B1-specific MFNLP sequence in the EMSA. One of the MFNLP binding complexes is identified to contain AP-1 factor c-Fos and JunB. Nevertheless, the formation of these complexes is not significantly influenced by applying different extracellular stimuli nor does the duration of stimulation affect complex formation. Besides, the competition of AP-1-specific oligonucleotides with the MFNLP sequence provides further evidence that AP-1 proteins are one of the factors that bind to the MFNLP sequence. We also revealed the strong competition between the serum-responsive element of the c-Fos promoter (SRE c-Fos) and the MFNLP sequence, but Anti-SRF antibody failed to supershift any of the protein-DNA complexes. SRE usually interacts with complexes consisting of SRF and a member of the ternary complex factor (TCF) family of transcription factors, such as Elk-1 and Sap-1 (61.Treisman R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar,62.Treisman R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 423-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Other factors from the TCF family, or those that induce TCF expression are probably involved in the formation of the protein complexes bound to the MFNLP sequence. Although c-Fos is not phosporylated by SAPK/JNKs but by FRK (a proline-directed MAPK, which is the only known to affect c-Fos activity) (63.Huang X.C. Deng T. Sumners C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 245-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 64.Lee J. Wang Z. Luoh S.M. Wood W.I. Scadden D.T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the SAPK/JNKs are capable of phosphorylating and activating TCF/Elk-1 and Sap-1. Different studies have provided the evidence of induction of c-fos expression through SAPK/JNK-mediated TCF/Elk-1 or Sap-1 phosphorylation. c-Fos regulation by the SAPK/JNK pathway occurs probably only via the phosphorylation of TCF/Elk-1 or Sap-1, which in turn leads to the induction of c-fos (35.Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H.

Increased production of the c-Fos protein is important for AP-1 activity because Jun/Fos heterodimers are more stable than Jun/Jun homodimers (71.Halazonetis T.D. Georgopoulos K. Greenberg M.E.

The HIV-1 promoter BT94t-B1-specific MFNLP insertion plays a critical role in SPRK-induced transactivation. Nevertheless the precise contribution of SPRK to the induction of HIV-1 LTRs is unknown because of the lack of knowledge about the upstream activator of SPRK. AP-1 factors c-Fos and JunB, together with other factors that form a stable complex on the MFNLP sequence, are involved in the regulatory events. The natural occurrence or selection of an insertion at a certain position in the LTR region implies a role of different insertions that are taken advantages of by the virus for its replication. Identification of JNK signaling in the regulation of HIV LTR and therefore potentially in the control of viral latency highlights these enzymes as molecular targets for the refinement of novel therapies of HIV disease. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 utilizes cellular proteins and transcriptional signals, which are used to regulate T cell functions for virus production (1.Stevenson M. Stanwick T.L. Dempsey M.P. Lamonica C.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 2.Gowda S.D. Stein B.S. Mohagheghpour N. Benike C.J. Engleman E.G. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 773-780PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence in the 5′-HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) region is important for the transactivation and regulation of the HIV-1 gene expression (3.Okamoto T. Benter T. Josephs S.F. Sadaie M.R. Wong-Staal F. Virology. 1990; 177: 606-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4.Tong-Starksen S.E. Luciw P.A. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It contains binding motifs for DNA binding factors, such as nuclear factor-κB, AP-1, and SP-1 (7.Reddy E.P. Dasgupta P. Pathobiology. 1992; 60: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8.Gaynor R. AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 9.Harrich D. Garcia J. Wu F. Mitsuyasu R.

The interactions between different factors with the binding motifs on the 5′-LTR region determine the transactivation level of the HIV-1 promoters. Therefore mutations or insertions in the LTR region may modulate the transactivation and viral replication (12.Hauber J. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 673-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Golub E.I. Li G.G. Volsky D.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3654-3660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Koken S.E. van Wamel J.L. Goudsmit J.

Virol. 1994; 68: 3163-3174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of 500 HIV-1 LTRs from 42 HIV-1-infected patients showed that 38% of the patients harbor a naturally occurring insertion, which is designated as the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) (16.Estable M.C. Bell B. Hirst M. Sadowski I. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6465-6474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Estable M.C. Bell B. Merzouki A. Montaner J.S. O'Shaughnessy M.V. Sadowski I.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4053-4062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The length of the MFNLP sequence can vary between 15 and 34 base pairs with a consensus sequence of 5′-ctacacagctgctACAAgaACTGCTGA-3′. It locates between positions −120 and −121 of the HIVXB2 sequence, which is upstream of the HIV-1 nuclear factor-κB binding motifs. Because the MFNLP sequence is not correlated with disease stage, CD4 count, or slope for interpatient or intrapatient MFNLP accumulation frequency, the function of the MFNLP sequence remains unclear. In addition, limited reports documented enhanced (13.Golub E.I. Li G.G. Volsky D.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3654-3660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), decreased (14.Koken S.E. van Wamel J.L. Goudsmit J.

Since the cloning of the first two subunits, α1 and β1, in 1987 (3.Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M. Ramachandran J. Reale V. Glencorse T.A.

Without structural information, it would be difficult to ascertain whether a deleterious mutation might act directly to alter an active site residue or indirectly through disruption of protein conformation. To overcome this shortcoming and allow insight into the structure and function relationship of GABAA receptors, a high expression system is of urgent importance. Previously, we have reported the overexpression of the Cys166–Leu296 segment of GABAAreceptor α1 subunit and the delineation of a structural domain within the segment (23.Xue H. Chu R. Hang J. Lee P. Zheng H. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24.Xue H. Hang J. Chu R. Xiao Y. Li H. Lee P. Zheng H. J. Mol.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and rosette-like quaternary structures (25.Xue H. Zheng H. Li H. Kitmitto A. Zhu H. Lee P. Holzenburg A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present study the properties of Cys166–Leu296 along with the Gln28–Arg248, Gln28–Arg276, Gln28–Leu296, and Gln28–Glu165 polypeptides were characterized with respect to ligand binding and protein folding. Site-directed mutagenesis was applied to the three residues Tyr187, Thr234, and Tyr237 (numbering of bovine precursor protein), previously identified to be important for ligand binding (16.Buhr A. Schaerer M.T. Baur R. Sigel E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17.Buhr A. Baur R. Malherbe P. Sigel E. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and to the two Trp residues Trp198and Trp273 in order to gain insight into the structure-function relationships of BZ binding. The cDNA clone, pCDM8-bα1, encoding bovine α1 subunit was a gift from Dr. A. N. Bateson of the University of Alberta. The plasmid pTrcHis was purchased from Invitrogen; diazepam and estazolam were from Wuhan Pharmaceutical Co., China; GABA and muscimol were from Sigma; and the fluorescent BZ ligand Bodipy-FL Ro-1986 (BFR) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. Ethyl ester of β-carboline-3-carboxylate (β-CCE) was a gift from Prof. Richard W. Olsen of UCLA. All subcloning and mutagenesis were performed with the PCR-based Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) with slight modifications in which Pfu DNA polymerase was used instead, and DpnI treatment was replaced by gel purification of linear PCR products. A 2.3-kilobase pair DNA containing the full-length cDNA (GenBankTM accession number X05717) encoding the mature peptide (Gln28–Gln456) of bovine GABAA receptor α1 subunit was subcloned from pCDM8-bα1 to pTrcHis for expression after removal of the upstream vector sequence excepting the mini-cistron with a pair of PCR primers (P1 and P2 in Table I). Based on this initial subclone more deletional and substitutional mutants were made using PCR primers designated in Table I. Silent base substitutions were incorporated into the primers (Table I) to optimize codon usage and introduce termination codons as appropriate.

Open table in a new tab Freshly transformedEscherichia coli cells of NovaBlue strain (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) were stored in 10% Me2SO aliquots at −80 °C. After induction of the growing culture with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside for 6 h (23.Xue H. Chu R. Hang J. Lee P. Zheng H. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the cells were harvested and washed once with 200 ml of solution A (50 mm Tris·Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5), lysed in 100 ml of solution B (50 mm Tris·Cl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, 250 μg/ml lysozyme) at 37 °C for 30 min, diluted with 100 ml of solution C (50 mm Tris·Cl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.5), homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax T25 homogenizer (Janke & Kunkel IKA-Labortechnik, Germany), and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of solution D (2% deoxycholic acid, 50 mm Tris·Cl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.5), re-homogenized, collected at 9,500 rpm × 30 min, washed with 100 ml of solution E (10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.5), and centrifuged at 9,500 rpm for 20 min. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 4 m urea (10 ml per g of pellet) prior to centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min and washed in 100 ml of solution E. The pellet was solubilized in 2% SDS, 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 12, and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR 26/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sample was eluted using a refolding buffer, containing 250 mm Arg, 100 mm Tris, and 1 mm EDTA, with 0.3 mml-cystine and 3 mml-cysteine added just before use, at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 10 mmTris·Cl, pH 9.0, for 3 days, with three buffer changes per day. Protein concentrations were determined photometrically (26.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar). The molecular weight and purity of proteins were estimated using 15% SDS-PAGE. The identities of recombinant proteins were confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Mass spectroscopic analyses were provided by Molecular Biology Resource Facility, University of Oklahoma Health Science Center, and N-terminal protein sequencing was by the Protein Service Laboratory, University of British Columbia. All CD spectra were obtained using a JUSCO J-720 spectropolarimeter at room temperature with a 0.1-cm path length cuvette for far-UV CD or 1-cm for near-UV CD. The protein samples were 0.1 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 9.0, for far-UV and 1 mg/ml for near-UV CD. Secondary structure contents were estimated from far-UV CD (27.Sreerama N. Woody R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar). All fluorescence measurements were performed at room temperature using a Perkin-Elmer model LS50B luminescence spectrometer. A stock of 1.65 mm BFR in Me2SO at −20 °C was diluted into buffer just before use. Protein solutions were mixed with 0.41 μm BFR in the cuvette, and 450–550 nm emission spectra at 5-nm slit were obtained at 280, 295, 340, or 490 nm excitation and 2.5-nm slit width. Light at 280 nm excited both BFR and protein intrinsic fluorophores, whereas light at 340 nm excited only BFR. This was utilized to correct for errors in BFR concentration and interference from protein scattering on fluorescence intensity. For this purpose, two sets of emission spectra, one with excitation wavelength of 280 nm and the other of 340 nm, were recorded in parallel. The ratio of respective fluorescence intensities, INT280/INT340, was used as an index of FRET; this was replaced by INT295/INT340 in the case of single Trp mutants. FA was measured at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm with a 10-nm slit and an emission wavelength of 511 nm with a 10-nm slit. For saturation experiments, 0.165 μm BFR in 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 9.0, was titrated with protein. At such a low BFR concentration, FA would be proportional to the concentration of ligand-receptor complex. Therefore, the fraction of bound ligand present at each titration point could be estimated from change in FA (ΔA) as a function of protein concentration after correction for fluorescence intensity difference between free and bound ligands (28.Wei A. Herron J.N. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 3372-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and was employed to calculate K d. The maximal FA increase (ΔA max) estimated from a nonlinear least square fitting of the saturation curve to a single-site binding model was Scatchard plotted as [bound]/[free] = [bound]/([protein] − [bound]) versus [bound] = [BFR]total × ΔA/ΔA max to yield theK d of ligand-receptor complex, where bound or free refers to fraction of receptor bound to ligand or free of ligand. For competitive inhibition assay, 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 9.0, containing 0.165 μm BFR and 10 μmCys166–Leu296 was titrated in turn with β-CCE, estazolam, diazepam, GABA, or muscimol solution amounting to less than 4% volume of the assay mixture and monitored by FA measurements. To measure FQ by BFR, single Trp mutant proteins of 1.5 μm in 10 mmTris·Cl, pH 9.0, was titrated with 1.65 mm BFR. The emission intensity at 342 nm with 7-nm slit was recorded at 295 nm excitation with 5-nm slit. The ratio of the initial fluorescence intensity versus the intensity at each titration point was plotted against the quencher concentration (29.Lehrer S.S. Leavis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). All subclones of GABAA receptor α1 subunit segments were successfully expressed. Under the current purification protocol, about 10 mg of purified product was obtained per liter of culture. The high level expression and the purity of the recovered recombinant proteins are demonstrated in Fig. 1. Secondary structure contents of recombinant receptor segments estimated from far-UV CD spectra are presented in Table II. The ratio β/α, the content of β-strand relative to α-helix, was calculated for Cys166–Leu296, and its point mutation variants were calculated for comparison. All the polypeptides formed not only stable β-rich secondary structure (Fig.2 A) but also ordered tertiary packing as evident from their near-UV CD spectra. As illustrated in Fig. 2 B, the CD spectrum of Gln28–Leu296 showed distinct signals around 270–295 nm characteristic of proteins with well packed aromatic side chains.Table IISecondary structures of and ligand binding by recombinant GABAAreceptor segmentsSegmentSecondary structures, contentsaSecondary structure contents were estimated from CD spectra of six independent runs by the computer program of Sreerama and Woody (27).

Data significantly different (p < 0.05) from corresponding values of Cys166–Leu296 are shown in boldface. Open table in a new tab The five overexpressed polypeptides, namely Gln28–Arg248, Gln28–Arg276, Gln28–Leu296, Gln28–Glu165, and Cys166–Leu296, were active in binding the fluorescent BZ ligand BFR. Analysis of the variation of FA of BFR with protein concentrations yielded the binding constantsK d for the five segments, which range from 1.96 to 9.97 μm (Fig. 3 Band Table II). Cys166–Leu296, the shortest segment among the five, was selected for further analysis. When BFR was excited at 490 nm, the λmax of its excitation spectrum and where no protein absorption occurred, its emission intensity was diminished by the addition of receptor protein (Fig.4 A). In addition, a red shift of the emission spectrum became evident. In comparison, no significant changes in BFR fluorescence emission were observed with the addition of the same concentration of lysozyme (14.30 kDa), which has a molecular weight similar to that of Cys166–Leu296 (14.83 kDa). Therefore the quenching caused by the receptor protein was not nonspecific protein effects. In contrast to the quenching observed with 490 nm excitation, the fluorescence intensity of BFR increased upon addition of receptor protein in a concentration-dependent manner when the excitation wavelength was set at 280 nm to excite both ligand fluorescence and intrinsic protein Trp fluorescence (Fig. 4 B). The phenomenon indicates that the energy released from protein fluorescence emission was transferred to the ligand. The hyperbolic increase of FRET index with protein concentration is shown in Fig. 3 A. To assess whether the binding of BFR to the receptor segment bore any resemblance to ligand binding to the BZ-binding site in the central nervous system, the effects of competing ligands were examined. The known high affinity central BZ site ligand β-CCE exerted a strong inhibitory effect on ΔA in the FA binding assay. Diazepam and estazolam, two BZ ligands with affinities lower than β-CCE, caused moderate inhibition, and the two non-BZ site ligands muscimol and GABA caused only very minor inhibition (Fig.5). Five point mutations were made on segment Cys166–Leu296 at three putative binding-site residues, Tyr187, Thr234, and Tyr237, and the two Trp residues, Trp198 and Trp273. Their effects on protein secondary structures were examined with far-UV CD (Fig. 2, C and D; TableII). Secondary structure content and the β/α ratio of each of the five-point mutants were compared with that of Cys166–Leu296 through statistical analyses by Student's t test for significance. Significant changes from the wild-type parameters (p < 0.05) are shown in bold face in Table II. Compared with wild-type Cys166–Leu296, the Y187A mutant showed an increase in β-sheets (p = 0.0197), a decrease in α-helix (p = 0.0091), and hence increased β/α ratio (p = 0.0087). This suggests that Tyr187 in the wild-type Cys166–Leu296 probably contributed to the maintenance of an α-helical structure that was likely converted into a more extended structure upon Ala substitution of the residue. T234A showed a decrease in β-sheets (p = 0.0068), an increase in α-helix (p = 0.0074), and a decreased β/α ratio (p = 0.0031), suggesting the possibility that Thr234 was involved in maintaining a β-stranded structure. Among the three “binding site” mutants, Y237A gave rise to the least change in secondary structures, which was mainly shown as a slight increase in the content of “Others” (p = 0.0089). The changes in α-helix and β-sheet contents caused by the two single Trp mutants were both insignificant (Fig. 2 D and Table II). Nevertheless, it was noticeable that W273Y mutation reduced the content of β-turn (p = 0.0073), which could be the consequence of the disruption of a β-turn structure in Cys166–Leu296 involving Trp273. The three mutants Y187A, T234A and Y237A retained both Trp residues but exhibited a reduced FRET (Fig. 3 A). They also bound BFR more weakly. Their K d values calculated from FA were 13.83, 8.38, and 10.27 μm, respectively (Fig.3 B and Table II). Compared with 4.85 μm for the wild-type Cys166–Leu296, these mutants caused statistically significant 2–3-fold reductions in binding affinity. The two single Trp mutants W198Y and W273Y diminished in FRET values, as the consequence of the removal of one of the intrinsic fluorophores. However, their BFR binding K d values of 5.97 and 4.77 μm obtained from FA were both not significantly different from that of Cys166–Leu296 judging from the t test (Fig. 3 D and Table II). The FRET was stronger for the W198Y mutant, which retained Trp273, than the W273Y mutant, which retained Trp198 instead (Fig.3 C), indicating that Trp273 was situated closer to the BZ-binding site than Trp198. The relative accessibility of the two Trp residues in Cys166–Leu296 by the ligand was also evaluated by quenching of Trp fluorescence by BFR. Addition of BFR caused decreases in protein intrinsic Trp fluorescence in both mutants (Fig.6). However, the fluorescence of Trp273 in the W198Y mutant was more severely quenched by BFR than that of Trp198 in W273Y, indicating that Trp273 was more accessible to the ligand than Trp198, in agreement with the FRET results. The overexpression of the Cys166–Leu296segment of GABAA receptor α1 subunit was previously found to generate a protein domain with stable folding and rich in β-structures (23.Xue H. Chu R. Hang J. Lee P. Zheng H. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 24.Xue H. Hang J. Chu R. Xiao Y. Li H. Lee P. Zheng H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the present study the three overlapping long segments obtained so far containing an extension to the N terminus, namely Gln28–Arg248, Gln28–Arg276, and Gln28–Leu296, also were all rich in β-strands, ranging from 45.7 to 51.9% (Table II). Segment Gln28–Arg248 would comprise the entire putative extracellular domain except for two amino acids, Gln28–Arg276 additionally almost the entire first transmembrane region, and Gln28–Leu296additionally almost the entire second transmembrane region (3.Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M. Ramachandran J. Reale V. Glencorse T.A. Seeberg P.H. Barnard E.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Since the three segments were identical at the N terminus portion up to Arg248, their differences in secondary structure contents resulted from differences at the C terminus portion. Dividing the longest protein Gln28–Leu296 into two gave rise to the shorter Gln28–Glu165 and Cys166–Leu296. The latter was more enriched than the former in β-strands, whereas the former contained more α-helix. These results were consistent with the secondary structure predictions reported earlier (24.Xue H. Hang J. Chu R. Xiao Y. Li H. Lee P. Zheng H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The higher α-helical content of Gln28–Arg276 than Gln28–Leu296 suggests that residues Glu277-Leu296, a part of the putative second transmembrane region, did not form an α-helical structure within segment Gln28–Leu296. However, it is not ruled out that these residues could participate in an α-helix within the full-length receptor. In this regard, these GABAA α1 N terminus segments resemble the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the prototype of the fast-acting ligand-gated ion channel receptor superfamily (30.Karlin A.
