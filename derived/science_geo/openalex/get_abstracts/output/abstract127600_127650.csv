https://openalex.org/W2082107925,"It is hypothesized that collective efficacy, defined as social cohesion among neighbors combined with their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good, is linked to reduced violence. This hypothesis was tested on a 1995 survey of 8782 residents of 343 neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois. Multilevel analyses showed that a measure of collective efficacy yields a high between-neighborhood reliability and is negatively associated with variations in violence, when individual-level characteristics, measurement error, and prior violence are controlled. Associations of concentrated disadvantage and residential instability with violence are largely mediated by collective efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2110132014,"Helicobacter pylori, strain 26695, has a circular genome of 1,667,867 base pairs and 1,590 predicted coding sequences. Sequence analysis indicates that H. pylori has well-developed systems for motility, for scavenging iron, and for DNA restriction and modification. Many putative adhesins, lipoproteins and other outer membrane proteins were identified, underscoring the potential complexity of host-pathogen interaction. Based on the large number of sequence-related genes encoding outer membrane proteins and the presence of homopolymeric tracts and dinucleotide repeats in coding sequences, H. pylori, like several other mucosal pathogens, probably uses recombination and slipped-strand mispairing within repeats as mechanisms for antigenic variation and adaptive evolution. Consistent with its restricted niche, H. pylori has a few regulatory networks, and a limited metabolic repertoire and biosynthetic capacity. Its survival in acid conditions depends, in part, on its ability to establish a positive inside-membrane potential in low pH."
https://openalex.org/W2085955270,"Recent evidence demonstrating multiple regions of human cerebral cortex activated by pain has prompted speculation about their individual contributions to this complex experience. To differentiate cortical areas involved in pain affect, hypnotic suggestions were used to alter selectively the unpleasantness of noxious stimuli, without changing the perceived intensity. Positron emission tomography revealed significant changes in pain-evoked activity within anterior cingulate cortex, consistent with the encoding of perceived unpleasantness, whereas primary somatosensory cortex activation was unaltered. These findings provide direct experimental evidence in humans linking frontal-lobe limbic activity with pain affect, as originally suggested by early clinical lesion studies."
https://openalex.org/W2079378073,"Catalytic protein subunits of telomerase from the ciliate Euplotes aediculatus and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain reverse transcriptase motifs. Here the homologous genes from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and human are identified. Disruption of the S. pombe gene resulted in telomere shortening and senescence, and expression of mRNA from the human gene correlated with telomerase activity in cell lines. Sequence comparisons placed the telomerase proteins in the reverse transcriptase family but revealed hallmarks that distinguish them from retroviral and retrotransposon relatives. Thus, the proposed telomerase catalytic subunits are phylogenetically conserved and represent a deep branch in the evolution of reverse transcriptases."
https://openalex.org/W1979520552,"Nuclear transcription factors of the NF-κB/Rel family are inhibited by IκB proteins, which inactivate NF-κB by trapping it in the cell cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of IκBs marks them out for destruction, thereby relieving their inhibitory effect on NF-κB. A cytokine-activated protein kinase complex, IKK (for IκB kinase), has now been purified that phosphorylates IκBs on the sites that trigger their degradation. A component of IKK was molecularly cloned and identified as a serine kinase. IKK turns out to be the long-sought-after protein kinase that mediates the critical regulatory step in NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2052722944,"A C. elegans neurosecretory signaling system regulates whether animals enter the reproductive life cycle or arrest development at the long-lived dauer diapause stage. daf-2, a key gene in the genetic pathway that mediates this endocrine signaling, encodes an insulin receptor family member. Decreases in DAF-2 signaling induce metabolic and developmental changes, as in mammalian metabolic control by the insulin receptor. Decreased DAF-2 signaling also causes an increase in life-span. Life-span regulation by insulin-like metabolic control is analogous to mammalian longevity enhancement induced by caloric restriction, suggesting a general link between metabolism, diapause, and longevity."
https://openalex.org/W2060128629,"Members of the recently recognized SRC-1 family of transcriptional coactivators interact with steroid hormone receptors to enhance ligand-dependent transcription. AIB1, a member of the SRC-1 family, was cloned during a search on the long arm of chromosome 20 for genes whose expression and copy number were elevated in human breast cancers. AIB1 amplification and overexpression were observed in four of five estrogen receptor-positive breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. Subsequent evaluation of 105 unselected specimens of primary breast cancer found AIB1 amplification in approximately 10 percent and high expression in 64 percent of the primary tumors analyzed. AIB1 protein interacted with estrogen receptors in a ligand-dependent fashion, and transfection of AIB1 resulted in enhancement of estrogen-dependent transcription. These observations identify AIB1 as a nuclear receptor coactivator whose altered expression may contribute to development of steroid-dependent cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2064216426,"Epoxides are versatile building blocks for organic synthesis. However, terminal epoxides are arguably the most important subclass of these compounds, and no general and practical method exists for their production in enantiomerically pure form. Terminal epoxides are available very inexpensively as racemic mixtures, and kinetic resolution is an attractive strategy for the production of optically active epoxides, given an economical and operationally simple method. Readily accessible synthetic catalysts (chiral cobalt-based salen complexes) have been used for the efficient asymmetric hydrolysis of terminal epoxides. This process uses water as the only reagent, no added solvent, and low loadings of a recyclable catalyst (&lt;0.5 mole percent), and it affords highly valuable terminal epoxides and 1,2-diols in high yield with high enantiomeric enrichment."
https://openalex.org/W2019955714,"The pineal hormone melatonin elicits two effects on the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN): acute neuronal inhibition and phase-shifting. Melatonin evokes its biological effects through G protein-coupled receptors. Since the Mel1a melatonin receptor may transduce the major neurobiological actions of melatonin in mammals, we examined whether it mediates both melatonin effects on SCN function by using mice with targeted disruption of the Mel1a receptor. The Mel1a receptor accounts for all detectable, high affinity melatonin binding in mouse brain. Functionally, this receptor is necessary for the acute inhibitory action of melatonin on the SCN. Melatonin-induced phase shifts, however, are only modestly altered in the receptor-deficient mice; pertussis toxin still blocks melatonin-induced phase shifts in Mel1a receptor-deficient mice. The other melatonin receptor subtype, the Mel1b receptor, is expressed in mouse SCN, implicating it in the phase-shifting response. The results provide a molecular basis for two distinct, mechanistically separable effects of melatonin on SCN physiology."
https://openalex.org/W1591639440,"Rab3 is a neuronal GTP-binding protein that regulates fusion of synaptic vesicles and is essential for long-term potentiation of hippocampal mossy fibre synapses. More than thirty Rab GTP-binding proteins are known to function in diverse membrane transport pathways, although their mechanisms of action are unclear. We have now identified a putative Rab3-effector protein called Rim. Rim is composed of an amino-terminal zinc-finger motif and carboxy-terminal PDZ and C2 domains. It binds only to GTP (but not to GDP)-complexed Rab3, and interacts with no other Rab protein tested. There is enrichment of Rab3 and Rim in neurons, where they have complementary distributions. Rab3 is found only on synaptic vesicles, whereas Rim is localized to presynaptic active zones in conventional synapses, and to presynaptic ribbons in ribbon synapses. Transfection of PC12 cells with the amino-terminal domains of Rim greatly enhances regulated exocytosis in a Rab3-dependent manner. We propose that Rim serves as a Rab3-dependent regulator of synaptic-vesicle fusion by forming a GTP-dependent complex between synaptic plasma membranes and docked synaptic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2040711587,"The epithelium that lines the gut is impermeable to macromolecules and microorganisms, except in Peyer's patches (PPs), where the lymphoid follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) contains M cells that transport antigens and microorganisms. A cultured system that reproduces the main characteristics of FAE and M cells was established by cultivation of PP lymphocytes with the differentiated human intestinal cell line Caco-2. Lymphocytes settled into the epithelial monolayer, inducing reorganization of the brush border and a temperature-dependent transport of particles and Vibrio cholerae . This model system could prove useful for intestinal physiology, vaccine research, and drug delivery studies."
https://openalex.org/W2005578607,"Remyelination occurs in demyelinated CNS regions in diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Identification of the cell type(s) responsible for this remyelination, however, has been elusive. Here, we examine one potential source of remyelinating oligodendrocytes—immature, cycling cells endogenous to adult white matter—and demonstrate that this population responds to demyelination by differentiating into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Dividing cells in subcortical white matter of adult rats were labeled by stereotactic injection of a replication-deficient lacZ-encoding retrovirus (BAG). Following a focal demyelination induced with lysolecithin, many of the BAG-labeled cells differentiated into myelinating oligodendrocytes engaging in repair of the lesion. Identification of endogenous cells capable of remyelination provides a target for the study of CNS repair processes in demyelinating diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2015038624,"The striatum has a central role in many neurobiological processes, yet little is known about the molecular control of its development. Inroads to this subject have been made, due to the discovery of transcription factors, such as the Dlx genes, whose expression patterns suggest that they have a role in striatal development. We report that mice lacking both Dlx-1 and Dlx-2 have a time-dependent block in striatal differentiation. In these mutants, early born neurons migrate into a striatum-like region, which is enriched for markers of the striosome (patch) compartment. However, later born neurons accumulate within the proliferative zone. Several lines of evidence suggest that mutations in Dlx-1 and Dlx-2 produce abnormalities in the development of the striatal subventricular zone and in the differentiation of striatal matrix neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1660332899,"Repressive chromatin structures need to be unravelled to allow DNA-binding proteins access to their target sequences. This de-repression constitutes an important point at which transcription and presumably other nuclear processes can be regulated. Energy-consuming enzyme complexes that facilitate the interaction of transcription factors with chromatin by modifying nucleosome structure are involved in this regulation. One such factor, nucleosome-remodelling factor (NURF), has been isolated from Drosophila embryo extracts. We have now identified a chromatin-accessibility complex (CHRAC) which uses energy to increase the general accessibility of DNA in chromatin. However, unlike other known chromatin remodelling factors, CHRAC can also function during chromatin assembly: it uses ATP to convert irregular chromatin into a regular array of nucleosomes with even spacing. CHRAC combines enzymes that modulate nucleosome structure and DNA topology. Using mass spectrometry, we identified two of the five CHRAC subunits as the ATPase ISWI, which is also part of NURF, and topoisomerase II. The presence of ISWI in different contexts suggests that chromatin remodelling machines have a modular nature and that ISWI has a central role in different chromatin remodelling reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2169653175,"The cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel is a textbook example of an ion channel regulated by protein phosphorylation; however, the molecular events that underlie its regulation remain unknown. Here, we report that in transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing L-type channels, elevations in cAMP resulted in phosphorylation of the α1C and β2a channel subunits and increases in channel activity. Channel phosphorylation and regulation were facilitated by submembrane targeting of protein kinase A (PKA), through association with an A-kinase anchoring protein called AKAP79. In transfected cells expressing a mutant AKAP79 that is unable to bind PKA, phosphorylation of the α1C subunit and regulation of channel activity were not observed. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the association of an AKAP with PKA was required for β-adrenergic receptor-mediated regulation of L-type channels in native cardiac myocytes, illustrating that the events observed in the heterologous expression system reflect those occurring in the native system. Mutation of Ser1928 to alanine in the C-terminus of the α1C subunit resulted in a complete loss of cAMP-mediated phosphorylation and a loss of channel regulation. Thus, the PKA-mediated regulation of L-type Ca2+ channels is critically dependent on a functional AKAP and phosphorylation of the α1C subunit at Ser1928."
https://openalex.org/W2128420761,"Voltage-activated K+ channels are integral membrane proteins that open or close a K+-selective pore in response to changes in transmembrane voltage. Although the S4 region of these channels has been implicated as the voltage sensor, little is known about how opening and closing of the pore is accomplished. We explored the gating process by introducing cysteines at various positions thought to lie in or near the pore of the Shaker K+ channel, and by testing their ability to be chemically modified. We found a series of positions in the S6 transmembrane region that react rapidly with water-soluble thiol reagents in the open state but not the closed state. An open-channel blocker can protect several of these cysteines, showing that they lie in the ion-conducting pore. At two of these sites, Cd2+ ions bind to the cysteines without affecting the energetics of gating; at a third site, Cd2+ binding holds the channel open. The results suggest that these channels open and close by the movement of an intracellular gate, distinct from the selectivity filter, that regulates access to the pore."
https://openalex.org/W1817985333,"Dopamine receptors have been implicated in the behavioural response to drugs of abuse. These responses are mediated particularly by the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway arising in the ventral tegmental area and projecting to the limbic system. The rewarding properties of opiates and the somatic expression of morphine abstinence have been related to changes in mesolimbic dopaminergic activity that could constitute the neural substrate for opioid addiction. These adaptive responses to repeated morphine administration have been investigated in mice with a genetic disruption of the dopaminergic D2 receptors. Although the behavioural expression of morphine withdrawal was unchanged in these mice, a total suppression of morphine rewarding properties was observed in a place-preference test. This effect is specific to the drug, as mice lacking D2 receptors behaved the same as wild-type mice when food is used as reward. We conclude that the D2 receptor plays a crucial role in the motivational component of drug addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2054278011,"Dopamine secreted from hypophysial hypothalamic neurons is a principal inhibitory regulator of pituitary hormone secretion. Mice with a disrupted D2 dopamine receptor gene had chronic hyperprolactinemia and developed anterior lobe lactotroph hyperplasia without evidence of adenomatous transformation. Unexpectedly, the mutant mice had no hyperplasia of the intermediate lobe melanotrophs. Aged female D2 receptor -/- mice developed uterine adenomyosis in response to prolonged prolactin exposure. These data reveal a critical role of hypothalamic dopamine in controlling pituitary growth and support a multistep mechanism for the induction and perpetuation of lactotroph hyperplasia, involving the lack of dopamine signaling, a low androgen/estrogen ratio, and a final autocrine or paracrine ""feed-forward"" stimulation of mitogenesis, probably by prolactin itself."
https://openalex.org/W2124005257,"The effects of the psychotomimetic drug phencyclidine on the neurochemistry and function of the prefrontal cortex in vervet monkeys were investigated. Monkeys treated with phencyclidine twice a day for 14 days displayed performance deficits on a task that was sensitive to prefrontal cortex function; the deficits were ameliorated by the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine. Repeated exposure to phencyclidine caused a reduction in both basal and evoked dopamine utilization in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a brain region that has long been associated with cognitive function. Behavioral deficits and decreased dopamine utilization remained after phencyclidine treatment was stopped, an indication that these effects were not simply due to direct drug effects. The data suggest that repeated administration of phencyclidine in monkeys may be useful for studying psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction and dopamine hypofunction in the prefrontal cortex, particularly schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W1655746131,"Human lesion data indicate that an intact left hippocampal formation is necessary for auditory-verbal memory. By contrast, functional neuroimaging has highlighted the role of the left prefrontal cortex but has generally failed to reveal the predicted left hippocampal activation. Here we describe an experiment involving learning category-exemplar word pairs (such as 'dog...boxer') in which we manipulate the novelty of either individual elements or the entire category-exemplar pairing. We demonstrate both left medial temporal (including hippocampal) and left prefrontal activation and show that these activations are dissociable with respect to encoding demands. Left prefrontal activation is maximal with a change in category-exemplar pairings, whereas medial temporal activation is sensitive to the overall degree of novelty. Thus, left prefrontal cortex is sensitive to processes required to establish meaningful connections between a category and its exemplar, a process maximized when a previously formed connection is changed. Conversely, the left medial temporal activation reflects processes that register the overall novelty of the presented material. Our results provide striking evidence of functionally dissociable roles for the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal formation during learning of auditory-verbal material."
https://openalex.org/W2073382375,"The migration of neuronal precursors along radial glial fibers is a critical step in the formation of the nervous system. In this report, we show that neuregulin-erbB receptor signaling plays a crucial role in the migration of cerebellar granule cells along radial glial fibers. Granule cells express neuregulin (NRG), and radial glia cells express erbB4 in the developing cerebellum and in vitro. When the glial erbB receptors are blocked, neurons fail to induce radial glia formation, and their migration along radial glial fibers is impaired. Moreover, soluble NRG is as effective as neuron-glia contact in the induction of radial glia formation. These results suggest that the activation of glial erbB4 by NRG is an early critical step in the neuronal migration program."
https://openalex.org/W1483422351,"Repetitive activation of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system results in a long-lasting increase in synaptic transmission called long-term potentiation (LTP). It is generally believed that this synaptic plasticity may underlie certain forms of learning and memory. LTP at most synapses involves the activation of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) subtype of glutamate receptor, but LTP at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses is independent of NMDA receptors and has a component that is induced and expressed presynaptically. It appears to be triggered by a rise in presynaptic Ca2+, and requires the activation of protein kinase A, which leads to an increased release of glutamate. A great deal is known about the biochemical steps involved in the vesicular release of transmitter, but none of these steps has been directly implicated in long-term synaptic plasticity. Here we show that, although a variety of short-term plasticities are normal, LTP at mossy fibre synapses is abolished in mice lacking the synaptic vesicle protein Rab3A."
https://openalex.org/W2038702076,"We have examined the hypothesis that the segregation of LGN axon terminals into ocular dominance (OD) patches in layer 4 of the visual cortex requires neurotrophins, acting as signals to modulate the pattern of synaptic connectivity. Neurotrophin receptor antagonists, composed of the extracellular domain of each member of the trk family of neurotrophin receptors fused to a human Fc domain, were infused directly into visual cortex during the peak phase of OD column formation. Infusion of trkB–IgG, which binds BDNF and NT-4/5, inhibited the formation of OD patches within layer 4, while trkA–IgG and trkC–IgG, which preferentially bind NGF and NT-3, respectively, had no effect. The autoradiographic labeling of LGN terminals in cortical layer 4 was reduced by trkB–IgG, in contrast with the increased labeling observed following NT-4/5 infusion. These data suggest that an endogenous ligand of trkB, normally present in limiting amounts within visual cortex, is necessary for the selective growth and remodeling of LGN axons into eye-specific patches."

[35S]methionine-labeled proteins (PKCθFL, PKCθFL(D-A), PARP) were synthesized by coupled transcription and translation reactions (Promega, Madison, WI). Labeled proteins were incubated with 5 μg/ml Escherichia coli-derived Caspase-3β, Caspase-1, Caspase-2, Caspase-4, Caspase-6, or Caspase-7 in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.25 mm EDTA at room temperature for 30 min (16Bump N.J.

The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then autoradiography. Recombinant PKCθ proteins were prepared by coupled transcription and translation. A vector expressing a PKCθ fragment (CF; amino acids 355–706) was generated by polymerase chain reaction cloning from the full-length PKCθ cDNA. A mutant PKCθCF with Lys-409 substituted by Arg (K-R) was generated by overlapping primer extension. Protein kinase assays were performed as described (PKC assay kit; Life Technologies, Inc.). PKCθFL, PKCθCF, or PKCθCF(K-R) were cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH). HeLa cells were suspended at a density of 1 × 107cells/ml and transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulsar, Bio-Rad; 0.22 V, 960 μF). At 40 h post-transfection, cells were sorted by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mansfield, MA), and viability was checked by trypan blue exclusion. Transfected cells were stained with propidium iodide. FACScan was used to determine sub-G1 content in cells positive for green fluorescence. Chromatin fragmentation was determined by staining methanol-fixed cells with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).

Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar), we asked whether PKCθ is also susceptible to cleavage. PKCθ was detectable as a 78-kDa band in control cells (Fig.1 A). By contrast, ara-C-induced apoptosis was associated with cleavage of PKCθ to a 40-kDa fragment (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained during apoptosis induced by cisplatinum, etoposide, and 20-gray ionizing radiation (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). To determine whether PKCθ cleavage is associated with induction of apoptosis, we studied cells that overexpress the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein and exhibit resistance to induction of apoptosis (13Datta R.

Exposure of control U-937/neo cells to ara-C resulted in cleavage of PKCθ, while there was no apparent effect of this agent on PKCθ in the U-937/Bcl-xL transfectant (Fig.2 A).

Overexpression of CrmA had no effect on ara-C-induced PKCθ cleavage or apoptosis (Fig. 2 B). By contrast, ara-C treatment of cells that overexpress p35 resulted in no detectable cleavage of PKCθ or induction of apoptosis (Fig.2 B). These findings indicated that PKCθ is cleaved by an ICE/Ced-3-like protease. The Caspase-3 protease is insensitive to CrmA and inhibited by p35 (14Datta R. Kojima H. Banach D. Bump N.J. Talanian R.V.

Full-length PKCθ labeled with [35S]methionine was cleaved by purified Caspase-3 to a 40-kDa fragment (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, there was no apparent cleavage of PKCθ with purified ICE (Fig. 3 A). Cleavage of PKCθ at the DEVD/K site predicts the formation of a catalytic domain of 40 kDa that corresponds physically with the PKCθ fragment identified in apoptotic U-937 cells. Nonetheless, to confirm the Caspase-3-mediated cleavage site in PKCθ, we mutated the essential P1 and P4 Asp residues with substitution by Ala (D351A and D354A). The finding that Caspase-3 fails to cleave the PKCθ(D-A) mutant provided support for involvement of the DEVD354/K site (Fig. 3 A). Caspase-3, Caspase-7, and Ced-3 cleave PARP at the DEVD216/G site (22Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A.

The finding that PKCθ is cleaved by Caspase-3, and not Caspase-7, provided support for selectivity of the PKCθ cleavage site (Fig. 3 B). There was also no detectable cleavage of PKCθ with Caspase-2, Caspase-9, or Caspase-6 (Fig. 3 B). Other studies have demonstrated that Caspase-3 is activated in cells treated with ara-C (14Datta R. Kojima H. Banach D. Bump N.J. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Weichselbaum R.R. Wong W.W. Kufe D.W. J. Biol.

Preincubation of the active lysate with CrmA had no effect, while p35 blocked PKCθ cleavage (Fig.3 C). Taken together, these results indicate that PKCθ is cleaved by Caspase-3 in cells induced to undergo apoptosis. To assess whether cleavage of PKCθ at the DEVD/K site is associated with activation of kinase function, we assayed recombinant PKCθ proteins for phosphorylation of the pseudosubstrate region of PKC (amino acids 19–31) with replacement of Ala-25 by Ser. The [A25S]PKC(19–31) peptide serves as a substrate for PKCθ (24Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Meller N. Coggeshall K.M. Giampa L. Telford D. Isakov N. Altman A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The PKCθ-cleaved fragment (CF; amino acids 355–706) was over 6-fold more active than PKCθ full-length (FL) and the PKCθFL(D-A) mutant (TableI). Moreover, a mutant of the cleaved fragment with Lys-409 in the ATP binding site mutated to Arg (K409R; designated K-R) had little if any activity above that found for control bacterial lysates (Table I).

To determine if PKCθ contributes to apoptosis, we transfected HeLa cells with PKCθFL, PKCθCF, or PKCθCF(K-R) cloned into vectors expressing the green fluorescence gene. Positive transfectants were selected by flow cytometry, reseeded in medium, and assayed for viability by trypan blue exclusion. Over 90% of the PKCθFL transfectants were viable, while only 10–15% of the PKCθCF-transfected cells survived (Fig.4 A). The finding that over 90% of the PKCθCF(K-R) transfectants were viable provided further support for the selective effects of PKCθCF expression (Fig.4 A). To assess whether transfection of PKCθCF induces apoptosis, we monitored the appearance of green fluorescence-positive cells with sub-G1 DNA content. Transfection of PKCθFL or PKCθCF(K-R) was associated with 7–10% of cells with sub-G1 DNA (Fig. 4 B). Significantly, transfection of kinase-active PKCθCF resulted in 48% of cells with sub-G1 DNA (Fig. 4 B). Cells were also stained with DAPI to assess nuclear morphology (25McGahon A.J. Martin S.J.

Transfection of PKCθCF, but not PKCθFL or PKCθCF(K-R), was associated with nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 4 C). Recent studies have demonstrated that the aPKCs (PKC ζ and λ) interact with Par-4 and abrogate the ability of Par-4 to induce apoptosis (26Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M. Frutos S. Sanchez P. Lozano J.

https://openalex.org/W2057974199,"We identified D N-cadherin, a novel Drosophila cadherin that is expressed in axons and in the mesoderm. Although D N-cadherin has diverged from vertebrate classic cadherins in terms of its extracellular structure, it still can form a complex with catenins and induce cell aggregation, as do the vertebrate molecules. Loss-of-function mutations of the gene resulted in either embryonic lethality or uncoordinated locomotion of adults. In the central nervous system of null mutant embryos, subsets of ipsilateral axons displayed a variety of aberrant trajectories including failure of position shifts, defective bundling, and errors in directional migration of growth cones. These results suggest that processes of axon patterning critically depend on D N-cadherin-mediated axon–axon interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2012199249,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a putative morphogen secreted by the floor plate and notochord, which specifies the fate of multiple cell types in the ventral aspect of the vertebrate nervous system. Since in Drosophila the actions of Hh have been shown to be transduced by Cubitus interruptus (Ci), a zinc finger transcription factor, we examined whether a vertebrate homolog of this protein can mediate the functions of Shh in the vertebrate nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that expression of Gli-1, one of three vertebrate homologs of Ci, can be induced by Shh in the neural tube. Further, ectopic expression of Gli-1 in the dorsal midbrain and hindbrain of transgenic mice mimics the effects of ectopically expressed Shh-N, leading to the activation of ventral neural tube markers such as Ptc, HNF-3beta, and Shh; to the suppression of dorsal markers such as Pax-3 and AL-1; and to the formation of ectopic dorsal clusters of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons. These findings demonstrate that GLI-1 can reproduce the cell patterning actions of Shh in the developing nervous system and provide support for the hypothesis that it is a mediator of the Shh signal in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1997845538,"The function of dopamine (DA) in the nervous system is paralleled by its neuroendocrine control of pituitary gland functions. Here, we document the neuroendocrine function of dopamine by studying the pituitary gland of mice lacking DA D2 receptors (D2R). These mice present a striking, progressive increase in lactotroph number, which ultimately leads to tumors in aged animals. Females develop tumors much earlier than males. An estrogen-mediated lactotroph proliferation cannot account for this sexual dimorphism, since D2R-null females are hypoestrogenic and, thus, have estrogen levels similar to males. In contrast, prolactin levels are six times higher in females than in males. We show that active prolactin receptors are present in the pituitary and their expression increases in concomitance with tumor expansion. These results point to prolactin as an autocrine proliferative factor in the pituitary gland. Additionally, they demonstrate an antiproliferative function for DA regulated through D2 receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1990625891,"Deletion of the dopamine transporter (DAT) results in increased dopaminergic tone, anterior pituitary hypoplasia, dwarfism, and an inability to lactate. DAT elimination alters the spatial distribution and dramatically reduces the numbers of lactotrophs and somatotrophs in the pituitary. Despite having normal circulating levels of growth hormone and prolactin in blood, hypoplastic glands from DAT−/− mice fail to respond to secretagog stimulation. The effects of DAT deletion on pituitary function result from elevated DA levels that down-regulate the lactotroph D2 DA receptors and depress hypothalamic growth hormone-releasing hormone content. These results reveal an unexpected and important role or DA in the control of developmental events in the pituitary gland and assign a critical role for hypothalamic DA reuptake in regulating these events."
https://openalex.org/W2054414484,"Head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCC) have a high local recurrence rate due to incomplete tumor resection. The use of molecular markers to establish surgical margins may decrease local recurrence. Surgical margins are determined by histopathologic analysis on frozen sections. We postulate that genetic and molecular changes precede gross histologic alterations. Tumor markers may improve the reliability of pathology examination, but those evaluated to date lack the sensitivity needed for routine clinical use. Western blot analysis showed elevated eIF4E in all 26 HNSCC in contrast to its low expression in benign lesions. Surgical margins were analysed for eIF4E in 23 patients. Twelve patients showed elevated eIF4E in histologically negative margins. Cancer has recurred in 5 of the 12 patients as opposed to none of the 11 patients with eIF4E negative margins (P=0.02, Log rank test). This is the first report of eIF4E in HNSCC, as a sensitive and specific marker for HNSCC, with potential for defining clear resection margins. The correlation between elevated levels of eIF4E at the margins and recurrence highlights its ability to detect malignant cells prior to clear-cut alterations in morphology. The accuracy and simplicity of these assays underscore the usefulness of eIF4E in managing HNSCC."

Our analysis of C. elegans ina-1 α integrin mutants provides the first genetic evidence that migrating neurons require integrins. Mosaic analysis and expression studies show that ina-1 acts autonomously in cells to promote their migrations. Although axons generally extend to their normal targets in ina-1 mutants, bundling of axons into fascicles is defective, defining a previously unrecognized role for integrins. In addition to these neuronal phenotypes, ina-1 mutants also display many morphogenetic defects. Finally, we show that the C. elegans INA-1 α integrin subunit associates with the PAT-3 β subunit in vivo, suggesting that these proteins function together in cell migration, axon fasciculation, and morphogenesis."

Moreover, individuals with PLP null mutations have a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, not seen with other PLP mutations of humans or animals.

https://openalex.org/W1989476856,"p16INK4A is a G1-specific cell cycle inhibitor which maps to human chromosome 9p21, a region frequently mutated or deleted in cancer cell lines and primary tumors. In glioblastomas the frequency of homozygous deletions is 40-70% making it one of the most common mutations in this tumor type. We have analysed the significance of the loss of this gene in gliomas by introducing the cDNA for p16INK4A into the human glioma cell line U-1242 MG which has a deleted CDKN2 locus. We used the tetracycline repressible vector system and obtained two stably transfected clones that expressed p16INK4A upon induction. p16INK4A expression caused a G1 arrest and enlargement of the cells similar to that of senescent cells. When staining for Senescence-Associated beta-galactosidase activity, described to be specific for senescent cells, we could show that the enlarged cells specifically gave a positive staining reaction. This senescence phenotype was dependent on the continuous expression of p16INK4A since it was reversed upon reintroduction of tetracycline suppression. Thus, the induced expression of p16INK4A in these glioma cells reverted their immortal phenotype and caused an immediate cellular senescence."

Analysis of successive event amplitudes revealed an interaction between consecutive IPSCs, indicating that bursts originate at single release sites. A mean receptor occupancy of 76% was calculated. IPSCs within a burst were analyzed using nonstationary noise analysis. The results indicate that individual release sites differ in the number, unitary conductance, and peak opening probability of their postsynaptic channels. In addition, the IPSC decay kinetics were very different among release sites. Finally, a significant correlation was found between several pairs of single site synaptic parameters."

https://openalex.org/W1516263509,"β Pictoris is the best known example of a main-sequence star encircled by a tenuous disk1. Optical2,3 and infrared4 images of β Pic suggest that the disk is composed of dust grains which have been interpreted1 as the debris generated by the disruption of the asteroid-sized remnants of planet-formation processes5. The star itself is relatively old, with an age in excess of 100 Myr. Here we present high-resolution millimetre-wave images of continuum and molecular-line emission from dust and gas surrounding a much younger star, MWC480: the stellar properties of MWC480 are similar to those of β Pic, but its age is just 6 Myr. The morphology of the circumstellar material and a comparison with the predictions of kinematic modelling indicate the presence of a rotating disk, gravitationally bound to the star. Moreover, the mass of the disk is greater than the minimum required to form a planetary system like our own5. We therefore suggest that the disk around the young star MWC480 could be a progenitor of debris disks of the type associated with older stars such as β Pic, and so holds much promise for the study of both the origin of debris disks and the early stages of the formation of planetary systems."

Dominant gain-of-function alleles inhibit enteric and egg-laying muscle contraction, whereas a putative null mutation has no observed phenotype. egl-36 encodes a Shaw-type (Kv3) voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit. In Xenopus oocytes, wild-type egl-36 expresses noninactivating channels with slow activation kinetics. One gain-of-function mutation causes a single amino acid substitution in S6, and the other causes a substitution in the cytoplasmic amino terminal domain. Both mutant alleles produce channels dramatically shifted in their midpoints of activation toward hyperpolarized voltages. An egl-36::gfp fusion is expressed in egg-laying muscles and in a pair of enteric muscle motor neurons. The mutant egl-36 phenotypes can thus be explained by expression in these cells of potassium channels that are inappropriately opened at hyperpolarized potentials, causing decreased excitability due to increased potassium conductance."
https://openalex.org/W2334424067,"Previous studies have shown that treatment of avian reticuloendotheliosis virus-transformed RECC-UTC4-1 (C4-1) lymphoblastoid cells with 10 microg/ml (18.8 microM) of RRR-alpha-tocopheryl succinate (vitamin E succinate, VES) for 3 days induced approximately 50% of the cells to undergo apoptosis. Elevated and prolonged expression of c-jun mRNA and protein was temporally correlated with VES-induced cell death. Data presented in this paper show that the elevated and prolonged expression of c-jun message and protein are not accounted for by enhanced stability, and show the involvement of c-Jun in VES-induced apoptosis in this lymphoblastoid cell type. C4-1 cells infected with a virus carrying a dominant, negatively acting mutant form of c-Jun, supjun-1, exhibited: (i) 71% reduction in VES-induced apoptosis, (ii) a 2.0-2.5-fold decrease in wildtype, endogenous c-Jun expression, and (iii) a 2.4-2.6-fold reduction in AP-1 binding activity. Additionally, cells co-treated with VES plus RRR-alpha-tocopherol, exhibited a 70% reduction in apoptosis, a marked reduction in c-Jun expression and a 1.6-fold reduction in AP-1 binding activity. These studies suggest that c-Jun plays a crucial role in VES-induced apoptosis in C4-1 cells, and add to our understanding of mechanisms of action involved in VES-mediated tumor cell growth inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2051223127,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor frequently inactivated in human cancers. We have studied the DNA binding potential and the transcriptional activity of p53 variants and p53 protein complexes in in vitro transcription assays. p53 specific transcription was measured via introduction of radioactive UTP into G-free cassette transcripts regulated by promoter sequences containing p53 response elements. Latent and activated p53 fractions were prepared from insect cells infected with p53 encoding baculoviruses by chromatography on heparin columns. p53 fractions distinguishable by their specifc DNA binding activities and their recognition by monoclonal antibody PAb421 were obtained. Specific DNA binding and binding to PAb421 are mutually exclusive. The C-terminus of p53 can be phosphorylated by casein kinase II, protein kinase C and cyclin dependent kinases. The antibody PAb421 binds within the PKC phosphorylation site of p53 and is able to activate DNA binding of latent p53 in vitro. Activation of p53 by PAb421 also results in enhanced transactivation in vitro. Dephosphorylation of latent p53 with phosphatase 2A does not change these properties. This suggests that a conformational change in the carboxyl terminal domain of p53 controls the transactivation potential of p53."

https://openalex.org/W2059810547,"A method is outlined for obtaining giga-ohm seals on intracellular membranes in intact cells. The technique employs a variant of the patch-clamp technique: a concentric electrode arrangement protects an inner patch pipette during penetration of the plasma membrane, after which a seal can be formed on an internal organelle membrane. Using this technique, successful recordings can be obtained with the same frequency as with conventional patch clamping. To localize the position of the pipette within cells, lipophilic fluorescent dyes are included in the pipette solution. These dyes stain the membrane of internal organelles during seal formation and can then be visualized by video-enhanced or confocal imaging. The method can detect channels activated by inositol trisphosphate, as well as other types of intracellular membrane ion channel activity, and should facilitate studies of internal membranes in intact neurons and other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2084355981,"The C. elegans egl-36 gene encodes a Shaw-type potassium channel that regulates egg-laying behavior. Gain of function [egl-36(gf)] and dominant negative [egl-36(dn)] mutations in egl-36 cause reciprocal defects in egg laying. An egl-36::gfp reporter is expressed in the egg-laying muscles and in a few other tissues. Expression of an egl-36(gf) cDNA in the egg-laying muscles causes behavioral defects similar to those observed in egl-36(gf) mutants. Gain of function EGL-36 subunits form channels that are active at more negative potentials than wild-type channels. The egl-36(gf) alleles correspond to missense mutations in an amino terminal subunit assembly domain (E138K) and in the S6 transmembrane domain (P435S), neither of which were previously implicated in the voltage dependence of channel activation. Altogether, these results suggest that EGL-36 channels regulate the excitability of the egg-laying muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2076811889,"To investigate the molecular mechanisms mediating hematopoietic cell differentiation and mitogenesis by activation of the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (PDGF-βR), the wild type PDGF-βR (PDGF-βRWT) and tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants of the PDGF-βR, including F751, F966, F970, F1009, F1021 and F1009/F1021 were overexpressed in FDC-P2 myeloid progenitor cells by retroviral-mediated gene transfer. Stimulation of PDGF-βRWT and F966, F970 and F1009 infectants with PDGF-BB led to the increased expression of monocytic differentiation markers. In contrast, activation of PDGF-βR in the parental line or the F1021 or F1009/F1021 mutant infectants failed to induce monocytic differentiation. PDGF-BB stimulation of PDGF-βRWT, F751, F966, F970 and F1009 infectants led to pronounced DNA synthesis, whereas F1021 and F1009/F1021 infectants did not reveal any increase in mitogenesis when compared to that of the FDC-P2 line. While PDGF stimulation of FDC-P2 cells overexpressing PDGF-βRWT led to a pronounced increase in inositol phosphate formation due to phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) activation, PDGF-BB induced phosphoinositol hydrolysis was completely abolished in the F1021 and F1009/F1021 infectants. GF 109203X, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) activation, fully blocked PDGF-βR-mediated monocytic differentiation and mitogenesis. Taken together, these results suggest that stimulation of the PDGF-βR signaling pathway can mediate monocytic differentiation when PDGF-βR is expressed at sufficient levels and that activation of PLC-γ and PKC plays a pivotal role in PDGF-βR-mediated differentiation and mitogenesis in FDC-P2 cell system."
https://openalex.org/W2314623204,"Our previous studies in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells demonstrate that thrombin stimulates Ras-dependent mitogenesis through the pertussis toxin insensitive G protein G12. While the direct effectors of G12 are unknown, Gα12 can transform fibroblasts, utilize Ras and Rac dependent signaling pathways and stimulate GTP loading of Ras. Here we have examined the role of the Shc adaptor protein in mitogenic signaling by the thrombin receptor in 1321N1 cells. As has been reported in other systems, thrombin stimulation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in 1321N1 cells. We also show that transient expression of Gα12 results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, thereby identifying Shc as the most proximal G12 effector to date. In addition, we demonstrate by microinjection that thrombin stimulated mitogenesis requires Shc and occurs specifically through the Shc SH2 domain. Expression of the SH2 domain of Shc also inhibits Gα12 mediated induction of an AP-1 dependent reporter gene demonstrating that G12 utilizes Shc to propagate downstream signals. Our data indicate that Shc is essential for stimulation of Ras dependent mitogenesis and gene expression by the G12 coupled thrombin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2317073734,"Inhibition of cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) by cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) blocks cell cycle progression and inhibits cellular proliferation. The archetypical member of the INK4 CDKI family, p16INK4A (also called CDKN2), is a tumor suppressor frequently deleted or mutated in certain neoplasms and many cell lines. Because p19INK4D has strong structural and functional similarity to p16INK4A, we have assessed its role as a tumor suppressor. This was accomplished by screening the p19INK4D coding region for mutations, deletions and rearrangements in sarcomas and non-small cell lung cancers. Alterations of the p19INK4D gene were found in samples from five of 67 (7%) patients with osteosarcomas and none were found in other types of sarcomas or in lung cancers. Five osteosarcoma samples had Southern blot patterns consistent with gene rearrangement. These samples included a primary and recurrent osteosarcoma from the same patient; both with the same rearrangement. Four samples had SSCP patterns consistent with sequence alterations, sequencing determined that three were due to silent base changes and apparently polymorphisms. Sequencing the fourth shifted band revealed a one base insertion causing a frameshift beginning with codon 27. In summary, these studies found alterations affecting the p19INK4D gene in a small but significant number of osteosarcomas. Presumably, abnormalities of this gene contribute to the development of cancer of bone cells."
https://openalex.org/W2325731379,"Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) binds to specific transmembrane receptors and is partly transported to a nuclear location. To study this transport we made a kinase-negative mutant of FGF receptor 4 as well as one where the major part of the cytoplasmic receptor domain was deleted, and expressed them in U2OSDr1 cells that lack functional FGF receptors. All receptors mediated endocytic uptake of aFGF. Translocation of the growth factor across cellular membranes was assayed using aFGF with a C-terminal CAAX-motif, which signals addition of a farnesyl group onto the protein once in the cytosol. CAAX-tagged aFGF was farnesylated when incubated with cells containing wild-type or kinase-negative receptors. It was not farnesylated in cells expressing the deleted receptor, or when the incubation was in the presence of genistein. aFGF incubated with cells transfected with wild-type or kinase-negative receptors, but not with the deleted receptor, was partly recovered from the nuclear fraction in the absence, but not in the presence of genistein. The data indicate that the cytoplasmic receptor domain, but not the active kinase, is required for transport of the growth factor into cells, and that genistein inhibits the process."
