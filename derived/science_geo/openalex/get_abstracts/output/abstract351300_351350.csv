https://openalex.org/W2124565737,"The management and conservation of the world's oceans require synthesis of spatial data on the distribution and intensity of human activities and the overlap of their impacts on marine ecosystems. We developed an ecosystem-specific, multiscale spatial model to synthesize 17 global data sets of anthropogenic drivers of ecological change for 20 marine ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that no area is unaffected by human influence and that a large fraction (41%) is strongly affected by multiple drivers. However, large areas of relatively little human impact remain, particularly near the poles. The analytical process and resulting maps provide flexible tools for regional and global efforts to allocate conservation resources; to implement ecosystem-based management; and to inform marine spatial planning, education, and basic research."
https://openalex.org/W2001037711,"A high-throughput protocol was developed for the synthesis of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Twenty-five different ZIF crystals were synthesized from only 9600 microreactions of either zinc(II)/cobalt(II) and imidazolate/imidazolate-type linkers. All of the ZIF structures have tetrahedral frameworks: 10 of which have two different links (heterolinks), 16 of which are previously unobserved compositions and structures, and 5 of which have topologies as yet unobserved in zeolites. Members of a selection of these ZIFs (termed ZIF-68, ZIF-69, and ZIF-70) have high thermal stability (up to 390 degrees C) and chemical stability in refluxing organic and aqueous media. Their frameworks have high porosity (with surface areas up to 1970 square meters per gram), and they exhibit unusual selectivity for CO2 capture from CO2/CO mixtures and extraordinary capacity for storing CO2: 1 liter of ZIF-69 can hold approximately 83 liters of CO2 at 273 kelvin under ambient pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2092301601,"Learning is often considered complete when a student can produce the correct answer to a question. In our research, students in one condition learned foreign language vocabulary words in the standard paradigm of repeated study-test trials. In three other conditions, once a student had correctly produced the vocabulary item, it was repeatedly studied but dropped from further testing, repeatedly tested but dropped from further study, or dropped from both study and test. Repeated studying after learning had no effect on delayed recall, but repeated testing produced a large positive effect. In addition, students' predictions of their performance were uncorrelated with actual performance. The results demonstrate the critical role of retrieval practice in consolidating learning and show that even university students seem unaware of this fact."
https://openalex.org/W2045081995,"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been generated from mouse and human fibroblasts by the retroviral transduction of four transcription factors. However, the cell origins and molecular mechanisms of iPS cell induction remain elusive. This report describes the generation of iPS cells from adult mouse hepatocytes and gastric epithelial cells. These iPS cell clones appear to be equivalent to embryonic stem cells in gene expression and are competent to generate germline chimeras. Genetic lineage tracings show that liver-derived iPS cells are derived from albumin-expressing cells. No common retroviral integration sites are found among multiple clones. These data suggest that iPS cells are generated by direct reprogramming of lineage-committed somatic cells and that retroviral integration into specific sites is not required."
https://openalex.org/W2034252508,"Bacterial infection often results in the formation of tissue abscesses, which represent the primary site of interaction between invading bacteria and the innate immune system. We identify the host protein calprotectin as a neutrophil-dependent factor expressed inside Staphylococcus aureus abscesses. Neutrophil-derived calprotectin inhibited S. aureus growth through chelation of nutrient Mn 2+ and Zn 2+ : an activity that results in reprogramming of the bacterial transcriptome. The abscesses of mice lacking calprotectin were enriched in metal, and staphylococcal proliferation was enhanced in these metal-rich abscesses. These results demonstrate that calprotectin is a critical factor in the innate immune response to infection and define metal chelation as a strategy for inhibiting microbial growth inside abscessed tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2025458672,"Optical atomic clocks promise timekeeping at the highest precision and accuracy, owing to their high operating frequencies. Rigorous evaluations of these clocks require direct comparisons between them. We have realized a high-performance remote comparison of optical clocks over kilometer-scale urban distances, a key step for development, dissemination, and application of these optical standards. Through this remote comparison and a proper design of lattice-confined neutral atoms for clock operation, we evaluate the uncertainty of a strontium (Sr) optical lattice clock at the 1 × 10 –16 fractional level, surpassing the current best evaluations of cesium (Cs) primary standards. We also report on the observation of density-dependent effects in the spin-polarized fermionic sample and discuss the current limiting effect of blackbody radiation–induced frequency shifts."
https://openalex.org/W1976259602,"Eastern boundary current systems are among the world's most productive large marine ecosystems. Because upwelling currents transport nutrient-rich but oxygen-depleted water onto shallow seas, large expanses of productive continental shelves can be vulnerable to the risk of extreme low-oxygen events. Here, we report the novel rise of water-column shelf anoxia in the northern California Current system, a large marine ecosystem with no previous record of such extreme oxygen deficits. The expansion of anoxia highlights the potential for rapid and discontinuous ecosystem change in productive coastal systems that sustain a major portion of the world's fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W1991486744,"The way predators control their prey populations is determined by the interplay between predator hunting mode and prey antipredator behavior. It is uncertain, however, how the effects of such interplay control ecosystem function. A 3-year experiment in grassland mesocosms revealed that actively hunting spiders reduced plant species diversity and enhanced aboveground net primary production and nitrogen mineralization rate, whereas sit-and-wait ambush spiders had opposite effects. These effects arise from the different responses to the two different predators by their grasshopper prey-the dominant herbivore species that controls plant species composition and accordingly ecosystem functioning. Predator hunting mode is thus a key functional trait that can help to explain variation in the nature of top-down control of ecosystems."

https://openalex.org/W2079092251,"The majority of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations that cause human disease are mild to moderately deleterious, yet many random mtDNA mutations would be expected to be severe. To determine the fate of the more severe mtDNA mutations, we introduced mtDNAs containing two mutations that affect oxidative phosphorylation into the female mouse germ line. The severe ND6 mutation was selectively eliminated during oogenesis within four generations, whereas the milder COI mutation was retained throughout multiple generations even though the offspring consistently developed mitochondrial myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Thus, severe mtDNA mutations appear to be selectively eliminated from the female germ line, thereby minimizing their impact on population fitness."
https://openalex.org/W1986930831,"Staphylococcus aureus produces hospital- and community-acquired infections, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus posing a serious public health threat. The golden carotenoid pigment of S. aureus , staphyloxanthin, promotes resistance to reactive oxygen species and host neutrophil-based killing, and early enzymatic steps in staphyloxanthin production resemble those for cholesterol biosynthesis. We determined the crystal structures of S. aureus dehydrosqualene synthase (CrtM) at 1.58 angstrom resolution, finding structural similarity to human squalene synthase (SQS). We screened nine SQS inhibitors and determined the structures of three, bound to CrtM. One, previously tested for cholesterol-lowering activity in humans, blocked staphyloxanthin biosynthesis in vitro (median inhibitory concentration ∼100 nM), resulting in colorless bacteria with increased susceptibility to killing by human blood and to innate immune clearance in a mouse infection model. This finding represents proof of principle for a virulence factor–based therapy against S. aureus ."
https://openalex.org/W2109584202,"Cell-autonomous immunity is widespread in plant-fungus interactions and terminates fungal pathogenesis either at the cell surface or after pathogen entry. Although post-invasive resistance responses typically coincide with a self-contained cell death of plant cells undergoing attack by parasites, these cells survive pre-invasive defence. Mutational analysis in Arabidopsis identified PEN1 syntaxin as one component of two pre-invasive resistance pathways against ascomycete powdery mildew fungi. Here we show that plasma-membrane-resident PEN1 promiscuously forms SDS-resistant soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes together with the SNAP33 adaptor and a subset of vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMPs). PEN1-dependent disease resistance acts in vivo mainly through two functionally redundant VAMP72 subfamily members, VAMP721 and VAMP722. Unexpectedly, the same two VAMP proteins also operate redundantly in a default secretory pathway, suggesting dual functions in separate biological processes owing to evolutionary co-option of the default pathway for plant immunity. The disease resistance function of the secretory PEN1-SNAP33-VAMP721/722 complex and the pathogen-induced subcellular dynamics of its components are mechanistically reminiscent of immunological synapse formation in vertebrates, enabling execution of immune responses through focal secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2168619064,"Searches for extrasolar planets have uncovered an astonishing diversity of planetary systems, yet the frequency of solar system analogs remains unknown. The gravitational microlensing planet search method is potentially sensitive to multiple-planet systems containing analogs of all the solar system planets except Mercury. We report the detection of a multiple-planet system with microlensing. We identify two planets with masses of approximately 0.71 and approximately 0.27 times the mass of Jupiter and orbital separations of approximately 2.3 and approximately 4.6 astronomical units orbiting a primary star of mass approximately 0.50 solar mass at a distance of approximately 1.5 kiloparsecs. This system resembles a scaled version of our solar system in that the mass ratio, separation ratio, and equilibrium temperatures of the planets are similar to those of Jupiter and Saturn. These planets could not have been detected with other techniques; their discovery from only six confirmed microlensing planet detections suggests that solar system analogs may be common."

https://openalex.org/W2063958537,"The Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) is phosphorylated on Akt substrate (PAS) motifs in response to insulin and contraction in skeletal muscle, regulating glucose uptake. Here we discovered a dissociation between AS160 protein expression and apparent AS160 PAS phosphorylation among soleus, tibialis anterior, and extensor digitorum longus muscles. Immunodepletion of AS160 in tibialis anterior muscle lysates resulted in minimal depletion of the PAS band at 160 kDa, suggesting the presence of an additional PAS immunoreactive protein. By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified this protein as the AS160 paralog TBC1D1, an obesity candidate gene regulating GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes. TBC1D1 expression was severalfold higher in skeletal muscles compared with all other tissues and was the dominant protein detected by the anti-PAS antibody at 160 kDa in tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus but not soleus muscles. In vivo stimulation by insulin, contraction, and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator AICAR increased TBC1D1 PAS phosphorylation. Using mass spectrometry on TBC1D1 from mouse skeletal muscle, we identified several novel phosphorylation sites on TBC1D1 and found the majority were consensus or near consensus sites for AMPK. Semiquantitative analysis of spectra suggested that AICAR caused greater overall phosphorylation of TBC1D1 sites compared with insulin. Purified Akt and AMPK phosphorylated TBC1D1 in vitro, and AMPK, but not Akt, reduced TBC1D1 electrophoretic mobility. TBC1D1 is a major PAS immunoreactive protein in skeletal muscle that is phosphorylated in vivo by insulin, AICAR, and contraction.

Skeletal muscle is the largest tissue in the human body by mass and is the chief site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. Insulin stimulation causes translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters from intracellular regions to the plasma membrane and t-tubule system where they function to import glucose. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, insulin fails to stimulate adequate GLUT4 translocation, resulting in impaired glucose uptake and poor glucose tolerance.Skeletal muscle is unique as an insulin-sensitive tissue because voluntary contraction during exercise causes GLUT4 translocation completely independent of insulin signaling (1Richter E.A.

Physiol. 2005; 99: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Contraction-stimulated glucose uptake is preserved in the muscle of individuals with type 2 diabetes, thus demonstrating the existence of signaling pathways that circumvent defective components of the insulin signaling pathway (3Kennedy J.W.

Phosphorylation of AS160 at Akt substrate motifs (RXRXX(S/T)) is proposed to inhibit AS160 activity or cause dissociation from GLUT4 vesicles.

We demonstrate that in skeletal muscle, insulin, AICAR, and contraction directly regulate TBC1D1 phosphorylation. We also report the de novo identification of phosphorylation sites on endogenous TBC1D1 from mouse skeletal muscle and their comparative regulation by insulin and AICAR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Protocols for animal use were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Joslin Diabetes Center. Experimental work was conducted on male ICR mice, aged 8-10 weeks, purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All mice were housed in a 12:12-h light:dark cycle and fed a standard laboratory diet and water ad libitum. Mice were restricted from food for ∼5 h before the start of experiments. Animal experiments started at ∼1 p.m.In Vivo Insulin and AICAR Administration—For both insulin and AICAR experiments, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (90-100 mg/kg). To elicit a maximal insulin response, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 unit of recombinant human insulin (humulin R, #HI 210, Lilly). Controls were injected with saline (0.9% NaCl) or not injected. No difference was observed between saline injected and non-injected controls. To activate AMPK, mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 mg/g AICAR (#A8129, Sigma Aldrich) dissolved in saline (50 mg/ml). Because of solubility and injection volume limitations, this was a practical maximum dosage. Controls were injected with saline (0.9% NaCl). Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and muscles were immediately dissected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.In Situ Contraction—Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (90-100 mg/kg). Peroneal nerves to both hind limbs were surgically exposed. One hind limb was subjected to electrical stimulation using a Grass S88 pulse generator (Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA) for 15 min (train rate, 2/s; train duration, 500 ms; pulse rate, 100 Hz; duration, 0.1 ms at 1-10 V), and the other hind limb served as a sham-operated control. Because of normal variation in the surgery and the resultant contact of the electrode with the nerve, voltage was manually adjusted so that muscles directly innervated by the peroneal nerve contracted with a full range of motion without the recruitment of extraneous motor groups. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation immediately after the cessation of contraction, and tibialis anterior muscles were immediately dissected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.Preparation of Tissue Lysates—The following buffer was utilized to prepare lysates for immunoblotting, myosin heavy chain separation, measurement of citrate synthase activity, and immunoprecipitation: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 250 mm mannitol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Nonidet P-40 substitute (v/v) (Calbiochem), 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT, and Complete Mini protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science, #4693124), pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Frozen tissues were pulverized at liquid nitrogen temperature and homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY) in ice-cold buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Lysate protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).Immunoblots—Lysates (30 μg protein) and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE before immunoblotting (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar). Antibody-bound proteins were visualized on film using chemiluminescence detection reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Exposed film was scanned with an ImageScanner (GE Healthcare), and bands were quantitated by densitometry (Fluor-Chem 2.0; Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Commercially available primary antibodies were anti-AS160 (#07-741, Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-GLUT4 (#400064, Calbiochem), anti-α-tubulin (#SC5286, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PAS (#9611, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-phospho-Akt-Thr-308 (#9275, Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-phospho-AMPK-Thr 172 (#2535, Cell Signaling Technology). Serum-purified anti-TBC1D1 antibody was generated by Cell Signaling Technology by immunizing rabbits. To confirm that the anti-TBC1D1 antibody did not cross-react with AS160, TBC1D1 was immunoprecipitated from a tibialis anterior muscle lysate, and the pre-depletion lysate, supernatant, and immunoprecipitate were immunoblotted for TBC1D1 and AS160. Immunoprecipitations without antibody or lysate were included as additional controls and demonstrated that the immunodepletion and immunoprecipitation of TBC1D1 were dependent upon the anti-TBC1D1 antibody but that the anti-TBC1D1 antibody alone did not generate the TBC1D1 signal detected in the immunoprecipitate lane. To minimize the possibility of nonspecific interactions, the anti-TBC1D1 antibody preparations used to immunoprecipitate and immunoblot TBC1D1 were from different rabbits.Immunoprecipitations—AS160 was immunoprecipitated with a goat polyclonal antibody made against the C-terminal region of AS160 (#ab5909, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, or #100-1313, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). The long form of AS160 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody made against the splice exon of AS160. This antibody was kindly donated by Dr. Gustav Lienhard of Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH. Protein G-agarose beads (#22851, Pierce) or protein G Fast Flow-Sepharose beads (#17-0618-01, GE Healthcare) were used to bind anti-AS160, anti-TBC1D1, or anti-PAS antibodies. Bead-antibody-protein complexes were washed 1× with lysis buffer, 1× or 2× with lysis buffer + 500 mm NaCl, and 1× with lysis buffer. Pellets were aspirated and spotted with 5-10 μl of 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin before elution. Bovine serum albumin was utilized as a carrier protein to maximize the efficiency of immunoprecipitated protein elution. Proteins were eluted from protein G beads by adding Laemmli buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and heating for 5 min at 95 °C.Myosin Heavy Chain Separation—Myosin heavy chain isoforms were separated as previously described (27Bamman M.M. Clarke M.S. Talmadge R.J. Feeback D.L. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Before electrophoresis, β-mercaptoethanol (1 μl/ml) was added to a 12× upper running buffer consisting of 600 mm Tris (base), 900 mm glycine, and 0.6% SDS. Lower running buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris (base), 75 mm glycine, and 0.05% SDS. Soleus muscle (1.5 μg), tibialis anterior (TA) muscle (1 μg), and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle (1 μg) lysates were prepared as above under “Preparation of Tissue Lysates” (this section of text) and were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in 2× Laemmli buffer at a final volume of 12 μl. After heating, 10 μl was loaded onto gels for separation. Gels were run at 100 V for 1 h and 150 V for ∼20 h. Temperature was maintained at 4-8 °C for the duration of the run. Gels were silver-stained with the SilverSNAP Stain Kit II (Pierce, 24612). Myosin heavy chain fraction was quantitated from images of scanned gels using the 1D-Multi function of AlphaEase FC software.Citrate Synthase Activity—Citrate synthase activity was measured according to the method of Srere (28Srere P. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-6Crossref Scopus (2023) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Lysates were prepared as above under “Preparation of Tissue Lysates,” and citrate synthase activity was measured at room temperature on a 96-well plate with a final reaction volume of 200 μl.Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was isolated from muscle and white adipose tissue with RNeasy Fibrous Tissue (#74704) and Lipid Tissue (#74804) mini kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia CA). RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (#M1701, Promega, Madison, WI). cDNA was amplified for 40 cycles using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (#4309155, Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Primer efficiencies and the relative differences in the starting quantity of each transcript were derived from the equations developed by Pfaffl (29Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (24916) Google Scholar). β-Actin was utilized as an internal standard. Primers utilized were: AS160 forward, 5′-CCATGAAGGAGGACTCCAAA-3′, and AS160 reverse, 5′-TCATGCAGGCTGAACTTGTC-3′; TBC1D1 forward, 5′-GTGAGGAAGAGGCGTTCAAG-3′, and TBC1D1 reverse, 5′-AGGTCTCGGTGGTAATCGTG-3′; β-actin forward, 5′-CAACGAGCGGTTCCGATG-3′, and β-actin reverse, 5′-GCCACAGGATTCCATACCCA-3′. To compare the relative abundances of AS160 and TBC1D1 splice variants, cDNA was amplified with exon-flanking primers for 30 cycles (98 °C × 10s, 61.7 °C × 20s, and 72 °C × 60s) with the Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (#F540-S, New England Biolabs). Primers utilized were: AS160 forward, 5′-GGCTTGGAAGTATGGACAGC-3′, and AS160 reverse, 5′-CATGGTGGGAGAGAGAGGAG-3′; TBC1D1 forward, 5′-GTGACTCAGAGGGCCACATT-3′, and TBC1D1 reverse, 5′-TGGCCACTCGAAGGAATATC-3′. Amplicons were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and imaged with ethidium bromide staining under UV light.In Vitro Phosphorylation of TBC1D1—TBC1D1 sufficient for 60 reactions was immunoprecipitated from a ∼6-mg pooled tibialis anterior muscle lysate. The following buffers were used for this procedure: enzyme buffer (50 mm Tris, 250 mm mannitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Brij-35, pH 7.4, at 4 °C) and kinase activation buffer (100 mm Hepes, 200 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm AMP, and 0.5 mm ATP, pH 7.0); DTT, AMP, and ATP were added just before use. Immunoprecipitated TBC1D1 was incubated with 10 ng of recombinant AMPK (#P47-10H, SignalChem, Richmond, BC, Canada) or recombinant Akt (#14-447, Millipore, Billerica, MA) for 0, 30, or 60 min, 10 ng of AMPK + 10 ng Akt for 60 min, or enzyme buffer without enzyme for 60 min at 37 °C. Before use, AMPK and Akt were diluted in enzyme buffer with 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin and 2 mm DTT. Protein G-antibody-TBC1D1 complexes were aspirated and resuspended in enzyme buffer with 4 mm DTT and bovine serum albumin equivalent to 5 μg per reaction. Immunoprecipitated TBC1D1 suspension, kinase activation buffer, double distilled H2O, and diluted enzymes were combined at a ratio of 1:2:1:1. Reactions were stopped by adding 4× Laemmli buffer, and phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting with the PAS antibody.Mass Spectrometry—For mass spectrometry experiments, AS160 and PAS-160 (TBC1D1) were immunoprecipitated from pooled tibialis anterior muscle lysates (∼40 mg, ∼5 mg/ml), subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (#24592, Pierce). For PAS-160 identification and analysis at the Joslin Diabetes Center Proteomics Core, AS160 was simultaneously depleted with both the C-terminal and splice exon AS160 antibodies before TBC1D1 immunoprecipitation with the PAS antibody. Samples were reduced and alkylated with iodacetamide before SDS-PAGE. Samples were digested with trypsin, and peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermofinnigan, San Jose, CA) by methods routinely utilized by the Joslin Diabetes Center Proteomics Core (30Ishida-Takahashi R.

To compare insulin- and AICAR-stimulated phosphorylation of TBC1D1, AS160 was depleted with the C-terminal AS160 antibody, phosphorylated TBC1D1 was immunoprecipitated with the PAS antibody, and samples were reduced and alkylated in-gel. Samples were digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermofinnigan) by methods routinely utilized by the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility (33Villen J.

In all cases data were analyzed with the sequest algorithm, and reported phosphopeptides were verified by manual inspection of spectra.Data Analysis and Statistics—Data from immunoblots were normalized by setting the average of control or reference values to 1. For real-time PCR, AS160 cDNA levels in individual soleus muscles were set to 1, and data were normalized to AS160 in soleus muscle. Statistical analyses were completed using SigmaStat 3.5 (Systat, San Jose, CA) or Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Means were compared by t test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-way ANOVA. When differences between means were detected by one- or two-way analysis of variance, Fisher's least significance difference test was used for post hoc testing. When data failed tests for normality or equal variance, data were rank-transformed before analysis. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The differences between groups were considered significant when p < 0.05.RESULTSAS160 Expression—AS160 functions as a brake to restrain GLUT4 transporter exocytosis. Therefore, we compared AS160 and GLUT4 expression in muscles of different fiber types to test the hypothesis that muscles expressing higher levels of GLUT4 would express greater amounts of AS160. AS160 expression (Fig. 1A), GLUT4 expression (Fig. 1B), myosin heavy chain fraction (Fig. 1C), and citrate synthase activity (Fig. 1D) were measured in soleus, TA, and EDL muscle. AS160 expression was ∼10-fold greater in soleus muscle compared with tibialis anterior and EDL muscle. In contrast, GLUT4 expression was equal in soleus and tibialis anterior muscles. Myosin heavy chain analysis demonstrated that soleus, but not tibialis anterior or EDL muscle, expressed type I and IIa myosin heavy chain. No association was found with citrate synthase activity, a marker for mitochondrial content, which was greatest in tibialis anterior muscle followed by soleus and then EDL. Thus, AS160 expression was associated with myosin heavy chain type I and IIa, not GLUT4 expression or citrate synthase activity.Insulin-stimulated PAS-160 Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation of AS160 at Akt substrate motifs (RXRXXS(S/T)) has been measured in numerous studies by immunoblotting with a PAS antibody (11Bruss M.D. Arias E.B.

https://openalex.org/W2090278531,"Alcohol dependence is a major public health challenge in need of new treatments. As alcoholism evolves, stress systems in the brain play an increasing role in motivating continued alcohol use and relapse. We investigated the role of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), a mediator of behavioral stress responses, in alcohol dependence and treatment. In preclinical studies, mice genetically deficient in NK1R showed a marked decrease in voluntary alcohol consumption and had an increased sensitivity to the sedative effects of alcohol. In a randomized controlled experimental study, we treated recently detoxified alcoholic inpatients with an NK1R antagonist (LY686017; n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). LY686017 suppressed spontaneous alcohol cravings, improved overall well-being, blunted cravings induced by a challenge procedure, and attenuated concomitant cortisol responses. Brain functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to affective stimuli likewise suggested beneficial LY686017 effects. Thus, as assessed by these surrogate markers of efficacy, NK1R antagonism warrants further investigation as a treatment in alcoholism."

https://openalex.org/W2019577996,"A fundamental question about the gating mechanism of voltage-activated K+ (Kv) channels is how five positively charged voltage-sensing residues1,2 in the fourth transmembrane segment are energetically stabilized, because they operate in a low-dielectric cell membrane. The simplest solution would be to pair them with negative charges3. However, too few negatively charged channel residues are positioned for such a role4,5. Recent studies suggest that some of the channel’s positively charged residues are exposed to cell membrane phospholipids and interact with their head groups5,6,7,8,9. A key question nevertheless remains: is the phospho-head of membrane lipids necessary for the proper function of the voltage sensor itself? Here we show that a given type of Kv channel may interact with several species of phospholipid and that enzymatic removal of their phospho-head creates an insuperable energy barrier for the positively charged voltage sensor to move through the initial gating step(s), thus immobilizing it, and also raises the energy barrier for the downstream step(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1970778492,"Here we describe three novel collagen VI chains, alpha4, alpha5, and alpha6. The corresponding genes are arranged in tandem on mouse chromosome 9. The new chains structurally resemble the collagen VI alpha3 chain. Each chain consists of seven von Willebrand factor A domains followed by a collagenous domain, two C-terminal von Willebrand factor A domains, and a unique domain. In addition, the collagen VI alpha4 chain carries a Kunitz domain at the C terminus, whereas the collagen VI alpha5 chain contains an additional von Willebrand factor A domain and a unique domain. The size of the collagenous domains and the position of the structurally important cysteine residues within these domains are identical between the collagen VI alpha3, alpha4, alpha5, and alpha6 chains. In mouse, the new chains are found in or close to basement membranes. Collagen VI alpha1 chain-deficient mice lack expression of the new collagen VI chains implicating that the new chains may substitute for the alpha3 chain, probably forming alpha1alpha2alpha4, alpha1alpha2alpha5, or alpha1alpha2alpha6 heterotrimers. Due to a large scale pericentric inversion, the human COL6A4 gene on chromosome 3 was broken into two pieces and became a non-processed pseudogene. Recently COL6A5 was linked to atopic dermatitis and designated COL29A1. The identification of novel collagen VI chains carries implications for the etiology of atopic dermatitis as well as Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2088132686,"Bubble chambers were the dominant technology used for particle detection in accelerator experiments for several decades, eventually falling into disuse with the advent of other techniques. We report here on a new application for these devices. We operated an ultraclean, room-temperature bubble chamber containing 1.5 kilograms of superheated CF 3 I, a target maximally sensitive to spin-dependent and -independent weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) couplings. An extreme intrinsic insensitivity to the backgrounds that commonly limit direct searches for dark matter was measured in this device under operating conditions leading to the detection of low-energy nuclear recoils like those expected from WIMPs. Improved limits on the spin-dependent WIMP-proton scattering cross section were extracted during our experiments, excluding this type of coupling as a possible explanation for a recent claim of particle dark-matter detection."
https://openalex.org/W2153266207,"Accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by beta- and gamma-secretases, is toxic to neurons and is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Production of Abeta from APP is greatly affected by the subcellular localization and trafficking of APP. Here we have identified a novel intracellular adaptor protein, sorting nexin 17 (SNX17), that binds specifically to the APP cytoplasmic domain via the YXNPXY motif that has been shown previously to bind several cell surface adaptors, including Fe65 and X11. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of SNX17 and RNA interference knockdown of endogenous SNX17 expression both reduced steady-state levels of APP with a concomitant increase in Abeta production. RNA interference knockdown of SNX17 also decreased APP half-life, which led to the decreased steady-state levels of APP. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed a colocalization of SNX17 and APP in the early endosomes. We also showed that a cell surface adaptor protein, Dab2, binds to the same YXNPXY motif and regulates APP endocytosis at the cell surface. Our results thus provide strong evidence that both cell surface and intracellular adaptor proteins regulate APP endocytic trafficking and processing to Abeta. The identification of SNX17 as a novel APP intracellular adaptor protein highly expressed in neurons should facilitate the understanding of the relationship between APP intracellular trafficking and processing to Abeta."
https://openalex.org/W2119009760,"The ADP-ribosyltransferases are a class of enzymes that display activity in a variety of bacterial pathogens responsible for causing diseases in plants and animals, including those affecting mankind, such as diphtheria, cholera, and whooping cough. We report the characterization of a novel toxin from Vibrio cholerae, which we call cholix toxin. The toxin is active against mammalian cells (IC50 = 4.6 ± 0.4 ng/ml) and crustaceans (Artemia nauplii LD50 = 10 ± 2 μg/ml). Here we show that this toxin is the third member of the diphthamide-specific class of ADP-ribose transferases and that it possesses specific ADP-ribose transferase activity against ribosomal eukaryotic elongation factor 2. We also describe the high resolution crystal structures of the multidomain toxin and its catalytic domain at 2.1- and 1.25-Å resolution, respectively. The new structural data show that cholix toxin possesses the necessary molecular features required for infection of eukaryotes by receptor-mediated endocytosis, translocation to the host cytoplasm, and inhibition of protein synthesis by specific modification of elongation factor 2. The crystal structures also provide important insight into the structural basis for activation of toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. These results indicate that cholix toxin may be an important virulence factor of Vibrio cholerae that likely plays a significant role in the survival of the organism in an aquatic environment.

Many pathogenic bacteria utilize secreted protein toxins (exotoxins) as components of their virulence repertoire. These toxins induce cell death or alter cellular physiology by mechanisms such as proteolysis, pore formation, and covalent modification of host proteins. Although some toxins are responsible for the complete pathology of a disease, others manipulate the host immune response, promote escape from the intracellular environment, release nutrients, or facilitate bacterial penetration of host barriers (1Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. 2nd. Academic Press, San Diego, San Diego1999Google Scholar, 2Burns D.L. Barbieri J.T. Iglewski B.H. Rappuoli R. Bacterial Protein Toxins. ASM Press, Washington, DC2003Crossref Google Scholar). Since secreted toxins have been best characterized in terms of their virulence toward mammals, survival of these pathogens in the environment may provide additional selective pressures. For example, the secreted phospholipase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa encoded by plcS (now known as plcH) contributes to virulence against Candida albicans (3Hogan D.A. Kolter R. Science. 2002; 296: 2229-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella (4Jander G. Rahme L.G. Ausubel F.M. J.

Science. 1995; 268: 1899-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Furthermore, secreted toxins may play roles in survival or colonization by non-pathogenic bacteria involved in symbioses (6Ruby E.G. Urbanowski M. Campbell J. Dunn A. Faini M. Gunsalus R. Lostroh P. Lupp C. McCann J. Millikan D. Schaefer A. Stabb E. Stevens A. Visick K. Whistler C. Greenberg E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Cholera toxin, an A-B5 toxin that is expressed by some strains of Vibrio cholerae, causes cholera disease by specifically transferring an ADP-ribose group to an Arg residue of the GTP-binding protein Gs, thereby activating adenylate cyclase. Increased concentration of cAMP leads to secretion of Cl-, (HCO3−), and water from epithelial cells at the site of colonization, resulting in dehydration and electrolyte loss from the infected patient. Production of a “rice stool” by these patients, which carries V. cholerae at concentrations as high as 108/ml (7Kaper J.B. Morris Jr., J.G. Levine M.M. Clin. Microbiol.

Immun. 2007; 75: 2645-2647Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have revealed the presence of a gene (chxA) encoding a novel putative secreted exotoxin (23Yates S.P. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Merrill A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), with similarity to exotoxin A (ExoA) 6The abbreviations used are: ExoA, P. aeruginosa exotoxin A; ExoAc, P. aeruginosa exotoxin A catalytic fragment; cholixc, V. cholerae exotoxin catalytic fragment; DTA, diphtheria toxin catalytic fragment; DT, diphtheria toxin; eEF2, eukaryotic ribosomal elongation factor 2; ADPRT, ADP-ribosyltransferase; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. of P. aeruginosa. ExoA is a potent ADP-ribosylating toxin that specifically modifies the post-translationally modified histidine residue, diphthamide, in the essential eukaryotic ribosomal elongation factor 2 (eEF2) (24Jorgensen R. Merrill A.R. Andersen G.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ is transferred onto the diphthamide imidazole leading to inhibition of protein synthesis in susceptible eukaryotic cells (25Wilson B.A. Collier R.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 27-41PubMed Google Scholar, 26Jorgensen R. Yates S.P. Teal D.J. Nilsson J. Prentice G.A. Merrill A.R. Andersen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45919-45925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Herein, we clearly demonstrate that the chxA gene encodes a second major ADP-ribosylating toxin in V. cholerae. This toxin is catalytically active, specific for the ribosomal eEF2 substrate, and toxic against a diverse array of eukaryotes. Cholix toxin is only the third member of the eEF2-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase toxins, in addition to ExoA and diphtheria toxin (DT). Finally, we have determined the crystal structures of the full-length cholix toxin and its catalytic C-terminal domain (cholixc) to 2.1 Å and 1.25 Å, respectively. Remarkably, the latter structure is the highest resolution to date for any member of the ADPRT family and is co-crystallized in complex with a competitive inhibitor, PJ34, which binds to the NAD+ binding pocket of the toxin. Furthermore, the full-length structure demonstrates striking similarities to ExoA, which consists of a tripartite domain structure, including domains I–III that function in receptor binding, membrane translocation, and enzyme catalysis, respectively. The new crystal structures reveal that inherent flexibility of Loop 1 (L1) (and perhaps also Loop 4, L4) in the toxin is a prerequisite for enzymatic activity and that disruption of specific H-bonds to domain II, either from reduction of disulfide bonds, from furin cleavage or both, is what activates the toxin upon entry into the eukaryotic host cell. In agreement with recent structural studies of the eEF2·ExoA·NAD+ complex, 7R. Jorgensen, Y. Wang, D. Visschedyk, and A. R. Merrill, submitted for publication. L1 of cholix toxin also has the potential to interact with both NAD+ and the diphthamide target residue in eEF2 to form a solvent cover for the active site during the transferase reaction. Cloning of chxA Gene, Expression, and Purification of Cholix and Cholixc Toxins—The 208-residue catalytic fragment of cholix toxin (cholixc) gene (GB AY876053) was cloned into a pET-28a(+) vector with a N-terminal His6 tag and a Tobacco Etch Virus protease site. Escherichia coli ER2566 cells were transformed with plasmid and were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween, 1.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed in a French press. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C at 20,000 × g for 20 min, twice. The filtered supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-charged HiTrap™ Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and 500 mm NaCl, washed with buffer and eluted with a 0–250 mm imidazole gradient. The cholixc toxin was dialyzed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and was digested with tobacco etch virus (1:10 ratio) at 4 °C. The protein was then separated on a HiTrap™ Chelating HP column, and the flow-through was loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, and 25 mm NaCl and eluted with a 25–500 mm NaCl gradient. The gene encoding the 634-residue cholix toxin for structural studies (GB AY876053) was cloned into a pET-28a(+) vector with a N-terminal His6 tag. The cells were expressed and purified as for the catalytic fragment. The cholix toxin for in vivo studies was produced from a different construct possessing a tobacco etch virus protease digestion site between the His6 tag and the protein sequence. The His6 tag was cleaved off the full-length cholix toxin by tobacco etch virus digestion as described for the catalytic fragment. The cholixc and cholix toxins were both concentrated to ∼7 mg/ml in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, buffer. Cytotoxicity Assays—Mouse L-M fibroblasts (ATCC CCL-1.2) were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2) in modified McCoy 5A media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 125 units/ml penicillin, 125 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 mm HEPES, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were added to 24-well cell culture dishes (1 × 105 cells/ml) and were incubated for 5 h, washed with fresh media, and incubated with 0.75 ml of media containing 1 μCi/ml of l-[4,5-3H]leucine (GE Healthcare) for 18 h. Cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.25 ml of 0.1 n NaOH was added. After 5 min at 37 °C, 4 wells of each treatment were pooled together and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. Protein was precipitated with sodium deoxycholate and 7% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitate was washed twice with 6% trichloroacetic acid, prior to dissolving in 0.2–0.4 ml of 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min at 56 °C. Protein concentrations were determined (Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit), and incorporation of [3H]leucine was measured in a Beckman LS6000TA scintillation counter (Ultima Gold mixture, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For Fig. 1, toxin was added at the indicated dilutions in fresh media and incubated with the cells for ∼48 h. Cytotoxicity Assays Comparing MEF-1 and PEA13 Cells—MEF-1 and PEA 13 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C under 10% CO2. Then, 5 × 105 cells/ml were added to 24-well dishes in a 1-ml volume, and experiments were performed as above, except that cells were incubated with toxin for 16 h, then with [3H]leucine for 3 h. Samples were processed as above, except that ScintiSafe-30% (Fisher) scintillation mixture was utilized. Artemia Toxicity Assays—Artemia cysts were added to filtered seawater and aerated at room temperature for ∼24 h. Within several hours of hatching, A. nauplii were placed in 24-well dishes containing 400 μl of sterile sea water, with a total of 30–70 nauplii per well, and incubated at 28 °C for 42–45 h. Artemia mortality was assessed using a dissecting microscope. Detection of Biotinylated ADP-ribose-eEF2—100 μm Bio-NAD (Trevigen) was incubated with 5 μm toxin in the presence of 7 μl of CHO cell lysate in 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer for 60 min at 25 °C. The proteins were separated on by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and were transferred to nitrocellulose at 125 mA for 80 min. The membrane was blocked (2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h and then was incubated in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline with 1:5000 dilution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphate conjugate (Promega) and mixed overnight on a Nutator at 4 °C. The blot was then washed with 0.5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, buffer and developed in 10 ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium alkaline phosphate substrate for 3 min. Crystallography—The cholixc toxin was co-crystallized with 5 mm PJ34 (Sigma-Aldrich) by vapor diffusion against reservoirs containing 15% polyethylene glycol-8000 and 20 mm KH2PO4 at 19 °C. Before flash freezing in liquid N2, the crystals were transferred to paratone-N (Hampton research) for cryoprotection. A native 1.25-Å dataset was collected at Advanced Photon Source beamline 19-ID, and a 1.65-Å dataset on a crystal soaked for 1 h in 5 mm HgCl2 was collected at beamline 17-ID. The cholixc toxin structure was solved using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phases. The anomalous scattering substructure search, density modification, and initial chain tracing were all performed in Phenix (28Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. Mc-Coy A.J.

Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3667) Google Scholar), and a single major and two minor sites were found. The resulting partial model was used for molecular replacement against the high resolution native dataset using the CCP4 program MolRep (29Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), and the structure was then traced using warpNtrace (30Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) and was iteratively rebuilt in Coot (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and anisotropically refined in Refmac5 (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) at 1.25-Å resolution. Cholix toxin was crystallized by vapor diffusion against reservoirs containing 23% polyethylene glycol-10,000, 7.5% ethylene glycol, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, at 19 °C. Before flash freezing in liquid N2 the crystals were transferred to paratone-N (Hampton research) for cryoprotection. A native 2.1-Å dataset was collected at our in-house Enraf-Nonius FR571 diffractometer equipped with a rotating copper anode and a Proteum Pt135 CCD detector (Bruker). The structure of cholix toxin was solved by molecular replacement with CNS 1.1 (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) and Phaser (34McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar) using the refined structure of cholixc toxin together with the receptor binding and translocation domains from the structure of ExoA from P. aeruginosa (PDB entry 1IKQ) as search models. The solution from molecular replacement was used as input to warpNtrace, which could trace ∼80% of the structure. The model was rebuilt in Coot and refined in Refmac5 using TLS at 2.1-Å resolution. chxA Encodes a Putative ADPRT—Previously, we identified several DNA fragments from V. cholerae strains SIO and TP that have strong similarity to genes encoding virulence factors in known bacterial pathogens, including a putative ADPRT with resemblance to the toxA gene from P. aeruginosa (21Purdy A. Rohwer F. Edwards R. Azam F. Bartlett D.H. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2992-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This gene, called chxA, encodes a 666-residue protein with a 32-residue leader sequence, called cholix toxin (70.7-kDa, 634-residue mature protein), and is similar to known diphthamide-specific ADPRTs (23Yates S.P. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Merrill A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cholix toxin primary structure shows 32% sequence identity with Pseudomonas ExoA, has a furin protease site for cellular activation (35Inocencio N.M. Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31831-31835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contains a C-terminal KDEL sequence that likely routes the toxin to the endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell (36Hessler J.L. Kreitman R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14577-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and possesses three classical signature regions (23Yates S.P. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Merrill A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 37Masignani V. Balducci E. Serruto D. Veggi D. Arico B. Comanducci M. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 293: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) peculiar to the catalytic domain of the diphthamide-specific toxins (23Yates S.P. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Merrill A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, all of these features within the primary sequence of the cholix toxin provided a powerful indication that this protein is a new member of the eEF2-specific ADPRT group (DT group) (23Yates S.P. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Merrill A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 37Masignani V. Balducci E. Serruto D. Veggi D. Arico B. Comanducci M. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 293: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cholix Toxin Is a Bacterial ADPRT Enzyme—The ADPRT reaction in the DT group involves a nucleophilic substitution where the diphthamide imidazole in eEF2 is the nucleophile that replaces the nicotinamide base (leaving group) of the NAD+ substrate (23Yates S.P. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Merrill A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The cellular effect of the covalent modification (ribosylation) of eEF2 is inhibition of protein synthesis leading to host cell death (38Perentesis J.P. Miller S.P. Bodley J.W. Biofactors. 1992; 3: 173-184PubMed Google Scholar). To explore whether cholix toxin possessed ADPRT activity, we cloned both the full-length and truncated chxA gene into the T7-based E. coli pET28b vector for expression and purification of both the whole toxin and its C-terminal catalytic domain. The proteins were purified by immobilized metal ion chromatography and were tested for both NAD-glycohydrolase and ADPRT activities using a fluorescence-based assay with purified yeast eEF2 as substrate previously developed in our laboratory (39Armstrong S. Merrill A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The full-length recombinant toxin (634 residues, 70.7 kDa) showed only weak catalytic activity suggesting that this protein requires activation, a prerequisite for this family of enzymes/toxins (40Leppla S.H. Martin O.C. Muehl L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41Chung D.W. Collier R.J. Infect. Immun. 1977; 16: 832-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Beattie B.K. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9042-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, the catalytic fragment (208 residues, 23 kDa) showed strong glycohydrolase (Km, 67 ± 4 μm; kcat, 1.92 ± 0.12 h-1) and ADPRT activities (Table 1). Cholix toxin is a slightly better enzyme than ExoA with a lower Km (3-fold), similar kcat, and specificity constant (2-fold higher) for the NAD+ substrate (23Yates S.P. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Merrill A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacing the hallmark catalytic Glu-581 residue (corresponding to Glu-553 in ExoA and Glu-148 in DT) within the enzyme domain of cholix toxin with an Ala showed the expected result on the activity of the enzyme (∼2600-fold reduction in kcat, Table 1). Thus, cholix toxin recognizes eEF2 as the target protein substrate and possesses both glycohydrolase and ADPRT enzyme activities, which qualifies it as the third bone fide member of the DT group of bacterial ADPRT enzymes along with ExoA and DT (23Yates S.P. Jorgensen R. Andersen G.R. Merrill A.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Comparison of the ADPRT kinetic parameters for ExoAc and cholixc toxins The kinetic parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values represent the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments.ParameterExoAcCholixc toxinKm(NAD) (μm)121 ± 2145 ± 3Vmax (m s–1)1.3 × 10–71.03 × 10–7kcat (s–1)13 ± 210 ± 3kcat (s–1) catalytic Glu → AlaaThe catalytic Glu to Ala mutations involved Glu-553 (ExoAc) and Glu-581 (cholixc toxin)0.008 ± 0.00010.004 ± 0.003kcat/Km (m–1 s–1)1.1 × 1052.3 × 105a The catalytic Glu to Ala mutations involved Glu-553 (ExoAc) and Glu-581 (cholixc toxin) Open table in a new tab Cholix Toxin Is Active against Eukaryotic Cells—To assess whether cholix toxin possessed biological activity against eukaryotes, we dosed mouse fibroblast cells with both wild-type toxin and a catalytically inactive mutant toxin, E581A, and compared the effects on cell viability (Fig. 1). The E581A mutant toxin had little or no effect on cell viability even at high doses (50 ng/ml) (Fig. 1b), whereas the wild-type toxin showed considerable clearing of cell density (killing) at 1 ng/ml (Fig. 1c) with little or no surviving fibroblast cells at 50 ng/ml (Fig. 1f). Using the cytotoxicity assay described under “Experimental Procedures,” we quantified the sensitivity of mouse fibroblast 1.2 L-M cells to cholix toxin, and the results are shown in Fig. 2a. The IC50 is 4.6 ± 0.4 ng/ml, and this is comparable to the cytotoxicity of ExoA against this mouse fibroblast cell line (43Middlebrook J.L. Dorland R.B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1977; 23: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inactive E581A mutant toxin showed little or no activity against the mouse fibroblast cells (Fig. 2a). The protein inhibition by ExoA and cholix toxin was also tested on mouse cells lines with and without the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) receptor. Fig. 2b shows that cholix toxin recognizes the ubiquitous LRP receptor (44May P. Woldt E. Matz R.L. Boucher P. Ann. Med. 2007; 39: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), which is also the specific receptor that ExoA exploits to enter the target eukaryotic cell (45Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. FitzGerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the cellular intoxication mechanism for cholix toxin is very similar to ExoA but differs from that of DT (46Collier R.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, because the LRP-deficient strain also showed some sensitivity to cholix toxin, it is possible that there may be other avenues, besides the LRP receptor, by which cholix toxin can access the host cell cytoplasm. V. cholerae is an aquatic organism that is often found attached to the exoskeletons of zooplankton (47Tamplin M.L. Gauzens A.L. Huq A. Sack D.A. Colwell R.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 1977-1980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this behavior may provide nutrients and protection against environmental challenges (48Kirn T.J. Jude B.A. Taylor R.K. Nature. 2005; 438: 863-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of purified cholix toxin to act on A. nauplii (brine shrimp), and the results are shown in Fig. 2c. Remarkably, cholix toxin was toxic to A. nauplii, because doses near 50 μg/ml killed all of the crustaceans, yet the E581A cholix toxin mutant had no effect on their viability. We next examined whether cholix toxin was able to specifically and covalently modify the ribosomal eEF2 protein in a mam"

The rotor shaft, an antiparallel α-helical coiled coil of the amino and carboxyl termini of the γ subunit, deeply penetrates the central cavity of the stator cylinder. We truncated the shaft step by step until the remaining rotor head would be outside the cavity and simply sat on the concave entrance of the stator orifice. All truncation mutants rotated in the correct direction, implying torque generation, although the average rotary speeds were low and short mutants exhibited moments of irregular motion.

https://openalex.org/W1984849052,"Seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) exert strong regulatory influences on virtually all physiological processes. Although it is historically assumed that heterotrimeric G proteins mediate these actions, there is a newer appreciation that beta-arrestins, originally thought only to desensitize G protein signaling, also serve as independent receptor signal transducers. Recently, we found that activation of ERK1/2 by the angiotensin receptor occurs via both of these distinct pathways. In this work, we explore the physiological consequences of beta-arrestin ERK1/2 signaling and delineate a pathway that regulates mRNA translation and protein synthesis via Mnk1, a protein that both physically interacts with and is activated by beta-arrestins. We show that beta-arrestin-dependent activation of ERK1/2, Mnk1, and eIF4E are responsible for increasing translation rates in both human embryonic kidney 293 and rat vascular smooth muscle cells. This novel demonstration that beta-arrestins regulate protein synthesis reveals that the spectrum of beta-arrestin-mediated signaling events is broader than previously imagined."
https://openalex.org/W1979628343,"Rhinovirus infection is the most common cause of acute exacerbations of inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, where it provokes steroid refractory and abnormally intense neutrophilic inflammation that can be life threatening. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression correlates with disease severity and neutrophil infiltration in these conditions. However, the role of EGFR signaling in rhinovirus infection is unknown. We measured the key determinants of neutrophilic inflammation interleukin (IL)-8 and ICAM-1 in rhinovirus (RV16 serotype)-infected bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B. RV16 infection stimulated IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression, which was further elevated (2-fold) by transient up-regulation of EGFR levels. Detection of viral RNA by quantitative real time PCR confirmed that enhanced expression was not associated with increased viral replication. EGFR ligands (epiregulin, amphiregulin, and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor) were induced by RV16 infection, and inhibition of metalloproteases responsible for ligand shedding partially suppressed this response. The EGFR inhibitor AG1478, completely blocked IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression to basal levels, as did the specific Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB203580 blocked IL-8 secretion but not ICAM-1 expression, whereas the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin was ineffective in both responses. Kinase inactive K721R EGFR, which is selectively deficient in STAT signaling, reversed RV16 responses associated with EGFR overexpression. In conclusion, RV16 infection rapidly promotes induction of EGFR ligands and utilizes EGFR signaling to increase IL-8 and ICAM-1 levels. These results suggest that targeting EGFR may provide a selective therapy that dampens neutrophil-driven inflammation without compromising essential antiviral pathways mediated by pathogen recognition receptors such as TLR3.

Because it is known that these exacerbations are associated with inflammation that is much more intense, often life threatening, we reasoned that epithelial defects known to occur in these conditions might provide fundamental insights into mechanisms regulating the nature of mucosal responses to pathogens. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease epidermal growth factor EGF receptor extracellular signal-regulated kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription interleukin intercellular adhesion molecule 1 quantitative real time PCR mitogen-activated protein kinase rhinovirus(es) fetal calf serum phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Tolllike receptor(s) activator protein-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay heparin-binding. Respiratory viruses are frequently identified in exacerbations.

Of these viruses, rhinoviruses (RV) are the most common pathogen detected during an asthma or COPD exacerbation, with at least half of viral triggered episodes being associated with RV (4Johnston S.L. Pattemore P.K. Sanderson G. Smith S. Lampe F. Josephs L. Symington P. O'Toole S. Myint S.H. Tyrrell D.A. Holgate S.T.

Wedzicha J.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). The major group of RV including the RV16 strain uses the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) as a receptor to infect the respiratory epithelium (11Arruda E. Boyle T.R. Winther B. Pevear D.C. Gwaltney Jr., J.M. Hayden F.G. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 171: 1329-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because rhinovirus is not itself cytopathic, the intensity of inflammation during the host immune response is thought to be a critical determinant of exacerbation severity (2Mallia P. Johnston S.L. Chest. 2006; 130: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Accordingly in healthy humans RV16 infection produces a trivial inflammatory response, but asthmatics and COPD patients mount a more intense reaction to infection (12Grunberg K. Timmers M.C. de Klerk E.P. Dick E.C. Sterk P.J. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 1375-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Mallia P. Message S.D. Kebadze T. Parker H.L. Kon O.M. Johnston S.L. Respir. Res. 2006; 7: 116Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A common and striking molecular feature of the asthmatic and COPD airway is the induction of receptor tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Because EGFR and its associated ligands regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration, this receptor can coordinate repair of damaged epithelium (14Holgate S.T. Clin. Exp. Allergy 30. 2000; 1: 37-41Crossref Google Scholar). EGFR is normally confined to the intercellular lateral junctions of columnar and basal cells in the bronchial epithelium (15Polosa R. Prosperini G. Leir S.H. Holgate S.T. Lackie P.M. Davies D.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, the asthmatic airway displays increased uniform staining throughout the epithelium including the luminal surface (16Puddicombe S.M. Polosa R. Richter A. Krishna M.T. Howarth P.H.

Howarth P.H. Holgate S.T. Davies D.E. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1362-1374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic smoke exposure also promotes epithelial irritation (18Lannan S. Donaldson K. Brown D. MacNee W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L92-L100PubMed Google Scholar), and EGFR is up-regulated in COPD (16Puddicombe S.M. Polosa R. Richter A. Krishna M.T. Howarth P.H. Holgate S.T. Davies D.E.

Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the polarization of apical expression of EGFR ligands, which are normally separated from basolateral expression of EGFR, is lost. Also, proteases able to liberate membrane-bound latent EGFR ligands are induced; thus the receptor comes into proximity to the milieu of growth factor ligands secreted apically in response to damage mediated by infection. Thus EGFR signaling contributes to inflammation because EGF ligands directly promote steroid refractory production of the major neutrophil chemokine, interleukin-8 (IL-8), in primary epithelial cultures (22Hamilton L.M. Torres-Lozano C. Puddicombe S.M. Richter A. Kimber I. Dearman R.J. Vrugt B. Aalbers R. Holgate S.T. Djukanovic R. Wilson S.J. Davies D.E. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2003; 33: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A strong correlation between EGFR, IL-8, and submucosal neutrophils in asthmatic bronchial biopsies has also been demonstrated (22Hamilton L.M. Torres-Lozano C. Puddicombe S.M. Richter A. Kimber I. Dearman R.J. Vrugt B. Aalbers R. Holgate S.T. Djukanovic R. Wilson S.J. Davies D.E. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2003; 33: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the hypothesis that overexpression of EGFR is a fundamental determinant of epithelial responses to RV16 using IL-8 and ICAM-1 as inflammatory response indices. We dissected the nature of the amplifying effect of EGFR pharmacologically and by genetic manipulation of EGFR. Our findings show that the EGFR/Erk pathway regulates RV16 induction of IL-8 and ICAM-1, and overexpression of EGFR augments their release in a STAT-dependent manner. Thus targeting EGFR may offer an effective therapy that reduces the inflammatory burden associated with asthma and COPD exacerbations, which operates independently of the antiviral defenses of the hosts. Cell Culture—Human BEAS-2B cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with 50 mg/ml of bovine pituitary extract and 5 μg/ml of epidermal growth factor, and minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate and antibiotics (5 μg/ml gentamycin, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). HeLa cells of the Ohio strain were a gift from Dr. Reena Ghildyal (Department of Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia) and were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamycin. All of the cell culture medium and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. Viral Stock Preparation—RV16 (gift from Dr. Ghildyal, Monash) was cultured in Ohio-HeLa cells. Stock viruses were inoculated onto HeLa cells until a cytopathic effect was observed. Supernatant was collected, and the cell debris was cleared by centrifugation. RV16 was titrated by diluting stock virus (10-1 to 10-8) and then inoculating HeLa cells in 96-well plates. Upon observation of cytopathic effect, TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious dose) was determined by the Reed-Muench method. Transient Expression of EGFR cDNA—Human EGFR cDNA and the kinase inactive EGFR mutant (K721R) cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA1 (Invitrogen) have been previously reported (23Walker F. Kato A. Gonez L.J. Hibbs M.L. Pouliot N. Levitzki A. Burgess A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). BEAS-2B cells were plated out in 6-well multidishes for 24 h prior to transfection using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen). Transfections were carried out in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% FCS together with 5 μg/ml gentamycin, and the cells were infected with RV 24 h post-transfection. Cell Infection and Inhibitors—The cells were infected with RV16 (multiplicity of infection of 2) for 1 h on a rocker at 37 °C and subsequently replenished with fresh maintenance medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% FCS). In some experiments, prior to infection, the cells were exposed to selective inhibitors for 30 min. The EGFR blocker AG1478 (10 μm; Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), the Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126 (10 μm; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm; Sigma), the broad spectrum protease inhibitor GM6001 (10 μm; Biomol), and tumor necrosis factor proteinase inhibitor-1 (10 μm; Merck) were used. At specified time points cell pellets were harvested, archived at -70° C, and subsequently subjected to Western analysis and quantitative real time PCR (QPCR) as detailed below. Quantification of IL-8, EGFR, and ICAM-1 Protein—Cell-free supernatants were collected, and IL-8 concentration was measured using commercially available paired antibodies and standards, following the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen). Western blotting was performed to quantify EGFR, ICAM-1, and tubulin levels as previously described (24Bozinovski S. Jones J.E. Vlahos R. Hamilton J.A. Anderson G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42808-42814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies (Cell Signaling) were incubated overnight at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography using chemiluminescence (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using Kodak EDAS one-dimensional image analysis software. RNA Extraction and QPCR—Total RNA was isolated from individual samples, according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The purified RNA was used as a template to generate first-strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) as previously described (25Bozinovski S. Jones J. Beavitt S.J. Cook A.D. Hamilton J.A. Anderson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L877-L885Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). QPCR was performed using the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). For IL-8 and ICAM-1, TaqMan probe/primer combinations were used. A total volume of 10 μl was used for TaqMan PCR using AmpliTaq Gold polymerase and universal master mix (Applied Biosystems). EGFR ligands primers listed in Table 1 (EGF, HB-EGF, transforming growth factor α, epiregulin, and amphiregulin) were designed using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems), and the reactions were performed using SYBR green master mix (Invitrogen). Default PCR thermal profiles were used as previously described (25Bozinovski S. Jones J. Beavitt S.J. Cook A.D. Hamilton J.A. Anderson G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L877-L885Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The threshold cycle numbers were calculated using the ΔΔCT relative value method using 18 S rRNA as the housekeeping gene. RV16 viral RNA detection was achieved with the OL26 and OL27 primers (26Johnston S.L. Sanderson G. Pattemore P.K. Smith S. Bardin P.G. Bruce C.B. Lambden P.R. Tyrrell D.A. Holgate S.T. J. Clin.

A standard curve was constructed for viral RNA using 10-fold serial dilutions of the RV16 cloned plasmid (gift from Dr. Mandy Lindsay, Department of Medicine, Monash University).TABLE 1Primer sequences used to determine gene expression by QPCRTargetSequenceTransforming growth factor αSense5′–TGGTGGTGGTCTCCATCGTAntisense5′–AGCAGTGTATCAGCACACATGTGAEGFSense5′–GTGCAGCTTCAGGACCACAAAntisense5′–AAATGCATGTGTCGAATATCTTGAGHB-EGFSense5′–CGGTGCGGGACCATGAAntisense5′–GAGAGAACTGCAGCCAGAAAGAGAmphiregulinSense5′–ACTCGGCTCAGGCCATTATGAntisense5′–CGCTTCCCAGAGTAGGTGTCAEpiregulinSense5′–TTGTTTGCATGGACAGTGCATAntisense5′–CCCACTTCACACCTGCAGTAGTT18 SSense5′–CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAATTCAntisense5′–TTGGCAAATGCTTTCGCTCRV16OL265′–GCACTTCTGTTTCCCCOL275′–CGGACACCCAAAGTAG Open table in a new tab IL-8 Expression Is Augmented in RV16-infected Cells Overexpressing EGFR—RV16 infection of BEAS-2B cells led to rapid viral RNA production within 3 h, increasing over the 40-h incubation period as assessed by detection of viral RNA using QPCR (Fig. 1A). Although a previous study did not detect RV14 virus within 4 h of BEAS-2B infection (27Subauste M.C. Jacoby D.B. Richards S.M. Proud D. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), the serial titers methodology used in that study is markedly less sensitive than QPCR-based approaches (28Dagher H. Donninger H. Hutchinson P. Ghildyal R. Bardin P. J. Virol. Methods. 2004; 117: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). RV16 infection stimulated IL-8 secretion that was significantly greater than diluent-treated cells. IL-8 production occurred within 3 h of infection, and the levels remained significantly elevated over the 40-h time course (Fig. 1B). The early induction of IL-8 is consistent with early detection of viral RNA production in infected cells. BEAS-2B cells express low endogenous EGFR levels that are at the lower limit of detection by Western analysis. Cells transfected with EGFR cDNA displayed markedly higher EGFR levels (Fig. 2A), and the protocol was standardized to reproducibly increase receptor levels by about 10–15-fold. Importantly, cells overexpressing EGFR secreted 2-fold more IL-8 in supernatants collected at the indicated time points (Fig. 2B). To assess whether IL-8 levels were being transcriptionally regulated, mRNA expression was analyzed by QPCR. Like protein secretion, RV16 infection induced IL-8 transcript, and this was further enhanced 2-fold in EGFR-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2C). Elevated EGFR levels also promoted an increase in basal IL-8 mRNA expression (Fig. 2C), which is consistent with the significant correlation between EGFR and IL-8 expression in asthmatic bronchial biopsies (22Hamilton L.M. Torres-Lozano C. Puddicombe S.M. Richter A. Kimber I. Dearman R.J. Vrugt B. Aalbers R. Holgate S.T. Djukanovic R. Wilson S.J. Davies D.E. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2003; 33: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). ICAM-1 Induction by EGFR Overexpression—ICAM-1 has previously been reported to be induced by RV16 infection (29Papi A. Johnston S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9707-9720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and likewise we observed a 2-fold increase in ICAM-1 mRNA that was only significant at the early time points (Fig. 3A). Consistent with transcript levels at 40 h, RV16 infection did not significantly alter ICAM-1 protein expression above vehicle-treated cells, as assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). In contrast, RV16 infection significantly increased ICAM-1 levels in cells overexpressing EGFR. There was a small and nonsignificant trend toward increased ICAM-1 expression in vehicle or diluent-treated cells transfected with EGFR cDNA. To assess whether increased inflammatory markers were associated with greater RV16 replication, viral RNA levels were measured in cells expressing endogenous and elevated EGFR. As shown in Fig. 4, no difference in viral RNA quantity was observed over 40 h, thus implicating alternate mechanisms for IL-8 and ICAM-1 amplification.FIGURE 4Viral replication is unaltered in EGFR-transfected cells. Untransfected (open bar) and EGFR-transfected (closed bar) cells infected with RV16 over 40 h were subjected to QPCR for detection of viral RNA. No significant difference in productive viral replication was observed over the time course in with EGFR transfected cells (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mechanisms of EGFR Activation in RV16-infected Cells—Autocrine production of EGFR ligands in response to epithelial damage is associated with wound repair mechanisms (14Holgate S.T. Clin. Exp. Allergy 30. 2000; 1: 37-41Crossref Google Scholar); however ligand production in response to RV16 infection has not been investigated. Hence, we measured a panel of EGFR ligands by QPCR in RV16-infected BEAS-2B cells. As shown in Fig. 5, amphiregulin, and HB-EGF was elevated 1.5-fold in RV16-infected cells at the 3-h time point. We also observed a 2-fold induction of epiregulin in response to RV16 infection, again at the early 3-h time point, indicating a direct viral-mediated process for ligand up-regulation. Transforming growth factor α was not significantly altered by RV16, and unaltered CT (threshold) values for EGF were only detected at the later cycles (cycles 35–40; data not shown). Like other membrane-anchored growth factors, EGFR ligands exist as transmembrane precursors that are proteolytically cleaved and released to promote receptor engagement (30Massague J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Ectodomain shedding is regulated by matrix metalloproteases and the alternate class of metalloproteases known as ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteases). To assess the role of metalloproteases in RV-mediated inflammatory events, we utilized the broad spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor, GM6001. IL-8 production in RV16-infected cells expressing endogenous receptor levels was suppressed with GM6001 by 50% (Fig. 6A). Likewise, enhanced IL-8 production in EGFR-overexpressing cells was blocked with GM6001 by about 50% compared with RV16-infected cells expressing endogenous receptor levels. GM6001 also significantly reduced ICAM-1 expression associated with elevated EGFR levels (Fig. 6B). We also utilized the selective ADAMs inhibitor tumor necrosis factor proteinase inhibitor-1 and observed no inhibitory effect on RV-mediated IL-8 production (data not shown). Collectively, these results implicate matrix metalloproteases in ectodermal ligand shedding.FIGURE 6The broad spectrum matrix metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 reduces IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression associated with EGFR overexpression. BEAS-2B cells expressing endogenous (open bar) or elevated (closed bar) EGFR levels were infected with RV16 for 40 h in the presence of vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) or the GM6001 (GM) inhibitor. Supernatant was collected and used to measure secreted IL-8 by ELISA (A), and cell pellets were retained for QPCR assessment of ICAM-1 expression (B). *, p < 0.05 by t test (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) EGFR Signaling Pathways Regulating IL-8 and ICAM-1 Expression—Ligand engagement of EGFR promotes formation of homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes with its closely related family member ErbB2/HER2, leading to receptor activation. Upon activation, multiple pathways are engaged and include (i) Ras/Erk MAPK, (ii) PI3K/Akt, and (iii) STAT transcription factors (31Jorissen R.N. Walker F. Pouliot N. Garrett T.P. Ward C.W. Burgess A.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 31-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). To evaluate these signaling pathways, selective pharmacological inhibitors were used. The EGFR receptor blocker, AG1478 suppressed IL-8 production to baseline levels (Fig. 7A), implicating EGFR signaling in endogenous and overexpressed systems. The Erk pathway blocker, U0126 also effectively blocked IL-8 production equivalent to AG1478 inhibitor levels. In contrast, the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor, wortmannin did not reduce IL-8 expression. The p38 MAPK has previously been shown to regulate cytokine production in response to RV infection, and consistent with this study (32Griego S.D. Weston C.B. Adams J.L. Tal-Singer R. Dillon S.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5211-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we observed a significant decline in SB203580 treated cells. Enhanced ICAM-1 expression in EGFR-overexpressing cells was inhibited by AG1478 and U0126 (Fig. 7B). Wortmannin was again ineffective at reducing ICAM-1 induction attributed to EGFR overexpression. In contrast to IL-8, p38 MAPK does not regulate ICAM-1 expression because SB203580 did not alter its expression. We next introduced EGFR kinase inactive K721R cDNA into RV16-infected BEAS-2B cells. This construct is defective in ATP binding and is unique in that it retains its ability to heterodimerize with ErbB2. This interaction is sufficient for activation of Erk and Akt pathways; however, STAT activation is completely absent (23Walker F. Kato A. Gonez L.J. Hibbs M.L. Pouliot N. Levitzki A. Burgess A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7192-7204Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Deb T.B. Su L. Wong L. Bonvini E. Wells A. David M. Johnson G.R. J. Biol.

Here, we observed that IL-8 and ICAM-1 expression attributed to elevated EGFR levels were reversed in EGFR K712R-expressing cells (Fig. 8). Hence, STAT signaling is unconditionally required for induction of inflammatory markers associated with enhanced EGFR expression.FIGURE 8EGFR signaling triggered by RV16 also utilizes STAT transcription factors to increase IL-8 and ICAM-1 levels. BEAS-2B cells were transfected with an empty vector control (Vector), EGFR (WT), or kinase inactive EGFR (K721R) that has defective STAT signaling but retains its ability to activate Erk1/2 and Akt. 40 h following RV16 infection, supernatants were retained for IL-8 measurement by ELISA (A) and cell pellets were subjected to Western analysis using specific antibodies to ICAM-1 and α-tubulin (B).

https://openalex.org/W1971351672,"Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy at low temperatures was used to investigate vibrations of Au(111) and Cu(111). The low-energy peaks at 9 millielectron volts (meV) on Au(111) and 21 meV on Cu(111) are attributed to phonons at surfaces. On Au(111), the phonon energy is not influenced by the different stacking of the surface atoms, but it is considerably influenced by different atomic distances within the surface layer. The spatial variation of the phonon excitation is measured in inelastic electron tunneling maps on Au(111), which display atomic resolution. This atomic resolution is explained in terms of site-specific phonon excitation probabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2026266460,"B lymphocytes express both B cell receptor and Toll-like receptors (TLR). We show here that Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a critical component in B cell receptor signaling, is also involved in TLR9 signaling in B cells. Stimulation of B cells with TLR9 ligand CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) leads to transient phosphorylation of Btk, and in the absence of Btk, TLR9-induced proliferation of B cells is impaired. Interestingly, Btk–/– B cells secrete significantly more interleukin (IL)-12 but much less IL-10 compared with wild type B cells upon TLR9 stimulation. Immunization of Btk–/– mice with CpG ODN also leads to elevated levels of IL-12 in vivo and consequently, a greater -fold increment in the production of Th1 type IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies in these mice compared with wild type controls. The addition of exogenous recombinant IL-10 could suppress IL-12 production by TLR9-activated Btk–/– B cells, suggesting that in B cells, Btk negatively regulates IL-12 through the induction of autocrine IL-10 production. TLR9 signaling also leads to the activation of NFκB, including the p65RelA subunit in wild type B cells. The lack of Btk signaling affects the activation of NFκB and impairs the translocation of the p65RelA subunit to the nucleus of B cells upon TLR9 stimulation. However, p65RelA–/– B cells could respond similarly to wild type B cells in terms of IL-10 and IL-12 secretion when stimulated with CpG ODN, suggesting that the defect in NFκB p65RelA activation is additional to the impairment in cytokine production in TLR9-activated Btk–/– B cells. Thus, Btk plays an important role in TLR9 signaling and acts separately to regulate NFκB RelA activation as well as IL-10 and IL-12 production in B cells. B lymphocytes express both B cell receptor and Toll-like receptors (TLR). We show here that Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a critical component in B cell receptor signaling, is also involved in TLR9 signaling in B cells.

Immunization of Btk–/– mice with CpG ODN also leads to elevated levels of IL-12 in vivo and consequently, a greater -fold increment in the production of Th1 type IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies in these mice compared with wild type controls. The addition of exogenous recombinant IL-10 could suppress IL-12 production by TLR9-activated Btk–/– B cells, suggesting that in B cells, Btk negatively regulates IL-12 through the induction of autocrine IL-10 production. TLR9 signaling also leads to the activation of NFκB, including the p65RelA subunit in wild type B cells. The lack of Btk signaling affects the activation of NFκB and impairs the translocation of the p65RelA subunit to the nucleus of B cells upon TLR9 stimulation. However, p65RelA–/– B cells could respond similarly to wild type B cells in terms of IL-10 and IL-12 secretion when stimulated with CpG ODN, suggesting that the defect in NFκB p65RelA activation is additional to the impairment in cytokine production in TLR9-activated Btk–/– B cells. Thus, Btk plays an important role in TLR9 signaling and acts separately to regulate NFκB RelA activation as well as IL-10 and IL-12 production in B cells. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), 3The abbreviations used are: Btk, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; BCR, B cell receptor; TLR, Toll-like receptor(s); LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IL, interleukin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcription. a member of the Tec family of protein-tyrosine kinases, has been shown to play important roles in B cell development, activation, and survival. Mutations in Btk are known to lead to X-linked agammaglobulinemia in humans and X-linked immunodeficiency in mice (1Satterthwaite A.B. Witte O.N. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 175: 120-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These diseases are characterized by a block in B-lymphopoiesis and CD5+ B-1 cell generation, defects in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, and impairment in humoral immune responses to certain types of T cell-independent antigens (2Fruman D.A. Satterthwaite A.B. Witte O.N. Immunity. 2000; 13: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Structurally, Btk contains multiple protein-protein interaction domains. It has a pleckstrin homology domain for membrane localization following its activation, as well as Src homology 2, Src homology 3, and proline-rich domains for binding other signaling molecules. In addition, it possesses multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Hence, Btk is postulated to play a key role in signal transduction processes. Signaling by various receptors in B cells activates Btk. These receptors include immune receptors, such as the BCR and the receptor for IgE, FcϵRII (3Hata D. Kawakami Y. Inagaki N. Lantz C.S. Kitamura T. Khan W.N. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Miura T. Han W. Hartman S.E. Yao L. Nagai H. Goldfeld A.E. Alt F.W. Galli S.J. Witte O.N. Kawakami T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1235-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), as well as various cytokine receptors (4Matsuda T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fukada T. Okuyama Y. Fujitani Y. Tsukada S. Mano H. Hirai H. Witte O.N. Hirano T. Blood. 1995; 85: 627-633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sato S. Katagiri T. Takaki S. Kikuchi Y. Hitoshi Y. Yonehara S. Tsukada S. Kitamura D. Watanabe T. Witte O. Takatsu K. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2101-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). B lymphocytes also express innate immune receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLR). Presently, it is not quite clear whether Btk is also activated by the various TLR and whether it is involved in TLR signaling in B cells given that Btk is critically required for signaling by the BCR. TLR are innate immune receptors that recognize molecular patterns that are unique to and invariant among entire classes of microbes. Such pathogen-associated molecular patterns are found on LPS, bacterial lipoproteins and lipoteichoic acids, flagellin, and unmethylated CpG DNA of bacteria and viruses (6Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). Different pathogen-associated molecular patterns are recognized by different TLR (e.g. LPS is recognized by TLR4 in conjunction with other molecules, such as CD14, whereas CpG DNA is recognized by TLR9 and flagellin is recognized by TLR5). Most TLR are plasma membrane-bound receptors, but a few, such as TLR3, -7, and -9, are found in the endosomes. All TLR share a common structural feature in their cytoplasmic portions in the form of a Toll/IL-1 receptor domain that is critical for signal transduction. Engagement of TLR by ligands triggers a signaling cascade that involves the activation of adaptor molecules, such as MyD88, TRIF, TIRAP, and TRAM as well as IL-1R-associated kinase and TNFR-associated factor 6, which leads ultimately to the activation of NFκB and MAP kinase signaling pathways (7Takeda K. Akira S. Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). Since signaling by the TLR is complex, it is conceivable that more molecules could be involved in their signal transduction process. Some of these molecules could be shared components with other signal transduction systems, such as the BCR signaling system. This may be especially so in the context of a B cell, which expresses both BCR and TLR. One obvious and possible shared candidate between BCR and TLR signaling would be Btk. The notion that Btk might be involved in TLR signaling was suggested by the previous finding that peritoneal macrophages derived from X-linked immunodeficiency mice exhibited reduced responses to LPS (8Mukhopadhyay S. Mohanty M. Mangla A. George A. Bal V. Rath S. Ravindran B. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2914-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It was also shown recently that Btk was involved in NFκB activation in macrophages stimulated by LPS (9Doyle S.L. Jefferies C.A. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23496-23501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Jefferies C.A. Doyle S. Brunner C. Dunne A. Brint E. Wietek C. Walch E. Wirth T. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26258-26264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, LPS binds both TLR4 and CD14 (11Rallabhandi P. Bell J. Boukhvalova M.S. Medvedev A. Lorenz E. Arditi M. Hemming V.G. Blanco J.C. Segal D.M. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Dunzendorfer S. Lee H.K. Soldau K. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), hence making it ambiguous whether Btk is indeed involved in TLR signaling per se. Moreover, most studies of Btk involvement in TLR signaling had been done in macrophages and dendritic cells (13Schmidt N.W. Thieu V.T. Mann B.A. Ahyi A.N. Kaplan M.H. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 7203-7210Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Liljeroos M. Vuolteenaho R. Morath S. Hartung T. Hallman M. Ojaniemi M. Cell.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and it is not clear if Btk is involved in TLR signaling in B cells. Furthermore, even if Btk is involved in signaling by TLR4 (10Jefferies C.A. Doyle S. Brunner C. Dunne A. Brint E. Wietek C. Walch E. Wirth T. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26258-26264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) that is expressed on the plasma membrane, it is not clear whether Btk is involved in signaling by the endosome-located TLR, such as TLR9. To definitively assess whether Btk is involved in TLR signaling and to determine the effect of a lack of Btk in TLR engagement in B cells, we have now examined the role of Btk in signal transduction by TLR9, which is a homotrimeric receptor located in the endosomes and activated by cellular recognition of unmethylated CpG-DNA. We show here that Btk deficiency impairs TLR9-induced cellular proliferation of B cells. Furthermore, the absence of Btk signaling during TLR9 engagement also altered B cell production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12 and IL-10, respectively, and biased the sera antibody profile in Btk–/– mice toward that of a Th1 type, since there was greater production of IgG2b and IgG3 antibodies. At a molecular level, the lack of Btk signaling leads to defective NFκB activation and to the nuclear translocation of the p65RelA subunit in TLR9-activated B cells. This defect is additional to the impairment in cytokine production in Btk–/– B cells, since B cells lacking p65RelA could respond in a normal manner as wild type B cells in terms of IL-10 and IL-12 production when treated with CpG ODN. Thus, Btk separately regulates NFκBp65RelA activation and cytokine production during TLR9 engagement in B cells. Mice—Wild type C57BL/6 and Btk–/– mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). NFκB p65RelA–/– mice were obtained from Dr. Amer A. Beg (University of South Florida) and bred and housed in our facilities. Experiments with mice were performed according to guidelines issued by the National Advisory Committee on Laboratory Animal Research. Preparation and Stimulation of B Lymphocytes—Single cell suspensions were prepared from spleens of mice and treated with red blood cell lysis solution (0.15 m NH4Cl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.2). B cells were obtained to >90% purity using a negative selection protocol with anti-CD43 mAb-coupled magnetic beads (Miltenyl Biotech). B cells were cultured in 48-well flat bottom plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and stimulated with CpG ODN 1826 (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA), LPS 0111:B4 (Sigma), or goat anti-mouse IgM F(ab′)2 fragment (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). For proliferation assays, cells were stimulated for 48 h in 96-well round bottom plates and pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) for a further 6 h before harvest. Cell proliferation was quantified by a MicroBeta TriLux scintillation counter. For cell stimulation in Western blot analyses, 1 × 107 cells suspended in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-IgM antibodies, 100 ng/ml LPS, or varying concentrations of CpG ODN at 37 °C for various periods of time. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blot Analyses—Splenic B cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in phospholysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and sonicated. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were recovered for protein quantification by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation studies, antibodies were first coupled to Protein A/G Plus-agarose (SC-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and incubated with precleared cell lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, beads were boiled in loading buffer for 5 min to release the proteins. For Western blot analyses, 30 μg of whole cell lysates or 5 μg of nuclear extracts were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, MA). The membranes were subsequently probed with antibodies against various signaling molecules. The anti-Btk, anti-ERK2, anti-IκBα, anti-HDAC1, and anti-RelA antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. Densitometric analyses of Btk phosphorylation was carried out using a Bio-Rad imaging densitometer and multianalysis software, and pixel intensity (absorbance units/mm2) was normalized to the corresponding total protein and expressed as -fold increase in intensity over the control nonstimulated sample. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Cells were stimulated at 5 × 106 cells in Opti-MEM medium and processed with NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). The nuclear extract (5 μg) was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled, double-stranded probe containing two tandem NFκB-binding sites, 5′-CATGGCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAACT-3′ and 5′-CATGAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. The reaction was performed in 20 μl of binding buffer (60 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 62.5% glycerol, and 1 mg of poly(dI-dC)) for 30 min on ice. After incubation, samples were resolved in a 5% native gel for 3 h. The gel was dried for 1 h and exposed to autoradiography film. To verify equal amounts of proteins used in the nuclear extracts, a control oligonucleotide for NF-Y was used. Measurement of Cytokine Production by ELISA—Untreated or CpG ODN-stimulated wild type and Btk–/– B cells were cultured in 48-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/ml. At 16 h poststimulation, supernatants were harvested and stored at –20 °C or immediately assayed for cytokine production. To measure serum IL-12 level in vivo, mice were given a single dose of 50 μg CpG ODN and bled every 2 h. The concentrations of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, and IL-12p70 as well as IL-23p19 were determined using commercial ELISA kits (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from wild type and Btk–/– B cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized with Superscript II reverse transcriptase as per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 real time PCR system using the following primers: TLR9, 5′-CCCTGGTGTGGAACATCATTC-3′ and 5′-CCCGAGGCTCCCTCTGA-3′; IL-10, 5′-CAGCCAGGTGAAGACTTTCT-3′ and 5′-GTAACCCTTAAAGTCCTGCATT-3′; actin, 5′-AGATGACCCAGATCATGTTTGAGA-3′ and 5′-CACAGCCTGGATGGCTACGTA-3′. The cDNAs for NFκB p65RelA and HPRT mRNA were amplified by PCR with the following primers: NFκB p65RelA, 5′-GAGGTGTATTTCACGGGACC-3′ and 5′-CATTGAAAGGACTCTTCTTCATG-3′; HPRT, 5′-TTGCTGGTAAAAAGGACCTCTCGA-3′ and 5′-CCACAGGACTAGAACACCTGCTAA-3′. In Vivo CpG ODN Administration and Measurement of Serum Antibody Levels—Wild type and Btk–/– mice were injected with 20 μg of CpG ODN at every 2-day interval and bled at day 7 to measure serum Ig levels. NUNC Maxisorp 384-well plates were coated with 0.5 μg/ml anti-mouse Igκ antibody (Pharmingen). Serially diluted serum (20 μl) was added to each well and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Samples were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 prior to incubation with biotinylated rat anti-mouse IgM, IgG2b, or IgG3 antibodies (BD Pharmingen), which were followed by streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. Finally, BD OptEIA detection reagent (BD Biosciences) was applied, and colorimetric changes were quantified by measuring absorbance at 450 nm with a TECAN Genios multiplate reader. Flow Cytometry—Cells were stained with optimal amounts of fluorescein isothiocyanate-, phycoerythrin-, and biotin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for 10 min on ice and washed three times with staining medium. Biotin-conjugated antibodies were revealed with streptavidin-CyChrome. Flow cytometry analyses were performed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). The florochrome-conjugated anti-IgM, anti-IgD, anti-CD25, anti-CD69, anti-CD86, and anti-major histocompatibility complex class II antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test (Prism; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). p values of <0.05 were considered significant and marked with an asterisk. Btk Is Transiently Phosphorylated upon CpG ODN Stimulation of B Cells—To determine if Btk is involved in TLR9 signaling in B cells, we first examined if Btk is phosphorylated and, hence, activated upon CpG ODN stimulation of murine primary B lymphocytes. We treated purified wild type splenic B cells with either anti-IgM antibodies that cross-linked the BCR, LPS that engaged TLR4/CD14, or CpG ODN that stimulated TLR9. As expected and shown in Fig. 1A, Btk was activated, as indicated by its tyrosine phosphorylation status, upon stimulation of B cells via the BCR. LPS treatment of B cells also led to the activation of Btk, although its phosphorylation pattern appeared to be of shorter duration compared with that induced by the anti-IgM antibodies (Fig. 1B). Likewise, stimulation of B lymphocytes with CpG ODN also led to a transient phosphorylation of Btk at the 5 min time point, as evidenced by the Western blot analysis and quantification of Btk phosphorylation by densitometry (Fig. 1C). Thus, the data indicate that Btk is transiently activated upon TLR9 engagement and suggested that Btk could be involved in some aspects of TLR signaling. Btk Deficiency Impaired CpG ODN-induced Cellular Proliferation of B Lymphocytes—Since Btk was transiently phosphorylated upon the engagement of TLR4 and TLR9, we were interested in elucidating the physiological role that Btk played during TLR activation in B cells. We focused on TLR9 as a model system, since this TLR had been implicated in various B cell autoimmune diseases (16Lamphier M.S. Sirois C.M. Verma A. Golenbock D.T. Latz E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1082: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Christensen S.R. Kashgarian M. Alexopoulou L. Flavell R.A. Akira S. Shlomchik M.J. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 18Viglianti G.A. Lau C.M. Hanley T.M. Miko B.A. Shlomchik M.J. Marshak-Rothstein A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), and the role of Btk in TLR9 signaling had not been well studied. We first examined the ability of Btk–/– B cells to up-regulate the expression of cell surface activation markers in response to TLR9 engagement. Our data indicated that wild type and Btk–/– B cells could up-regulate the expression of CD25 (IL-2Rα), CD69 (early activation marker), CD86 (B7.2), and major histocompatibility complex class II antigens after overnight treatment with CpG ODN (data not shown). This suggested that the absence of Btk did not impair TLR9-induced up-regulation of activation markers in B cells. We next determined the ability of Btk–/– B cells to undergo cellular proliferation upon CpG ODN treatment (Fig. 2A). Wild type B cells proliferated in a dose-dependent manner upon CpG ODN stimulation, similar to their responses to treatment with LPS and anti-IgM antibodies. Interestingly, Btk–/– B cells could also proliferate in response to CpG ODN treatment; however, the extent of their cellular proliferation was much reduced compared with that of wild type B cells across the various concentrations of CpG ODN used in the stimulation assay. Thus, Btk–/– B cells appeared to have impairment of proliferative response to CpG ODN stimulation. As control and consistent with previous studies (19Khan W.N. Alt F.W. Gerstein R.M. Malynn B.A. Larsson I. Rathbun G. Davidson L. Muller S. Kantor A.B. Herzenberg L.A. Rosen F.S. Sideras P. Immunity. 1995; 3: 283-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), Btk–/– B cells could not respond to stimulation by anti-IgM antibodies. It was conceivable that the reduced cellular proliferation of Btk–/– B cells in response to CpG ODN was a result of reduced TLR9 expression in these mutant cells. To determine if this was the case, we directly quantified the amount of TLR9 mRNA expression by real time qPCR and showed that both Btk–/– and wild type B cells expressed an equivalent amount of TLR9 mRNA (Fig. 2B), indicating that the impairment in CpG ODN-induced proliferation in Btk–/– B cells was not due to abnormal expression of TLR9 in these cells. Thus, the data indicate that Btk is involved in regulating TLR9-induced cellular proliferation but not up-regulation of activation markers in B cells. Enhanced IL-12 and Reduced IL-10 Production in TLR9-activated Btk–/– B Cells—Other than the induction of cellular proliferation, TLR engagement is also known to trigger the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-α, in macrophages and dendritic cells (20Sabet M. Cottam H.B. Guiney D.G. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2006; 47: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Roelofs M.F. Joosten L.A. Abdollahi-Roodsaz S. van Lieshout A.W. Sprong T. van den Hoogen F.H. van den Berg W.B. Radstake T.R. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 2313-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To determine if Btk plays a role in TLR signaling of inflammatory cytokine production, we assayed for cytokine secretion after CpG ODN stimulation of purified wild type and Btk–/– B cells. As seen in Fig. 3A and compared with wild type B cells, Btk–/– B cells produced a higher amount of IL-6 after overnight stimulation with CpG ODN. This was in agreement with previous reports demonstrating higher IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated Btk–/– macrophages (13Schmidt N.W. Thieu V.T. Mann B.A. Ahyi A.N. Kaplan M.H. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 7203-7210Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CpG ODN-stimulated Btk–/– B cells also secreted significantly more IL-12p40 compared with similarly treated wild type B cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the absence of Btk signaling resulted in augmented production of this cytokine in B cells. IL-12p40 can be secreted as homodimers that have no known biological activity or as a heterodimer with IL-12p35 to form the biologically active IL-12p70 molecule (22Trinchieri G. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 365-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) or with IL-23p19 to form the biologically active IL-23 (23Trinchieri G. Pflanz S. Kastelein R.A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 641-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). We subsequently assayed for the presence of bioactive IL-12p70 molecules and showed that Btk–/– B cells indeed secreted larger amounts of IL-12p70 upon TLR9 engagement compared with wild type B cells (Fig. 3C). However, there was no appreciable amount of IL-23 secretion by wild type or Btk–/– B cells when stimulated with CpG ODN (data not shown). Thus, Btk deficiency leads to augmented production of IL-6 and IL-12 in TLR9-activated B cells. Since CpG ODN-stimulated Btk–/– B cells secreted significantly more IL-12, it remained possible that the production of other cytokines could also be perturbed. Hence, we assayed for IL-10 secretion in TLR9-stimulated wild type and Btk–/– B cells, since B lymphocytes were known to produce an appreciable amount of this cytokine. As shown in Fig. 4A, wild type B cells secreted IL-10 in response to CpG ODN stimulation. However, IL-10 secretion was not detectable in similarly treated Btk–/– B cells. Real time RT-PCR assays further confirmed that Btk–/– B cells did not up-regulate the expression of IL-10 mRNA upon CpG ODN stimulation, unlike the case for wild type B cells (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that in contrast to the negative regulation of IL-12 secretion, Btk positively regulates IL-10 production during TLR 9 signaling in B cells. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine and is known to modulate IL-12 production in dendritic cells and macrophages (24Akdis C.A. Blaser K. Immunology. 2001; 103: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Snijders A. Hilkens C.M. van der Pouw Kraan T.C. Engel M. Aarden L.A. Kapsenberg M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1207-1212PubMed Google Scholar, 26Aste-Amezaga M. Ma X. Sartori A. Trinchieri G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5936-5944PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of IL-10 production in CpG ODN-stimulated Btk–/– B cells could be a plausible cause for the enhanced IL-12 secretion in these cells. To test this possibility, we treated CpG ODN-stimulated Btk–/– B cells with varying concentrations of recombinant IL-10 and measured their subsequent secretion of IL-12. As seen in Fig. 4C, the addition of increasing amounts of recombinant IL-10 to CpG ODN-stimulated Btk–/– B cells led to a corresponding reduction in IL-12 secretion by these cells, suggesting that IL-10 production by B cells could modulate their secretion of IL-12. Thus, taken together, the data indicate that Btk negatively regulates IL-12 secretion via the autocrine induction of IL-10 production. Btk–/– Mice Have Enhanced Serum IL-12 Level and Exhibited Greater -Fold Induction of Th1 Type Antibody Production upon CpG ODN Immunizations—CpG ODN has been proposed as an adjuvant to boost immune responses (27Verthelyi D. Methods Mol. Med. 2006; 127: 139-158PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chaung H.C. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2006; 6: 1586-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Klinman D.M. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 25: 135-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We had shown that CpG ODN treatment of Btk–/– B cells in vitro led to their higher secretion of IL-12 (Fig. 3). Thus, CpG ODN engagement of TLR9 could have direct application in boosting cytokine or antibody levels in certain immunodeficient patients. To determine if CpG ODN could be relevant in these applications and if it could induce a higher level of proinflammatory cytokine production in vivo, we directly challenged wild type and Btk–/– mice with CpG ODN and monitored the amount of IL-12 in the sera of these mice at various time points postimmunization. As seen in Fig. 5A, CpG ODN treatment could indeed boost the level of serum IL-12 in wild type and Btk–/– mice. Interestingly, after a single dose of CpG ODN, Btk–/– mice had significantly more IL-12 in their sera at the 4 and 8 h time points postadministration compared with wild type mice. Although various other cell types in addition to B cells could have contributed to the production of IL-12 in wild type and Btk–/– mice, the data nevertheless supported our in vitro findings with Btk–/– B cells, namely that IL-12 secretion was enhanced in TLR9-stimulated cells lacking Btk. IL-12 is a Th1 type cytokine and is known to induce B cell antibody class switching to that of IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 (30Trinchieri G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar, 31Szabo S.J. Sullivan B.M. Peng S.L. Glimcher L.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 713-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar, 32Krieg A.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 709-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). It is known that Btk–/– mice are deficient in serum IgG3 antibodies. We therefore assessed if the augmented secretion of IL-12 during CpG ODN treatment could enhance IgG3 antibody levels or lead to greater -fold induction of Th1 type antibody production in Btk–/– mice compared with wild type mice. To accomplish this, we have focused on measuring the serum level of IgG2b and IgG3 in wild type and Btk–/– mice with or without CpG ODN immunization. As shown in Fig. 5B, CpG ODN-administered Btk–/– mice produced significantly more IgG2b antibodies in their sera compared with nontreated Btk–/– and wild type mice as well as CpG ODN-treated wild type mice. This is consistent with the higher level of serum IL-12 in CpG ODN-treated Btk–/– mice and with previous findings that IL-12 could bias antibody class switching to IgG2b. Interestingly, CpG ODN immunization could also elevate the level of IgG3 antibodies in Btk–/– mice compared with nontreated Btk–/– mice, although the level did not quite reach the basal level found in wild type mice.

Because understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ion channel and transporter gating remains an important challenge, we have undertaken a structure-guided engineering approach to probe structure-function relationships in TmCorA.

As the major intracellular divalent cation, Mg2+ is a required cofactor in hundreds of enzymes and is indispensable for maintaining genomic stability. The disregulation of Mg2+ homeostasis has been implicated in numerous pathological states, including cardiovascular disease and tumorigenesis (1Hartwig A. Mutat.

Of the four major biological cations, Mg2+ transport and homeostasis remains the most poorly understood. These processes have been best characterized in prokaryotes, where detailed molecular insights have recently been obtained through structure determinations of the CorA and MgtE Mg2+ transport systems (3Lunin V.V.

Alr1 and Mrs2 are the major Mg2+ transporters found in the plasma and inner mitochondrial membranes of yeast, plants, and mammals. Thus, CorA represents a ubiquitous and highly relevant model Mg2+ transport system.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3762-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), establishing TmCorA as a representative member of the so-called 2-TM-GxN metal ion transporter superfamily (12Knoop V. Groth-Malonek M. Gebert M. Eifler K. Weyand K. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2005; 274: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13Maguire M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). TmCorA revealed a pentameric assembly with a large intracellular N-terminal funnel domain (FD) linked to a membrane-embedded ion pore. In each subunit, two transmembrane (TM) helices are connected by a short periplasmic loop, with the universally conserved GMN motif found at the C-terminal end of the pore-lining helix, TM1. Two cation binding sites, M1 and M2, have been identified by crystallography at the protomer-protomer interface within the FD (4Eshaghi S. Niegowski D. Kohl A. Martinez Molina D. Lesley S.A. Nordlund P. Science. 2006; 313: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 5Payandeh J. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3762-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and have been characterized as a “divalent cation sensor (DCS)” using a protease protection assay (5Payandeh J. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3762-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A conformational change that was observed in the crystal structure of an isolated FD from Archaeoglobus fulgidus CorA (AfCorA) led us to propose a model for the structural basis of gating (Fig. 1A). These results implicated the DCS as part of a Mg2+-sensing molecular switch that may coordinate CorA gating with the regulation of cellular Mg2+ levels (5Payandeh J. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3762-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); they also suggest that CorA might function as a ligand-gated ion channel. Evidence indicates that the eukaryotic Alr1 and Mrs2 proteins operate as high conductance Mg2+-selective channels (14Liu G.J. Martin D.K. Gardner R.C. Ryan P.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 213: 231-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kolisek M. Zsurka G. Samaj J. Weghuber J. Schweyen R.J. Schweigel M.

J. 2007; 93: 3872-3883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); however, a coupled transport mechanism for CorA cannot yet be ruled out. For instance, certain CorA-dependent microbes thrive in environments that may require magnesium to be concentrated against its chemical potential (17Pfeiffer J. Guhl J. Waidner B. Kist M. Bereswill S. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3930-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and at least one CorA homologue has been characterized as a metal ion efflux system (18Worlock A.J. Smith R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4369-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although TmCorA has been characterized structurally, its function has not yet been demonstrated. Some authors suggest that TmCorA is a metal ion effluxer (4Eshaghi S. Niegowski D. Kohl A. Martinez Molina D. Lesley S.A. Nordlund P. Science. 2006; 313: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Niegowski D. Eshaghi S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2564-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas others have indicated a Mg2+ import system (3Lunin V.V. Dobrovetsky E. Khutoreskaya G. Zhang R. Joachimiak A.

Definitive assignment of the CorA proteins as channels or transporters will require further investigation, and an understanding of their gating mechanisms will aid in future analyses. Traditionally, “gating” refers to the opening or closing of an ion channel in response to a physiological stimulus. Recent studies have established that gating events can range from slight backbone or side-chain movements (20Zhou Y. MacKinnon R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 21Cordero-Morales J.F. Cuello L.G. Zhao Y. Jogini V. Cortes D.M. Roux B. Perozo E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) to larger scale conformational and packing rearrangements (22Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. Mackinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 23Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E.

Providing these insights remains a prominent challenge, and it is unknown whether universal principles might underlie the fine details of ion channel or transporter function. We have recently proposed the following CorA gating model. As intracellular Mg2+ levels decline, loss of bound cations at the M1 and M2 sites in the DCS should lead to a charge repulsion at this interface, which ultimately destabilizes helix-packing interactions within the FD. A possible structural rearrangement between α5 and α6 (relative to α7) has been indicated based on the available crystal structures of TmCorA and AfCorA (Fig. 1A). These conformational transitions would impinge on intracellular and periplasmic gating residues through helix rotations and/or translations. Upon the withdrawal of positively charged residues found on α6, an intracellular “electrostatic sink” created within the FD interior may help drive ion permeation through the CorA pore. Although this model postulates extensive conformational changes (5Payandeh J. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3762-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), direct structural and/or functional evidence on the full-length protein is still lacking. Therefore, we set out to investigate critical components of this gating model and probe other structure-function relationships in the TmCorA metal ion transport protein. Protein Purification—TmCorA was cloned into pET-15b (26Payandeh J. Pai E.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and site-directed mutants were generated using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). All plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) and purified as described previously (26Payandeh J. Pai E.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In brief, TmCorA was solubilized in n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM, Anatrace) and purified over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The N-terminal His6 tag was removed by thrombin digestion, and proteins were passed over a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Peak fractions containing TmCorA were passed over a second nickel column, and the flow-through was collected and concentrated using a centrifugal filter device (Millipore). The final protein buffer contained 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.026% DDM, 1 mm TCEP. TmCorA Reconstitution and Fluorescence Assay—Reconstitution buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 8 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, was added to dried phosphatidylcholine (PC, Avanti Polar Lipids) to produce a final 10 mg/ml liposome preparation by sonication. Freshly purified TmCorA was mixed with an excess of phosphatidylcholine liposomes to produce a lipid:protein ratio of 10:1, and the protein/liposome mix was dialyzed against 4 liters of reconstitution buffer overnight. Membrane-impermeable Mag-Fura-2 (Molecular Probes) was dissolved in water to a final concentration of 10 μm, and liposomes with (or without) incorporated TmCorA were loaded with Mag-Fura-2 by sonication on ice. Mag-Fura-2-loaded liposomes were subsequently applied to a Sephadex G-50 column with potassium-free buffer (150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (NMDG-Cl), 8 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) in order to remove extraliposomal potassium and generate an outward potassium gradient. Magnesium influx was initiated by adding 1-10 mm MgCl2 and 10 μm valinomycin (where specified) to the liposome suspensions. Measurements made at 25 °C in 3-ml cuvettes containing 2 ml of liposome suspensions with stirring were conducted five times for each sample. All studies were performed on a set of TmCorA proteins that were purified and reconstituted at the same time, with the wild-type protein included in each set. Continuous recording of fluorescence emission intensity of Mag-Fura-2 at 509 nm was used to monitor the rate of magnesium influx. The rate of fluorescence change was determined by fitting the initial 50 s with a linear function (Prism software). The rate of fluorescence change was converted to an uptake rate on the basis of a calibration curve generated by preloading liposomes with EDTA and MgCl2 in concentrations known to lead to free Mg2+ concentrations ranging from 10 μm to 10 mm. Uptake rates obtained for each set of proteins were compared using one-way analysis of variance (Prism software) with a secondary analysis between pairs (the Tukey test). p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To measure the Ca2+ permeability of TmCorA, 1-10 mm extraliposomal CaCl2 and 10 μm valinomycin were added to proteoliposomes loaded with Mag-Fura-2, and measurements were performed as described above. Cellular Complementation Assay—Salmonella typhimurium MM281, a strain devoid of all genomic Mg2+ transport systems (9Kehres D.G. Maguire M.E. Biometals. 2002; 15: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), was transformed with the indicated TmCorA expression plasmids and plated on LB agar supplemented with 100 mm MgCl2 and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. Single colonies were grown in 2.5 ml of LB supplemented with 100 mm MgCl2 and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C, 200 rpm. At an A600 of ∼2.0, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and cells were grown for another 2-3 h (A600 ∼ 3.5). Cell cultures were diluted 1:100 with fresh LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mm IPTG and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, but without added MgCl2, and serially diluted across a 96-well plate using the same “MgCl2-free” LB medium. With a multi-blot pin tool (V&P Scientific), ∼3 μl of the diluted cultures were plated in duplicate onto LB agar plates supplemented with 0.1 mm IPTG, 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, and the specified concentration of MgCl2 (0.1-10 mm). Plates were incubated at 37 °C and imaged after 20 h. All mutant proteins were assayed on at least three separate occasions. TmCorA protein expression levels in MM281 were extremely low owing to the lack of T7 polymerase in this Salmonella strain. To confirm membrane association for these proteins, 40-ml cultures were grown as described above. Cells were resuspended in 6 ml of lysis buffer (26Payandeh J. Pai E.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2006; 62: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and sonicated in the presence of protease inhibitors. After low speed centrifugation (15,000 × g, 30 min), supernatant and membrane fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h) in a bench-top Airfuge (Beckman). Membrane and supernatant fractions were prepared in 10× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. His6-tagged proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using primary anti-His antibodies (Qiagen) following SDS-PAGE. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Proteins were diluted to 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.026% DDM, 1 mm TCEP, and 2 mm EDTA (or 2 mm MgCl2, where specified). Thermal denaturation data were acquired on a circular dichroism spectrometer model 62A DS (Aviv) as described previously (5Payandeh J. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3762-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Analytical Gel Filtration Chromatography—For our standard analysis, proteins were diluted to 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.026% DDM, 1 mm TCEP. 500 μl of sample was loaded into a 200-μl loop and passed over an analytical Superdex 200 (10/300 GL) gel filtration column at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min on anÄKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). Protease Digestion Assay—For a 25-μl reaction volume, stock solutions were prepared to produce the final concentrations desired upon dilution. The reactions contained 19.5 μl of TmCorA protein (1.32 mg/ml), 5 μl of MgCl2 (0-10 mm), and 0.5 μl of trypsin (10 mg/ml, Sigma). Protein and MgCl2 solutions were mixed and equilibrated at 4 °C for 20 min; trypsin was then added, and reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 15 h. At 15 h, 25 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and samples were run immediately on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Experiments were performed using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicorCal) at 25 °C. A 500 μm solution of wild-type (WT) TmCorA was placed in the sample cell and titrated with 1 mm MgCl2 prepared in the same buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.026% DDM, 1 mm TCEP). Twenty-four injections were performed; the first injection was 0.5 μl followed by eight 2-μl, three 6-μl, five 10-μl, and seven 20-μl injections. When complete, the 1 mm MgCl2 solution was replaced by a 20 mm MgCl2 solution, and 18 further injections were performed into the same protein solution; one 0.5-μl injection followed by five 5-μl, four 10-μl, three 15-μl, and five 30-μl injections. The titration of mutant proteins was performed as described for the WT. Raw data were analyzed using the Origin 7.0 program and corrected for the ligand dilution heat by subtracting a control. Data sets representing the titration of each protein by 1 or 20 mm MgCl2 were fitted separately to estimate binding parameters. Data for the WT and L294V mutant were fit to the “two binding sites” model. Data obtained from the 1 mm MgCl2 titration of the Gly4α5α6 mutant were analyzed using the “sequential binding-six binding sites” function and, for the 20 mm MgCl2 titration, with the “sequential binding-four binding sites” function. Figure Preparation—The open state model was prepared as described previously (5Payandeh J. Pai E.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3762-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Most structural figures were generated using MOLSCRIPT (27Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and RASTER3D (28Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2854) Google Scholar) except that Fig. 5A was rendered in PyMOL (29DeLano W.L. The PyMol User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). The pore contour in Fig. 5C was determined using HOLE (30Smart O.S. Neduvelil J.G. Wang X. Wallace B. Sansom M.S. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) and visualized with VMD (31Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (37521) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment in supplemental Fig. 4A was prepared using ClustalW (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55409) Google Scholar) and adjusted manually after comparing a superposition of the TmCorA and AfCorA crystal structures. Structural superpositions, as shown in supplemental Fig. 6, were performed using LSQMAN (33Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Reconstituted TmCorA Mediates Mg2+ Flux—To first establish its function, we developed assays that specifically employed the TmCorA protein. Highly purified TmCorA was reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine-based liposomes loaded with the Mg2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Mag-Fura-2. In the presence of an inwardly directed Mg2+ gradient, TmCorA was capable of mediating Mg2+ influx at ambient temperatures (Fig. 1, B-E). Fig. 1B shows representative experiments where the fluorescence of Mag-Fura-2 increased over time in liposomes containing TmCorA. The addition of valinomycin, a K+-selective ionophore that should allow dissipation of intraliposomal charge accumulation under our experimental conditions, conferred a further increase in Mag-Fura-2 fluorescence and the rate of Mg2+ uptake (Fig. 1B-C, n = 5, p < 0.001). The TmCorA-mediated fluorescence response was dependent on the external MgCl2 concentration (Fig. 1D); there was no calcium-dependent response even in the presence of 10 mm extraliposomal CaCl2 and valinomycin (Fig. 1D, n = 5). Because Mag-Fura-2 exhibits a higher affinity for Ca2+ than for Mg2+, but a similar spectral response (Molecular Probes), these findings suggested that TmCorA is selective for magnesium ions over calcium ions. In fact, the magnesium uptake rate is over 100 times greater than that of calcium. In addition, Co(III)hexammine, a known inhibitor of other CorA superfamily members (15Kolisek M. Zsurka G. Samaj J.

These results provide the first direct evidence that TmCorA mediates the selective flux of magnesium ions; they also imply that accessory proteins are not required for this function. TmCorA Complements Mg2+-dependent Cellular Growth—TmCorA was reconstituted into a Salmonella strain devoid of all genomic Mg2+ transport systems, a strain otherwise capable of growth only when supplemented with sufficiently high Mg2+ concentrations (9Kehres D.G. Maguire M.E. Biometals. 2002; 15: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Compared with the relevant controls, the full-length WT TmCorA protein was clearly capable of reconstituting Mg2+ transport activity in vivo (Fig. 1F), but the MgCl2 concentrations required for complementation (∼1.0-2.5 mm) were 2 orders of magnitude higher than anticipated from studies of other CorA proteins (35Szegedy M.A. Maguire M.E.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2788-2791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because TmCorA derives from a bacterium with an optimal growth temperature of ∼80 °C, these discrepancies may reflect the high thermostability of TmCorA. However, CorA from Methanococcus jannaschii, an archaeal organism with optimal growth temperature at ∼85 °C, has transport characteristics almost identical to its mesophilic Salmonella and Escherichia CorA counterparts (34Kucharski L.M.

Therefore, Mg2+ may not be the preferred substrate of TmCorA, which could be consistent with the observation that T. maritima also encodes the widespread mgtE Mg2+ transport system (38Nelson K.E.

Although a detailed substrate profile for TmCorA will require further investigation, these results do not diminish the established roles for the CorA-Alr1-Mrs2 proteins in cellular Mg2+ homeostasis (2Schmitz C.

https://openalex.org/W2098083707,"Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) -1 plays an essential role in Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1 receptor (TLR/IL-1R) -associated NF-kappaB activation through its involvement in IKK activation, which then leads to subsequent IkappaB degradation and NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. In the present studies, we demonstrate a novel pathway in which IRAK-1 present in the nucleus participates in NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression. Nuclear localization of IRAK-1 is increased on cellular stimulation with IL-1 and LPS, or CRM-1-dependent nuclear export blockade. Induction of IRAK-1 produces enhanced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity that precedes IkappaB-alpha degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. IRAK-1 binds to the promoter of NF-kappaB-regulated gene, IkappaB-alpha, and enhances binding of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit to NF-kappaB responsive elements within the IkappaB-alpha promoter. IRAK-1 phosphorylates histone H3 in vitro and is required for IL-1-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 in vivo. These data indicate that both cytosolic and nuclear actions of IRAK-1 participate in the activation of NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional events."
https://openalex.org/W2073603121,"Adhesive signaling plays a key role in cellular differentiation, including in chondrogenesis. Herein, we probe the contribution to early chondrogenesis of two key modulators of adhesion, namely focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Src and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF). We use the micromass model of chondrogenesis to show that FAK/Src signaling, which mediates cell/matrix attachment, suppresses early chondrogenesis, including the induction of Ccn2, Agc, and Sox6. The FAK/Src inhibitor PP2 elevates Ccn2, Agc, and Sox6 expression in wild-type mesenchymal cells in micromass culture, but not in cells lacking CCN2. Our results suggest a reduction in FAK/Src signaling is a critical feature permitting chondrogenic differentiation and that CCN2 operates downstream of this loss to promote chondrogenesis.

Cartilage is a connective tissue that possesses a wide array of functions, including establishing the skeletal framework during embryogenesis and cushioning joints in adulthood. Chondrocytes, the cell type found in cartilage, generate and maintain the cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM), 8The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixdpcdays post-coitumFAKfocal adhesion kinaseRT-PCRreverse transcription PCRGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenasePBSphosphate-buffered salinePNApeanut agglutininBMPbone morphogenetic proteinWTwild-typeKOknock-out. which is crucial for chondrogenic development and homeostasis (1Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Formation of the adult skeleton is achieved by intramembranous and endochondral ossification (2Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar, 3Zelzer E. Olsen B.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The endochondral skeleton constitutes most skeletal elements of the body and is formed in two main steps. First, cartilage is formed by chondrogenesis. Chondrogenesis is initiated when mesenchymal cells aggregate to form condensations that ultimately determine the shape and location of future bones (2Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar, 3Zelzer E. Olsen B.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 4Karsenty G. Nature. 2003; 423: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). During this process, a high cell density is achieved that promotes cell-cell interactions resulting in the propagation of signal transduction events necessary for the initiation of chondrogenesis (5Cohn M.J. Tickle C. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 253-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells within these condensations begin to express markers typical of early chondrogenic cells. These markers include such proteins as the “Sox trio” of transcription factors (Sox9 and the related factors L-Sox5 and Sox6), type II collagen, and aggrecan (6Stanton L.-A. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Dev. Biol. 2003; 263: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7Seghatoleslami M.R. Roman-Blas J.A. Rainville A.M. Modaressi R. Danielson K.G. Tuan R.S. J. Cell.

Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Endochondral ossification, a process involving the creation of bone tissue utilizing the cartilage as template, follows (4Karsenty G.

In developing limbs in vivo, cells originating from the lateral plate mesoderm condense and form aggregations (5Cohn M.J. Tickle C. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 253-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In mouse development, formation of these aggregations occurs 10.5–12.5 days post-coitum (dpc) (9Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The level and efficiency of overall chondrogenic differentiation, and hence subsequent bone development, is directly correlated to the density of the initial condensation (10Ahrens P. Solursh M. Reiter R. Dev. Biol. 1977; 60: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The Sox trio appear to cooperate with each other to co-regulate the expression of chondrogenic markers such as aggrecan and type II collagen. However, much remains unknown about the additional requirements for chondrogenesis. Recently, it was shown that the formation of condensations and cartilage nodules requires adhesive signaling and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, via Rho and Rac (11Wang G. Woods A. Agoston H. Ulici V. Glogauer M. Beier F. Dev. Biol. 2007; 306: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Bang O.-S. Kim E.-J. Chung J.G. Lee S.-R. Park T.K. Kang S.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2007; 282: 23500-23508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). At later stages, adhesive signaling through integrins is involved (15Aszodi A. Hunziker E.B. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2465-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of cell-ECM interactions in early chondrogenesis is poorly understood. For example, the role of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Src, which mediates cell-ECM interactions, in chondrogenesis has not been thoroughly investigated. Moreover, the role of CCN2, a member of the CCN (CYR61, CTGF, NOV) family of pro-adhesive matricellular signaling modulators (16Leask A. Abraham D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4803-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), in early chondrogenesis is unclear. Culture systems have been developed that promote chondrogenesis. The three-dimensional micromass system is an excellent culture model to promote chondrogenic differentiation of a wide range of mesenchymal cells by providing sufficiently high cell density to promote the cell-cell interactions required for chondrogenesis (10Ahrens P. Solursh M. Reiter R. Dev. Biol. 1977; 60: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In this report we use the micromass cell culture system to probe the role of FAK/Src and CCN2 in early chondrogenesis in vitro. Monolayer Cell Culture—Fak+/+ and Fak-/- fibroblast cells (17Ilic D.

Ccn2+/+ and Ccn2-/- mesenchymal cells (13.5 dpc) were isolated and cultured as previously described (18Chen Y. Abraham D.J. Shi-wen X. Pearson J.D. Black C.M. Lyons K.M. Leask A. Mol. Biol.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Invitrogen). For CCN2 rescue experiments, plates were treated overnight with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 ng/ml CCN2 (EMP; Genetech). Micromass Cell Culture—Mesenchymal cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 per 10-μl droplet into each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate (Nunc) and left to adhere for an hour. Once adhered, micromass cultures were given 1 ml of medium. Micromass cultures were grown for a period of 6 days. In experiments involving inhibitor treatment, starting on Day 0, the day of plating, medium was supplemented with the FAK/Src inhibitor PP2 (10 μm in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (Calbiochem)), whereas control cultures were supplemented with the vehicle Me2SO only. Medium was replenished daily. The high density culture system allows for the recapitulation of the in vivo high density environment during chondrogenesis that allows for a high degree of cell-cell contact (11Wang G. Woods A.

RNA Isolation and Real-time RT (Reverse Transcription) PCR— RNA extraction was performed with the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen Inc.). RNA was collected from micromass cultures on days 1, 3, 6 of differentiation. RNA concentration was determined using a spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter). 25 ng of RNA/reaction was used for real-time RT-PCR according to established protocols (20Stanton L.A. Sabari S.

A total 15-μl reaction volume was used containing the TaqMan one-step master mix kit (Applied Biosystems) and gene-specific target primers (Assays-on-demand; Applied Biosystems) and probes (FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) dye layer) and endogenous reference primers and probes (VIC dye layer). The FAM dye layer yields quantification of the target genes, whereas VIC yields simultaneous quantification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (Gapdh) as an internal control. Relative gene expression was determined by measuring Col2a1, Agc, Dcn, Hapln, L-Sox5, Sox6, Sox-9, Ccn1, Ccn2, and Ccn5, using 40 cycles on the ABI Prism 7900 HT sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All samples were amplified in three parallel reactions per trial, and three independent trials were performed. RNA Quality Assessment, Probe Preparation, and Gene Chip Hybridization and Analysis—Microarrays and analyses were performed essentially as previously described (19Ivkovic S. Yoon B.S. Popoff S.N.

Gene Chips were processed at the London Regional Genomics Centre (Robarts Research Institute, London, ON). RNA was harvested (TRIzol; Invitrogen) and quantified. Quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA), the RNA 6000 Nano kit (Caliper Life Sciences, Mountain View, CA), and the Degradometer. Biotinylated complementary RNA (cRNA) was prepared from 10 μg of total RNA (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) 24 primers. Biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared by in vitro transcribing cDNA (Enzo Brioche, New York, NY). Fifteen μg of labeled cRNA was hybridized to Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Gene Chips for 16 h at 45 °C (Affymetrix). Gene Chips were stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, followed by an antibody solution and a second streptavidin-phycoerythrin solution (GeneChip Fluidics Station 450; Affymetrix). Gene Chips were scanned with the GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). Signal intensities for genes were generated using GCOS1.2 (Affymetrix) using default values for the statistical expression algorithm parameters and a target signal of 150 for all probe sets and a normalization value of 1. Normalization was performed in GeneSpring 7.2 (Agilent Technologies Inc.). The RMA preprocessor was used to import data from the .cel files. Data were transformed, (measurements <0.01 set to 0.01), normalized per chip to the 50th percentile and per gene to wild-type control samples. Experiments were performed twice, and -fold changes were identified using the GeneSpring filter. Data presented in Table 1 are an average of these independent studies. The -fold change between treated and untreated samples had to be at least 2-fold, in both sets of experiments, to identify a transcript as being altered.TABLE 1Microarray of Ccn2+/+ and –/– mesenchymal cells shows transcripts down-regulated greater than 2-fold CCN family members and early chondrogenic genes are shown.GeneAffy ID-Fold ChangeFull nameCtgf, Ccn21416953_at29.35Connective tissue growth factor (CCN2)Wisp2, Ccn51419015_at3.73Wnt-induced secreted protein-2 (CCN5)Cyr61, Ccn1144234_x_at2.12Cysteine-rich 61 (CCN1)Agc1449827_at4.40AggrecanHapln1438020_at3.45Link proteinDcn1449368_at4.52DecorinSox6142767_a_at2.81Sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 6 Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis—Protein was harvested using radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton-X, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA), 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO3 (Sigma), supplemented with a protease inhibitor mini complete tablet (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was quantified by a kit (BCA; Sigma) as described by the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of cell lysate (40 μg) and of concentrated medium (20 μl) were subjected to SDS/PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20 and incubated with anti-Sox6 (1:200; Sigma), anti-Sox5 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-aggrecan (1:500; R&D Systems), anti-CCN2 antibody (1:2000; Abcam), anti-type II collagen (1:2000; Santa Cruz), or anti-FAK antibody (1:2000; Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed three times for 5 min with Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20, followed by the application of appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and detection of proteins using ECL™ Western blot detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized using Chemi-Imager™5500 (Alpha Innotech Inc.). Immunofluorescence—Ccn2+/+ and Ccn2-/- cells were plated in monolayer at a density of 12,000 cells/well in a 24-well dish (Falcon) on glass coverslips. Cells were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated for 5 min with 0.1% Triton-X in PBS, and rinsed again in PBS. Cells were then incubated in blocking solution containing goat serum (Sigma) in PBS, 1:20, for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies directed to Sox6 were diluted in blocking solution at a concentration of 1:200 and incubated with coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were rinsed in PBS and then incubated with an AlexaFluor® 488-conjugated secondary antibody, diluted 1:300 in PBS, for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Following another wash in PBS, coverslips were mounted in Vecta-Shield anti-fade mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using Northern Eclipse software (Empix) and exported into Adobe Photoshop. Peanut Agglutinin (PNA) Staining—Micromass cultures were performed as above and were fixed on day 6 of culture in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were rinsed with PBS and then incubated for 2 h in 50 μg/ml PNA diluted in PBS. Cultures were washed again with PBS, and PNA was detected colorimetrically by diaminobenzidine (Dako Cytomation). Images were captured with a Nikon SMZ1500 microscope at ×5.6 magnification using a Photometrics coolSNAP-cf color digital camera (Photon Technology International). Alcian Blue Staining—Alcian Blue staining was carried out on day 6 of micromass culture as follows. Cultures were washed twice with cold PBS, fixed in 100% ethanol for 20 min at -20 °C, and incubated with 0.1% HCl-Alcian blue for 2 h (20Stanton L.A. Sabari S. Sampaio A.V. Underhil T.M. Beier F. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Excess stain was washed off with double distilled water and pictures were taken as described above. Stain was quantified by solubilizing the stain in 6.0 m guanidine hydrochloride for 8 h at room temperature. Absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer at 620 nm. Statistical Analysis—Data collected from real-time RT-PCR are an average of three trials of samples, from completely independent experiments, run in triplicate. Means were quantified relative to Gapdh, and then data were normalized to day 1 of control per trial or in the case where there is only 1 day being examined, data were normalized to the control sample.

Loss of FAK Promotes Features of Chondrogenesis, Including Nodule Formation and CCN2 Expression—The earliest stage of chondrogenesis, namely condensation, involves the migration of mesenchymal cells via cell/ECM interactions and is associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (12Bang O.-S. Kim E.-J. Chung J.G. Lee S.-R. Park T.K. Kang S.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2000; 278: 522-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the role of FAK in subsequent phases of chondrogenesis, including nodule formation and the induction of chondrogenic genes, is wholly unknown. To specifically assess the effect of loss of FAK on early chondrogenesis, we used the micromass culture system. Micromass cell culture is an established method of inducing chondrogenesis in vitro in a variety of mesenchymal cell types, including embryonic and adult fibroblasts (11Wang G. Woods A. Agoston H. Ulici V. Glogauer M. Beier F. Dev. Biol. 2007; 306: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22James C.G. Appleton C.T. Ulici V. Underhill T.M. Beier F. Mol. Biol.

To test the contribution of FAK to this process, we subjected Fak+/+ and Fak-/- fibroblasts (Fig. 1a) to high density micromass-induced chondrogenesis. Fak-/- animals die at embryonic day 8.5 (17Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 27Furuta Y.D. Ilic S. Kanazawa N. Takeda T. Yamamoto S. Aizawa S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1989-1995PubMed Google Scholar), precluding use of this type at later embryonic stages. Fibroblasts at 8.5 dpc represent “naïve” cells that have not begun to differentiate (9Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Fak+/+ and -/- fibroblasts were plated in micromass cultures for 6 days. On day 6 of culture, PNA-stained images (Fig. 1b) were taken of the cultures. To our surprise, loss of FAK expression, even in naïve E8.5 fibroblasts, resulted in increased PNA staining, a hallmark of chondrogenic differentiation, in micromass culture as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1b). In the Fak-/- cells, L-Sox5 and Col2a1 mRNA expression was significantly higher than in the wild-type controls (Fig. 1c). Conversely, Sox9 expression was unaltered (Fig. 1c). Intriguingly, Agc and Hapln mRNAs were not detected either in Fak+/+ and -/- fibroblasts (data not shown). Similarly, Sox6 was not induced in Fak-/- E8.5 cells (Fig. 1c). These results surprisingly suggest that the loss of FAK in these naïve cells was sufficient to induce some, but not all, features of chondrogenesis. CCN2 is a key modulator of adhesive signaling and promotes chondrogenic gene expression in vivo and in vitro (16Leask A. Abraham D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4803-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 18Chen Y. Abraham D.J. Shi-wen X. Pearson J.D. Black C.M. Lyons K.M. Leask A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5635-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To probe a possible connection between loss of FAK and CCN2 expression, real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of Fak+/+ and -/- fibroblasts in micromass culture for 6 days were used. This analysis revealed that CCN2 protein and mRNA were significantly elevated in the absence of FAK, whereas CCN2 protein and mRNA were not induced in Fak+/+ cells (Fig. 1, a and c). Collectively, these data suggested the intriguing notion that, in cells competent to undergo bone fide chondrogenic differentiation, FAK signaling may suppress chondrogenesis by preventing the induction of CCN2. Loss of Ccn2 Disrupts Expression of Early Chondrogenic Genes in Monolayer Culture—To test the hypothesis that CCN2 acted downstream of the loss of FAK to promote chondrogenesis, it was necessary to employ cells capable of undergoing full chondrogenic differentiation. To investigate this question, we therefore used E13.5 mouse mesenchymal cells, as chondrogenesis occurs in vivo at this stage (9Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3037-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis of mRNAs isolated from Ccn2+/+ and -/- mesenchymal cells growing in monolayer culture was performed. This analysis revealed that many early chondrogenic genes, such as Agc, Dcn, Hapln (the gene encoding link protein), and Sox6, showed a >2-fold reduction in expression in the absence of CCN2 (Table 1). Moreover, loss of Ccn2 resulted in reduced expression of the CCN family members Ccn1 and Ccn5 (Table 1), both of which have been implicated in bone formation (16Leask A. Abraham D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4803-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Differences in gene expression between wild-type and knock-out cells revealed by microarray analysis were verified using real-time RT-PCR analysis. As expected, real-time PCR analysis revealed that Ccn2 mRNA expression was observed in wild-type, but not in Ccn2-/-, cells (Fig. 2). Confirming our microarray data, real-time PCR analysis also showed that Ccn2-/- mesenchymal cells possessed a significant decrease in the mRNAs encoded by Ccn1 and Ccn5, Sox6, Agc, Dcn, and the link protein gene Hapln (Fig. 2). We used Western blot analysis to confirm reduced expression of Sox6 and aggrecan protein in the absence of CCN2 (Fig. 3A). Moreover, down-regulation of Sox6 in the Ccn2-/- cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence analyses of Ccn2+/+ and -/- mesenchymal cells. Sox6 was localized around the nuclei of Ccn2+/+ cells but was markedly reduced in Ccn2-/- cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast to these results, here was a significant increase in L-Sox5 gene expression and no change in Sox9 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, no change in mRNA transcript levels for Col2a1 or Col10a1 (Fig. 2) was observed in the CCN2-deficient mesenchymal cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that loss of CCN2 did not result in reduced L-Sox5 and type II collagen protein expression (Fig. 3A). These data demonstrate that CCN2 is required for the expression of some, but not all, chondrogenic genes in monolayer cell culture.FIGURE 3In the absence of Ccn2, levels of early chondrogenic matrix-associated proteins Sox6 and aggrecan are decreased. A, protein isolated from Ccn2 +/+ (WT) and -/- (KO) mouse mesenchymal cells was cultured in monolayer for 48 h. Conditioned medium and protein extracts were examined for aggrecan and Sox6, respectively, by Western blot analysis. Both Sox6 and aggrecan protein expression were decreased in Ccn2-/- mouse mesenchymal cells. β-actin was used as a loading control. Densitometry analysis of aggrecan and Sox6, relative to β-actin, shows a significant difference between samples. No difference was seen in the expression of type II collagen and Sox5. Data shown represent means + S.E. from three trials. *, p <0.05 using Student's paired t test. B, for immunofluorescence analysis, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled (FITC) antibody for Sox6 and with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclei. Sox6 was localized around the nuclei in the Ccn2 +/+ mouse mesenchymal cells, whereas expression was markedly decreased in the Ccn2-/- mouse mesenchymal cells. Six different fields were examined. A representative field is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Loss of Ccn2 Results in Impaired Chondrogenesis in Micromass Culture—Based on our mRNA and protein expression data indicating a role for CCN2 in early chondrogenesis, we assessed the effect of loss of CCN2 in the micromass culture system (11Wang G. Woods A. Agoston H. Ulici V. Glogauer M. Beier F. Dev. Biol. 2007; 306: 612-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ccn2+/+ and -/- mesenchymal cells were plated in high density micromass cultures and cultured for up to 6 days. PNA staining of the resultant cultures revealed that loss of CCN2 expression impaired the overall ability of mesenchymal cells to undergo condensation (Fig. 4a). Similarly, Alcian Blue staining revealed that loss of CCN2 expression resulted in reduced glycosaminoglycan production (Fig. 4b). RNAs were harvested on days 1, 3, and 6 of micromass culture, and transcription of chondrogenic genes was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. In wild-type mesenchymal cells, CCN2 was expressed at constant levels throughout the time course, and, as expected, CCN2 was undetectable in Ccn2-/- cells (Fig. 5). Confirming our experiments using monolayer culture, loss of CCN2 expression resulted in decreased expression of Agc and Hapln (encoding link protein) mRNAs throughout the 6 days of culture (Fig. 5). In the absence of CCn2, Col2a1 mRNA expression was significantly increased throughout the 6 days of culture (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the absence of CCN2 alters the balance of collagen and proteoglycan gene expression.FIGURE 5Loss of Ccn2 affects proteoglycan mRNA expression. Ccn2+/+ (WT) and -/- (KO) mouse mesenchymal cells were subjected to micromass cultures for 6 days. For real-time RT-PCR, RNA was harvested on days 1, 3, and 6. Agc, Sox6, and Hapln mRNA expression was significantly reduced in Ccn2-/- mouse mesenchymal cells on all 6 days examined. Conversely, Col2a1, L-Sox5, and Sox9 expression was significantly increased in Ccn2-/- mouse mesenchymal cells.

https://openalex.org/W2060585767,"Erythropoietin (Epo) stimulates a significant increase in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) through activation of the murine transient receptor potential channel TRPC2, but TRPC2 is a pseudogene in humans. TRPC3 expression increases on normal human erythroid progenitors during differentiation. Here, we determined that erythropoietin regulates calcium influx through TRPC3. Epo stimulation of HEK 293T cells transfected with Epo receptor and TRPC3 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in [Ca(2+)](i), which required extracellular calcium influx. Treatment with the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122 or down-regulation of PLCgamma1 by RNA interference inhibited the Epo-stimulated increase in [Ca(2+)](i) in TRPC3-transfected HEK 293T cells and in primary human erythroid precursors, demonstrating a requirement for PLC. TRPC3 associated with PLCgamma, and substitution of predicted PLCgamma Src homology 2 binding sites (Y226F, Y555F, Y648F, and Y674F) on TRPC3 reduced the interaction of TRPC3 with PLCgamma and inhibited the rise in [Ca(2+)](i). Substitution of Tyr(226) alone with phenylalanine significantly reduced the Epo-stimulated increase in [Ca(2+)](i) but not the association of PLCgamma with TRPC3. PLC activation results in production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)). To determine whether IP(3) is involved in Epo activation of TRPC3, TRPC3 mutants were prepared with substitution or deletion of COOH-terminal IP(3) receptor (IP(3)R) binding domains. In cells expressing TRPC3 with mutant IP(3)R binding sites and Epo receptor, interaction of IP(3)R with TRPC3 was abolished, and Epo-modulated increase in [Ca(2+)](i) was reduced. Our data demonstrate that Epo modulates TRPC3 activation through a PLCgamma-mediated process that requires interaction of PLCgamma and IP(3)R with TRPC3. They also show that TRPC3 Tyr(226) is critical in Epo-dependent activation of TRPC3. These data demonstrate a redundancy of TRPC channel activation mechanisms by widely different agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2148241486,"Regulation of the number of eggs ovulated by different mammalian species remains poorly understood. Here we show that oocyte-specific deletion at the primary follicle stage of core 1 beta1,3-galactosyltransferase (T-synthase; generates core 1-derived O-glycans), leads to a sustained increase in fertility. T-syn mutant females ovulated 30-50% more eggs and had a sustained increase in litter size compared to controls. Ovarian weights and follicle numbers were greater in mutants, but follicular apoptosis was not decreased. The number of follicles entering the growing pool was unaltered, but 3-wk mutants ovulated fewer eggs, suggesting that increased fertility results from prolonged follicle development. T-syn mutant ovaries also contained numerous multiple-oocyte follicles (MOFs) that appeared to form by adjacent, predominantly preantral, follicles joining--a new mechanism for MOF generation. Ovulation of multiple eggs from MOFs was not the reason for increased fertility based on ovulated egg and corpora lutea numbers. Thus, the absence of T-synthase caused modified follicular development, leading to the maturation and ovulation of more follicles, to MOF formation at late stages of folliculogenesis, and to increased fertility. These results identify novel roles for glycoproteins from the oocyte as suppressors of fertility and regulators of follicular integrity in the mouse."

Analysis of a PCKI1-lacZ reporter gene revealed that CKI1 expression was regulated by intracellular levels of the essential mineral zinc. Zinc depletion resulted in a concentration-dependent induction of CKI1 expression. This regulation was mediated by the zinc-sensing and zinc-inducible transcriptional activator Zap1p. A purified Zap1p probe interacted with two putative UASZRE sequences (ZRE1 and ZRE2) in the CKI1 promoter. Mutations of ZRE1 and ZRE2 to a nonconsensus UASZRE attenuated the induction of CKI1 expression in response to zinc depletion. A UASINO element in the CKI1 promoter was responsible for stimulating CKI1 expression, but this element was not involved with the regulation by zinc depletion. The induction of CKI1 expression in zinc-depleted cells translated into increased choline kinase activity in vitro and in vivo, and an increase in phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the Kennedy pathway.

Zinc is an essential mineral for the growth and metabolism of S. cerevisiae; it serves as a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes and it is a structural component of several transcription factors (2Vallee B.L.

In controlling the cytoplasmic levels of zinc, some transporters mediate zinc influx (e.g. Zrt1p, Zrt2p, Fet4p, Cot1p, and Zrc1p), whereas some transporters mediate zinc efflux (e.g. Zrt3p) (5Eide D.J.

The zinc transporters are regulated at the level of gene expression, and indeed, the most highly regulated transporter is Zrt1p (5Eide D.J. J.

The expression of Zrt1p is induced for increased zinc uptake when the cytoplasmic levels of zinc are limiting (6Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The increase in Zrt1p expression is dependent on the zinc-sensing and zinc-inducible transcriptional activator Zap1p, which interacts with a UASZRE sequence in the ZRT1 promoter to activate transcription (6Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 17Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol.

Conversely, when the cytoplasmic levels of zinc are high, the expression of Zrt1p is reduced to attenuate zinc uptake (6Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Reduced Zrt1p expression is due to the loss of Zap1p activation of ZRT1 expression (18Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Moreover, when the cytoplasmic levels of zinc are limiting, Zrt1p is a stable protein, and when the levels of zinc are high, Zrt1p is removed from the plasma membrane by endocytosis and is proteolytically degraded in the vacuole (19Gitan R.S.

The transcriptional regulation of the PS synthase and PI synthase enzymes translates into a decrease in the cellular PE content 3The decrease in PE content is attributed to reductions in both PS synthase and PS decarboxylase activities (37Iwanyshyn W.M.

The reciprocal regulation of these CDP-DAG branch point enzymes is part of an overall mechanism by which the synthesis of PI is coordinately regulated with the synthesis of phospholipids by way of the CDP-DAG pathway (1Carman G.M.

Because of the complementary nature of the phospholipid synthesis pathways in S. cerevisiae, we hypothesized that the decrease in CDP-DAG pathway enzyme activities is compensated by an increase in PC synthesis via the CDP-choline branch of the Kennedy pathway (Fig. 1). We focused our studies on the regulation of CKI1-encoded choline kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the committed step in the pathway (Fig. 1). Indeed, choline kinase is a highly regulated enzyme that is controlled by transcriptional (41Hosaka K. Murakami T. Kodaki T. Nikawa J. Yamashita S. J.

All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid Constructions—The plasmids used in this work are listed in Table 1. The pKSK11 plasmid contains the CKI1 gene promoter fused to the coding sequence of the lacZ gene of E. coli. This plasmid was constructed by replacing the CRD1 gene promoter in pSD90 (a plasmid based on YEp357R) with the CKI1 gene promoter sequence at the SphI/KpnI sites. The CKI1 promoter was obtained by PCR (primers, 5′-TCAGCATGCCTGCAGATATGAATTCCATAGG-3′ and 5′-CGAGGTACCCCTGGACGTGATTCTTGTAC-3′) using strain W303-1A genomic DNA as the template. The PCR primer used in the forward direction corresponds to -308 bp to the start codon, and the primer used in the reverse direction corresponds to +23 bp to the start codon. The correct orientation of the CKI1 promoter was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. Plasmid pCK-UASino is a derivative of pKSK11, in which the UASINO element (39Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) sequence (5′-TATTCACAT-3′) in the CKI1 promoter was mutated to a nonconsensus sequence 5′-TATTTTTTTT-3′.

Plasmid pCK-ZRE1, 2 is a derivative of pKSK11 where both ZRE1 and ZRE2 were mutated to the nonconsensus sequence. pCK-ZRE1, 2 was constructed by PCR amplification of plasmid pCK-ZRE1 using the primers for the construction of pCK-ZRE2. After PCR amplifications, all samples were digested with DpnI to eliminate the template DNA. The plasmids were amplified in E. coli, purified, and sequenced to confirm the mutations in the CKI1 promoter. Transformation of yeast (51Ito H. Yasuki F. Murata K. Kimura A. J.

The annealing reactions were incubated for 5 min at 100 °C in a heat block, and then kept in the heat block for another 2 h after it had been turned off. The annealed oligonucleotides (100 pmol), which had a 5′ over-hanging end, were labeled with [α-32P]dATP (400-800 Ci/nmol) and Klenow fragment (5 units) for 30 min at room temperature.

https://openalex.org/W1993743744,"Natural laminin matrices are formed on cell membranes by a cooperative process involving laminin self-polymerization and binding to cognate cellular receptors. In a cell-free system, laminin can self-polymerize, given that a minimal critical concentration is achieved. We have previously described that pH acidification renders self-polymerization independent of protein concentration. Here we studied the ultrastructure of acid-induced laminin polymers using electron and atomic force microscopies. Polymers presented the overall appearance of natural matrices and could be described as homogeneous polygonal sheets, presenting struts of 21 +/- 5 and 86 +/- 3 nm of height, which approximately correspond to the sizes of the short and the long arms of the molecule, respectively. The addition of fragment E3 (the distal two domains of the long arm) did not affect the polymerization in solution nor the formation of adsorbed matrices. On the other hand, the addition of fragment E1', which contains two intact short arms, completely disrupted polymerization. These results indicate that acid-induced polymers, like natural ones, involve only interactions between the short arms. The electrostatic surface map of laminin alpha1 LG4-5 shows that acidification renders the distal end in the long arms exclusively positive, precluding homophylic interactions between them. Therefore, acidification reproduces in vitro, and at a physiological protein concentration, what receptor interaction does in the cellular context, namely, it prevents the long arm from disturbing formation of the homogeneous matrix involving the short arms only. We propose that acid-induced polymers are the best tool to study cellular response to laminin in the future."

ThT-Pase was first identified in rat brain (1Hashitani Y. Cooper J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2117-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been found in most mammalian tissues studied to date (2Penttinen H.K. Uotila L. Med. Biol. 1981; 59: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of the purified, homogeneous ThTPase further revealed that the enzyme is a 24-25-kDa monomer with virtually absolute specificity for ThTP (3Makarchikov A.F. Chernikevich I.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Antunes A.F. Zorzi W. Coumans B. De Pauw E. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. J.

The enzyme has an alkaline pH optimum, and its catalytic activity depends critically on a divalent metal cofactor, such as Mg2+. ThTPase is thought to regulate the intracellular concentration of ThTP, which is found in most animal cells but at a much lower level than other forms of thiamine (5Iwata H. Yabushita Y. Doi T. Matsuda T. Neurochem. Res. 1985; 10: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Several lines of biochemical evidence have shown that ThTP can phosphorylate proteins in the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata and in rodent brain (6Nghiem H.O. Bettendorff L. Changeux J.P. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, ThTP is believed to act as one of the messengers in cell signaling in response to cellular stress (7Lakaye B. Wirtzfeld B. Wins P. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17142-17147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite the relatively high turnover rate of ThTP in neural cells (8Bettendorff L. Peeters M. Wins P. Schoffeniels E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), its level is strictly maintained at a low concentration in vivo, presumably through the activity of ThTPase. The sequence of ThTPase does not closely resemble that of any other protein identified in the mammalian genomes. However, recent bioinformatic analysis has suggested that mammalian 25-kDa ThTPase and adenylate cyclase CyaB from Aeromonas hydrophila define an ancient superfamily of domains, called the CYTH domains, which play a role at the interface of polyphosphate and nucleotide metabolism (9Iyer L.M. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The structures of several CYTH domains have been determined, including class IV adenylyl cyclase from Yersinia pestis (YpAC4, Protein Data Bank (PDB) 2FJT) (10Gallagher D.T. Smith N.N. Kim S.K. Heroux A. Robinson H. Reddy P.T. J. Mol.

With the exception of the hypothetical protein NE1496 from N. europaea, these structures are characterized by a closed tunnel fold resembling that initially described for the RNA triphosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Cet1, PDB 1D8H) (11Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Given the fact that Cet1 and the two proposed founding members of CYTH family, ThTPase and CyaB (9Iyer L.M. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), are all metal-dependent enzymes that act on the triphosphate-containing substrates, it has been proposed that the tunnel fold is characteristic of a larger enzyme superfamily, namely the “triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme” (TTM) superfamily (12Gong C. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 1468-1474Google Scholar). Despite its more open fold, Keppetipola et al. (13Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) classified the hypothetical protein NE1496 from N. europaea as a member of the TTM superfamily and gave it the name “NeuTTM,” which we use here. The enzymatic mechanism of TTM proteins has remained elusive. Sequence analysis and recent mutational studies have identified a few conserved residues, arrayed inside the tunnel, as essential for catalysis (12Gong C. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2006; 12: 1468-1474Google Scholar, 13Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, how these residues participate in enzyme catalysis is unclear. We present here the solution structure of mouse ThTPase (mThTPase) determined by NMR spectroscopy. Unlike most of the TTM proteins studied so far, the enzyme has an open cleft like NeuTTM. We used NMR titration experiments to identify residues responsible for Mg2+ and substrate (ThTP) binding. These titration results, together with the intermolecular NOEs, enabled us to build a structural model of the ground state ternary complex, mThTPase·ThTP·Mg2+, in which mThTPase adopts a tunnel fold characteristic of a TTM protein. Our results provide a framework for further characterization of ThTPase and shed light on its catalytic mechanism. Informatics—We used the Sesame laboratory information management system (14Zolnai Z. Lee P.T. Li J. Chapman M.R. Newman C.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Rayment I. Ulrich E.L. Volkman B.F. Markley J.L. J. Struct. Funct.

Cloning and Protein Production—The gene encoding mTh-TPase (BC025562) was purchased from Open Biosystems. 15N/15N,13C-labeled proteins were expressed and purified following the standard Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics pipeline protocols for plasmid construction (15Thao S.

Margineanu I. Roland S. Lins L. Aichour R. Lebeau L. El Moualij B. Zorzi W. Coumans B. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Int. J. Biochem.

The standard reaction medium contained 50 mm Na-TAPS (pH 8.3), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ThTP (synthesized as described (20Bettendorff L. Nghiem H.O. Wins P. Lakaye B. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 322: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)), and the enzyme preparation at the appropriate dilution. The total volume was 0.1 ml. After incubation (20 min, 37 °C), the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of phosphate reagent (21Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR spectra were recorded at the National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison (NMRFAM) using 600- and 900-MHz Varian Inova and 750-MHz Bruker spectrometers equipped with 1H, 15N, 13C triple-resonance cryogenic probes. Unless indicated otherwise, the sample temperature was controlled at 25 °C. The sample used for determining the structure of mThTPase contained 1.4 mm [U-13C, U-15N]mThTPase, 10 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, in 90% H2O, 10% D2OatpH 7.0. A suite of three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments, including HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HBHA(CO)NH, C(CO)NH, and HCCH total correlation spectroscopy were acquired for sequential backbone and non-aromatic side chain assignments of free mThTPase. Three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (τmix = 100 ms), three-dimensional aliphatic 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (τmix = 100 ms), and three-dimensional aromatic 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (τmix = 100 ms) data sets were acquired to measure NOEs used for additional assignments (side chain amide groups and aromatic groups) and distance constraints. The sample used in determining the structure of the mThTPase·ThTP complex (used in modeling the ternary complex) contained 1.4 mm [U-13C, U-15N]mThTPase, 2 mm unlabeled ThTP, 10 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol in 90% H2O, 10% D2O at pH 7.0. Data sets acquired with this sample included three-dimensional HNCA and three-dimensional HN(CO)CA for sequence specific assignments and three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (τmix = 100 ms) and three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (τmix = 100 ms) for NOE assignments. In addition, a 13C,15N-filtered, 13C-edited NOESY (τmix = 150 ms) (22Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J.F. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar) spectrum was collected at 30 °C to detect intermolecular NOEs between mThTPase and ThTP. Two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra were acquired to monitor the titration of Mg2+ or ThTP to 0.5 mm U-15N-labeled mThTPase, with ThTP at 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 mm and Mg2+ at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 mm, respectively. The spectra were processed and analyzed, respectively, with the nmrPipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11456) Google Scholar) and Sparky software packages. The raw, time-domain NMR data sets and chemical shift assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (BMRB) data base under accession number 15063. Structure Calculations—Interproton distance constraints for free mThTPase were derived from a three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum and a three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum. Backbone φ and ψ angles were derived from TALOS-based analysis of backbone chemical shifts (24Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar). The automated iterative refinement module (25Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar) in the CYANA software package (26Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) was used to generate the initial NOE assignments and the initial set of structural models. These NOE assignments were subsequently corrected and extended through iterative analysis of NMR spectra and structural calculation. In the final round of CYANA refinement, 4698 NOE restraints and 289 dihedral angle restraints were used. In addition, 176 hydrogen bond restraints, generated from analysis of the secondary chemical shifts and from observed NOEs characteristic for α-helices and β-sheets, were also added to the set of restraints. Of the 100 final structures calculated by CYANA, the 20 structures with the lowest target functions were chosen for further refinement in explicit water solvent by Xplor-NIH (27Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Marius C.G. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar) followed by validation by Procheck-NMR (28Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4367) Google Scholar). The statistics for the 20 final structures are listed in Table 1.

However, a number of NOE differences were also identified, which led to the removal of 112 NOEs specific for free mThTPase and the addition of 29 NOEs specific for complexed mThTPase. In addition, 16 intermolecular NOEs between mThTPase and ThTP were derived from a three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum and a 13C,15N-filtered, 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum, and 20 ambiguous distance restraints were derived from NMR titration and mutational studies. The structure of the ternary complex was calculated through standard annealing and torsion angle dynamics using the program CNS 1.1 (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P.

Analysis of the effect of ThTP concentration on the activity of recombinant mThTPase indicated non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with inhibition by excess substrate at [ThTP] > 0.5 mm (Fig. 1A). Thus, it was not possible to determine accurate Km and kcat values for this enzyme. To explain substrate inhibition, it might be assumed that the enzyme is able to catalyze hydrolysis of the Mg-ThTP complex but not free ThTP. At constant Mg2+ concentration, increasing substrate concentration would result in an accumulation of free ThTP, which might act as a competitive inhibitor. If this explanation were valid, substrate inhibition should be strong at low Mg2+ concentration and should be reversed by excess Mg2+. Fig. 1A clearly shows that this is not the case; substrate inhibition is not reversed in the presence of high [Mg2+] (10 mm) when compared with a lower concentration (0.2 mm). It is therefore hard to explain substrate inhibition if we assume that the substrate can only bind to the active site. It seems more likely that ThTP also binds to some peripheral non-catalytic site with lower affinity. Substrate inhibition was observed previously for rThTPase (1Hashitani Y. Cooper J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2117-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but at a much higher substrate concentration, [ThTP] > 3 mm, than for mThTPase. By contrast, no substrate inhibition was observed for bThTpase (3Makarchikov A.F. Chernikevich I.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), hThTPase (18Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Wins P. Margineanu I. Roland S. Lins L. Aichour R. Lebeau L. El Moualij B. Zorzi W. Coumans B. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1348-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), or pThTPase (19Szyniarowski P. Lakaye B. Czerniecki J. Makarchikov A.F. Wins P. Margineanu I. Coumans B. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1725: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our results also suggest that the activating effect of Mg2+ reflects cation binding to an activation site on the protein rather than complexation with the substrate. Indeed, the apparent Ka for Mg2+ is independent of ThTP concentration (0.50 ± 0.09 and 0.45 ± 0.06 mm, respectively, at 0.2 and 0.5 mm ThTP), suggesting that it reflects the Kdiss between Mg2+ and the activation site of the enzyme (Fig. 1B). As has been found for all other ThTPases, the enzymatic activity of mThTPase is pH-dependent (Fig. 1C). The optimal pH for mThTPase was found to be 8.5, in agreement with that for hThTPase (18Lakaye B. Makarchikov A.F. Wins P. Margineanu I. Roland S. Lins L. Aichour R. Lebeau L. El Moualij B. Zorzi W. Coumans B. Grisar T. Bettendorff L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1348-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional Structure of Free mThTPase—The 20 conformers of mThTPase that represent its solution structure, superimposed by the backbone atoms of their structured regions, are shown in Fig. 2A. These structures overlay the average structure (residues 5-213) with a backbone atom r.m.s.d. of 1.06 Å and an all heavy atom r.m.s.d. of 1.43 Å. Analysis of the backbone φ and ψ dihedral angles showed that 99.1% of these angles fall within the allowed region in the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). The outliers correspond to residues in the poorly defined N and C termini and loop regions. The structure shows that mThTPase in solution is monomeric; this result is in agreement with observed 15N R1/R2 relaxation rates (data not shown). The overall structure of mThTPase is dominated by an antiparallel β-sheet that is folded in half to form a cup-shaped shallow cleft (Fig. 2B). The β-sheet consists of nine strands with order 9 1 8 7 6 2 3 4 5 (Fig. 2C). The two longest strands are β2 (28-41) and β6 (116-131), which extend from one rim of the cleft to the other and form the core of the cleft. On the β6 side of the central β2-β6 sheet, the wall of the cleft is formed by four half-length or shorter strands (β7, 141-149; β8, 153-162; β1, 6-14; β9, 183-185). On the β2 side of the central β2-β6 sheet, the opposite wall of the cleft is formed by additional strands (β3, 53-57; β4, 61-66; β5, 80-82). This architecture, reinforced by the natural twist of the β-strands, causes the strands at the two edges of the β-sheet (β1 and β5) to curl toward each other. Further closure of the cleft is blocked by the two C-terminal antiparallel α-helices (α7, 193-201; α8, 203-212) situated over one end of the cleft. The α7- and α8-helices tightly associate with each other through coil-coil interactions and are anchored to the β-sheet by two hydrophobic clusters: a cluster of residues (Tyr-39, Trp-53, Leu-194, Leu-198, Leu-209) on one side of the two helices and a cluster of residues (Phe-121, Phe-151, Tyr-153, Ala-119, Lys-193, Tyr-197) on the other side of the two helices. Several helices are attached to the outside face of the β-sheet. Three helices (α1, 18-25; α5, 165-167; α6, 168-182) cover the outer faces of strands β1, β2, β6, β7, and β8 so as to enclose a hydrophobic cluster composed of side chains from residues Val-8, Phe-12, Leu-22, Leu-29, Trp-128, Ile-144, Leu-146, Val-162, Lys-165, and Leu-182. Three additional helices (α2, 46-49; α3, 85-96; α4, 106-113) are attached to the outer faces of strands β2 and β3 so as to enclose another hydrophobic cluster composed of side chains from residues Leu-47, Leu-54, Trp-62, Ile-88, Leu-92, Phe-93, Leu-95, Val-106, Leu-110, Leu-113, and Leu-115. The mThTPase structure also contains poorly defined regions. The most prominent of these is the loop that connects β4 and β5 (lβ4,β5, 67-79). This 13-residue loop, which protrudes from one rim of the cleft, constitutes the major dynamic element at the top of the cleft. Residues at both the N terminus (1Hashitani Y. Cooper J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2117-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Penttinen H.K. Uotila L. Med. Biol. 1981; 59: 177-184PubMed Google Scholar, 3Makarchikov A.F. Chernikevich I.P. Biochim.

NMR Titrations—To map the Mg2+ and ThTP binding sites in mThTPase, we carried out separate titrations of the enzyme with Mg2+ or ThTP by adding increasing amounts of Mg2+ or ThTP to an NMR sample containing 0.5 mm mThTPase. At each titration point, a 1H,15N HSQC spectrum was collected to monitor changes in chemical shifts (Fig. 3, A and B). Changes in 1HN and 15N chemical shifts between the free state of mThT-Pase and the Mg2+ or ThTP-bound state were calculated according to the formula, Δδave(HN) = [(ΔδHN2 + (ΔδN/5)2)/2]½, where ΔδHN and ΔδN correspond, respectively, to the chemical shift differences in 1HN and 15N. In the absence of Mg2+, we saw no evidence for hydrolysis of the added ThTP. In the titration with Mg2+, progressive shifting of NMR peaks from their positions in free mThTPase after each addition (Fig. 3A) indicated that free mThTPase is capable of binding Mg2+. Furthermore, all the chemical shift changes fell into the fast exchange limit on the NMR time scale, indicative of weak binding. The peaks that moved upon Mg2+ addition correspond to a small number of residues in mThTPase (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that Mg2+ binding leads to a local change in the conformation of mThTPase. Residues that displayed the largest chemical shift changes were identified as residues 7-11, 142-149, 157-160, 190, and 193. This result is consistent with the earlier suggestion, from studies on Cet1 and CthTTM (a homologue of NeuTTM from Clostridium thermocellum) (11Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Keppetipola N. Jain R. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11941-11949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), that residues equivalent to Glu-7, Glu-9, Asp-145, Glu-157, and Glu-159 in mThTPase are responsible for metal binding. Indeed, when mapped onto the structure of mThTPase, these most perturbed residues are all located inside the cleft (Fig. 3C) and appear to define a single Mg2+ binding site. On the basis of the Mg2+-dependent chemical shift changes and the assumption of 1:1 stoichiometry, a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.1 mm was estimated for the mThTPase·Mg2+ complex. Residues Ala-190 and Lys-193, along with those residues exhibiting minor titration shifts (32-34, 55-64, 120-125) (supplemental Fig. S1), are located peripheral to this site. Thus, their chemical shift changes presumably arise from a secondary or indirect binding effect. The titration of mThTPase with ThTP (Fig. 3B) led to spectral changes consistent with a slow process on the chemical shift timescale (indicative of tight binding with Kd ≤ 1 μm). The addition of ThTP led to decreased intensities of peaks from free mTh-TPase and the appearance of new peaks corresponding to the mThTPase·ThTP complex. The effects were found to be widespread and included residues on all nine β-strands and in the region between α6 and α8 (supplemental Fig. S1). Those residues with the largest backbone titration shifts Δδave(HN) included Glu-9, His-31, Glu-81, Thr-123, Arg-125, Glu-157, Glu-189, Ala-190, Lys-193, and to a lesser extent, Arg-10, Lys-65, Val-33, and Leu-194. Furthermore, large side chain chemical shift changes were observed for a few residues exhibiting only moderate backbone chemical shift perturbations. These residues included Asp-145 (Δδ(Cβ) =-2.2 ppm), Asp-147 (Δδ(Cβ) = 1.4 ppm), Ala-192 (Δδ(Cβ) =-1.0 ppm), and Met-195 (Δδ(Cϵ) = 0.9 ppm). When mapped onto the structure of mThTPase, the residues with the largest chemical shift perturbations were located in the interior of the cleft (Fig. 3D). The presence of ThTP also induced severe broadening of signals from residues in this region: 6-11, 77-79, 125-128, 157-160, 188-189, and 191-193. Analysis of the ThTP titration was consistent with a mThTPase·ThTP stoichiometry of 1:1. Although no significant spectral changes occurred upon increasing the ThTP concentration from 1 to 2 mm, when the ThTP concentration was increased to 4 mm or higher, signals from a number of residues exhibited additional broadening and chemical shift changes; these included the indole gro"
https://openalex.org/W2017231837,"Cyclin E overexpression is observed in multiple human tumors and linked to poor prognosis. We have previously shown that ectopic expression of cyclin E is sufficient to induce mitogen-independent cell cycle entry in a variety of tumor/immortal cell lines. Here we have investigated the rate-limiting step leading to cell cycle entry in quiescent normal human fibroblasts (NHF) ectopically expressing cyclin E. We found that in serum-starved NHF, cyclin E forms inactive complexes with CDK2 and fails to induce DNA synthesis. Coexpression of SV40 small t antigen (st), but not other tested oncogenes, efficiently induces mitogen-independent CDK2 phosphorylation on Thr-160, CDK2 activation, and DNA synthesis. Additionally, in contact-inhibited NHF ectopically expressing cyclin E, st induces cell cycle entry, continued proliferation, and foci formation. Coexpression of cyclin E and st also bypasses G(0)/G(1) arrests induced by CDK inhibitors. Although CDK2 is dispensable for G(0)/G(1) cell cycle entry and normal proliferation in mammals, CDK2 activity is an essential rate-limiting step in NHF with deregulated cyclin E expression and altered PP2A activity, which endows primary cells with transformed features. Consequently, CDK2 could be targeted therapeutically in tumors that involve these alterations. These data also suggest that alterations prior to cyclin E deregulation facilitate proliferation of tumor cells by bypassing mitogenic requirements and negative regulation by adjacent cells."
https://openalex.org/W2120724477,"YidC is a member of the Oxa1 family of proteins that facilitates the membrane insertion of a subset of inner membrane proteins in Escherichia coli. YidC acts as an insertase for membrane insertion of subunit c of the F1F0 ATP synthase (F0c), but the requirements for substrate recognition have remained unclear. Here, we have analyzed the role of the charged aminoacyl residues in F0c in YidC targeting and membrane insertion. Binding experiments demonstrate that F0c is targeted directly to YidC without the presence of a stable lipid surface-bound intermediate. Positive charges in the cytoplasmic loop of F0c are important determinants for YidC binding and subsequent membrane insertion. These data support a model in which F0c binds directly to YidC prior to its membrane insertion. YidC is a member of the Oxa1 family of proteins that facilitates the membrane insertion of a subset of inner membrane proteins in Escherichia coli. YidC acts as an insertase for membrane insertion of subunit c of the F1F0 ATP synthase (F0c), but the requirements for substrate recognition have remained unclear. Here, we have analyzed the role of the charged aminoacyl residues in F0c in YidC targeting and membrane insertion. Binding experiments demonstrate that F0c is targeted directly to YidC without the presence of a stable lipid surface-bound intermediate. Positive charges in the cytoplasmic loop of F0c are important determinants for YidC binding and subsequent membrane insertion. These data support a model in which F0c binds directly to YidC prior to its membrane insertion. The Escherichia coli inner membrane protein, YidC, is a member of the cytochrome oxidase biogenesis (Oxa) membrane protein family, which functions in promoting membrane insertion in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and bacteria (1Luirink J. von Heijne G. Houben E. de Gier J.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; : 329-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). YidC is an essential protein in E. coli and other bacteria. A fraction of the YidC is associated with the Sec-translocase, where it interacts with transmembrane segments (TMSs) 3The abbreviations used are:TMStransmembrane segmentAMdiS4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidF0cF1F0 ATP synthase subunit cIMVinner membrane vesicleIMPinner membrane proteinSRPsignal recognition particlePMFproton motive forceTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.3The abbreviations used are:TMStransmembrane segmentAMdiS4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidF0cF1F0 ATP synthase subunit cIMVinner membrane vesicleIMPinner membrane proteinSRPsignal recognition particlePMFproton motive forceTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. of nascent inner membrane proteins (IMPs) during membrane integration (2Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. M. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In addition, YidC also functions as an independent entity in the insertion of IMPs. The major coat proteins of bacteriophage M13 and Pf3, which were initially thought to insert spontaneously (3Kuhn A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were the first identified substrates of this pathway (4Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 5Chen M. Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Muller M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7670-7675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The first authentic E. coli YidC substrate described was subunit c of the F1F0 ATP synthase (F0c) (6van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas recently, the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, was proposed to be another substrate of the YidC pathway (7Facey S.J. Neugebauer S.A. Krauss S. Kuhn A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The YidC dependence of F0c is of particular interest as it concerns a critical step in the assembly of the F1F0 ATPase. F0c is a component of the membrane-embedded F0 sector that associates with the cytosolic F1 domain (α3β3γδϵ) to assemble into a functional F1F0 ATPase. In E. coli, multiple F0c subunits assemble into a decameric ring structure (8Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which interacts with two b subunits and one a subunit (F0b and F0a, respectively). The F1F0 ATPase plays a central role in the energy metabolism of the cell, converting the energy stored in a transmembrane electrochemical gradient of protons into the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. During the catalytic cycle, F0c becomes protonated at an aspartic acid at position 61 in the second TMS. This residue is located at the subunit a/c interface, and protonation induces a rotation of the c-ring whereupon another F0c can be protonated by F0a. This process drives the rotation of subunit γ within the α3β3 hexamer of F1, and by conformational changes in the catalytic nucleotide binding sites, causes the synthesis and release of ATP (9Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 154-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 10Weber J. Senior A.E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The biogenesis of the F1F0 ATPase has been studied in some detail. The current model is that upon the YidC-mediated insertion, F0c assembles into a decameric ring structure (6van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Fillingame R.H. Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Kol S. Turrell B.R. de Keyzer J. van der Laan M. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29762-29768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that subsequently interacts with the F0a/(F0b)2 subcomplex (13Stalz W.D. Greie J.C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27068-27071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is commonly believed that, in the next stage, the preassembled F1 sector binds to the membrane-embedded F0 sector to form the functional ATPase. In vitro, mixing of the separately purified sectors results in the restoration of coupled ATPase activity (14Steffens K. Schneider E. Herkenhoff B. Schmid R. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 138: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which YidC inserts IMPs into the membrane is poorly understood. Analysis of the physicochemical properties of YidC-only substrates may provide further insights in this process. Although the currently identified substrate range of the YidC-only pathway is relatively small, a common feature of these membrane proteins is their small size, their hydrophobicity, and the presence of short hydrophilic periplasmic regions. M13 phage procoat protein (73 amino acids) and the E. coli MscL (136 amino acids) and F0c (79 amino acids) are similar in structure and contain two TMSs (or a signal sequence and TMS). The Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pf3 major coat protein (44 amino acids) contains only one TMS. Although in vivo depletion of the bacterial SRP component Ffh interferes with membrane assembly of a tagged F0c variant (15van Bloois E. Haan G.J. de Gier J.W. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), reconstitution studies have demonstrated that M13, Pf3, and F0c are all targeted to YidC in a SRP-independent manner (6van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 16de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Saaf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 23295-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MscL, on the other hand, seems to utilize SRP (7Facey S.J. Neugebauer S.A. Krauss S. Kuhn A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Currently, it is unclear how ribosome targeting by SRP is achieved as YidC lacks the C-terminal extension of the mitochondrial Oxa1p needed for ribosome binding (18Jia L. Dienhart M. Schramp M. McCauley M. Hell K. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6438-6447Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Szyrach G. Ott M. Bonnefoy N. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6448-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is not evident how SRP can discriminate between the YidC and Sectranslocases, i.e. the assumed default pathway for SRP-targeted nascent IMPs (20Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Therefore, a major unresolved question is how these IMPs are targeted and recognized by YidC. Obviously, the hydrophobic character of the TMSs is important for YidC recognition in line with observations that TMSs of substrate proteins can be cross-linked to YidC (2Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. M. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that the charge distribution in these IMPs may be critical for membrane binding and may possibly allow the electrophoretic translocation of the periplasmic regions and/or the formation of the final membrane topology (21van der Laan M. Nouwen N.P. Driessen A.J. M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Before YidC was identified as an essential component for insertion, M13 procoat was believed to insert into the membrane spontaneously. Earlier studies with model systems suggested that the positive charges at the N and C termini of M13 procoat are important for an electrostatic binding to the membrane surface (22Kuhn A. Wickner W. Kreil G. Nature. 1986; 322: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Gallusser A. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), whereas the negative charges in the connecting loop were proposed to be needed for the proton motive force (PMF)-dependent insertion, allowing the protein to adopt its final membrane topology (24Cao G. Cheng S. Whitley P. von Heijne G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26898-26903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the negative charges appear not to be necessary for insertion per se (25Kuhn A. Zhu H.Y. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2385-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although those studies demonstrated that M13 procoat has a strong tendency to interact electrostatically with the membrane surface, it is unknown whether a membrane surface-bound form represents an authentic intermediate in YidC-mediated targeting and insertion. In contrast, membrane insertion of F0c occurs independently of the PMF, whereas its membrane topology is reverse of that of M13 procoat (6van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). With F0c, the short N and C termini are translocated, whereas the loop that connects the two TMSs remains in the cytosol.Here, we have determined the role of the charged aminoacyl residues in the N terminus and cytosolic loop region of F0c in YidC targeting and membrane insertion using in vitro assays. Our data demonstrate that positive charges in the cytosolic loop region of F0c are important determinants for YidC recognition, and consequently, also for subsequent YidC-mediated membrane insertion. The data further suggest that membrane insertion does not occur via a stable membrane surface-bound intermediate of F0c, consistent with a model wherein newly synthesized F0c is targeted directly to YidC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Plasmids—E. coli strain A19 was used to obtain the S135 lysate (26Clark A.J.

After every generation, the cultures were diluted with 1 volume of the same medium until the YidC-depleted cells stopped growing. Depletion was verified by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against YidC. All mutants were constructed in vector pET20AtpE-A79C (6van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. M.

Reactions were carried out for 20 min at 37 °C in the absence or in the presence of YidC-depleted or non-depleted inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) as described previously. A small sample of the reaction mixture was used as a synthesis control, and the remainder was treated with 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K for 30 min on ice in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100. Samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by 18% SDS-PAGE and phosphoimaging. Binding assays were performed in the same manner, but the remainder was loaded on top of a sucrose cushion consisting of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20% sucrose (v/v) sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol and spun at 25 p.s.i. for 20 min. Pellets were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and analyzed by 18% SDS-PAGE and phosphoimaging.Labeling of F0c A79C—To determine the topology of membrane-inserted wild-type F0c and F0c N++M-----, in vitro labeling reactions were carried out in the presence of IMVs prepared from strain SF100. A small part of the reaction was removed as a synthesis control. The IMVs were subsequently reisolated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion consisting of 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20% (v/v) sucrose and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 20% (v/v) glycerol. The membranes were then incubated for 20 min on ice with 0.15 mg/ml protease K. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 5 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Labeling reactions were performed for 30 min at room temperature with 1 mm 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMdiS) (Invitrogen) with and without Triton X-100 present. The labeling reaction was quenched with dithiothreitol, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and phosphoimaging.RESULTSF0 Subunit c Charge Mutagenesis—In the cytoplasmic membrane, F0c forms a helical hairpin of two TMS. The short N and C termini are translocated into the periplasm, whereas the connecting loop region remains cytosolic (Fig. 1A). Except for the catalytic aspartic acid at position 61 in the second TMS, charged aminoacyl residues are found only at the N terminus (Glu-2 and Asp-7) and in the cytosolic loop (Lys-34, Glu-37, Arg-41, Asp-44, and Arg-50) connecting the two TMSs (M-region). To investigate the contribution of these charges in the targeting of F0c to YidC and the subsequent membrane insertion, we constructed a series of mutants in which the charge distribution and the net charge of the individual regions were systematically altered. To minimize changes in steric interactions with YidC, substitutions of amino acid residues were chosen such that they minimally affected the size of the side chain. To facilitate the determination of the membrane topology of the F0c mutants, mutations were made in an F0c derivative that contains a unique cysteine residue at position 79 and that, like wild-type F0c, inserts into membranes in a YidC-dependent manner (6van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The nomenclature used to describe the mutants first indicates the position in the protein, i.e. N or M, referring to the N terminus or the middle loop region, respectively, followed by the charges present in the region. For instance, the mutant that has the two N-terminal charges replaced by uncharged residues will be referred to as F0c N00. Table 1 summarizes all the mutants used in this study.Recognition of F0c by YidC Is Dependent on the Charge Distribution in the M-region—To study the YidC dependence of F0c binding and insertion, IMVs were isolated from E. coli strain JS7131 (4Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) grown in the presence of arabinose (wild-type cells, YidC+ IMVs) or glucose (YidC-depleted cells, YidC- IMVs). Analysis of these IMVs by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting showed that under YidC depleting conditions, the ∼25-kDa phage shock protein A was induced (29van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. M. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) and that the IMVs of cells grown in the presence of glucose contain only a very small amount of YidC (Fig. 1C). These IMVs were used in subsequent assays, unless indicated otherwise.To determine the role of the charged aminoacyl residues in the M-region of F0c in targeting to YidC, a combined binding/insertion assay was developed based on an in vitro transcriptional/translation reaction of F0c in the presence of IMVs followed by isolation of the IMVs by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. Since targeting, binding, and insertion are tightly coupled processes, the sedimentation assay monitors both the amount of membrane-associated F0c and the amount of inserted F0c. In vitro synthesized wild-type full-length F0c co-sediments with YidC+ IMVs (Fig. 2A, lane 5), whereas only low amounts associate with YidC- IMVs (lane 6). The latter levels are only slightly higher than the sedimentation in the absence of IMVs (lane 4). This suggests that the residual binding is due to the small residual amounts of YidC present in the YidC- IMVs. The efficiency of the in vitro synthesis of F0c was not affected by the presence of IMVs (lanes 1–3). Increased levels of F0c were found to co-sediment with IMVs containing overproduced levels of YidC (Fig. 2E). These data show that the sedimentation of F0c with IMVs is strictly YidC-dependent and that newly synthesized F0c has little tendency to associate with lipids or other membrane proteins present in the IMVs.FIGURE 2Co-sedimentation of F0c with YidC is strongly decreased upon removal of two or more positive charges in the M-region. Wild-type (WT) F0c (A), F0c M+-+-0 (B), F0c M0000+ (C), and F0c M00000 (D) were synthesized in the absence of IMVs (lanes 1 and 4) or in the presence of 5 μg of YidC+ IMVs (lanes 2 and 5) or YidC- IMVs (lanes 3 and 6). E, wild-type F0c was synthesized in the absence of IMVs (lanes 1 and 4) or in the presence of 5 μg of SF100 IMVs (YidC+, lanes 2 and 5) or YidC-overexpressed SF100 IMVs (YidC2+, lanes 3 and 6). After translation, samples were directly analyzed on SDS-PAGE as translation controls (lanes 1–3) or spun through a sucrose gradient, and the collected membrane material was resuspended and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (lanes 4–6). F, quantification of the co-sedimentation of charge mutants with YidC expressed as the ratio of F0c bound to YidC+ and YidC- IMVs. F0c mutants defective in membrane association showed a ratio of 1 or less. n.d., not determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The sedimentation assay was further used to study the interaction of the remaining mutant F0c proteins with YidC. Removal of only one of the positive charges in the M-region (Fig. 2B, F0c M+-+-0) had little effect on the amount of F0c co-sedimented with the YidC+ IMVs. On the other hand, when only a single positive charge (F0c M0000+) (Fig. 2C) or no charge (F0c M00000) (Fig. 2D) is present in the M-region, sedimentation is no longer YidC-dependent, and only very low levels of F0c associate with the IMVs. Analysis of all M-region mutants in the YidC-dependent sedimentation assay (Fig. 2F) showed that the presence of two positive charges in the M-region suffices for efficient YidC-binding (F0c M0-+-+, F0c M+-0-+, and F0c M+-+-0), whereas a further reduction to either one or no positive charge entirely abolishes the YidC-dependent sedimentation. Neutralization of the two negative charged amino acids in the M-region (F0c M+0 + 0+) had little effect on the YidC-dependent sedimentation. With charge mutants of the N terminus of F0c, sedimentation of F0c N00 and F0c N++ is somewhat reduced as compared with the wild-type (F0c N--) but remained YidC-dependent. Taken together, the above data indicate that the positively charged amino acids in the M-region of F0c are important determinants for YidC recognition.YidC-mediated Membrane Insertion of F0c Is Dependent on the Presence of Positive Charges in the M-region—We next analyzed the set of mutants for membrane insertion using the previously described protease-protection assay. In the presence of YidC+ IMVs, membrane-inserted wild-type F0c becomes protease-resistant (6van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, lane 5), whereas with YidC- IMVs, only a low level of protease-protected F0c is observed (lane 6) that is slightly above the background levels observed in the absence of membranes (lane 4). Like wild-type F0c, a substantial amount of protease-protected F0c was observed when the two negatively charged aminoacyl residues at the N terminus were mutated (Fig. 3, B and C, lane 5; F0c N00 and F0c N++), although the YidC dependence of F0c N00 was somewhat reduced. These data show that F0c N00 and N++ insert into the membrane in a YidC-dependent manner and indicate that the charge distribution of the N terminus only marginally affects membrane insertion of F0c.FIGURE 3Membrane insertion of F0c is dependent on the presence of at least two positive charges in the M-region. Wild-type (WT) F0c (A), F0c N00 (B), F0c N++ (C), F0c M+-+-0(D), F0c M0000+ (E), and F0c M00000 (F) were synthesized in the absence of IMVs (lanes 1 and 4) or in the presence of 5 μg of YidC+ IMVs (lanes 2 and 5) or YidC- IMVs (lanes 3 and 6). After translation, samples were applied directly on SDS-PAGE as translation controls (lanes 1–3) or treated with 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (PK) (lanes 4–6). G, quantification of the YidC dependence of membrane insertion of all charge mutants expressed as the ratio of F0c insertion to YidC+ and YidC- IMVs. F0c mutants defective in membrane insertion showed a ratio of 1 or less.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, the membrane insertion of the M-region mutants of F0c was analyzed (Fig. 3, D–G). Mutagenesis of only one of the three positively charged residues into a neutral or negatively charged aminoacyl residue hardly affected the YidC-dependent membrane insertion of F0c (Fig. 3, D and G; F0c M0-+-+, M+-+-0, and M+-0-+). However, a marked decrease in the YidC-dependent membrane insertion was observed upon the mutagenesis of at least two positive charges (Fig. 3, E and G;F0c M0-0-+, M0-+-0, and M+-0-0). Strikingly, the removal of all positive charges (Fig. 3G;F0c M0-0-0), neutralization of the M-region (Fig. 3, F and G;F0c M00000), or a complete replacement of the positively charged residues for glutamate (Fig. 3G, F0c M-----) completely abolishes the YidC-dependent membrane insertion. The latter mutant also excludes the possibility that the insertion defect is due to polarity effects of the introduced leucine residues. Neutralization of the two negatively charged amino acids (Fig. 3G; F0c M+0 + 0+) barely affected the insertion. It should be noted that in particular with F0c M00000, substantial levels of YidC-independent membrane insertion are observed. The F0c mutant with the reversed charge (F0c N++M-----) only weakly inserts into the membrane in a YidC-dependent manner (Figs. 3G and 4A). Overall, it is concluded that at least two positive charges in the M-region of F0c are required for YidC-mediated membrane insertion.

FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a protein that has a membrane topology inverse of that of wild-type F0c. As the F0c N++M----- also behaved differently in the binding and insertion assays as compared with wild-type F0c, we decided to analyze its membrane topology. The F0c derivatives used in this study contain a C-terminal cysteine residue (Cys-79) that in wild-type F0c is translocated into the vesicle lumen. With the membrane-inserted wild-type F0c, the cysteine residue is inaccessible for labeling with the membrane-impermeable reagent AMdiS (6van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J.

Sequence discrimination could take place in the binding and/or the catalytic steps. In this study, we independently measure the binding affinity and initial cleavage rate of Flp recombinase with ∼20 designed alternate target DNA sequences. Our results show that Flp specificity is largely, although not entirely, imparted at the binding step and is the result of a combination of direct and indirect readout. The Flp binding site includes an A/T-rich region that displays a characteristically narrow minor groove. We find that many A → T changes are tolerated at the binding step, whereas C or G substitutions tend to decrease binding affinity. The effects of the latter can be alleviated by replacing guanine with inosine, which removes the N2 amino group that protrudes into the minor groove. Some A → T changes reduce binding affinity, due to clashing with nearby residues, reinforcing that specificity requires avoiding negative contacts as well as creating positive ones. A tracts, which can lead to unusually rigid DNA structure, are tolerated during the binding step when placed within the region where the minor groove is already narrow. However, most A tracts slow catalysis more than C or G substitutions. Understanding what kind of sequence variation is tolerated in the binding and catalytic steps helps us understand how the target DNA is recognized by Flp and will be useful in guiding the design of Flp variants with altered specificities.

Specificity in protein-DNA interactions is required for many cellular processes including transcription, DNA repair, and recombination. Proteins that modify DNA must distinguish their substrates from an overwhelming number of competing DNA sequences. In many cases, DNA-binding proteins recognize a specific DNA sequence even when there are few direct, unique contacts between the DNA bases and the amino acid side chains. Whereas it was once thought that unique hydrogen bond donor and acceptor patterns in the major groove would be the most important feature in DNA-protein recognition, further studies have revealed that other sequence-specific features of DNA often play a critical role. A large number of DNA-binding proteins have been shown to use indirect readout in their recognition of the appropriate DNA sequence, including the 434 repressor, TATA-binding protein, restriction enzymes including EcoRI, and the DNA bending proteins IHF and HU (1Mauro S.A.

In this study we focus on understanding substrate recognition in a site-specific DNA recombinase. Flp is a tyrosine recombinase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that specifically recognizes a pair of 13-bp inverted repeats and catalyzes recombination of the intervening sequence. The recombination reaction involves two rounds of DNA cleavage, strand exchange and religation (7Grindley N.D. Whiteson K.L. Rice P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 567-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Flp is widely used as a biotechnology tool to knock out genes, especially in Drosophila. Efforts to design recombinases with altered specificity for biotechnology applications are ongoing (8Gordley R.M. Smith J.D. Graslund T. Barbas 3rd, C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 802-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Voziyanov Y. Konieczka J.H. Stewart A.F. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and would be aided by further understanding of DNA recombinase recognition. There is no simple set of rules for engineering protein-DNA interfaces. A few examples of successful engineering of DNA-binding proteins exist, most of which relied on selection methods rather than rational design. Zinc finger designs have become sophisticated with the use of phage display and DNA-shuffling (10Pabo C.O. Peisach E. Grant R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), Cre recombinase has been evolved to have different specificity (11Santoro S.W. Schultz P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4185-4190Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 12Buchholz F. Stewart A.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and DNA polymerase has been converted to an RNA polymerase (13Xia G. Chen L. Sera T. Fa M. Schultz P.G. Romesberg F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6597-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The modular design of serine recombinases, where DNA binding and catalysis are physically separable, has made fusion proteins with transcription factor DNA binding domains replacing the DNA binding domains possible (8Gordley R.M. Smith J.D. Graslund T. Barbas 3rd, C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 802-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Akopian A. He J. Boocock M.R. Stark W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8688-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the case of Flp, where DNA binding and catalysis are concentrated in one region of the protein, engineering has focused on a combination of selection and rational design (9Voziyanov Y. Konieczka J.H. Stewart A.F. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Flp recognizes and cleaves DNA specifically at the Flp recognition target (FRT) 2The abbreviations used are: FRT, Flp recognition target; WT, wild type; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine. 2The abbreviations used are: FRT, Flp recognition target; WT, wild type; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine. site, despite the presence of only a few direct side chain to base contacts between Flp and the DNA (Fig. 1). This suggests that much of Flp-DNA recognition is driven by indirect readout, where sequence-dependent structure, flexibility, and other properties of the DNA create specificity, rather than unique contacts between amino acid side chains and DNA bases. The need for a narrow minor groove may explain the specificity for A:T base pairs in the Flp binding site near the scissile phosphate. A/T-rich regions typically have a narrow minor groove, because they are able to achieve a greater degree of propeller twist between adjacent base pairs than C:G pairs where the N2 amino group of the guanine clashes with the base in the n+1 position on the opposite strand (15Fratini A.V. Kopka M.L. Drew H.R. Dickerson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14686-14707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gorin A.A. Zhurkin V.B. Olson W.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 34-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). A:T base pairs are common among protein-DNA complexes that rely on indirect readout to recognize preferred sites, such as HU and the nucleosome, presumably because they have a recognizably narrow minor groove (6Swinger K.K. Rice P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Prior to the experiments described here, binding and catalysis had not been studied independently in Flp. Studies of the effects of binding site mutations have measured the more ambiguous efficiency of full recombination assays that involve two rounds of cleavage, strand exchange, and ligation, any of which could be affected by sequence changes. In these full recombination assays, the WT base is preferred over the other three possibilities in most cases, as the Cox lab showed in their initial study (17Senecoff J.F. Rossmeissl P.J. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The direct contacts made between Flp side chains and the DNA target are clearly important, especially the contact between Arg-281 and a nearby guanine (see Fig. 1). In our study we have focused on the bases near the scissile phosphate (positions 1–6 in Fig. 2) which largely do not make direct contacts with Flp, to understand whether and how they contribute to recognition of the cognate sequence of Flp. Several classic enzyme studies have shown that there is a tight link between binding and catalysis; i.e. altering the substrate will affect both Km and kcat (18Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. 3rd. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1998Google Scholar, 19Kraut D.A. Carroll K.S. Herschlag D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 517-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 20Goldhaber-Gordon I. Early M.H. Baker T.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14633-14642Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, there are several examples of DNA-binding proteins that at least partially separate recognition in the binding and catalytic steps. For example, EcoRI can bind many DNA sequences that are similar to the cognate sequence with high affinity, but the protein distorts only the correct sequence into a form that it can cleave (4Kurpiewski M.R. Engler L.E. Wozniak L.A. Kobylanska A. Koziolkiewicz M. Stec W.J. Jen-Jacobson L. Structure. 2004; 12: 1775-1788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Other DNA-binding proteins have modular designs that physically separate the DNA-binding and catalytic roles to some degree. For example, Mu transposase discriminates among most substrates at the binding rather than the catalytic step, presumably because sequence-specific DNA binding and catalysis are carried out by different domains (20Goldhaber-Gordon I. Early M.H. Baker T.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14633-14642Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In Flp, it is not clear if sequence discrimination takes place during the initial binding step, in the cleavage step, or a combination of the two. In our study, we address two questions. Is the identity of the bases near the scissile phosphate (which Flp makes almost no direct contacts with) important for Flp recognition of its cognate sequence? If so, is sequence discrimination taking place during the binding or catalytic steps, or both? To gain insight into how Flp recognizes its DNA substrate, we designed the FRT DNA mutants shown in Table 1 for both binding and cleavage studies. Our analysis of the structure of the DNA in two Flp-DNA crystal structures revealed that the minor groove is unusually narrow in the A/T-rich region near the scissile phosphate (Fig. 3), and that there is an unusually large drop in the roll angle between the two consecutive A:T base pairs near the scissile phosphate.TABLE 1Equilibrium constants for Flp binding with FRT variants, underline = direct contact to Flp side chain; lowercase bold = mutationKiKi errorIC50ErrorΔGΔΔGnmkcal/molWT GAAGTTCCTATTCTT4.71.310.72.3–11.50 CTTCAAGGATAAGAAGATCFrt1ta GAAGTTCCTATTtTT0.960.024.30.03–12.5–0.96 CTTCAAGGATAAaAAGATCFrt1gc GAAGTTCCTATTgTT179.82.1329.23.9–9.42.2 CTTCAAGGATAAcAAGATCFrt1at GAAGTTCCTATTaTT135.244.8247.481.3–9.52.0 CTTCAAGGATAAtAAGATCWToh GAAGTTCCTATTCoh33.55.655.79–10.41.2 CTTCAAGGATAAGAAGATCWTp GAAGTTCCTATTCp1.61.13.961.7–12.2–0.65 CTTCAAGGATAAGAAGATCFrt14ta GAAGTTCCTtTTtTT16.83.432.76.2–10.80.76 CTTCAAGGAaAAaAAGATCFrt4ta GAAGTTCCTtTTCTT15.12.228.63.8–10.80.70 CTTCAAGGAaAAGAAGATCFrt6ta GAAGTTCtTATTCTT19.92.137.33.7–10.70.86 CTTCAAGaATAAGAAGATCFrt46ta GAAGTTCtTtTTCTT211.658.8380.5105.1–9.32.3 CTTCAAGaAaAAGAAGATCFrt1235at GAAGTTCCaAaaaaa554.6284.31006.5514.8–8.72.9 CTTCAAGGtTtttttGATCFrt235at4ta GAAGTTCCataaCTT733.7370.31297.9654–8.53.0 CTTCAAGGtattGAAGATCFrt5at GAAGTTCCaATTCTT60.622.597.935.8–10.01.5 CTTCAAGGtTAAGAAGATCFrt5uA GAAGTTCCuATTCTT11.92.221.23.5–11.00.56 CTTCAAGGATAAGAAGATCFrt3at GAAGTTCCTAaTCTT228.425.7410.746–9.22.3 CTTCAAGGATtAGAAGATCFrt3au GAAGTTCCTAaTCTT43.26.871.911.1–10.21.3 CTTCAAGGATuAGAAGATCFrt2at GAAGTTCCTATaCTT2.61.17.11.9–11.9–0.36 CTTCAAGGATAtGAAGATCFrt5cg GAAGTTCCcATTCTT106.330.2186.652.4–9.71.87 CTTCAAGGgTAAGAAGATCFrt5ci GAAGTTCCcATTCTT37.213.360.320.9–10.31.2 CTTCAAGGiTAAGAAGATCFrt4cg GAAGTTCCTcTTCTT49.25.688.89.8–10.11.4 CTTCAAGGAgAAGAAGATCFrt3cg GAAGTTCCTAcTCTT137.40.3227.60.55–9.52.0 CTTCAAGGATgAGAAGATCFrt3ci GAAGTTCCTAcTCTT71.429.7115.547.4–9.91.6 CTTCAAGGATiAGAAGATCFrt2cg GAAGTTCCTATcCTT195.638.5347.668–9.32.2 CTTCAAGGATAgGAAGATCFrt3gc4cg GAAGTTCCTcgTCTT217.610.4398.919–9.22.3 CTTCAAGGAgcAGAAGATC Open table in a new tab Our FRT alternate sequences focus on the bases in the vicinity of the scissile phosphate. To probe whether the narrow minor groove of A/T-rich sequences is being recognized by Flp, we made A → T transversions, which should maintain roughly the same groove width, and substituted C:G pairs, which we expected to widen the minor groove. With several sequences we explore how A tracts of four or more sequential As on one strand, which are typically quite rigid, affect binding and catalysis, and whether inosine:cytosine pairs lacking the N2 amino group of guanine are less disruptive than G:C pairs. We also measured the effects of sequence changes on the binding and cleavage steps separately to reveal when sequence discrimination takes place. Overall we find that sequence variation leads to larger changes in binding affinity than cleavage rate constants. A combination of direct and indirect readout is used in the binding and the catalytic steps, which appear to have different specificity requirements. A → T changes, including those that create A tracts, are better tolerated during the binding step. However, C or G substitutions hinder binding more than catalysis. This suggests that a narrow minor groove is important for recognition in the binding step, whereas flexibility to form a specific transition state conformation is important in the catalytic step. WT Flpe and FlpeY343F (“FlpeYF”) were purified as previously described (21Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24800-24807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Conway A.B. Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Binding Competition Assays—PAGE-purified FRT substrates were ordered from IDT. Aliquots of Flpe were diluted in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.1, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm fresh dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 1 m NaCl, 0.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin from fresh 10 mg/ml aliquot, and 2 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. A master mixture of 2× buffer with ≤0.25 nm 32P-labeled FRT DNA and 25 nm Flpe YF was mixed together. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, 5-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were distributed into tubes, 5 μl of the appropriate cold competitor DNA were added (leading to final concentrations of 1, 9, 18, 60, 90, or 180 nm) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Final reaction conditions were 5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 2 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm TAPS, pH 8, 1 mm fresh dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 25 nm Flpe YF. 10-μl samples were loaded onto a native 16 × 18-cm gel containing 10% 29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide (w/w), 5% glycerol, and 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C and run for 1 h at 150 V. Gels were visualized following exposure to PhosphorImager screens (Kodak) using a Bio-Rad phosphorimager. Free DNA and DNA-protein complex intensities in each lane were quantified with the volume analysis function in rectangle mode of Quantity One. Competition data were plotted with f, the ratio of fraction bound in the presence of inhibitor divided by the fraction bound in the absence of inhibitor on the y axis and c, the concentration of cold competing DNA on the x axis. We used the fraction bound in the presence of 1 nm cold competitor DNA as the denominator in the ratio above, because the fraction bound in the absence of competitor DNA was artificially low, possibly because of low Flp solubility with low DNA or salt concentration. The IC50 was determined by fitting the competition curves in Kaleidagraph to the following equation, f=[IC50]/([c]+[IC50])(Eq. 1) where IC50 is the concentration at which f = 0.5. Each IC50 was fit to the average and standard deviation of at least three independent experiments, with the errors weighted in the fits. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the competitor, Ki, cannot be determined from the IC50 using the simple Cheng-Prusoff equation because more than 50% of the DNA is bound to Flp in the absence of competitor DNA. Ki was solved for using an equation that takes the initial fraction bound into account (23Krohn K.A. Link J.M. Nucl. Med. Biol. 2003; 30: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Munson P.J. Rodbard D. J. Recept. Res. 1988; 8 (Erratum (1989-1990) J. Recept.

Experiments were repeated a minimum of three times; error bars in Fig. 4 represent the standard deviation, and errors in Table 1 represent the standard error from the fit. Substrates with weak binding affinity were poorly determined in the range of concentrations we used for the competition assays, leading to greater errors in Table 1. Catalysis Assays—Using the FRT substrates found to have Kis less than ∼100 nm, catalysis assays were performed in 5% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 2 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm TAPS, pH 8, 1 mm fresh dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm (NH4)2SO4 with <2 nm 32P-FRT DNA and 100 nm WT Flpe. After establishing how long it took each substrate to reach 10% completion of the cleavage reaction, time points were chosen for each substrate, ranging from 10 s to 1 min, which would allow us to measure the initial rate. Reactions were stopped in 2× SDS buffer and run on 16% Tris Tricine mini gels with SDS buffer at 150 V for 40 min. Gels were exposed, scanned, and quantitated as described above, and the average of at least three experiments time points were fit to a straight line going through the origin with Kaleidagraph, using the errors to weight the overall fit. Error bars on v0 in Fig. 5 represent the standard error from the fit. To determine the cleavage rate constant, kcleavage, we divided the v0 by the fraction bound, as calculated based on the Ki with the following equation. [DNA−Flp]=((−[DNA]+[Flp]+Kd)±(([DNA]+[Flp]+Ki)2−4[DNA][Flp]1/2)/2)(Eq. 3) The errors were determined by numerically propagating the errors through on v0 and the fraction bound, and multiplying these errors in quadrature to obtain the error on kcleavage. The equilibrium inhibition constants (Ki) we derived from competition binding assays are shown in Table 1, these equilibrium inhibition constants can be treated as equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd). To rule out any possible covalent species in our competition binding assays, we used a Y343F mutant, which lacks the catalytic tyrosine. In all of these experiments we used a variant of Flp, Flpe, containing four mutations that were evolved to give Flp greater stability at 37 °C (12Buchholz F. Stewart A.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Buchholz F. Angrand P.O. Stewart A.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The DNA substrates we used each contain a single Flp binding site, which is one-half of the inverted repeat found in the FRT site (Fig. 4). Using competition assays with increasing amounts of unlabeled competitor DNA and a single concentration of Flpe YF eliminated many of the problems we had with Flpe solubility and behavior. Competition assays were repeated 3–6 times, and a weighted fit of the averages with their errors was carried out using an equation for the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) and converted to Ki values as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We also measured the catalytic efficiency of a subset of FRT variants with WT Flpe and a DNA suicide substrate containing the FRT variation of interest (Table 2). The DNA substrates used in both binding and catalysis studies have only two bases after the scissile phosphate, which are diluted into solution following cleavage during the catalysis experiments, resulting in a covalent bond between Flp and the DNA. Early cleavage time points were taken, and the average fraction DNA cleaved from 3 to 5 experiments was fit with a weight for the error to a line to obtain the initial velocity, v0. The v0 was converted to a cleavage rate constant by dividing by the fraction bound based on the concentration of Flp, DNA, and the Ki for that substrate (Fig. 5). The Ki for the WT FRT is 4.7 ± 1.3 nm, and the cleavage rate constant, kcleave, in these conditions is 2.8 ± 0.06 × 10-3 s-1.TABLE 2Flp-catalyzed DNA cleavage rates for 13 FRT variantsKiFraction boundvokcleavenms–1 × 10–3WT4.7 ± 1.30.95 ± 0.0122.7 ± 0.342.8 ± 0.06Frt1ta0.96 ± 0.020.99 ± 0.00023.1 ± 0.153.1 ± 0.1Frt1gc180 ± 2.20.36 ± 0.0030.0108 ± 0.00470.03 ± 0.04Frt14ta17 ± 3.40.85 ± 0.0250.29 ± 0.0720.3 ± 0.01Frt46ta212 ± 590.32 ± 0.060.043 ± 0.00330.1 ± 0.03Frt4ta15 ± 2.20.87 ± 0.0170.54 ± 0.0550.6 ± 0.04Frt6ta20 ± 2.10.83 ± 0.0150.87 ± 0.0141.0 ± 0.02Frt3at228 ± 260.30 ± 0.0240.1 ± 0.0170.33 ± 0.03Frt2at2.6 ± 1.10.97 ± 0.014.9 ± 0.285.0 ± 0.05Frt5cg106 ± 30.20.48 ± 0.070.9 ± 0.111.9 ± 0.27Frt4cg49 ± 5.60.67 ± 0.0250.64 ± 0.0320.96 ± 0.04Frt3cg137 ± 0.330.42 ± 0.00060.5 ± 0.0461.2 ± 0.02Frt3au43 ± 6.80.70 ± 0.030.9 ± 0.0251.3 ± 0.07 Open table in a new tab Exploring the Scissile Phosphate Position—The change from C to T (FRT WT and FRT1ta) is well tolerated, leading to a very small enhancement in affinity (Table 1 and Fig. 4B). Additionally, comparing the ΔΔG of FRT14ta and Frt4ta, which differ only by the presence of a T in the scissile phosphate position, shows almost no change. However both, G and A (FRT1gc and FRT1at) in the scissile phosphate position weaken binding significantly. The crystal structure shows that there is a hydrogen bond between Lys-82 and the N7 amino group of guanine across from the scissile phosphate position (Fig. 1). This H-bond would be preserved by a C:G → T:A change, as the A supplies a similar H bond acceptor in this position. However, C:G → A:T and C:G → G:C changes would disrupt this H-bond (Fig. 1). Interestingly, a K82M mutation can recombine both the WT FRT sequence and the C:G → G:C transversion in Frt1gc in an in vivo assay (26Voziyanov Y. Stewart A.F. Jayaram M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We also probed whether the scissile phosphate itself affects binding, by comparing WT sequence substrates that end with a hydroxyl and one that contains the scissile phosphate (FRT WToh and FRT WTP, Table 1). The lack of a scissile phosphate does deter binding somewhat (Ki ∼ 34 nm) and the presence of the scissile phosphate returns binding to levels that are slightly better than FRT WT with a two-base pair overhang. Comparing A Tracts with the Sequential Changes of Which They Are Comprised—A tracts are stretches of 4–6 As or Ts, which give a rigid structure with a narrow minor groove that can result in DNA bending at their edges (27Barbic A. Zimmer D.P. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2369-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because A tracts do not contain pyrimidine-purine (Y-R) base steps such as T-A, which have been found to be more flexible than other dinucleotide steps, they may also be less amenable to induced fit in DNA-protein interactions. The pure stretches of As or Ts in the FRT substrates shown in Fig. 4c (as opposed to A/T mixtures), reveal that the position of the A tract within the FRT site has an enormous effect on binding. An A tract (FRT46ta), which still allows for a C in the scissile phosphate position but extends back further toward position 7 where the minor groove is wider in the Flp-DNA crystal structures (Fig. 3) drastically weakens binding, whereas the A tract positioned closer to the scissile phosphate (FRT14ta) has a much smaller effect on binding. The narrowing of the minor groove in an A tract increases in the 5′-3′ direction for a stretch of As, meaning that the FRT46ta sequence may become extremely narrow where the WT sequence widens a bit with a C. Individually making the changes that add up to the A tract that destroys binding does not reveal an additive effect: the individual changes in FRT4ta and FRT6ta do not seriously affect binding, suggesting that the rigid nature of the full A tract in FRT46ta may be responsible for the decrease in binding activity. Other proteins with affinity for A/T-rich segments have struggled to bind to rigid A tracts. For example, whereas the TATA-binding protein functions well and can co-crystallize with many A → T transversions in its target sequence, it cannot function or co-crystallize with a rigid A tract (2Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodakek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A → T Transversions—A → T changes preserve the minor groove hydrogen bond donor/acceptor pattern, and also the increased propeller twist that leads to a narrow minor groove. If these are the recognizable properties of A/T-rich regions, we should not expect A → T transversions to significantly affect binding. This is true for two of the four A → T transversions in the TATT sequence (FRT4ta and FRT2at), which have reasonable binding affinity. In fact, FRT2at has slightly improved binding affinity. However, the other two (FRT3at and FRT5at) have strongly reduced affinity, for position 3 even worse than a CG substitution (Table 1). Examination of the Flp-DNA structure reveals that there are two side chains located quite close to the negatively affected A → T transversions. In the case of FRT3at, modeling an A → T transversion in this position reveals that the Ala-55 of Flp would be positioned very close to the methyl on the swapped T, leading to a steric clash (Fig. 1B). To test the potential clash between Ala-55 and the methyl on the swapped T in FRT3at, we substituted uridine for thymine (FRT3au). We found that removing this methyl largely restored binding; the binding affinity of Frt3au is much stronger than for FRT3at. The binding defect of FRT5at is harder to explain. Met-58, although poorly ordered, is potentially within range to have some favorable hydrophobic interaction with the methyl of T5 (22Conway A.B. Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test the potential interaction between Met-58 and the methyl on T5, we substituted uridine for thymine in this position (FRT5uA). The binding affinity for FRT5uA is similar to WT (Ki ∼ 12 nm versus 4.7 nm for WT), suggesting that the interaction between Met-58 and the methyl on T is not significant. It is thus unclear why the binding of FRT5at is impaired, although it may be that placing the hydrophilic N7 of adenine in proximity to Met-58 is less favorable than removing the methyl group of the WT thymine. These clashes are an important reminder that specificity comes from not only positive direct contacts between an enzyme and its substrate, but also from bad contacts that prevent the binding of the incorrect substrate. This likely explains why FRT235at4ta, with all As and Ts swapped, leads to extremely poor binding. Similarly, the poorly binding A tract FRT1235at includes the deleterious changes in FRT1at, FRT3at, and FRT5at. Separate from our questions about Flp recognition, we noticed some differences in how FRT2at behaves in our binding and catalysis assays as compared with the full recombination assays used by Cox and co-workers (17Senecoff J.F. Rossmeissl P.J. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). FRT2at is an alternative WT sequence found in one of the three Flp protomer binding sites that comprise a WT FRT site in the 2-μ plasmid of S. cerevisiae. (Note that there are only 3 known “WT” Flp binding sites, and thus we cannot do the sort of large scale comparisons possible for transcription factors such as TATA-binding protein (2Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodakek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).) The Cox laboratory (17Senecoff J.F. Rossmeissl P.J. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) found that this alternative WT sequence hindered full recombination activity only when the change shown in FRT2at was present in both half-sites, on both sides of the spacer. Interestingly, we find that FRT2at has even stronger binding affinity than the WT FRT substrate. This implies that the defect in full recombination assays lies in other steps, such as the conformational changes involved in strand exchange and Holliday junction isomerization. Substituting C:G Pairs—Replacing an A:T pair with a C:G pair, which presumably widens the minor groove through the addition of the N2 amino group of guanine, consistently weakens binding of FRT variants in positions 2–5 (Fig. 4E). To confirm that it is specifically the N2 amino group of guanine causing the decrease in binding, we chose two positions to examine with inosine:cytosine pairs, which are identical to G:C pairs but lack the N2 amino group of guanine (Fig. 6). These changes preserve the WT pattern of pyrimidine-purine steps as well. This probes whether the narrow minor groove is indeed the sequence-specific structural characteristic that Flp recognizes. We found that the I:C pairs do not disrupt binding nearly as much as the G:C pairs (FRT5ci and FRT3ci in Table 1), suggesting that the N2 amino group of guanine is responsible for a great deal of the decrease in affinity. We chose 13 of the FRT substrates to compare the efficiency of the first cleavage step with the binding step (Table 2). Using radiolabeled DNA suicide substrates and WT Flpe, we took early time points to measure covalent cleavage product formation. It is technically difficult to measure catalysis with FRT substrates that have a low binding affinity, because it is difficult to achieve saturated binding conditions that are comparable with WT within a concentration range where Flp is soluble (<200 nm). Interestingly, the cleavage rate constants appear to be more seriously reduced with the A tracts that can bind well (FRT14ta and FRT4ta) compared with other FRT substrates with poor binding due to C:G pair substitutions (FRT5cg, Frt4cg, and FRT3cg, see Fig. 5). Compared with WT, Frt14ta has a ∼3-fold decrease in binding affinity, but a ∼10-fold decrease in cleavage rate constant. Frt3cg has a ∼30-fold decrease in binding but just a ∼3-fold decrease in cleavage rate constant. Examining the structure of FRT DNA before and after cleavage shows that the cleaved DNA kinks at the site of the scissile phosphate (Fig. 7). This suggests that the scissile phosphate may need to be in a specific conformation that a rigid A tract would interfere with, inhibiting cleavage more than poor binding from a C/G substitution does. Most of the differences in cleavage rate constants for the different FRT substrates are not significant on a logarithmic scale. This implies that many of our DNA sequence changes have not affected the Achilles heel of the reaction because they do not critically hinder cleavage. However, there are some changes that do significantly affect catalysis: Frt1gc, with a C → G change right at the scissile phosphate, essentially prevents cleavage from taking place. When combined with the binding data, the catalysis data reveal that whether discrimination takes place primarily in the binding or catalytic step depends on the position of the sequence change. Maintaining a narrow minor groove with a well placed A tract allows good binding, but hinders catalysis, likely due to the rigid nature of A tracts affecting the movement of the substrate in or before the transition state. Interestingly, the substitution of C:G pairs to widen the minor groove interferes with binding but not as much with catalysis. However, the C:G → G:C change in Frt1gc is devastating at both the binding and the catalytic steps. We measured the binding equilibrium and the apparent rate of the first chemical step in the recombination reaction, so that we can independently compare how the changes in DNA sequence affect the binding and catalysis. Our results show that Flp specificity is largely imparted at the binding step. Specificity can be thought of as the ability to discriminate between substrates in the ground state, or the competition of substrates for an enzyme. Because many DNA-binding proteins do not have a catalytic function beyond binding to a particular DNA sequence, and others have unusually divorced specificity in their binding and catalytic steps, we could have found that sequence changes had no impact on binding and only affected catalysis or vice versa. There are a few intriguing instances where Flp substrates that bind well are cleaved poorly, suggesting that the sequence requirements for optimal binding and catalysis are not identical. Some changes in the DNA sequence may affect the ability of the DNA-protein complex to reach the transition state, explaining why a rigid A tract such as Frt14ta that can bind well is a poor cleavage substrate. Our results also show that Flp specificity is the result of a combination of direct and indirect readout, but that the details of the indirect readout are more subtle than initially thought. For example, the single C:G → T:A and A:T → T:A changes in Frt4ta and Frt6ta are only mildly deleterious, but when they are combined in Frt46ta, the effect is far more than additive. Frt46ta contains a bone fide “A tract,” whose special structure may be incompatible with that of the Flp-DNA complex. However, Frt14ta, where the A tract is moved only one position to the right, binds reasonably well. This can be rationalized by the crystal structure, where the minor groove becomes increasingly wide (and thus A tract-incompatible) toward position C7. Disrupting the A/T-rich region near the scissile phosphate through the substitution of C:G pairs worsens binding, whereas A/T transversions and replacements with inosine:cytosine pairs have much smaller impacts on binding. This suggests that Flp does indeed prefer sequences that can easily adopt a narrow minor groove in this region. Some A/T transversions hindered binding, which can be attributed to clashes with nearby Flp side chains. While focusing on how specificity is created by positive interactions it can be easy to forget that specificity also comes from avoiding negative interactions so that the incorrect substrate does not bind. In addition, whereas binding is disrupted by the substitution of C:G pairs in the A/T-rich region of the FRT site, catalysis seems to be much less hindered. Even the A tract FRT14ta, which binds similarly to WT FRT, is outperformed by FRT4cg in the catalysis assays, where the substitution of a C:G pair does disrupt binding. Flp sequence discrimination in this region near the scissile phosphate is thus imparted at both the binding and catalytic steps, depending on the change that is made.

Our results suggest that rapid redistribution of Kv2.1 channels occurs during physiological changes in neuronal excitability. The Kv2.1 voltage-dependent potassium channel subunit is expressed in a wide range of neurons in the mammalian central nervous system. In heterologous expression systems, Kv2.1 usually produces potassium currents that activate and inactivate relatively slowly (1Pak M.D. Covarrubias M. Ratcliffe A. Salkoff L. J.

It has been suggested that activation of Kv2.1 channels occurs primarily during repetitive stimulation of neurons, leading to a decrease in excitability during such stimulation (4Du J. Haak L.L. Phillips-Tansey E. Russell J.T. McBain C.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 19-31Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5Misonou H. Mohapatra D.P. Park E.W. Leung V. Zhen D. Misonou K. Anderson A.E. Trimmer J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A series of studies by Trimmer and co-workers (5Misonou H. Mohapatra D.P. Park E.W. Leung V. Zhen D. Misonou K. Anderson A.E. Trimmer J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Kv2.1 channels have an unusual distribution in the plasma membrane and that this localization can be modified by neuronal activity. In cortical and hippocampal neurons, Kv2.1 is localized to numerous discrete clusters on the soma and proximal dendrites. It has been proposed that Kv2.1 channels regulate the spread of excitation between the soma and distal dendrites of these neurons. The Kv2.1 clusters are typically circular or “donut”-shaped. Several forms of neuronal stimulation can, however, eliminate this pattern of channel localization. The induction of seizure activity or the application of glutamate or muscarinic agonists to isolated neurons produces dissolution of the clusters leading to a more uniform distribution of Kv2.1 immunoreactivity in the plasma membrane (5Misonou H. Mohapatra D.P. Park E.W. Leung V. Zhen D. Misonou K. Anderson A.E. Trimmer J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). This alteration in channel location can be attributed to stimulation-induced elevation of calcium levels, which activates a calcium-dependent phosphatase, leading to the dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 at sites located in its cytoplasmic C terminus (6Park K.S. Mohapatra D.P. Misonou H. Trimmer J.S. Science. 2006; 313: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of Kv2.1 also produces hyper-polarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation (5Misonou H. Mohapatra D.P. Park E.W. Leung V. Zhen D. Misonou K. Anderson A.E. Trimmer J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 6Park K.S. Mohapatra D.P. Misonou H. Trimmer J.S. Science. 2006; 313: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Kv2.1 is an ortholog of the Shab gene in Drosophila (7Tsunoda S. Salkoff L. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5209-5221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and orthologs of these channels have been cloned and characterized in a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate species. Although the sequence of these channels has been relatively highly conserved across evolution, their specific electrical characteristics are not so well conserved. For example, the homolog of Kv2.1 in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, differs from the mammalian channel in a number of ways. In this species, neuronal action potentials can be relatively broad (>10–200 ms), and activation of Aplysia Kv2.1 occurs rapidly enough to contribute to the repolarization of individual action potentials (8Quattrocki E.A. Marshall J. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 73-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to mammalian Kv2.1, which inactivates very slowly with maintained depolarization (over ∼3–5 s), Aplysia Kv2.1 inactivates within several hundred milliseconds. Repetitive depolarization of the Aplysia channel at frequencies greater than ∼1 Hz produces cumulative inactivation, leading to frequency-dependent broadening of action potentials at firing rates greater than 1 Hz (8Quattrocki E.A. Marshall J. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 73-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Kaczmarek L.K. Strumwasser F. J. Neurosci. 1981; 1: 626-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The clustering of mammalian Kv2.1 channels can be attributed to a 26-amino acid targeting sequence located in the proximal cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of the channel (10Lim S.T. Antonucci D.E. Scannevin R.H. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 2000; 25: 385-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Four residues within this region are critical for localization to clusters. A conserved clustering sequence can be found in the C-terminal domain of Aplysia Kv2.1. The Aplysia sequence differs from that in rat or humans, however, in that a unique cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site is located within the Aplysia clustering sequence (8Quattrocki E.A. Marshall J. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 73-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Aplysia Kv2.1 channel is expressed in the bag cell neurons within the abdominal ganglion. These neurons have been used extensively to investigate the mechanisms of prolonged changes in the intrinsic excitability of neurons following brief synaptic stimulation (11Conn P.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Mol. Neurobiol. 1989; 3: 237-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Kupfermann I. Kandel E.R. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 22329-22335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In response to very brief stimulation of an input, these neurons generate a ∼30-min period of repetitive firing, termed the “afterdischarge,” which causes the secretion of several neuroactive peptides. During this afterdischarge cyclic AMP levels are elevated, producing an increase in action potential broadening (9Kaczmarek L.K. Strumwasser F. J. Neurosci. 1981; 1: 626-634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K. Strumwasser F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5200-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This allows action potentials that are generated at distal sites in the neurites to progressively invade the proximal neurites and somata of the bag cell neuronal network (16Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K. Strumwasser F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5200-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Dudek F.E. Blankenship J.E. Science. 1976; 192: 1009-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At the end of the afterdischarge, the neurons enter a prolonged (∼18 h) refractory state, during which further stimulation fails to evoke afterdischarges. This pattern of electrical activity allows these neurons to act as a “master switch” for a series of reproductive behaviors. In this paper we have examined the localization of Aplysia Kv2.1 channels. We have found that, like mammalian Kv2.1, Aplysia Kv2.1 channels form clusters in the plasma membrane at the soma and proximal dendrites of bag cell neurons. Physiological stimulation of an afterdischarge or elevation of cyclic AMP levels produces an increase in cluster formation. We have also found that clusters can be dissolved by injection of a peptide corresponding to the clustering sequence within the C terminus and that this is associated with an increase in potassium current that serves to prevent frequency-dependent action potential broadening. Our findings suggest that formation and dissolution of Kv2.1 clusters is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that regulates propagation of information toward and through the somata of neurons. Animals and Cell Culture—Adult A. californica weighing 100–200 g were obtained from Marine Specimens Unlimited (San Francisco, CA) or Marinus Inc. (Long Beach, CA). The animals were housed in an ∼400-liter aquarium containing continuously circulating, aerated Instant Ocean (Aquarium Systems, Mentor, OH) salt water at 14 °C on an ∼12-h light/dark cycle and were fed Romaine lettuce three times a week. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (18–20 °C). For primary cultures of isolated bag cell neurons, the animals were anesthetized by an injection of isotonic MgCl2 (∼50% of body weight); the abdominal ganglion was removed and treated for 18 h at 18–20 °C with neutral protease (13.33 mg/ml; 165859; Roche Applied Science) dissolved in normal artificial seawater (nASW). 2The abbreviations used are: nASW, normal artificial seawater; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; 8-CPT-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenythio)-cAMP. nASW was composed of 460 mm NaCl, 10.4 mm KCl, 11 mm CaCl2, 55 mm MgCl2, 15 mm HEPES, 1 mg/ml glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin; pH was adjusted to 7.8 with NaOH. The ganglion was then transferred to fresh nASW, and the bag cell neuron clusters were dissected from their surrounding connective tissue. Using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette and gentle trituration, the neurons were dispersed in nASW onto 35 × 10-mm polystyrene tissue culture dishes (no. 25000; Corning, Corning, NY). The cultures were maintained in nASW for 1–3 days in a 14 °C incubator. For all of the experiments using isolated neurons in this study, the number of observations (n) refers to number of cells, and the experiments were always carried out using cultures prepared from at least two to four different animals. In experiments to test the effects of afterdischarge on the distribution of Kv2.1 immunoreactivity, intact abdominal ganglia together with bag cell clusters and their pleuroabdominal connective nerves were first incubated for 18 h with neutral protease to soften the collective tissue exactly as described above. The ganglia were then placed in a recording chamber, and afterdischarges were evoked by a stimulus train (20V, 2.5 ms, 6 Hz, 15 s) applied to a suction electrode on the connective nerve. The discharges were monitored through a second suction electrode over the bag cell clusters. Thirty minutes after stimulation, the clusters were dissociated into isolated cells as described above and were then fixed for immunocytochemistry 45 min after stimulation. Establishment of Aplysia Kv2.1 Stable Cell Line—The Aplysia Kv2.1 clone in Bluescript was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 and used to transfect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. CHO cells were grown in Iscove's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and hypoxanthine supplement. Stable cell lines were generated via Lipofectamine 2000-mediated transfection using geneticin as a selection agent for transfected cells. Once the transfected cells had grown to near confluence, the cells were trypsinized, resuspended in medium with low serum, and sorted by size and nuclear refractance so that dead cells were removed, and individual live cells were plated in isolation to create colonies of transfected cells derived from a single progenitor (Yale Cancer Center FACS Center). The colonies were grown to confluence and then plated in 35-mm dishes and assayed for the presence of Aplysia Kv2.1 channels by recording the whole cell current response to a voltage step to +20 mV with the membrane potential clamped at -70 mV with a gigaohm resistance at the electrode-cell junction (whole cell patch clamp mode). Five positive colonies were isolated, and all showed an inactivating voltage-dependent outward current with conductance-voltage relationships similar to that described by Quattrocki et al. (8Quattrocki E.A. Marshall J. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 73-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) for Aplysia Kv2.1 in oocytes. Antibody Production and Purification—The peptides were synthesized to generate antibodies against amino acid sequences encoded by the cloned Aplysia Kv2.1 cDNAs (GenBank™ accession number S68356). The peptide (CXDRADPSLNQDNE), which includes 12 amino acids in the extracellular region between S1 and S2, was synthesized at the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Center at Yale University. The X represents aminocaproic acid, which acted as a spacer molecule between the specific sequence and a nonspecific N-terminal cysteine, which allowed conjugation of the peptide to bovine serum albumin. Bovine serum albumin, in turn, acted as a carrier for antigenic peptide in the generation of chicken polyclonal IgY, which was carried out by Aves Labs, Inc. (Tigard, OR). For affinity purification of IgYs, the synthetic peptides were conjugated to Sulfolink Coupling Gel (Pierce) by the N-terminal cysteine. Each of the two prepared columns was incubated with IgYs for 1 h at room temperature, and then the columns were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Specific antibodies were eluted with a 100 mm glycine buffer, pH 2.5, and then immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.5. Fractions containing proteins (measured by the optical density at 280 nm) were pooled and dialyzed against PBS using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Pierce) and concentrated using a spin column. Immunoprecipitation—Stably transfected CHO cells were lysed with standard radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was precleared with goat anti-IgY immobilized on agarose beads. Kv2.1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysate using affinity-purified chicken anti-Kv2.1 or a fraction of the column flow (nonimmune) through IgY as a control. Following incubation with IgY, the immobilized goat anti-IgY was used to concentrate the IgY-Kv2.1 complexes, and then the pellet was resuspended in SDS gel loading buffer with β-mercaptoethanol and separated on a 4–15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad). The gel was stained with 0.01% silver nitrate. Immunoblotting—Bag cell neuron clusters were dissected from 200–250-g animals. The clusters were homogenized in 100 μl of buffer (1% Lubrol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 nm sodium orthovanadate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 20 μm ZnCl2, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, containing protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science) in glass-glass tissue grinders for 3 min on ice. The samples were then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were collected and transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. SDS gel-electrophoresed proteins were transferred to a immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the blot in Tris-buffered saline Tween 20 (TBST) buffer with 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were incubated with anti-APKv2.1 antibody (1: 200) developed in chicken or with primary antibody incubated with excess antigen peptide overnight at 4 °C and then washed four times for 30 min each, followed by application of secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-chicken Ig Y; Pierce) at 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes of 30 min each in TBST, immunoreactive proteins were visualized with detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—Staining of cultured bag cell neurons was performed on coverslips coated with 1 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma). Bag cell neurons were cultured in nASW for 1–2 days before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in 400 mm sucrose/nASW, as described previously (18White B.H. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1582-1595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three ml of fixative solution were then rapidly superfused into the central well, and fixation was allowed to continue for 25 min. The culture dishes were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 5% goat serum/PBS before incubation with primary antibodies. The coverslips were removed from the culture dishes, inverted on 100 μl of primary antibody solution, and placed in a humidified chamber at 4 °C overnight. The primary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:10,000 in 5% goat serum/PBS. After overnight incubation, the coverslips were washed extensively with PBS and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with fluorescein or Cy3-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG secondary antibodies (FITC-GαCigG or Cy3-GαCigG, Molecular Probes). The coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides using mounting medium. The stained slides were viewed and photographed using Axiovision software (Zeiss). Measurements of relative fluorescence were made by converting the Axiovision files to TIFF files. Regions of interest were defined (4–25 μm2) using Adobe Photoshop 7.0, and the relative luminosity for each region of interest was calculated. Confocal microscopy was carried out using a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope. Because of the large size of bag cell neurons (up to 80 μmin diameter), the focal planes corresponding to apical and basal surfaces of isolated bag cells neurons could readily be differentiated using two criteria. First, neurites and axons extend in length along the flat surface of the dish only at the basal surface of the cells and are generally not visible in sections of the apical surface. Second, during confocal imaging, we obtained three-dimensional projection images to establish the complete topology of the cells. In confocal sections, the apical surface of each neuron was defined as the last apical section before a section in which no clear signal could be visualized, and in all cases, the cross-sectional area of this section was no smaller than 80% of the cross-sectional area of sections at the center of the cell. Individual clusters were defined as patches of immunostaining with a cross-sectional diameter of at least 1 μm. Because bag cell neurons are a homogenous population of neurons and because control and experimental cells were taken from the same animals, we quantified cluster number by counting the total number of patches at the apical surface of each control and experimental cell. Localization of Kv2.1 in Tissue Sections—Tissue was dissected and fixed as described above. Following fixation the tissue was further cryoprotected and rinsed in PBS with 20% sucrose for 18–24 h at 4 °C before embedding in TissueTek medium and freezing in a slurry of acetone and dry ice. Twelve-micrometer sections were cut through the ganglia using a cryostat. The sections were collected on polylysine-coated slides, air dried briefly, and used for antibody staining immediately. The sections were blocked in 2% goat serum/PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h, incubated for 1 h in 2 μg/ml anti-Aplysia Kv2.1 in blocking solution, rinsed three times in PBS, incubated in 1/500 diluted goat anti-rabbit FITC-secondary for 1 h, rinsed again in PBS, and covered with a coverslip with Citifluor. The sections were viewed with a Nikon Optiphot light microscope and photographed with Kodak EliteChrome 400 slide film. Injection of Anti-Aplysia Kv2.1 Peptide into Bag Cell Neurons—Bag cell neurons were isolated and maintained in primary culture according to the previously described method of Kaczmarek et al. (19Kaczmarek L.K. Finbow M. Revel J.P. Strumwasser F. J. Neurobiol. 1979; 10: 535-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Current clamp and voltage clamp recordings were made from bag cell neurons using an AxonClamp 2B (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). For current clamp recordings, the single sharp electrode, bridge balance method was used. For voltage clamp analysis, the discontinuous single-electrode approach was used (20Jonas E.A. Knox R.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schwartz J.H. Solomon D.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1645-1658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wilson W.A. Goldner M.M. J. Neurobiol. 1975; 6: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), in which the membrane potential is changed using a high frequency train of current pulses and measurements of membrane potential are made immediately prior to each current pulse. The discontinuous single electrode voltage clamp amplifier was run at a switching frequency of 1–2 kHz. To ensure adequate voltage control, the individual pulses were monitored on an oscilloscope and adjusted so that the period of voltage sampling corresponded to up to nine electrode time constants. Microelectrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.2-mm ID, TW 120F-4; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and had tip diameters of <1 μm and had resistances of ∼2 MΩ when filled with 3 m KCl. The injections were made with pressure pulses (typically 1–10 pulses; each pulse ∼100 ms in duration) using a Picospritzer (General Valve, Fairfield, NJ) and an injection pressure of 14 p.s.i. The injection solutions contained 11 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 530 mm potassium acetate, 4.3 mg/ml FITC or rhodamine dextran (to monitor injections), and peptide (5 μm). The voltage was filtered at 3 kHz using the Axonclamp built-in Bessel filter and sampled at 2 kHz using a Digidata 1322A A/D converter (Axon Instruments), an IBM-compatible personal computer, and Clampex. All of the current clamp recordings were performed in nASW. Current was delivered with Clampex software (version 8.2; Axon Instruments). For voltage clamp recordings, the CaCl2 in nASW was replaced by 2 mm CoCl2, and the holding potential is at -40 mV. For staining, the cells were fixed within 60 min after injection. Computer Simulations—Simulations of the effects Aplysia Kv2.1 current on action potential broadening were carried out using the following equation, CdV/dt=gcan3J(50 − V)+ gk1m3h(−80 − V)+gk2p(−80 − V)+ gL(Erest −V)+ls(Eq. 1) where gK1 describes the value of the Aplysia Kv2.1 conductance. This equation is similar to that used previously to describe the effects of Aplysia Kv2.1 on action potentials of bag cell neurons (8Quattrocki E.A. Marshall J. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 73-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) except for the addition of a second voltage-dependent potassium conductance (gK2) governed by the gating variable p, which evolved according to equations identical in form to Equations 2–4 of Ref. 8Quattrocki E.A. Marshall J. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 73-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. All of the parameters were identical to those of described by Quattrocki et al. (8Quattrocki E.A. Marshall J. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 73-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with the exception of gCa = 0.8 μs, Erest = -60 mV and with the following parameters for the evolution of the variable p: gK2 = 0.05 μs, up = 0.1 mV-1, Ap = 0.141 ms-1, and wp = 0.021 mV-1. In Fig. 8A, the control value of the Aplysia Kv2.1 conductance gK1 was 1.5 μs and was raised to 1.8 μs in the center panel. For the right-hand panel in Fig. 8 showing the effects of altered voltage dependence, gK1 was 1.5 μs, but Vm was changed from -10 to -20 mV. Characterization of the Anti-Aplysia Kv2.1 Antibody—To examine the localization of Aplysia Kv2.1 in bag cell neurons, we generated antibodies in chicken against a synthetic peptide containing a 12-amino acid sequence corresponding to the extracellular loop between the S1 and S2 hydrophobic segments of the channel (8Quattrocki E.A. Marshall J. Kaczmarek L.K. Neuron. 1994; 12: 73-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Characterization of this antibody was first carried out by immunostaining CHO cells transiently transfected with the Aplysia Kv2.1 gene. Such transfected cells were strongly labeled with this anti-Aplysia Kv2.1 antibody (Fig. 1A). In contrast, no staining was detected in CHO cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 1C). The chicken anti-Aplysia Kv2.1 antibody specifically immunoprecipitated a protein of ∼ 94 kDa from homogenates of CHO cells transfected with the Aplysia Kv2.1 (Fig. 1F). A band of the same molecular mass was also detected on Western blots of preparations from abdominal ganglia of Aplysia (Fig. 1G), and no band was detected when the antibody was preabsorbed overnight with the antigen peptide prior to immunoblotting. Distribution of Aplysia Kv2.1 Channels in Cultured Bag Cell Neurons and in Intact Abdominal Ganglia—To examine the cellular localization of Aplysia Kv2.1 in bag cell neurons in more detail, we prepared cultures of isolated neurons (19Kaczmarek L.K. Finbow M. Revel J.P. Strumwasser F. J. Neurobiol. 1979; 10: 535-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fig. 1D shows a confocal image through the center of the soma of an isolated neuron stained with anti-Aplysia Kv2.1. Dense clusters of immunoreactivity were detected at the edge corresponding to the plasma membrane of the soma. Less intensely stained clusters could also be seen on the proximal neurites. No immunostaining could be detected when the antibody was preincubated with the immunogen peptide (Fig. 1E). We also examined the localization of Aplysia Kv2.1 in the intact nervous system. Immunostaining of 12-μm cryostat sections through the abdominal ganglion confirmed that Aplysia Kv2.1 is strongly expressed in bag cell neurons, which are located in two clusters at the rostral end of the ganglion (Fig. 2A). Staining could also be detected in other cells of the ganglion. As for the isolated cells, no staining was observed when the antibody was preabsorbed with the immunogen peptide (Fig. 2B). Immunoreactivity for Aplysia Kv2.1 could be located both at the somata of individual bag cell neurons and in proximal neurites, which extend around the clusters of somata and around the pleuroabdominal connective nerve close to the abdominal ganglion. This general distribution exactly matches that for other markers of bag cell neuronal processes, such as egg laying hormone, their major neuropeptide transmitter (22Chiu A.Y. Strumwasser F. J. Neurosci. 1981; 1: 812-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Vertebrate C-P4Hs are α2β2 tetramers in which the β subunit is identical to protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). Three isoforms of the catalytic α subunit, PHY-1, PHY-2, and PHY-3, have been characterized from Caenorhabditis elegans, PHY-1 and PHY-2 being responsible for the hydroxylation of cuticle collagens, whereas PHY-3 is predicted to be involved in collagen synthesis in early embryos. We have characterized transcripts of two additional C. elegans α subunit-like genes, Y43F8B.4 and C14E2.4. Three transcripts were generated from Y43F8B.4, and a polypeptide encoded by one of them, named PHY-4.1, assembled into active (PHY-4.1)2/(PDI-2)2 tetramers and PHY-4.1/PDI-2 dimers when coexpressed with C. elegans PDI-2 in insect cells. The C14E2.4 transcript was found to have a frameshift leading to the absence of codons for two residues critical for P4H catalytic activity. Thus, C. elegans has altogether four functional C-P4H α subunits, PHY-1, PHY-2, PHY-3, and PHY-4.1. The tetramers and dimers containing recombinant PHY-4.1 had a distinct substrate specificity from the other C-P4Hs in that they hydroxylated poly(l-proline) and certain other proline-rich peptides, including ones that are expressed in the pharynx, in addition to collagen-like peptides. These data and the observed restricted expression of the phy-4.1 transcript and PHY-4.1 polypeptide in the pharyngeal gland cells and the excretory duct suggest that in addition to collagens, PHY-4.1 may hydroxylate additional proline-rich proteins in vivo.

Under normoxic conditions, two specific proline residues in the HIF-α subunit are subject to hydroxylation by the HIF-P4Hs, which are located in the cytoplasm and nucleus, resulting in binding of the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and rapid targeting of HIF-α for proteasomal degradation (2Myllyharju J.

The D. melanogaster genome contains a large gene family of 20 members that encode C-P4H α-subunit-like polypeptides (29Abrams E.W. Andrew D.J. Mech.

Expression of two other D. melanogaster C-P4H α-subunit-like genes has been shown to be restricted to the salivary glands and to be necessary for the maintenance of an open salivary gland lumen and proper secretory function (29Abrams E.W.

C. elegans PHY-3 is expressed in the embryos, late larval stages, and adult nematodes, its expression in the larval and adult stages being restricted to the spermatheca, a specialized region of the gonad where fertilization of the oocytes occurs (37Riihimaa P.

Nematodes lacking PHY-3 have no obvious phenotypic abnormalities, but the 4-hydroxyproline content of their embryos is markedly reduced, suggesting that PHY-3 is involved in the synthesis of collagens in early embryos, most likely the collagens present in the egg shell (37Riihimaa P.

C. elegans has three PDI isoforms, PDI-1, PDI-2, and PDI-3, of which PDI-2 functions as the C-P4H β subunit (38Veijola J. Annunen P. Koivunen P. Page A.P. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem.

The Caenorhabditis C-P4Hs assembled from the PHY-1 and PHY-2 polypeptides have unique molecular compositions by comparison with the vertebrate C-P4Hs and the one D. melanogaster C-P4H that has been characterized in detail. The main C-P4H form in C. elegans is a PHY-1/PHY-2/(PDI-2)2 mixed tetramer, but both C. elegans PHY polypeptides can also assemble into an active dimer with PDI-2, albeit much less effectively (36Myllyharju J. Kukkola L. Winter A.D. Page A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29187-29196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The assembly properties of the highly homologous C. briggsae PHY-1 and PHY-2 are similar to those of the corresponding C. elegans polypeptides with the exception that in the absence of PHY-1, C. briggsae PHY-2 assembles into an active (PHY-2)2/(PDI-2)2 tetramer instead of a PHY-2/PDI-2 dimer (40Winter A.D. Keskiaho K. Kukkola L. McCormack G. Felix M.-A. Myllyharju J. Page A.P. Matrix Biol. 2007; 26: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Combined disruption of phy-1 and phy-2 gene function leads to the absence of all cuticle C-P4H forms in the two Caenorhabditis species and results in an embryonic lethal phenotype (33Friedman L.

Disruption of the phy-2 gene alone produces no visible phenotype, since the enhanced assembly of the PHY-1/PDI-2 dimer can fully compensate for the lack of the mixed tetramer (33Friedman L.

Inactivation of the C. elegans and C. briggsae phy-1 genes alone leads to abnormal cuticle formation and dumpy and small phenotypes, respectively (33Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R.

Although enhanced assembly of the PHY-2/PDI-2 dimer and (PHY-2)2/(PDI-2)2 tetramer occurs in phy-1 null C. elegans and C. briggsae, respectively, these C-P4H forms cannot fully compensate for the lack of the mixed tetramer and the PHY-1/PDI-2 dimer (36Myllyharju J.

The recombinant C. elegans PHY-3 differs from PHY-1 and PHY-2 in that C-P4H activity is only generated when it is coexpressed with another C. elegans PDI isoform, PDI-1, but not with PDI-2 (37Riihimaa P. Nissi R. Page A.P. Winter A.D. Keskiaho K. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18238-18243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Veijola J.

Whether PHY-3 assembles into a complex with PDI-1 or whether PDI-1 just assists in its folding is as yet unknown, however (37Riihimaa P. Nissi R. Page A.P. Winter A.D. Keskiaho K. Kivirikko K.I.

In the present study we characterized transcripts, generated from the C. elegans genes Y43F8B.4 and C14E2.4, which were predicted to code for polypeptides with similarity to the catalytic α subunits of the human and C. elegans C-P4Hs. Three alternative transcripts were generated from the Y43F8B.4 gene, one of which, named phy-4.1, coded for a polypeptide that, when coexpressed in insect cells, assembled into an active C-P4H dimer and tetramer with C. elegans PDI-2. The spatial expression of the phy-4.1 transcript and PHY-4.1 polypeptide was found to be restricted to the pharyngeal gland cells and the excretory duct. Down-regulation of the phy-4.1 expression by RNAi did not lead to any obvious phenotypic abnormalities, however. A frameshift in the C14E2.4 transcript led to an omission of two of the four catalytically critical residues in the encoded polypeptide, which thus cannot possess P4H activity. These data indicate that C. elegans possesses four functional C-P4H α subunits, namely PHY-1, PHY-2, PHY-3, and PHY-4.1. The recombinant (PHY-4.1)2/(PDI-2)2 tetramer and PHY-4.1/PDI-2 dimer had a distinct substrate specificity from other C-P4Hs, in that they hydroxylated poly(l-proline) and certain other proline-rich peptides in addition to collagen-like peptides. These data together with the unique expression pattern suggest that in addition to collagens, PHY-4.1 may be involved in the hydroxylation of some other proline-rich proteins in vivo. C. elegans Strains and cDNA Pools Used in the Cloning of phy-4—The wild-type Bristol (N2), daf-2(e1370), RNAi-sensitive rrf-3(NL2099), dpy-18(e364), and phy-2(ok177) strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center and maintained at 20 °C by standard methods (41Sulston, J., and Hodgkin, J.

Heat shock treatment of N2 nematodes was performed at 37 °C for 1 h, and dauer formation was induced in the daf-2(e1370) strain by maintaining it at 25 °C for 1 week with a low food supply according to instructions in the C. elegans data base (available on the World Wide Web). Total RNA and mRNA were isolated from normal and heat-shocked N2 and dauer daf-2(e1370) mixed stage cultures with the TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) and a Poly(A)quik mRNA isolation kit (Stratagene), respectively, according to the manufacturers' instructions. cDNA was produced from the isolated RNAs with a SMART™ RACE cDNA Kit (BD Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of the Predicted Genes Y43F8B.4 and C14E2.4 and Their Transcripts—A sequence homology search of the C. elegans data base (available on the World Wide Web) indicated the existence of two putative genes, Y43F8B.4 and C14E2.4, encoding polypeptides with similarity to the catalytic C-terminal regions of the human and C. elegans C-P4H α subunits (Fig. 1). The accuracy of the predicted Y43F8B.4 transcripts was analyzed by 5′-RACE reactions with primers from exons 1, 2, and 3 and 3′-RACE reactions with primers from exons 3 and 4 and the cDNA pools generated above; and PCR with primer pairs from exons 1 and 3 and exons 3 and 5, using the C. elegans mixed stage cDNA library UNIZAP 937006 (Stratagene) as a template. The C14E2.4 transcripts were analyzed by 3′-RACE reactions of the cDNA pools using primers from exons 1, 3, 4, and 5 and by PCR of the cDNA library with primer pairs from exons 1 and 3 and exons 3 and 5. The RACE PCR experiments were performed with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) as follows: predenaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 68 °C, and extension for 3 min at 72 °C. The PCR template from the UNIZAP 937006 cDNA library was prepared by incubating 2 μl of the cDNA library at a final volume of 200 μl in 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 55 °C for 45 min, followed by 10 min at 95 °C and centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. 10 μl of the template was used in a PCR with a final volume of 50 μl. The PCR amplifications were performed as follows: preincubation for 5 min at 94 °C and 2 min at 72 °C before the addition of the Pfu polymerase, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 2 min at 65 °C, and extension for 3 min at 72 °C. All RACE and PCR products were cloned into pUC18 using the SureClone ligation kit (GE Healthcare) and sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer (Abi Prism 377; Applied Biosystems). Expression and Analysis of Recombinant PHY-4 Variants in Insect Cells—The cDNAs for the transcripts phy-4.1 and phy-4.2 (Fig. 1) without the sequences for the predicted transmembrane helix and signal peptide, respectively, were amplified by PCR and cloned into a BamHI-NotI-digested baculovirus expression vector pACGP67-A (Invitrogen) in frame with the baculovirus GP67 signal sequence.
