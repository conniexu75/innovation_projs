https://openalex.org/W1935984619,"Abstract The solubilities of amino acids, diglycine, and triglycine have been measured in water and 1 m to 6 m guanidine hydrochloride solutions. Free energies of transfer of amino acid side chains and backbone peptide units from water to guanidine hydrochloride solutions have been calculated from these data. The results show similarity between the patterns of solubilizing effects of guanidine hydrochloride and urea, although guanidine hydrochloride is 2 to 3 times more effective than urea at the same concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1673322472,"Abstract The enzyme lysine 2,3-aminomutase from Clostridium SB4 which catalyzes the conversion of l-lysine to l-β-lysine has been studied. A satisfactory radiochemical assay has been developed. Although the enzyme is inactivated rapidly by exposure to oxygen, it can be fully activated by anaerobic incubation with a sulfhydryl compound for 1 hour at 37°. Optimal activation occurs when 0.9 mm ferrous ion is present; evidence is presented that enzyme-bound ferrous ion is required for activity. The enzyme is moderately stable and has been purified 53-fold in 10% yield to a specific activity of 6.4 units per mg. The best preparations appear to be at least 95% homogeneous on the basis of disc gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. A molecular weight of 285,000 has been estimated by two different procedures. The sedimentation coefficient is 10.0 S. The addition of S-adenosylmethionine stimulated activity; near maximal activity was achieved when 3.7 moles of S-adenosylmethionine per mole of enzyme were added to the assay. The apparent Km for S-adenosylmethionine is 2.8 x 10-8 m. S-Adenosylhomocysteine inhibits competitively with S-adenosylmethionine. The enzyme is stereospecific for l-lysine; the apparent Km is 6.6 mm. S-Aminoethylcysteine is a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 56 µm). The aminomutase reaction is reversible; the equilibrium constant (K = (l-β-lysine)/(l-lysine)) at 37° is 6.7. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme has a peak at 420 mµ and is similar to that of some pyridoxal phosphate enzymes. The activity and the absorbance peak are decreased by treatment with cysteine, hydroxylamine, or isonicotinic acid hydrazide. Analytical data show that the enzyme contains at least 1.7 moles of protein-bound vitamin B6 per mole. Experiments with D2O and T2O show that little or no exchange between solvent hydrogen and lysine or β-lysine occurs during the aminomutase reaction."

Squalene epoxidase activity can be assayed either with squalene and heated microsomes or with 10,11-dihydrosqualene and intact microsomes. In common with other monooxygenases, the epoxidase requires TPNH and molecular oxygen. Both a soluble fraction of rat liver and microsomes are necessary for enzyme activity. Carbon monoxide or potassium cyanide fail to inhibit squalene epoxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1979824443,"The experiment of teaching a young chimpanzee to use American sign language1 is an important advance on previous attempts to test the linguistic potential of primates. For the first time, a primate’s capacity for a language used by some humans has been clearly separated from his capacity for making the sounds of human speech. In the nature of things, this pioneer study has been made under special conditions, and (like any single study) cannot be assumed to be perfectly representative. Nevertheless, it does offer evidence of a new kind, in the light of which it is timely to reexamine the relation between human language and the signals that animals use or can learn to use."
https://openalex.org/W1599095320,"The enzyme-dependent production of cross-linked collagen and the lysine-derived cross-link precursor allysine (α-aminoadipic δ-semialdehyde) has been demonstrated. The enzyme, lysyl oxidase, was extracted from embryonic chick cartilage and was inhibited by the lathyrogen β-aminopropionitrile. Cross-linking of collagen was indicated by production of a β12 component of collagen and insoluble collagen in the samples incubated with lysyl oxidase. Allysine production was observed in both α1 and α2 chains. Approximately three times as much was present in the α1 as in the α2 chain. The only lysyl residue that was found to be converted to allysine in the α1 chain was Residue 9 from the amino-terminal end. Since this is the residue that is converted in vivo and β-aminopropionitrile inhibits the conversion in vivo, it is concluded that lysyl oxidase is the physiologically active enzyme necessary for the first step in the cross-linking of collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1583648119,"Abstract An enzyme, methylase II, has been purified approximately 900-fold from calf thymus cytosol. The enzyme methylates exogenously added proteins with S-adenosyl-l-methionine-methyl-14C. Among the proteins tested, a protein isolated from calf thymus serves the best as methyl acceptor. The purified enzyme is completely free of endogenous substrate protein, and is electrophoretically homogenous. Molecular weight of the enzyme has been estimated to be 35,000 by means of Sephadex G-100. The enzymatically incorporated methyl group becomes volatile upon either acid or alkaline hydrolysis of the protein, and the product is identified as methyl alcohol. Optimum pH for the reaction is 6 in citrate-phosphate buffer, and the Km values for S-adenosyl-l-methionine with the protein isolated from calf thymus and with histone are 1.05 x 10-6 m and 1.54 x 10-6 m, respectively. The enzyme does not require any cofactor, and 50% glycerol protects the enzyme from thermal denaturation."
https://openalex.org/W3134895813,"Abstract The transport of several sugars by cells of Neurospora crassa grown in shake culture has been investigated. 3-O-Methyl-d-glucose is a substrate for the glucose transport system in glucose-grown cells but cannot be phosphorylated by the ATP-dependent hexokinase which readily catalyzes the phosphorylation of d-glucose. Since this nonmetabolizable glucose analogue cannot be accumulated against a concentration gradient in cells grown on glucose, it appears that net glucose uptake in glucose-grown cells involves a facilitated diffusion transport step followed by ATP-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent metabolism of the transported glucose. Growth of cells on d-fructose leads to the appearance of a system which catalyzes the accumulation of unaltered 3-O-methyl-d-glucose and l-sorbose against considerable concentration gradients."
https://openalex.org/W1565991817,"We have found that O-alkyl bonds in glycerolipids are synthesized by microsomal enzymes of preputial gland tumors when dihydroxyacetone-P or glyceraldehyde-3-P and 1-14C long chain fatty alcohols are used as substrates; ATP, coenzyme A, and Mg++ are essential cofactors. The O-alkyl moieties formed from the 1-14C- and 9,10-3H-labeled long chain fatty alcohols show that the fatty alcohol chains are directly incorporated. Dihydroxyacetone-P is an obligate source of the glycerol portion of glyceryl ethers, since only the dihydroxyacetone-P served as a precursor when 1-hydroxy-3-chloro-2-propanone phosphate was used as a specific inhibitor of triose-P isomerase, which is present in the microsomal preparation. Kinetic data on the following parameters were obtained: time, CoA, Mg++, ATP, protein, pH, and inhibitors (phosphate and 1-hydroxy-3-chloro-2propanone phosphate). We documented the chromatographic behavior of the intermediates (O-alkyldihydroxyacetone and O-alkyldihydroxyacetone-P) and identified the O-alkyl linkage by thin layer and gas-liquid chromatography of the isopropylidene derivatives of the O-alkylglycerols formed by LiAlH4 reduction. Only the 1 isomeric O-alkylglycerols could be isolated after LiAlH4 reduction. Although other nucleotides (ADP and ITP) substituted for ATP in this system, glutathione or cysteine could not replace the CoA requirement. Metals other than Mg++ did not provide optimal conditions, and copper ions inhibited the biosynthesis of O-alkyl bonds. To some extent, dihydroxyacetone was able to replace the dihydroxyacetone-P requirement, but it is possible that phosphorylation occurred in the system. The enzymic synthesis of the O-alkyl linkage is localized in microsomes and appears to decrease as the tumor ages. The preputial gland tumors contain significant quantities of Oalkyl- and O-alk-1-enyl-linked lipid classes, but the enzyme system described was unable to make O-alk-1-enyl bonds under our experimental conditions. However, the similar composition of the O-alkyl and O-alk-1-enyl moieties (16:0, 18:0, and 18:1) suggests that interconversions between these two lipid classes or their precursors may occur."
https://openalex.org/W1658606231,"Abstract The presence of two neuraminidases in rat liver, one strongly bound to the lysosomes and another that occurs in soluble form in the cytosol has been established. The properties of these two enzymes differ markedly. The pH optimum, with neuramin lactose as the substrate, is 5.8 for the soluble neuraminidase (5.2 after partial purification) and 4.4 for the lysosomal enzyme. Soluble neuraminidase is inhibited by Cu2+, Hg2+, and Zn2+ which have no effect on the lysosomal enzyme. Conversely, Na+, K+, and Li+ inhibit the lysosomal but not the soluble neuraminidase. The soluble enzyme hydrolyzes low molecular weight substrates such as neuramin lactose, neuramin lactose sulfate, and a sialoglycopeptide fraction isolated from a Pronase digest of ovine submaxillary glycoprotein but no activity can be detected when brain gangliosides and intact ovine submaxillary glycoprotein are used as substrates. The lysosomal neuraminidase, on the other hand, hydrolyzes all these substrates very efficiently."

https://openalex.org/W1491084071,"Abstract Methionine synthesis in Neurospora involves acetylation of homoserine, catalyzed by homoserine transacetylase; replacement of the acetyl group by cysteine, catalyzed by cystathionine γ-synthase; and elimination of homocysteine from cystathionine, catalyzed by β-cystathionase. Another enzyme catalyzes reactions of acetylhomoserine with sulfide or methylmercaptan to yield homocysteine or methionine directly, but the acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase reaction does not play a major role in methionine synthesis in this organism. Three other fungi, Saccharomyces, Candida, and Cunninghamella were found to have transacetylase and sulfhydrylase enzymes similar to those in Neurospora, but only equivocal levels of cystathionine synthase have so far been detected. The Neurospora cystathionine synthase activity was very labile after extraction and was lost on dilution. Inhibition by hydroxylamine could be only partially attributed to a requirement for pyridoxal phosphate. Eight genes are known in Neurospora in which mutation confers methionine auxotrophy. None of the corresponding mutants lacked the sulfhydrylase. The me-5 mutants investigated had modified, rather than absent, transacetylase activities. Cystathionine synthase activity was absent from extracts of me-3, me-7, me-1, and me-6 mutants. The first two of these mutants have no other known defect; the second two are also blocked in the transmethylation of homocysteine. Activity was reconstituted by pairwise mixing of macromolecular fractions from the four mutant extracts in all combinations, with one possible exception, suggesting that several gene products are involved in this presumably single step reaction. Addition of methionine to minimal growth medium did not affect the wild type levels of transacetylase or cystathionine synthase activity. S-Adenosylmethionine was identified as an end product inhibitor of cystathionine synthase. Activity was inhibited 50% by 0.01 mm S-adenosylmethionine, but the inhibition was established only after the enzyme had been exposed to inhibitor for 5 min. No end product control over the first reaction unique to methionine synthesis could be detected, suggesting the existence of another, unidentified vital function for acetylhomoserine, or for the transacetylase. The concentration of S-adenosylmethionine in wild type cells which had been grown in the presence of methionine was shown to be sufficient to inhibit cystathionine synthase completely. An ethionine-resistant mutant which over-produced methionine was found to be unable to accumulate the inhibitor due to a defect in S-adenosylmethionine synthase; this is believed to be the first identification of a gene coding this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2043927279,"WE have been able to stimulate the formation in rabbits of a very specific antibody against triiodothyronine (T3) by injecting the animals with a condensation product of T3 and succinyl poly-L-lysine. Antibodies against thyroxine (T4) have been obtained by Clutton, Harington and Yuill1 and by Churchill and Tapley2 using conjugated hapten–protein antigens, but the use of natural proteins as carriers may be the reason for the rather low specificity of the resulting antibodies. We prepared succinylated poly-L-lysine by the method of Stason, Vallotton and Haber3, and reacted it by carbodiimide condensation with the methyl ester of T3. After saponification a highly specific antigen was obtained."

https://openalex.org/W1569788509,"Abstract Reaction of muscle phosphorylase with 14C-iodoacetamide followed by determination of radioactivity in pepsin-derived peptides permits the measurements of rates of alkylation of cysteinyl peptides of known amino acid sequence. The two —SH groups of Peptides B1 and B2, previously shown not to be related to the structure and function of this enzyme, were not affected significantly by the experiments reported in this paper. Two —SH groups per monomer of phosphorylase a, contained in Peptides N and A, are related to structure and function because, as reported before, their alkylation results in a dissociated, inactive protein. The presence of AMP results in no alkylation of Peptide A and no dissociation into monomers, so that the loss of activity is correlated with the alkylation of the single —SH group of peptide N in each monomer, and both processes exhibit the same rate. Imidazole citrate buffer causes phosphorylase b to dissociate into monomers, and in this case also the —SH group of Peptide A is not alkylated and the rate of inactivation is the same as the rate of alkylation of the single —SH group of Peptide N. The rate of alkylation of the N peptide of the monomer is more than 100 times that of the dimer, is similar to the rate for model compounds, and suggests that in this monomer the —SH group is freely exposed on the surface. AMP, which maintains phosphorylase b in an oligomeric form in imidazole citrate, lowers the rate of alkylation and inactivation some 6-fold. The reduction of the aldimine linkage between pyridoxal-5-P and the enzyme does not prevent phosphorylase b from dissociating in imidazole citrate, and, as with the native enzyme, Peptide A is not alkylated, while the inactivation is correlated with the reaction of the N peptide. In contrast to the monomer formed in imidazole citrate, the monomeric apoenzyme formed by the removal of pyridoxal-5-P from phosphorylase b becomes alkylated in both its A and N peptides when treated with iodoacetamide. Phosphorylase a does not dissociate in imidazole citrate, and this buffer causes only a moderate increase in the rate of inactivation. The reaction of iodoacetamide with phosphorylase b in imidazole citrate causes a change in the spectrum of the pyridoxal-5-P which is indicative of the formation of a Schiff base. The rates of inactivation, of alkylation of the N peptide, and of the Schiff base formation are equivalent. The results are discussed in relation to the interdependence of diverse sites on the phosphorylase molecule. The various chemical modifications of specific sites, or the binding of ligands to their sites, result in changes transmitted through the protein structure as reflected by the altered character of other sites. In particular, the reactivities of the —SH groups of Peptides N and A, as measured by the rates of reaction with iodoacetamide, are altered in a definable manner by treatments of the other sites, and each variation in reactivity may represent a conformational change in the protein."

https://openalex.org/W2082898611,"Pistia stratiotes L. is a free-floating water-weed, common on many waters in West Africa. It is capable of rapid vegetative reproduction by offshoots, and concern has been expressed over a possible infestation of the lake behind the newly closed Kainji dam on the River Niger in Nigeria where the plant is now accumulating. Our discovery of the cause of a die-back of this plant which occurs annually on enclosed and permanent waters in the Ibadan area of Western State, Nigeria, offers some hope, however, that the plant could be controlled biologically on Kainji Lake."

https://openalex.org/W2414231020,"Abstract A 4 S α2-β1-glycoprotein was isolated from Cohn Fraction VI of pooled normal human plasma by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl- and carboxymethylcellulose, Sephadex A-50, and hydroxylapatite columns and by filtration through Sephadex G-100. The final preparation appeared homogeneous after starch gel and disc electrophoresis at pH 5.0 and 8.6. Physicochemical and chemical characterization of this plasma globulin revealed the following properties: molecular weight, approximately 60,000; sedimentation coefficient, 4.1 S; diffusion constant, 5.9 x 10-7 cm2·sec-1; frictional ratio, 1.50; axial ratio, approximately 8; electrophoretic mobility at pH 8.6, 3.9 x 10-5 cm2·sec-1·volt-1; isoelectric point at pH 4.0; and isoionic point at pH 4.9. The optical rotatory dispersion curve of the native protein revealed a trough with a maximum at 218 mµ. In 50% 2-chloroethanol, this maximum was shifted to approximately 232 mµ, whereas in 5 m urea the trough was noted at 211 mµ. The carbohydrate moiety accounted for approximately 30% of the total weight and consisted of neutral hexoses (galactose and mannose), glucosamine, sialic acid, and fucose. This glycoprotein contains one polypeptide chain as judged from terminal amino acid analyses (1 mole of carboxyl-terminal serine and 1 mole of amino-terminal arginine). The content of the 4 S α2-β1-glycoprotein in pooled normal human plasma was estimated to be approximately 20 mg/100 liters."

Goodfriend et al.2 showed that linking the polypeptides of bradykinin and angiotensin with rabbit serum albumin (RSA) by the use of carbodiimides produced a complex which was highly antigenic. Subsequently Davis et al.3 showed that the antibodies induced by the bradykinin–RSA complex were protective against the biological effects of bradykinin, and Oken et al.4 obtained similar results with angiotensin. So far the use of carbodiimides has been confined to protein and peptide syntheses."

https://openalex.org/W1562277216,"By the use of labeled substrates of known stereochemistry, it has been shown that the cholesterol Δ22-dehydrogenase of Tetrahymena pyriformis stereospecifically eliminates the 22-pro-R hydrogen atom in converting cholesterol to cholesta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol. Dehydrogenation by the same organism of biosynthetic cholesterols derived from (2R)-(2-3H,2-14C) and from (2S)-(2-3H,2-14C)-mevalonic acid in the rat then showed that the 2-pro-R hydrogen of mevalonic acid adopts the 22-pro-R configuration in cholesterol, and the 2-pro-S hydrogen of mevalonic acid adopts the 22-pro-S configuration. In addition, the introduction of the Δ7,8-double bond into cholesterol by T. pyriformis was shown to entail the removal of the 7β-hydrogen atom. The possible mechanisms of the reaction are briefly discussed. A chemical degradation of cholesta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol is also described."
https://openalex.org/W2007276590,"RECENTLY Fletcher and Huehns1–3 proposed an interesting hypothesis on the possible functional difference between the two iron binding sites of the iron transport protein, transferrin. They presented evidence from in vitro studies that iron uptake by the two binding sites is random, while the release of iron to erythroid precursors occurs preferentially from one site, which they arbitrarily designated the A site. This site is also postulated to be important in the transfer of iron to the placenta of pregnant animals. The other site, designated B, is somehow concerned with delivery of iron to storage depots. Complete saturation of both sites with iron produces greater transfer to erythroid precursors and/or storage depots. The concept of selective release of iron from functionally different binding sites on the transferrin molecule is potentially of great importance and warranted repetition of Fletcher and Huehns's in vitro experiments and the exploration of their hypothesis in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1559246006,"Abstract By means of steady state and pre-steady state kinetic experiments in the presence of the acridine dye, thionine, the rate constants associated with formation and disappearance of the presumed acyl enzyme intermediate were determined for the reaction of β-trypsin with tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester. At pH 4.9, 25°, 0.5 m sodium chloride, the kinetic constants are: k23 (acylation rate constant), 200 sec-1; k34 (deacylation rate constant), 0.25 sec-1; K's (enzyme-substrate dissociation constant), 1.25 mm. Evidence is presented that thionine is not bound at the active site of trypsin. A ternary enzyme-substrate-thionine complex exists with the same dissociation constant as the enzyme-substrate complex. An acyl enzyme-thionine complex exists with a dissociation constant higher than the enzyme-thionine complex. The presence of bound thionine slows down the acylation but speeds up the deacylation of trypsin by tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester."
