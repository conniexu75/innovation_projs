https://openalex.org/W2094878156,"Electrical properties of Purkinje cells were recorded by intracellular microelectrode during extracellular electrophoretic application of gamma aminobutyrate, norepinephrine, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate. All these substances hyperpolarized Purkinje cells. Transmembrane resistance decreased during gamma aminobutyrate hyperpolarization. In contrast, norepinephrine and the cyclic nucleotides generally elevated resistance. These results show that cyclic nucleotides mimic the unique effects of norepinephrine on the bioelectric properties of neuronal membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2063229129,"Brief periods of stimulation of the preganglionic nerve fibers produced a severalfold increase in the content of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in superior cervical sympathetic ganglia, whereas postganglionic stimulation did not. These and other experiments indicated that the increased concentrations of adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate were closely associated with the process of synaptic transmission. This increase occurred primarily in postsynaptic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1494318461,"Abstract The subcellular distribution of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase has been studied in rat cerebral tissue. The enzyme was found to be present primarily in the particulate fractions. The active particulate fractions possessed considerable latent activity which could be unmasked by treatment with Triton X-100. Protein kinase of high specific activity could be solubilized from the microsomal fraction as well as from subcellular organelles associated with the synapse. The data support the concept that adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate is associated with the molecular events underlying the processes of synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1661968451,"Abstract The survival time in plasma of incompletely desialylated ceruloplasmin, labeled with 64Cu or with tritium, was studied in the rat. Removal of less than 20% of the terminal sialic acid, with consequent exposure of the penultimate galactosyl residues, resulted in the rapid disappearance from the circulation of more than 50% of the injected dose. Statistical analysis of the experimental results by means of the Poisson distribution equation supports the estimate that the exposure of no more than 2 galactosyl residues is sufficient to effect prompt clearance of ceruloplasmin from the circulation. Examination of the specificity of the two neuraminidase preparations used in this study revealed that each of the enzymes possessed a preferential affinity for different sialic acid residues, although the results from each were statistically predictable. Consequently, the removal of any 2 sialic acid residues from 1 molecule of ceruloplasmin appears to be incompatible with the continued survival of that molecule in the circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1587358923,"A relatively simple procedure was devised for the purification of phosphofructokinase from rabbit liver extracts. The enzyme was purified more than 2600-fold with a yield of close to 50%. Liver phosphofructokinase migrates faster on zone electrophoresis than rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase. It also differs from muscle enzyme in stability, molecular weight, and kinetic properties. The liver enzyme behaves on Sepharose chromatography as a polymer of various states of aggregation with the largest aggregate having a particle weight of many millions. A comparison of the kinetic properties of liver and muscle phosphofructokinase revealed similarities in pH optimum, cation activation, and substrate affinity at pH 8.2. On the other hand, striking differences in kinetic control properties were observed at pH 7.0. The liver enzyme was more inhibited by ATP, less sensitive to the deinhibiting action of AMP, ADP, and cyclic 3',5'-AMP, less inhibited by citrate, phosphoenolpyruvate, phosphocreatine, 2-phosphoglycerate, and 3-phosphoglycerate, and more inhibited by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate than muscle phosphofructokinase. The results suggest that liver phosphofructokinase is less suited for anaerobic energy production than the skeletal muscle enzyme and may not be subject to the same control mechanism in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1571668265,"Abstract An assay method has been developed for the measurement of tissue levels of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) based upon the ability of the cyclic nucleotide to activate cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase purified from bovine heart, kidney cortex, or brain. The method has been used to measure cyclic AMP levels in mouse brain and in rat brain, liver, fat pads, and isolated adipose cells under various conditions. The results obtained with the three different sources of enzyme agreed well, both with each other and with published values. The limit of sensitivity of the assay method for cyclic AMP was about 2 x 10-9 m. In isolated adipose cells, Filipin, a polyene antibiotic with antilipolytic properties, decreased the intracellular cyclic AMP level, apparently by causing its leakage from the cells into the incubation medium. Vitamin K5, also an antilipolytic agent, unexpectedly potentiated the action of norepinephrine and corticotropin in elevating intracellular cyclic AMP levels in adipose cells. The data also show a differential inhibition by Ca++, EDTA, and dl-β-hydroxy-N-tert-butyl-2,4-dichlorophenethylamine of the action of various lipolytic hormones in elevating cyclic AMP levels in adipose cells. It is suggested that there occur at least three distinct types of hormone receptor in adipose cells, each interacting specifically with one of three catagories of hormone, namely, (a) norepinephrine, (b) glucagon, and (c) corticotropin and thyroid-stimulating hormone."

In one such patient, activity of this enzyme ranged from 8 to 34 percent of normal in erythrocytes when assayed with a very high concentration of magnesium 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. In addition, the mutant enzyme exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with this substrate as well as an increased Michaelis constant for both guanine and hypoxanthine. These findings provide the first evidence for genetic heterogeneity within the group of patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2428177224,"Abstract The reaction of the glutamine analogue, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), with the bifunctional, regulatory enzyme aggregate of the tryptophan pathway, anthranilate synthetase-anthranilate 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase (PR transferase), and with the anthranilate synthetase Component I protein of the aggregate was studied. DON inhibits anthranilate synthetase Component I activity and glutamine- and NH3-dependent anthranilate synthetase activities of anthranilate synthetase-PR transferase. DON inactivates glutamine-dependent anthranilate synthetase activity of the enzyme aggregate, but has less effect on the NH3-dependent anthranilate synthetase activity of the aggregate and does not inactivate anthranilate synthetase Component I. Inactivation of anthranilate synthetase activity of anthranilate synthetase-PR transferase by DON is dependent upon the substrate chorismate, thus providing evidence for ordered binding of first chorismate and then DON (or glutamine). Inactivation of anthranilate synthetase by DON is prevented by the feedback inhibitor, tryptophan. It is suggested that tryptophan evokes feedback inhibition, at least in part, by either preventing chorismate from binding or by preventing the conformational change needed to allow glutamine to bind. The two components of the aggregate, anthranilate synthetase Component I and PR transferase, can be separated by disc gel electrophoresis in 8 m urea. Following treatment of anthranilate synthetase-PR transferase with 14C-DON, most of the radioactivity is incorporated into PR transferase. It therefore appears that the two substrates for anthranilate synthetase bind to different polypeptide chains, chorismate to anthranilate synthetase Component I and glutamine to PR transferase. Approximately 2 moles of 14C-DON bind per mole of enzyme; this suggests a subunit composition of (anthranilate synthetase Component I)2 (PR transferase)2. Titrations with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) indicate that DON alkylates 2 cysteine residues per enzyme molecule. A glutaminase activity has been detected in purified preparations of anthranilate synthetase-PR transferase. Glutaminase activity is stimulated by chorismate and inhibited by tryptophan. It is suggested that this activity serves to transfer the amide of glutamine from the site on PR transferase to the NH3 site on anthranilate synthetase Component I. A reaction mechanism which accommodates the experimental data is proposed."

The remaining mannose residue was resistant to hydrolysis by α-mannosidase, but could be removed by a Smith degradation, a procedure which did not affect the N-acetylglucosamine residues. The resultant product chromatographed identically with 2-acetamido-4-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-N-(4-l-aspartyl)-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosylamine prepared chemically by Spinola and Jeanloz (J. Biol. Chem., 245, 4158 (1970)). In addition, both synthetic and isolated compounds reacted similarly on treatment with β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and glycosyl asparaginase. Evidence is presented showing the mannose residue in the asparaginyl trisaccharide to be linked to the 3-O position of the terminal nonreducing N-acetylglucosamine and that the N-acetylglucosamines form a disaccharide identical with di-N-acetylchitobiose."
https://openalex.org/W1620492677,"Abstract The activity of pyruvate oxidase from Escherichia coli increases 15- to 20-fold in the presence of phospholipids extracted from cell membranes. Fractionation and analysis of the phosphatides from E. coli cell envelope preparations revealed that lysophosphatidylethanolamine exhibited highest specific activity for stimulating the flavoprotein if the phospholipids were added directly to the assay mixtures. However, when water-soluble micellar preparations were substituted for direct addition of the phospholipid to the assay, all the phosphatides demonstrated higher specific activities for stimulating pyruvate oxidase. Furthermore, the differences originally noted in the activating capacities of the various cell envelope phospholipids were minimized. By measuring pyruvate oxidase activity under conditions in which the micellar phospholipid preparation was rate-limiting, Michaelis constants (Km) for various phosphatides were determined. The Km values for the cell envelope phospholipids, synthetic phosphatidylethanolamine, lecithin, and lysolecithin ranged from 0.9 to 2.2 x 10-6 m. The Km value for phosphatidylserine was somewhat higher, being 6.5 x 10-6 m. The diacylphospholipids exhibited normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Lysophosphatides demonstrated considerable divergence from normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This observation suggests that pyruvate oxidase differentiates between phospholipids according to the number of fatty acids contained within the molecular structure. The hydrophobic moieties of lecithin activate pyruvate oxidase whereas the hydrophilic portions of the molecule have no stimulatory effect. The enzyme can also be activated by fatty acids at concentrations only slightly higher than those required for maximal stimulation by micellar phospholipid preparations. Of the fatty acids tested, palmitoleic and oleic appear to be most efficient in stimulating pyruvate oxidase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2170808016,"Abstract Intestinal calcium transport was studied in vitro in ileal tissue obtained from vitamin D-deficient (-D) chicks which had received a dietary supplementation (+D) of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). When the flux measurements were carried out in both the mucosal → serosal and serosal → mucosal directions, under short-circuit conditions in which the transmural potential difference across the cell could be reduced to zero, it was found that calcium transport in the +D system was an active, cation-oriented process operating against an electropotential gradient. Calcium was not actively transported in the vitamin D-deficient chick. The presence or absence of inorganic phosphate had no effect on calcium flux in either the +D or -D system. Both the flux of 3H2O and 14C-thiourea were identical in the +D and -D systems, which is consistent with the concept that the increased calcium flux due to vitamin D3 treatment is not due to a general permeability difference. A carrier was shown to be present at the brush border side of the intestinal mucosal cells of both vitamin D-treated and -deficient chicks. However, kinetic studies and the differential effects of cold, iodoacetamide, and N-ethylmaleimide on calcium flux suggest that the biochemical properties of the calcium carrier in the +D system have been altered in some manner so as to effect a more efficient uptake of calcium into the cell. Also, the increased calcium flux due to vitamin D3 administration was found to require 40 to 50 hours for optimal development and to be blocked by prior actinomycin D treatment. This supports the hypothesis that the vitamin D-mediated enhancement of calcium transport is achieved indirectly through RNA and protein synthesis, rather than through direct participation of the vitamin."
https://openalex.org/W1606056101,"Abstract The processes involved in the induction of the liver enzyme tyrosine transaminase by either hydrocortisone or adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in organ culture have been shown to exhibit different characteristics. Removal of cyclic AMP, as the N6,O2'-dibutyryl analogue (dibutyryl cyclic AMP) during the early phase of induction of either tyrosine transaminase or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, or after attainment of a new elevated steady state level, prompted a virtually immediate cessation of the induction process. In contrast, removal of hydrocortisone at either stage did not stop elevation of transaminase activity for 1½ to 2 hours even in the presence of actinomycin D. The sequential addition of one inducer after maximal induction by the other revealed that hydrocortisone markedly amplified the subsequent effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on the transaminase. Prior exposure to dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not lead to any amplification of the subsequent enzyme response to hydrocortisone. The results are interpreted to indicate that hydrocortisone and cyclic AMP act at sequential sites n the synthesis of tyrosine transaminase. The suggestion s made that cyclic AMP may act at a post-transcriptional evel in the case of both the transaminase and carboxykinase."
https://openalex.org/W167900309,"In isolated bovine thyroid cells, incubation with TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) brought about a slowly developed stimulation of iodide accumulation. This stimulation was associated with an increase in the Vmax of the system that transports iodide ion into the cell. During the course of development of the stimulatory response, the presence of TSH was required only during the first 1 to 2 hours. After this initial period, the TSH could be removed, but full stimulation would still occur. During this same period, the stimulatory response could be completely blocked by addition of actinomycin D; whereas beyond it, addition of actinomycin D was without effect. It appears, therefore, that the TSH induced the synthesis of a specific RNA, and that this RNA accumulated sufficiently during the initial 2 hours to provide for the subsequent development of the full stimulatory response. When cycloheximide was added along with the TSH, stimulation was completely inhibited. However, if the cycloheximide and TSH were washed out at the end of the initial 2-hour period, and the incubation of the cells continued, full stimulation of the iodide pump developed even in the absence of further additions of TSH. Evidently, the induced specific RNA was accumulated in the cycloheximide-blocked cells, and when the cycloheximide was removed, this RNA became effective in inducing the formation of a specific stimulatory protein. Treatment of the thyroid cells with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) in place of TSH, faithfully reproduced all the effects of TSH in every detail. Moreover, the cyclic AMP content of the cells was found to be acutely responsive to increases and decreases in the concentration of TSH added to the incubation media. We conclude from the present findings that the first action of TSH is the activation of adenyl cyclase so that cyclic AMP production is augmented. Then the production of a specific RNA is induced, which in turn induces the formation of a specific stimulatory protein. The function of this protein in the stimulation of the iodide pump remains to be elucidated."

The similarity of the action of the cyclic nucleotides to that of glucagon supports the hypothesis that cyclic adenosine monophosphate is the secondary messenger mediating the action of glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W2047038134,"The effect of hydroxypyruvate on synthesis of oxalate and glycolate from glyoxylate was studied in in vitro preparations from normal human erythrocytes and leukocytes, rat liver, and with purified lactate dehydrogenase from beef heart. In the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, hydroxypyruvate stimulated the oxidation of glyoxylate to oxalate and decreased the reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate. These findings may explain the hyperoxaluria seen in L-glyceric aciduria (type II primary hyperoxaluria)."
https://openalex.org/W1533326198,"Abstract We investigated the effects of insulin on amino acid transport, protein synthesis, and protein breakdown in fat cells isolated from rat epididymal adipose tissue. Insulin stimulated the accumulation of 14C-labeled proteins in fat cells incubated with 14C-labeled l-leucine, l-alanine, glycine, and l-serine. With l-leucine-1-14C as a model amino acid, we observed that the effects of insulin did not require the addition of glucose or other carbohydrate to the incubation medium, and were produced by insulin concentrations comparable to those required to accelerate glucose transport. The accumulation of 14C-labeled proteins was inhibited by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and theophylline at concentrations known to increase adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in isolated fat cells. The inhibitory effects of ACTH were reversed by insulin, while the inhibitory effects of theophylline and ACTH plus theophylline were only partially reversed. High concentrations of N6, 21-O-dibutyryl cyclic AMP duplicated the effects of ACTH and theophylline. Insulin had only slight effects on the inhibition produced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Amino acid transport was assessed by measuring the intracellular accumulation of 14C-labeled α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), 1-aminocyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid, and certain natural amino acids. The labeled amino acids achieved intracellular to extracellular concentration ratios which were similar to the concentration ratios of the natural amino acids measured in fresh adipose tissue. AIB transport was Na+-dependent and temperature-sensitive and inhibited by a 20:1 molar excess of l-leucine, but was glucose-independent and not affected by ACTH, theophylline, or N6, 21-O-dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Insulin did not change the initial rate of AIB uptake, the initial rate of AIB efflux, or the equilibrium concentration ratios of AIB and cycloleucine. When protein synthesis was blocked by 10-4 m puromycin, insulin had a slight inhibitory effect on protein breakdown. This antiproteolytic effect of insulin could not fully account for the stimulatory effect of insulin on the accumulation of 14C-labeled proteins. We concluded that the predominant effect of insulin was exerted on some unidentified step in protein synthesis rather than on the steps of amino acid transport or protein breakdown. Furthermore, we postulated that cyclic AMP might act as a negative effector for the action of insulin on protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1533229961,"Abstract Intestinal transport or flux, J, of calcium was studied from both the mucosal to serosal sides and from the serosal to mucosal sides in ileal tissue obtained from vitamin D-treated (+D) and -deficient (-D) chicks. It was found that intestinal calcium transport in the +D ileum was an active, cation-oriented process, while calcium was not actively transported in the -D chick. Other parameters which are obligatorily associated with the +D calcium transport system are (a) sensitivity to cold, (b) inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide, and (c) an effective calcium carrier at the microvilli side of the cell. The polyene antibiotic, filipin, was found to be a specific tool with which to study calcium transport in vitro in a -D ileum. Filipin, at concentrations of 10 µg per ml (approximately 1.7 x 10-5 m), stimulates the calcium flux, Jms, of -D ileal tissue by 150 to 200%, but has little or no stimulatory effect on Jms of +D ileal tissue. The effect of filipin is specific for calcium as compared to Rb+, sulfate, phosphate, serine, thiourea, and water. The incubation of filipin in vitro with -D ileal tissue mimicked many aspects of dietary vitamin D administration. Filipin when placed in the solution bathing only the microvilli side of the intestinal cell (a) induces an active translocation of calcium against an electrochemical gradient; (b) confers the property of cold sensitivity on the increased Jms flux; (c) confers sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide on the increased Jms flux; (d) interacts with the membrane-bound carrier on the microvilli side of the cell to effect an increased uptake of calcium into the cell; and (e) binds more rapidly to intact ileal segments obtained from -D compared to +D chicks. Filipin was shown not to be an ionophoretic compound for calcium, so that the enhanced calcium translocation cannot be ascribed to a direct interaction of filipin and calcium. The sum of this and other evidence suggests that filipin is apparently able to effect a structural reorganization of the -D microvilli membrane so that a previously inactive calcium transport system becomes active. The consequences of this direct filipin-mediated reorganization are remarkably similar to the indirect actinomycin D-sensitive effects brought about by dietary vitamin D administration. A plausible hypothesis for the mechanism of action of vitamin D is that its administration to a vitamin D-deficient animal may cause a structural reorganization of the microvilli or brush border membrane by a process of induction of the synthesis de novo of proteins which are active in either a catalytic or structural role in the mucosal brush border membrane to effect efficient translocation of calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1612003925,"Abstract An orthophosphate-repressible extracellular alkaline phosphatase has been isolated from cultures of Micrococcus sodonensis. The enzyme is pure as judged by molecular sieve chromatography, disc gel electrophoresis, and ultracentrifugation, and possesses the following properties: (a) molecular weight, 80,000; (b) pH optimum, pH 9 to 9.5; (c) competitive inhibitors, orthophosphate, arsenite, and arsenate; (d) substrate specificity, hydrolyzes a wide variety of phosphorylated compounds including phosphomonoesters, nucleotide mono-, di-, and triphosphates, and inorganic pyrophosphate. Enzymatic activity is dependent upon the presence of free sulfhydryl group(s); derivatization of the enzyme with 1 eq of p-chloromercuribenzoate results in the loss of approximately 75% of its catalytic activity. Activity of the enzyme exhibits an absolute requirement for divalent cation with the following relative reactivations of ethylenediaminetetraacetate-inactivated enzyme: Ca++, 90; Mn++, 22; Co++, 15; Sr++, 13; and Cu++, Mg++, Zn++, l1. The Km for Ca++ was estimated to be 1.5 x 10-5 m and the Kdissociation = 1.5 x 10-5 m as determined by equilibrium dialysis. Assuming a molecular weight of 80,000, the Ca++ content of the enzyme was estimated to be 8 g atoms per mole. Removal of Ca++ from the enzyme resulted in a marked increase in susceptibility of the enzyme to inactivation by heat and proteolytic digestion."
https://openalex.org/W2267124181,"Abstract Microsomal and mitochondrial preparations from rat adrenal glands converted pregnenolone (3β-hydroxypregn-5-ene-20-one) to progesterone, a two step reaction which requires the participation of a DPN+-dependent Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and a Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase. The mitochondrial enzymes could be prepared as a membrane fraction after sonic treatment of the mitochondria. This preparation revealed a lower apparent Km for DPN+ than the corresponding microsomal system. The submitochondrial fraction rapidly oxidized DPNH formed during the reaction, whereas the microsomal fraction was much less active in this regard. When a DPN+-regenerating system (lactic dehydrogenase + pyruvate) was added to the microsomal system, the apparent Km for DPN+ was indistinguishable from that of the submitochondrial preparation. The conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone was inhibited by cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (3',5'-AMP) in both subcellular systems, but was more sensitive to inhibition in submitochondrial particles than in the microsomal preparation. However, when the DPN+-regenerating system was added to the microsomal fraction, utilization of pregnenolone to progesterone was inhibited by 3',5'-AMP to a comparable extent in both subcellular preparations. Inhibition of pregnenolone utilization by 3',5'-AMP was strictly competitive with respect to DPN+ in each instance. Among various adenine compounds tested, 3',5'-AMP inhibited the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone to the greatest extent. Adenosine also produced a significant inhibition. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate and adenosine 5'-diphosphate appeared to be slightly inhibitory. Adenosine 3'-monophosphate, adenosine 5'-triphosphate, and adenosine 2',3'-monophosphate were inactive. Activation of lactic dehydrogenase by DPNH was also inhibited competitively by 3',5'-AMP. This action of the cyclic nucleotide was less specific than its effect on pregnenolone utilization, since 5'-AMP, 5'-ADP, and 5'-ATP inhibited nearly as well. Moreover, adenosine had no effect in this instance. Steroid dehydrogenase and isomerase activities in adrenal subcellular fractions were also studied individually, using substrates which were specific either for Δ4-3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (pregn-4-ene-3β,20β-diol and androst-4-ene-3β,17β-diol) or for Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase (pregn-5-ene-3,20-dione and androst-5-ene-3,17-dione). Both enzyme activities were stimulated by DPN+ and competitively inhibited by 3',5'-AMP. At all levels of DPN+ and 3',5'-AMP, the activity of these dehydrogenase systems, as well as that of the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone, was lower than that of the isomerase systems. These results suggested that Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity may be rate-limiting in the over-all reaction and that the inhibitory effects of the cyclic nucleotide on conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone in adrenal subcellular preparations were primarily related to actions on the dehydrogenase."

https://openalex.org/W1584298557,"Abstract An inducible 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase (mevalonate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (acylating CoA), EC 1.1.1.-) has been purified 21-fold from soluble extracts of Pseudomonas to an apparently homogeneous state as judged by disc gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight estimated by gel electrophoresis is 2.6 to 2.8 x 105. The purified enzyme is free of HMG-CoA lyase (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA acetoacetate lyase, EC 4.1.3.4) or HMG-CoA hydrolase (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA hydrolase, EC 3.1.2.5) activities, and catalyzes the following reactions: HMG-CoA + 2NADH + 2H+ ⇄ mevalonate + 2NAD+ + CoA (1) Mevaldate + NAD+ + CoA → HMG-CoA + NADH + H+ (2) Mevaldate + NADH + H+ → mevalonate + NAD+ (3) Parallel enrichment of all three activities is observed throughout purification, suggesting that all are properties of a single protein. Reaction 1 is reversible, but mevalonate formation is strongly favored. Mevaldate is not a free intermediate either in HMG-CoA reduction or mevalonate oxidation. The pH optimum for mevalonate oxidation occurs at pH 9.2 to 9.6. Km values are 0.050 mm (dl-HMG-CoA), 0.032 mm (NADH), 0.30 mm (mevalonate), 0.27 mm (NAD+), and 0.039 mm (CoA). Although HMG is a competitive inhibitor both of mevalonate oxidation (Ki = 0.22 mm) and of HMG-CoA reduction (Ki = 3.9 mm), the former reaction is more effectively inhibited (Ki:Km = 0.73) than is the latter (Ki:Km = 79). Double reciprocal plots of data obtained by varying both HMG-CoA and NADH concentration given lines intersecting on the negative abscissa, with no evidence of concave curvature. HMG-CoA reduction thus appears to proceed by a mechanism different from that proposed for yeast HMG-CoA reductase by Kirtley and Rudney (Biochemistry, 6, 230 (1967)). Reaction 3 yields similar double reciprocal plots. For Reaction 2, Km values are 0.61 mm (dl-mevaldate), 0.06 mm (NAD+), and 0.046 mm (CoA). HMG is an effective inhibitor competitive with mevaldate (Ki = 1.3 mm; Ki:Km = 2.1).

Both strains had prephenate dehydrogenases with similar kinetic and allosteric characteristics. The enzyme had an absolute requirement for NAD as a cofactor. The intrinsic Km for prephenate was 2 mm; for NAD the Km equaled 1 mm. Optimal catalysis of the reaction was achieved at a temperature of 32°, pH 8.4. l-Tyrosine, a competitive inhibitor of prephenate dehydrogenase activity, accentuated strongly the cooperativity of binding of prephenate molecules to the enzyme. l-Tyrosine also protected the enzyme from temperature inactivation. d-Tyrosine and l-phenylalanine were also competitive inhibitors of prephenate dehydrogenase. Inhibitions by l-tryptophan and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate were mixed with respect to prephenate. Further repression of the synthesis of prephenate dehydrogenase by l-tyrosine beyond the existing level of repression in minimal medium was small in both wild type strains. A 2-fold decrement in specific activity resulted when cells were cultured in broth or in minimal media containing l-tyrosine or combinations of aromatic amino acids. Prephenate dehydrogenase from a regulatory mutant, insensitive to feedback inhibition by l-tyrosine, was also insensitive to inhibition by d-tyrosine, l-phenylalanine, and l-tryptophan."
https://openalex.org/W175341626,"Citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7) from Escherichia coli is purified to homogeneity. The minimal molecular weight from amino acid analysis is about 62,000. The molecular weight of sodium dodecyl sulfate monomers is 60,000 to 65,000. Results of peptide fingerprinting suggest that the enzyme is composed of only one kind of subunit. The catalytically active protein is a tetramer with a molecular weight of 248,000. At a pH of 8.0 to 9.5, citrate synthase, both in dilute and concentrated solutions, is present as an equilibrium mixture of the catalytically inactive monomer and octamer and catalytically active tetramer. At a pH of 7.0 the equilibrium is shifted toward the formation of octamer and in the presence of dithiothreitol this is the only species present. At a pH of 11.0 the enzyme irreversibly dissociates to form monomers. Titration with thiol reagents shows that the native enzyme has 1.5 to 2 sulfhydryl groups per monomer which are readily available to the reagents. Enzyme denaturated by sodium dodecyl sulfate shows the presence of about eight sulfhydryl groups per monomer. The reactivity of the exposed sulfhydryl groups does not change in the presence of substrate, acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), or the allosteric inhibitors, α-ketoglutarate and DPNH. Equilibrium-binding studies show that acetyl-CoA binds to the catalytically active tetramer and catalytically inactive octamer in a cooperative manner, both in the absence and presence of KCl. In initial velocity studies, however, the cooperative rate-concentration plots in the absence of KCl become Michaelian hyperbolas in its presence. It is surmised that KCl possibly affects only the rate constants associated with the binding of various reactants. The allosteric inhibitors, α-ketoglutarate and DPNH, bind to the enzyme in a negatively cooperative manner in the absence of acetyl-CoA but in a positively cooperative manner in its presence. The binding of both the inhibitors, especially that of DPNH, is considerably enhanced in the presence of the substrate. A quasi-ordered binding of inhibitors is, therefore, postulated during catalysis. All of the experimental observations can be rationalized if it is assumed that the various polymeric forms of the enzyme exist in the absence of ligands in a conformation which binds the substrates with poor affinity. The cooperativity of the binding plots is considered to arise by the differential binding of substrates and inhibitors to two states or conformations of the protein."

N6,O2'-Dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-AMP exerted its maximal effect at a concentration of 10-4m. At this concentration the cyclic nucleotide had no effect on the rate of nuclear ATP synthesis. The first wave of RNA synthesis consisted mainly of 45, 32, and 18 S ribosomal RNA and its synthesis was fully inhibited by 0.2 µg per ml of actinomycin D. In contrast the second wave of RNA synthesis consisted mainly of heterogeneous RNA ranging from 7 to 18 S and its synthesis was completely inhibited by 0.04 µg per ml of α-amanitin. Both the Mg++-low salt and the Mn++-high salt-stimulated RNA polymerases showed an increased activity in the presence of 10-4 m N6, O2'-dibutyryl cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1670245774,"Protein kinases and regulatory proteins (R-proteins) which are capable of binding adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) are partially purified from rat liver and rabbit skeletal muscle soluble fractions. The activity of either one of these kinases is almost totally depressed by R-protein from the homologous as well as from the heterologous tissue. As described earlier, cyclic AMP activates the inactive kinase by binding to R-protein resulting in the release of active kinase. These protein kinases phosphorylate the same specific seryl and threonyl residues of histone. Salmon sperm protamine and rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylase b kinase serve as phosphate acceptors for both kinases. A possible role of the protein kinase systems in controlling cellular activities is also discussed briefly."
https://openalex.org/W1486386618,"Abstract The NAD+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase from pea stems is shown to respond to the mole fraction of NADH when total NAD (NAD+ plus NADH) is kept constant. Fifty per cent inhibition occurs when the mole fraction of NADH is 0.1. In this region the enzyme is extremely sensitive to NADH concentration and it is suggested that this acts in a similar manner to energy charge in other systems. In an attempt to simulate conditions in vivo, the response of the enzyme to constant ratios of citrate to isocitrate was studied and it was found that even under these conditions the enzyme showed sigmoid kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2078537913,Herpesviruses specify new glycoproteins that bind to cell membranes and also appear in the envelope of the virion. Incubation of purified smooth membranes from infected cells with antiviral antibody results in an increase in the density of the membranes as determined by flotation in sucrose density gradients. The magnitude of this increase depends on the amount of antibody used; densities as high as 1.16 grams per cubic centimeter have been obtained (the density of the untreated membranes is 1.08 grams per cubic centimeter). Antiviral antibody does not increase the density of uninfected cell membranes nor do saline or normal rabbit serum change the densities of infected or uninfected cell membranes. Viral antigens—presumably the glycoproteins specified by the virus—are probably on the surface of the infected cell membranes and bind to them strongly enough to withstand the hydrodynamic forces applied to them in the sucrose gradient.
https://openalex.org/W1533950837,"Abstract The conformation of cytochrome c oxidase at pH 7.4 has been examined by circular dichroism measurements in the Soret and the intrinsic absorption regions. The studies include the conformational characterization of native oxidized and reduced oxidase, and the corresponding complexes with cyanide and carbon monoxide, as well as investigation of the conformational effects associated with increasing concentrations of detergent, aging of the preparation, and the ionic nature of the detergent. It is concluded that the conformation of the prosthetic group is dependent upon the nature of the detergent used, the age of the preparation, and the valence state of heme a. The ionic detergent, deoxycholate, and aging alter the conformation of heme a, especially in the reduced state of iron, whereas oxidized oxidase seems to be more or less insensitive to both. In the ferric state of iron the purified preparation exhibits a complex Soret spectrum which is replaced by a single symmetrical peak upon reduction with dithionite. A conformational change from a rather asymmetric heme a environment to relatively symmetrical surroundings seems to accompany the valence change of iron. It is further concluded that there exists no heme-heme interaction in any of the valence states of the enzyme. In the intrinsic absorption region, the native enzyme and its complexes exhibit extrema at 222 and 210 nm, typical of proteins and polypeptides containing α helical structures. The positive extremum, 197 nm, and the cross-over point, 204 nm, however, are indicative of the presence of other structures. The possibility of β structure is considered."

Although this enzyme resembles the particulate diesterase of the same organism in kinetic properties and in inhibition by methyl purines, its greater stability, its insensitivity to stimulation by imidazole and to inhibition by adenosine triphosphate,- and its selective release into the medium indicate a specific function, perhaps protection against exogenous cyclic nucleotide, for the soluble enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2137856257,"Abstract A total of 24 nucleotides were examined as substrates for 5'-AMP aminohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.6). The following nucleotides were deaminated at the indicated maximum velocity relative to AMP (100): adenosine 5'-phosphoramidate (73), N6-methyl-AMP (20), dAMP (18), adenosine 5'-monosulfate (13), adenosine (1), and ADP (1). Other substrates for which maximum velocities were not determined included N6-ethyl6-AMP, formycin 5'-monophosphate, 2'-O-methyl-ADP, and α,β-methylene-ADP. 3'-AMP, 3',5'-AMP, and 3-β-d-ribofuranosyladenine 5'-phosphate were not deaminated but were effective inhibitors. The pH optimum for ADP deamination was more acidic (pH 5.0 to 5.5) than the optima for AMP or adenosine (pH 6.3 to 7.0). Heat inactivation data and the concurrent elution of the activity for AMP and ADP from cellulose phosphate are consistent with a single enzyme being responsible for the multiple activities. Aspects of the mechanism are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1916573076,"Abstract The pyruvate kinase (ATP: pyruvate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.40) from the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus licheniformis was investigated. Pyruvate kinase was found to be rapidly inactivated by dilution at 30° or incubation at 0°. Divalent cations, P-enolpyruvate, and either AMP or Pi acted in concert to protect the enzyme against both the inactivation accompanying dilution and that caused by low temperatures. Pyruvate kinase was stabilized by Mg(II), P-enolpyruvate, and Pi during the 370-fold purification of the enzyme. Stability studies revealed that NAD+, NADH, ATP, and P-enolpyruvate partially stabilized pyruvate kinase in the presence of Mg(II). AMP and Pi decreased the apparent stability of the enzyme in the absence of Penolpyruvate. These studies also showed that the inactivation could be reversed under certain conditions. Three kinetically differentiable states of pyruvate kinase were shown, i.e. one active and two inactive. The first state, obtained when the enzyme was inactivated by dilution in the absence of metabolite ligands, was converted to the second inactive state by a time-dependent process mediated by AMP or Pi. The second inactive state, stabilized by AMP or Pi, was converted to the active, third state in a time-dependent process mediated by Mg(II) and P-enolpyruvate. This last conversion appeared to involve an aggregation process, since the rate of reactivation manifested a second order dependence on the concentration of inactive enzyme. The specific activity of pyruvate kinase in crude extracts was found not to depend on the stage of the life cycle or on the nature of the carbon-energy source supporting growth. In addition, the antiserum that was prepared against enzyme, purified 50 times, of cells grown on glucose precipitated all of the activity present in crude extracts of sporulating cells and that present in extracts of cells grown on glucose, pyruvate, or malate. Therefore, it was proposed that a single, constitutively synthesized pyruvate kinase is present in B. licheniformis."

https://openalex.org/W1505035505,"Thymidylate kinase (deoxythymidine 5'-monophosphate kinase) has been purified some 7,500-fold from extracts of mouse ascites hepatoma. The stability of the enzyme was maintained during purification by the constant presence of substrate (dTMP) and 2-mercaptoethanol and by the elimination of substrate-destroying phosphatase activity. Thiol was essential for the protective effect of dTMP. Also effective as enzyme stabilizers were dTDP and dTTP. The purified enzyme catalyzed the reversible reaction: dTMP + ATP (Mg++)/⇌ dTDP + ADP Interfering enzyme activities were not detectable, although the purified enzyme was not entirely physically homogeneous. An approximation of the molecular size of the principal component was of the order of 35,000. It has been shown that the dTMP kinase of mouse hepatoma is subject to an extraordinary product inhibition by ADP (Km:Ki ratio of 5). The inhibition appeared to be a mixed type in which binding of ADP to the enzyme tends to prevent dissociation of the enzyme complex to its products and, at the same time, interferes with the binding of ATP. The potency of the ADP inhibition and its wide ranging effect on dTMP kinase activity have been discussed as a basis for enzyme regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1562470032,"Abstract A simple general procedure for the synthesis of terminally phosphorylated α anomeric diphosphate derivatives of d-glucose, d-mannose, d-ribose, d-galactose, d-glucosamine, and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine was developed. The fully acetylated sugar 6-phosphates, 5-phosphate in the case of d-ribose, were phosphorylated at the anomeric carbon atom by condensation with crystalline phosphoric acid. The O-acetyl groups in the resulting diphosphate derivative were removed by treatment with alkali, and excess phosphoric acid was precipitated as an insoluble lithium salt. The sugar diphosphates were isolated by ion exchange chromatography and the lithium, potassium, and barium salts of each of these compounds were prepared and characterized. In each case, the ratio of acid-labile phosphate to total phosphate to acid-labile reducing sugar in the final product was 1:2:1. The compounds migrated as diphosphate esters on electrophoresis and paper chromatography. The final product was completely homogenous with respect to the sugar component. The structure and ring configuration were determined by analysis and periodate oxidation. The α configuration of the phosphate group at the anomeric carbon was established by comparing the optical rotation of the dialdehyde diphosphate derivative formed on periodate oxidation with the optical rotation of the product formed upon oxidation of α-d-glucose 1,6-diphosphate. The products were all active when they were assayed for enzymatic activity with phosphoglucomutase."

https://openalex.org/W1542184995,"Abstract A minced liver system from Rana catesbeiana tadpoles has been developed. Treatment of this liver preparation in vitro with insulin results in the activation of glycogen synthetase. Hormonally induced activation is the result of the conversion of the less active form of the enzyme to the more active form. The insulin-mediated activation is counteracted by hydrocortisone and dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. This indicates that hydrocortisone activation of glycogen synthetase in the intact animal is a secondary effect of the gluconeogenic hormone. With this in vitro system, we have obtained experimental evidence which indicates that hepatic glycogen synthetase can be controlled by modulation of cellular metabolites without requiring activation of glycogen synthetase by insulin. Alterations of cellular metabolites were achieved by the addition of glucose and ammonium acetate to the incubation medium."

https://openalex.org/W196241061,"Abstract Variables which affect the reassociation in vitro of the subunits of glyoxylic acid reductase have been defined and characterized. After exposure of the enzyme to 6.0 m guanidine hydrochloride-0.1 m mercaptoethanol or 8.0 m urea-0.1 m mercaptoethanol, optimal reassociation is obtained if the dissociated subunits are diluted into 0.15 m potassium phosphate or 0.2 m Tris-chloride, pH 7.2 to 7.6, containing 25% (v/v) glycerol and 5 mm to 50 mm mercaptoethanol. The yields of active enzyme are maximal if the temperature at dilution is 0°, if the temperature during renaturation is 0–2°, and if the protein concentration during renaturation is between 0.02 and 0.045 mg per ml. Under optimal conditions, the half-time for maximal renaturation is 7 to 10 hours and the recovery is 68% of the theoretical maximum, the catalytic capability of undenatured enzyme. Complete recovery is not obtained since the enzyme dissociates into subunits under the best of renaturation conditions and since small amounts of a poorly active tetramer are formed during the reassociation process. DPNH accelerates renaturation but does not significantly improve the yield. Glyoxylate inhibits both the rate of renaturation and the recovery of enzyme activity, whereas hydroxypyruvate has no effect on either. Bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v), improves the yield of active enzyme to 85 or 90% of the theoretical maximum, but the same concentration of albumin has no effect on the initial rates of the reassociation process. Although subunit reassociation does not appear to depend on the formation of disulfide bonds, the stability of the renatured enzyme is improved as these links develop. The physical and kinetic properties of the completely renatured protein are the same as those of the native enzyme."
