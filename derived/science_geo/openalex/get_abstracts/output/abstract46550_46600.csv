https://openalex.org/W2066362596,"There is abundant geographic variation in both morphology and gene frequency in most species. The extent of geographic variation results from a balance of forces tending to produce local genetic differentiation and forces tending to produce genetic homogeneity. Mutation, genetic drift due to finite population size, and natural selection favoring adaptations to local environmental conditions will all lead to the genetic differentiation of local populations, and the movement of gametes, individuals, and even entire populations--collectively called gene flow--will oppose that differentiation. Gene flow may either constrain evolution by preventing adaptation to local conditions or promote evolution by spreading new genes and combinations of genes throughout a species' range. Several methods are available for estimating the amount of gene flow. Direct methods monitor ongoing gene flow, and indirect methods use spatial distributions of gene frequencies to infer past gene flow. Applications of these methods show that species differ widely in the gene flow that they experience. Of particular interest are those species for which direct methods indicate little current gene flow but indirect methods indicate much higher levels of gene flow in the recent past. Such species probably have undergone large-scale demographic changes relatively frequently."
https://openalex.org/W2067495948,"The neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM, appears on early embryonic cells and is important in the formation of cell collectives and their boundaries at sites of morphogenesis. Later in development it is found on various differentiated tissues and is a major CAM mediating adhesion among neurons and between neurons and muscle. To provide a molecular basis for understanding N-CAM function, the complete amino acid sequences of the three major polypeptides of N-CAM and most of the noncoding sequences of their messenger RNA's were determined from the analysis of complementary DNA clones and were verified by amino acid sequences of selected CNBr fragments and proteolytic fragments. The extracellular region of each N-CAM polypeptide includes five contiguous segments that are homologous in sequence to each other and to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, suggesting that interactions among immunoglobulin-like domains form the basis for N-CAM homophilic binding. Although different in their membrane-associated and cytoplasmic domains, the amino acid sequences of the three polypeptides appear to be identical throughout this extracellular region (682 amino acids) where the binding site is located. Variations in N-CAM activity thus do not occur by changes in the amino acid sequence that alter the specificity of binding. Instead, regulation is achieved by cell surface modulation events that alter N-CAM affinity, prevalence, mobility, and distribution on the surface. A major mechanism for modulation is alternative RNA splicing resulting in N-CAM's with different cytoplasmic domains that differentially interact with the cell membrane. Such regulatory mechanisms may link N-CAM binding function with other primary cellular processes during the embryonic development of pattern."

https://openalex.org/W2083624153,"A fundamental problem in chemistry and biochemistry is understanding the role of solvation in determining molecular properties. Recent advances in statistical mechanical theory and molecular dynamics methodology can be used to solve this problem with the aid of supercomputers. By using these advances the free energies of solvation of all the chemical classes of amino acid side chains, four nucleic acid bases and other organic molecules can be calculated. The effect of a site-specific mutation on the stability of trypsin is predicted. The results are in good agreement with available experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2053508758,"The DNA in human sperm chromatin is packaged into nucleoprotamine (∼85%) and nucleohistone (∼15%). Whether these two chromatin fractions are sequence-specific subsets of the spermatozoon genome is the question addressed in this report. Sequence-specific packaging would suggest distinct structural and functional roles for the nucleohistone and nucleoprotamine in late spermatogenesis or early development or both. After removal of histones with 0.65M NaCl, exposed DNA was cleaved with Bam HI restriction endonuclease and separated by centrifugation from insoluble nucleoprotamine. The DNA sequence distribution of nucleohistone DNA in the supernatant and nucleoprotamine DNA in the pellet was compared by cloning size-selected single-copy sequences and by using the derived clones as probes of nucleohistone DNA and nucleoprotamine DNA. Two clones derived from nucleohistone DNA preferentially hybridized to nucleohistone DNA, and two clones derived from nucleoprotamine DNA preferentially hybridized to nucleoprotamine DNA, which demonstrated the existence of sequence-specific nucleohistone and nucleoprotamine components within the human spermatozoon."
https://openalex.org/W1531518952,"The principal region of the human plasma fibronectin molecule mediating the adhesion of melanoma cells appears to be the alternatively spliced type III connecting segment (IIICS (Humphries, M. J., Akiyama, S. K., Komoriya, A., Olden, K., and Yamada, K. M. (1986a) J. Cell Biol., in press]. A series of overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the entire IIICS (CS peptides) were examined for their effects on B16-F10 melanoma cell adhesion to the parent fibronectin molecule. Two nonadjacent CS peptides, designated CS1 and CS5, were inhibitory. In contrast, neither inhibited fibronectin-mediated spreading of fibroblastic baby hamster kidney cells. When N-terminal cysteine derivatives of the CS peptides were conjugated to IgG by covalent cross-linking with N-succinimidyl-3(2-pyridyldithio)propionate, both the CS1 and CS5 conjugates promoted B16-F10 melanoma cell spreading. All conjugates were inactive for spreading of baby hamster kidney cells, confirming the cell type specificity of the IIICS adhesion site. Determination of the amounts of CS peptide required to support melanoma cell adhesion revealed that the activity of CS1 was only 2.4-fold lower than that of the intact fibronectin molecule. CS5 was approximately 320-fold less active than fibronectin, suggesting that the CS1 region may be the major site of interaction with the melanoma cell surface. The adhesion-promoting activities of CS1-IgG and CS5-IgG were additive as were the inhibitory activities of the free peptides for B16-F10 cell spreading on fibronectin. These findings suggest that both regions of the IIICS can function separately or together in mediating the interaction of melanoma cells with fibronectin. Since CS1 and CS5 are each found in separate alternatively spliced regions of the IIICS, it is conceivable that the adhesion-promoting activity of fibronectin for different cell types may be under complex regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2085536565,"A better understanding of the molecular mechanism of protein biosynthesis depends on the availability of a reliable model for the ribosome particle. The application of a diffraction technique, namely, three-dimensional image reconstruction from two-dimensional sheets of the large ribosomal subunits of Bacillus stearothermophilus at a resolution of 30 angstroms is described. The resulting three-dimensional model shows at least four projecting arms, arranged radially near the presumed interface with the 30S subunit. The projecting arms are positioned around a cleft, which turns into a tunnel with a length of 100 to 120 angstroms and a diameter of up to 25 angstroms. This tunnel spans the particle and may provide the path taken by the nascent polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W2058951789,"Macrophages that rapidly enter injured peripheral nerve synthesize and secrete large quantities of apolipoprotein E. This protein may be involved in the redistribution of lipid, including cholesterol released during degeneration, to the regenerating axons. To test this postulate, apolipoprotein E-associated lipid particles released from segments of injured rat sciatic nerve and apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins from plasma were used to determine whether sprouting neurites, specifically their growth cones, possessed lipoprotein receptors. Pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, which can be stimulated to produce neurites in vitro, were used as a model system. Apolipoprotein E-containing lipid particles and lipoproteins, which had been labeled with fluorescent dye, were internalized by the neurites and their growth cones; the unmetabolized dye appeared to be localized to the lysosomes. The rapid rate of accumulation in the growth cones precludes the possibility of orthograde transport of the fluorescent particles from the PC12 cell bodies. Thus, receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake is performed by the apolipoprotein B,E(LDL) (low density lipoprotein) receptors, and in the regenerating peripheral nerve apolipoprotein E may deliver lipids to the neurites and their growth cones for membrane biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1497215682,"A gel assay is introduced to measure DNA polymerase insertion kinetics at single sites along a DNA template strand. The assay is used to analyze the kinetics of inserting deoxynucleotides opposite a synthetic abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lesions using Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha. The location of the abasic lesion next to different nearest-neighbor bases allows the effects of base stacking on the specificity of insertion to be evaluated. The specificity of nucleotide insertion, Vmax/Km, is 6-11 times greater for A over G and about 20-50 times greater for A over C and T. The insertion specificity at the abasic lesion appears to depend more on differences in Vmax than Km. Apparent Michaelis constants for inserting A and G deoxynucleotides are similar to within about a factor of 2. The insertion of A or G occurs most efficiently at the abasic lesion when T is the 5'-nearest neighbor on the primer strand and least efficiently when G is the 5'-nearest neighbor. The presence of different base stacking partners adjacent to the site of insertion has up to a 4-fold effect on specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1965724001,"Allowing mice access to food immediately after an aversive training session enhances memory retention. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8), which is a gastrointestinal hormone released during feeding, also enhances memory retention when administered intraperitoneally. This memory-enhancing effect of CCK-8 is blocked when the vagus nerve is cut, indicating that CCK-8 may produce its effect on memory retention by activating ascending fibers in the vagus nerve. Thus, CCK-8, a peripherally acting peptide, may mediate the memory-enhancing effects of feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2007851156,"A large number of proteins were tested for the property of intrinsic phosphorescence in deoxygenated aqueous solution at room temperature. The majority of proteins exhibit phosphorescence under normal solution conditions. Phosphorescence lifetimes from 0.5 millisecond to 2 seconds were observed in three-fourths of the proteins tested. The lifetime appears to correlate with relative isolation of the tryptophan indole side chain from solvent. With few exceptions, proteins in general can be expected to display a phosphorescence lifetime greater than 30 microseconds. This widespread characteristic of proteins has been largely overlooked because long-lived phosphorescence is highly sensitive to quenching by low levels of dissolved oxygen in solution. Protein phosphorescence offers a new time domain and a far wider dynamic range than has been used before for photoluminescence experimentation."
https://openalex.org/W1552612278,"Abstract Preincubation of neutrophils with certain agonists may prime the cells to cause increased responses to a second stimulus (primed stimulation). We used two approaches to examine the role of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) in priming and stimulation by 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP): inhibition of protein kinase C by 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-piperazine (C-I) and measurement of protein kinase C translocation induced by priming and stimulatory concentrations of OAG. C-I had little effect on stimulation or primed stimulation by fMLP, suggesting that fMLP invokes events independent of protein kinase C. C-I equally inhibited stimulation and primed stimulation by PMA. Direct stimulation by OAG was inhibited, but priming and primed stimulation by OAG was unaltered by C-I. OAG concentrations greater than or equal to 100 microM caused translocation of protein kinase C, in correlation with direct stimulation of the respiratory burst. Lower OAG concentrations (10-30 microM) primed to stimulation by fMLP and, conversely, stimulated neutrophils primed with fMLP, yet did not cause translocation of protein kinase C. The data are compatible with previous assumptions that PMA and OAG directly stimulate polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes by translocation and activation of protein kinase C. However, priming and primed stimulation by OAG apparently invoke distinct transduction mechanisms other than protein kinase C translocation."

Alkaline reductive treatment of the crude material led to the release of some neutral and numerous monosialyl and disialyl oligosaccharides. These were fractionated by gel filtration, anion-exchange chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. The structures of the monosialyl oligosaccharides were established by combination of sugar and methylation analysis, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and electron impact-mass spectrometry after permethylation and 1H NMR spectroscopy (at 500 MHz). Typically, some of the monosialyl oligosaccharides appeared to possess the core structure Gal beta(1----3)[GlcNAc beta(1----6)]GalNAc alpha(1----3)GalNAc-ol. Moreover, the (1----6)-linked branch consisted of an unusual di- or trigalactosyl sequence, [Gal alpha(1----4)0-1Gal beta(1----4)Gal beta (1----4)GlcNAc beta(1----6). Thus, the most complex representatives of the monosialyl fraction from Collocalia mucin were found to be: (Formula: see text) The other compounds identified are partial structures thereof."
https://openalex.org/W2012439049,"A fundamental feature of the mammalian visual system is the nonuniform distribution of ganglion cells across the retinal surface. To understand the ontogenetic processes leading to the formation of retinal ganglion cell topography, changes in the regional density of these neurons were studied in relation to ganglion cell loss and the pattern of retinal growth in the fetal cat. Midway through the gestation period, the density of these neurons was only two to three times greater in the area centralis than in the peripheral retina, whereas shortly before birth this central-to-peripheral difference was nearly 20-fold. Age-related changes in the ganglion cell distribution were found not to correspond in time or magnitude to the massive loss of ganglion cells that occurs during prenatal development. Rather, the formation of ganglion cell density gradients can be accounted for by unequal expansion of the growing fetal retina-peripheral regions expand more than the central region, thereby diluting the peripheral density of ganglion cells to a greater degree. Nonuniform growth, in conjunction with differential periods of neurogenesis of the different types of retinal cells, appears to be a dominant factor regulating overall retinal topography. These results suggest that the differential regional expansion of the fetal retina underlies the formation of magnification factors in the developing visual system."
https://openalex.org/W1657453984,"The oxidation of the methionine residues of human growth hormone (hGH) and human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS) to methionine sulfoxide by hydrogen peroxide has been studied. The kinetics of oxidation of individual methionine residues has been measured by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography tryptic peptide mapping. Met-170 is completely resistant to oxidation in both hormones. The other 3 methionine residues in hCS (Met-64, Met-96, and Met-179) have markedly different reaction rates. Oxidation of the methionine residues does not appear to cause gross conformational changes in either hGH or hCS, as judged by CD and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Oxidation of Met-14 and Met-125 in hGH has little effect on affinity of the hormone for lactogenic receptors or on its potency in the Nb2 rat lymphoma in vitro bioassay for lactogenic hormones. The oxidation of Met-64 and/or Met-179 in hCS reduces profoundly both its affinity for lactogenic receptors and its in vitro biological potency. It is inferred by induction that residues 64 and/or 179 are critical for the binding of both hGH and hCS to lactogenic receptors and the expression of lactogenic biological activity."

https://openalex.org/W2109552507,"Catalase-peroxidase was isolated from aerobically grown Rhodopseudomonas capsulata. The enzyme resembles typical catalases in some of its physicochemical properties. It has an apparent molecular weight of 236,000 and is composed of four identical subunits. It shows a typical high spin ferric heme spectrum with absorption maxima at 403 and 635 nm and shoulders at 503 and 535 nm. Upon binding of cyanide, the enzyme is converted to the low spin state, as shown by the shift of the Soret maximum to 418 nm and the band at 532 nm. It has an isoelectric point at pH 4.5. The enzyme differs from typical catalases in also having a strong peroxidatic activity with dianisidine, pyrogallol, and diaminobenzidine as electron donors. Both the catalatic and the peroxidatic activities are similarly inactivated by treatment with 1 mM H2O2, heating to 50 degrees C, exposure to ethanol/chloroform, and photooxidative conditions. In contrast to typical catalases, but similarly to peroxidases, the enzyme is reduced by sodium dithionite. The pH optimum of the peroxidatic activity is 5-5.3 (in contrast to 6-6.5 of the catalatic activity). 50% of the apparent maximal activities are reached at 0.3 and 4.2 mM H2O2 for the peroxidatic and catalatic activities, respectively. Both enzymic activities are equally inhibited by cyanide, 50% inhibition being achieved with 2.2 X 10(-5) M KCN. Contrarily, the two activities differ in their response to hydroxylamine and azide. 50% inhibition of the catalatic activity is obtained with 1.5 X 10(-4) M azide or 2.15 X 10(-6) M hydroxylamine; 50% inhibition of the peroxidatic activity requires 7.3 X 10(-4) M azide or 7.8 X 10(-5) M hydroxylamine. The activation energies of the catalatic and the peroxidatic activities are 1.9 and 1.7 kcal/mol, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2063550070,"Electrical coupling and dye coupling between pairs of rat hepatocytes were reversibly reduced by brief exposure to halogenated methanes (CBrCl3, CCl4, and CHCl3). The potency of different halomethanes in uncoupling hepatocytes was comparable to their hepatotoxicity in vivo, and the rank order was the same as that of their tendency to form free radicals. The effect of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) on hepatocytes was substantially reduced by prior treatment with SKF 525A, an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450, and by exposure to the reducing reagent beta-mercaptoethanol. Halomethane uncoupling occurred with or without extracellular calcium and did not change intracellular concentrations of calcium and hydrogen ions or the phosphorylation state of the main gap-junctional protein. Thus the uncoupling appears to depend on cytochrome P-450 oxidative metabolism in which free radicals are generated and may result from oxidation of the gap-junctional protein or of a regulatory molecule that leads to closure of gap-junctional channels. Decreases in junctional conductance may be a rapid cellular response to injury that protects healthy cells by uncoupling them from unhealthy ones."

https://openalex.org/W1556335334,"Essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency has been shown to protect against the glomerulonephritis in a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus. Since macrophages are an important cellular constituent of the inflammatory lesion, the effects of EFA deficiency on the eicosanoid metabolism and function of these cells were determined. EFA-deficient macrophages exhibited a depletion of phospholipid arachidonate and an accumulation of 20:3(n-9); phosphatidylinositol was the phospholipid most affected. When these macrophages were stimulated with unopsonized zymosan, they produced markedly less leukotriene C4 and B4 than control macrophages. EFA-deficient macrophages also synthesized leukotriene C3 from endogenous 20:3(n-9). No leukotriene B3 was detected. In contrast to the effects on leukotriene production, prostaglandin and thromboxane production were only minimally affected by EFA deficiency. When challenged with zymosan, EFA-deficient macrophages released less arachidonate relative to control macrophages and released half again as much 20:3(n-9) as arachidonate. Release of arachidonate from phosphatidylcholine in the EFA-deficient cells was highly selective for arachidonate; however, release of arachidonate from phosphatidylinositol was depressed relative to control and was not selective. Incubation of macrophages with exogenous arachidonate and 20:3(n-9) established that 20:3(n-9) decreased leukotriene C4 and B4 synthesis from arachidonate but did not affect prostaglandin production. To determine the functional effects of the deficiency state, receptor-mediated pinocytosis and phagocytosis were also examined in EFA-deficient cells. EFA-deficient macrophages exhibited a marked reduction in receptor-mediated pinocytosis. Phagocytosis, however, was unaffected by the deficiency state. These effects on macrophage eicosanoid metabolism and function may comprise a significant component of the anti-inflammatory effect of EFA deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1964821649,"The active site cysteine of pig liver thioltransferase was identified as Cys22. The kinetics of the reaction between Cys22 of the reduced enzyme and iodoacetic acid as a function of pH revealed that the active site sulfhydryl group had a pKa of 2.5. Incubation of reduced enzyme with [1-14C]cysteine prevented the inactivation of the enzyme by iodoacetic acid at pH 6.5, and no stable protein-cysteine disulfide was found when the enzyme was separated from excess [1-14C]cysteine, suggesting an intramolecular disulfide formation. The results suggested a reaction mechanism for thioltransferase. The thiolated Cys22 first initiates a nucleophilic attack on a disulfide substrate, resulting in the formation of an unstable mixed disulfide between Cys22 and the substrate. Subsequently, the sulfhydryl group at Cys25 is deprotonated as a result of micro-environmental changes within the active site domain, releasing the mixed disulfide and forming an intramolecular disulfide bond. Reduced glutathione, the second substrate, reduces the intramolecular disulfide forming a transient mixed disulfide which is then further reduced by glutathione to regenerate the reduced enzyme and form oxidized glutathione. The rate-limiting step for a typical reaction between a disulfide and reduced glutathione is proposed to be the reduction of the intramolecular disulfide form of the enzyme by reduced glutathione."
https://openalex.org/W1492922802,"The kinetics of L-proline transport across intestinal brush borders via the Imino carrier were studied using membrane vesicles. The Imino carrier is defined as the agent responsible for L-alanine insensitive. Na+-dependent uptake of L-proline. Initial rate measurements were made under voltage clamped conditions (pD = 0) to investigate L-proline transport as a function of cis and trans Na+ and proline concentrations. Under zero-trans conditions, increasing cis Na+ activated proline uptake with a Hill coefficient of 1.7 and decreased the apparent Kt with no change in Jimax. The Jimax was approximately 60 pmol mg-1 s-1 and the apparent Kt ranged from 0.25 mM at cis Na = 100 to 1.0 mM at cis Na+ = 30 mM. Trans Na inhibited proline uptake via a reduction in Jimax. Trans proline had no significant effect in the absence of trans Na+, but it relieved the trans Na+ inhibition. Under equilibrium exchange conditions, the Jimax was twice that observed under zero-trans conditions. These kinetics of L-proline transport suggest a model in which uptake occurs by a rapid equilibrium iso-ordered ter ter system. Two Na+ ions bind first to the carrier on the cis face of the membrane to increase the affinity of the carrier for proline. The fully loaded complex then isomerizes to release the substrates to the trans side. The partially loaded Na+-only forms are unable to translocate across the membrane. A rate-limiting step appears to be the isomerization of unloaded carrier from the trans to the cis side of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1554041356,"The complete amino acid sequence of pig liver thioltransferase has been determined. The homogeneous protein was cleaved by trypsin, chymotrypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and cyanogen bromide. The resulting peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and ion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography. Sequencing of the fragments was achieved with either automated Edman degradation or fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. Pig liver thioltransferase is a single polypeptide with 105 amino acid residues and an acetylated glutamine N terminus. The protein has 2 cysteine pairs with sequences of -Cys-Pro-Phe-Cys- and -Cys-Ile-Gly-Gly-Cys-, the first pair of which (Cys22 and Cys25) is located at the potential active site of the enzyme. The sequence of pig liver thioltransferase displays close homology (82%) with calf thymus glutaredoxin, suggesting that they belong to the same evolutionary family."
https://openalex.org/W1605045303,"Important cellular characteristics, including selective adhesion, growth rate, motility, and differentiation, are controlled, in part, by signals received at the cell surface. The molecular mechanisms for the cell surface control of these cell behaviors are largely unknown. In order to probe the role of specific extracellular molecules in controlling cell function, we report the development of synthetic surfaces which generally support the long-term growth of cells yet can be readily derivatized with a wide variety of molecules of biological interest. Polyacrylamide gels containing a gradient of active ester groups were prepared and then the esters were displaced with ligands to generate a gradient of carboxylic acid, tertiary amine, or hydroxyl groups. When untransformed mouse fibroblasts (BALB/3T3) were seeded on the various surfaces, they attached and grew only on those derivatized with carboxylic acids or hydroxyl groups within narrow concentration ranges. Cell growth rate, density, and morphology on polyacrylamide gels containing the optimal concentration of carboxylic acid groups (approximately 30 mumol/ml) were comparable to those on tissue culture plastic, whereas growth on hydroxyl group-derivatized gels was less extensive. In contrast, short-term (90-min) adhesion to hydroxyl group-derivatized gels was greater than that to carboxylic acid-derivatized gels. Both short-term adhesion and long-term growth required serum. Growth-supportive polyacrylamide gels were readily derivatized with molecules of biological interest. The techniques reported here are applicable to other types of cell in culture since the nature and concentration of substratum functional groups can be easily varied and tested for support of long-term cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1491884639,"The functional significance of calmodulin binding to human erythrocyte spectrin has been investigated under native conditions. Both native calmodulin and calmodulin derivatized with the photoactivable cross-linker methyl 4-azidobenzimidate (azidocalmodulin) have been used. When azidocalmodulin is photolyzed in the presence of erythrocyte ghosts, ghost extracts, or purified protein, it cross-links predominately to the beta subunit of erythrocyte spectrin. This cross-linking is calcium-dependent, requires photolysis, and is inhibited by 100 microM trifluoperazine or unlabeled calmodulin. Calmodulin labeled spectrin exhibits a specific and non-calcium-dependent inhibition of its ability to bind actin, even in the presence of protein 4.1. Its ability to self-associate or to bind spectrin-depleted membrane vesicles is unperturbed. Native calmodulin also inhibits protein 4.1-stimulated spectrin-actin binding, but unlike that of covalently bound calmodulin, inhibition by the uncross-linked calmodulin requires calcium. The degree of inhibition of spectrin-actin-4.1 binding induced by native calmodulin is significant since 109 microM calmodulin inhibits over 63% of the spectrin-actin binding induced by 4.5 microM protein 4.1. These results demonstrate a specific effect of calmodulin on erythroid spectrin function and suggest that calmodulin may influence the binding of protein 4.1 and actin to spectrin within the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1581680818,"The binding of calcium and terbium to purified chick vitamin D-dependent intestinal calcium-binding protein was studied by terbium fluorescence, circular dichroism, and intrinsic protein fluorescence techniques. Calcium-binding protein bound, with high affinity, at least 3 mol of terbium/mol of protein; numerous low affinity terbium-binding sites were also noted. The three highest affinity sites were resolved into one very high affinity site (site A) and two other sites (sites B and C) with slightly lower affinity. Resonance energy transfer from tryptophan residues to terbium occurred only with site A. This site was filled before sites B and C. Competition experiments in which calcium was used to displace terbium bound to the protein showed that larger amounts of calcium were needed to displace terbium from site A than from sites B and C. Energy transfer from terbium to holmium indicated that the terbium-binding sites (B and C) were located close to each other (about 7-12 A) but were distant (greater than 12 A) from site A. The addition of EDTA to calcium-binding protein resulted in a 25% decrease in intrinsic protein fluorescence, suggesting a conformational change in the protein. The titration of EDTA-treated calcium-binding protein with calcium resulted in recovery of intrinsic protein fluorescence. A reversible calcium-dependent change in the ellipticity of calcium-binding protein in circular dichroism experiments was also seen. These observed properties suggest that vitamin D-dependent chick intestinal calcium-binding protein behaves in a manner similar to other well-known calcium-binding regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1552470397,"The biosynthesis and metabolic turnover of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor was examined in a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, UCVA-1. This cell line has been shown to possess a much higher level of EGF receptors than is expected solely from receptor gene/mRNA dosage. Analysis of the biosynthesis using metabolic labeling, immunological quantitation, and inhibitor treatment revealed that the naked EGF receptor in UCVA-1 cells is a protein of Mr 130,000 that is matured consecutively as a Mr 160,000 and 170,000 glycoprotein through post-translational glycosylation. Analysis of the metabolic turnover using pulse-chase labeling and inhibitor treatment revealed that the rate of EGF receptor synthesis in UCVA-1 cells was similar to that in two squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, NA and Ca9-22, which also have high numbers of EGF receptors, but because of gene amplification. In contrast, the rate of receptor degradation in UCVA-1 cells was significantly slower than in the other two cell lines. These results suggest that the retarded metabolic turnover may constitute a unique mechanism for elevating cell surface EGF receptor levels in some tumor cells independent of gene amplification."
https://openalex.org/W1585133138,"We have previously isolated a partial cDNA clone encoding a heat shock protein which has been termed hsp 108 (Zarucki-Schulz, T., Kulomaa, M. S., Headon, D. R., Weigel, N. L., Baez, M., Edwards, D. O., McGuire, W. L., Schrader, W. T., and O'Malley, B. W. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 6358-6362; Sargan, D. R., Tsai, M.-J., and O'Malley, B. W. (1985) Biochemistry 25, 6252-6258). Here we examine the expression of the hsp 108 gene in steroid-stimulated chick oviducts. After 16 h of secondary stimulation with estrogen or progesterone, a 20-50-fold increase in hsp 108 mRNA is detected above unstimulated levels. RNA quantitation by Rot analysis shows that in these oviducts there are 75 molecules of hsp 108 mRNA/oviduct cell. Nuclear run-off assays indicate only a 2-4-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the gene in response to either sex steroid, suggesting that the gene is regulated both at the transcriptional level and by mRNA stabilization. On hormone withdrawal, the concentration of hsp 108 mRNA in the oviduct falls to unstimulated control levels within 4 days. Chronic stimulation of the chicks with estrogen (or high acute doses of estrogen) attenuates specifically the inductive response of the hsp 108 gene, but not of ovalbumin, under these conditions. This is not due to a significant reduction of the transcription rate of the gene. We have previously shown that hsp 108 is expressed constitutively in many tissues of the chick (Sargan, D. R., Tsai, M.-J., and O'Malley, B. W. (1985) Biochemistry 25, 6252-6258). In tissues which are not responsive to hormones, no short-term effects of hormone administration on the gene were observed. In the spleen there is a reproducible slow activation of the gene, but the kinetics of this response suggest that it is not a primary response to the hormone. Thus, this hsp 108 gene codes for an interesting new eucaryotic heat shock protein which is regulated also by steroid hormones in a tissue-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1630162829,"T-protein, one of the components of the glycine cleavage system, catalyzes the synthesis of the H-protein-bound intermediate from methylenetetrahydrofolate, ammonia, and H-protein having a reduced lipoyl prosthetic group (Okamura-Ikeda, K., Fujiwara, K., and Motokawa, Y. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 135-139). Spectroscopic studies indicated that the utilization of methylenetetrahydrofolate occurred only in the presence of the three substrates, indicating the formation of a quaternary complex. The amount of methylenetetrahydrofolate consumed was equal to that of methylene carbon attached to H-protein. Steady-state kinetic studies show that the reaction proceeds through an Ordered Ter Bi mechanism. Reduced H-protein is the first substrate that binds T-protein followed by methylenetetrahydrofolate and ammonia. The order of release of products is tetrahydrofolate and the H-protein-bound intermediate. Km values for H-protein, methylenetetrahydrofolate, and ammonia are 0.55 microM, 0.32 mM, and 22 mM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1488821433,"Abstract Incorporation of the three synthetic hemins, Fe(III) meso-tetraalkylporphyrins with the methyl, ethyl, or n-propyl groups, into apomyoglobin was followed by spectrophotometry, and the stoichiometric complex formation was confirmed. The reconstituted myoglobins bind with an equimolar amount of cyanide to exhibit visible absorption peaks at 419, 570, and 608 nm. The spectral feature was independent of the cyanide concentrations. Proton NMR spectra of the cyanide complexes resolved the pyrrole-proton signals of the hemins in a -5 to -15-ppm region, which is comparable with that of the corresponding signals of deuterohemin-containing low-spin methemoproteins. These spectral observations indicate the presence of the NC-Fe-N(His-F8) structure in the presently reconstituted cyanide metmyoglobins. The pyrrole-proton NMR signals of the hemins in cyanide metmyoglobins appeared as a singlet, doublet, or quartet for the methyl, ethyl, or n-propyl hemin complexes, respectively. The systematic NMR spectral changes suggest the dynamic free rotation of the alkylhemins about the Fe-N(His-F8) bond. Temperature-dependent NMR spectral transition of the meso-tetraethylhemin-reconstituted myoglobin was consistent with thermally regulated dynamic free rotation of the hemin in the myoglobin heme pocket."
https://openalex.org/W1541641692,"The utilization of millimolar concentrations of [2-14C]acetone and the production of acetone from acetoacetate were studied in perfused livers from 48-h starved rats. We devised a procedure for determining, in a perfused liver system, the first-order rate constant for the decarboxylation of acetoacetate (0.29 +/- 0.09 h-1, S.E., n = 8). After perfusion of livers with [2-14C]acetone, labeled acetate was isolated from the perfusion medium and characterized as [1-14C]acetate. No radioactivity was found in lactate or 3-hydroxybutyrate. After 90 min of perfusion with [2-14C]acetone, the specific activity of acetate was 30 +/- 4% (n = 13) of the initial specific activity of acetone. We conclude that, in perfused livers from 2-day starved rats, acetone metabolism occurs for the most part via free acetate."
https://openalex.org/W1566625473,"A murine monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated mAb 202, was generated using a human melanoma cell line, UCLASO-M14 as the immunogen. mAb 202 reacted with two (GM2 and GM3) of the four (GM2, GM3, GD2, and GD3) gangliosides expressed by M14. Several authentic monosialogangliosides, including GM4, GM3, GM2, GM1, GM1b, and sialylparagloboside were then tested for their binding to 202 mAb by the immune adherence inhibition assay, TLC-enzyme immunostaining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All showed positive binding but in varying degrees. GM4 showed the strongest affinity. No significant differences of reactivity were observed between the sialic acid derivatives, N-acetyl and N-glycolyl, in these gangliosides. Disialogangliosides such as GD3, GD2, GD1a, and GD1b, trisialoganglioside GT1b, and neutral glycolipids including GlcCer, GalCer, LacCer, GbOs3Cer, GbOs4Cer, GgOs3Cer, GgOs4Cer, and nLcOs4Cer were all negative. These results indicate that the 202 mAb detects sialyl alpha 2----3Gal residue in the monosialoganglioside, irrespective of the internal structure. Since GM4 is not expressed by M14 cells, the terminal disaccharide (sialyl alpha 2----3Gal) in GM3 and/or GM2 must have been the epitope responsible for the generation of the antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1523739028,"A cytosolic protein factor (ferroactivator) facilitates the activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by ferrous ions (Bentle, L. A., and Lardy, H. A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1431-1440). We have extended our studies on the interaction of Fe2+ with this enzyme to establish the conditions under which it is an activator or an inhibitor. Preincubation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase with Fe2+ and dithiothreitol resulted in irreversible loss of enzyme activity within minutes of Fe2+ addition. This was attributed to an active oxygen species produced by aerobic oxidation of the divalent metal ion in the presence of dithiothreitol as suggested by lack of inhibition in preincubation experiments with Fe2+ under mildly acidic pH; ferroactivation by many H2O2 scavenging enzymes; and lack of inhibition on preincubation under anaerobic conditions. We conclude that Fe2+ per se can activate phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and that ferroactivator protein helps to overcome the deleterious effects of aerobic oxidation. Mechanistic details of ferroactivation and a comparison of the known properties of ferroactivator indicated the similarity of this protein with rat liver glutathione peroxidase. The identity of ferroactivator as glutathione peroxidase was confirmed by the demonstration of catalytic activity, selenium content, and immunological cross-reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2086278114,"It has been proposed that clonal restriction boundaries develop in Xenopus embryos between clones initiated at the 512-cell stage, and that these boundaries result in formation of morphological compartments, each populated by progeny of a group of ancestral cells. Although this hypothesis has gained some acceptance, it has also been criticized because the use of only one cell lineage tracer was not a conclusive test of the hypothesis. However, the critical experiment, an assessment of the extent of mingling between two labeled clones in the same embryo, has now been performed. A model of the proposed arrangement of the ancestral cell groups in the 512-cell embryo predicted that the two clones would remain separate in 49% of cases and intermingle in 51% of cases. In fact, there was a bimodal distribution, in which separation of the clones occurred in 46% of embryos and extensive interclonal mingling was observed in 54%. These results are not compatible with hypotheses in which a unimodal distribution of mingling would be predicted but are consistent with the compartment hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1484646476,"Class II actin genes usually specify a polypeptide with a Met-Cys-Asp NH2 terminus, whereas the actin itself begins with an acetyl (Ac)-Asp(Glu). Previous studies with Drosophila actin showed that the first detectable intermediate is one with an Ac-Cys NH2 terminus which is subsequently cleaved in a novel reaction to expose the Asp. The initiator Met was probably removed early in translation as a free amino acid. To determine whether the class II actin initiating Met could also be removed in an acetylation-dependent manner, we translated Drosophila mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in which protein acetylation was inhibited. After 60 min, three actin intermediates were detected, NH2-Met-Cys-Asp-actin, Ac-Met-Cys-Asp-actin, and NH2-Cys-Asp-actin. During processing in the presence of acetyl-CoA, three additional species were observed with NH2-terminal Ac-Cys-Asp, NH2-Asp, and Ac-Asp segments. In a time- and acetyl-CoA-dependent fashion, Met-Cys-Asp-actin was processed to the mature actin, presumably through an Ac-Met-Cys-Asp intermediate. Thus, two different pathways for removal of the initiator Met of class II actins, acetylation-dependent and independent, are possible. Since no class II actin intermediate containing the initiator Met is seen in vivo, although in class I actins this intermediate is observed, the most probable pathway for class II actins in vivo is the cotranslational removal of the initiator Met as a free amino acid."
https://openalex.org/W1969911085,"The American family income distribution now lies at the center of several controversies. Some observers argue that the American middle class is vanishing, but U.S. census income statistics show income inequality has not changed appreciably since 1947. A second controversy involves whether average living standards have risen or fallen since the major oil price increase of 1973-74. These controversies can be partially resolved by understanding the sharp slowdown in the growth of workers' wages which occurred after 1973 and the demographic trends which kept per capita living standards rising despite stagnant wages, including more working women and low birthrates."
https://openalex.org/W1531017253,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) from mouse AtT-20 pituitary tumor cells, when transformed using a variety of in vitro protocols, yields a DNA-binding RNA-containing 6 S form. In order to better understand the physiological role of RNA interaction with the transformed GR, we have isolated and purified the putative RNA from AtT-20 cells. [3H]Triamcinolone acetonide-labeled cytosolic GR was transformed, using Sephadex G-25 filtration, to yield the RNA-containing 6 S GR. The transformed 6 S GR was separated on DEAE-cellulose into the 4 S GR (eluting at about 100 mM KCl) while its associated RNA eluted at 0.30-0.45 M KCl. The addition of only these RNA fractions to the 4 S GR can reconstitute 6 S GR as shown on 5-20% sucrose gradients. RNA (0.3-0.45 M KCl fractions) was further purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography, and the bound RNA (eluted at approximately 70 mM PO4(-2)) was then loaded onto preparative 5-20% sucrose gradients to separate RNA on the basis of size (sedimentation rate). A uniform class of RNA sedimenting at 4 S was obtained and then adsorbed to oligo(dT)-cellulose columns. The unbound fraction (poly(A-)) was capable of shifting 4 S GR to 6 S. Using these chromatographic procedures about 90% of the cellular RNA, incapable of reconstituting the 6 S GR from the 4 S form, was eliminated. The 4 S GR was covalently cross-linked with the purified RNA (termed PIVB RNA) using formaldehyde. The resulting cross-linked GR X RNA complexes were shown to sediment at the density of ribonucleoprotein (1.38 g/cm3) in CsCl gradients and at the 6 S position in high salt sucrose gradients. The hydrolysis of PIVB RNA with ribonuclease A prevented the formation of high salt-resistant ribonucleoprotein complexes, indicating that the GR may be in close contact with PIVB RNA. Electrophoresis of the PIVB RNA on 5% agarose-formaldehyde-denaturing gels yielded one major band with a molecular size of approximately 75 bases. It thus appears that an endogenous 4 S RNA (PIVB RNA) of about 25 kDa specifically interacts with the monomeric 4 S GR to yield the 6 S GR."
https://openalex.org/W1486968954,"Breast muscle of young chicks fed chow diets containing the creatine analog 1-carboxymethyl-2-iminoimidazolidine (cyclocreatine) accumulated up to 40 mumol/g wet weight of the synthetic phosphagen 1-carboxymethyl-2-imino-3-phosphonoimidazolidine (cyclocreatine-P2-). ATP levels were sustained at high values substantially longer in breast muscle of cyclocreatine-fed chicks, compared to control-fed chicks, during total ischemia initiated 2 h after injection of both groups with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (5 mg/kg subcutaneous). For example, in chicks fed 0.5% cyclocreatine for 10-19 days ATP levels in isoproterenol-stimulated breast muscles after 1 h of ischemia at 37 degrees C were 6.1 mumol/g, compared to 1.9 mumol/g for the control-fed group, and after 2 h of ischemia were 3.5 mumol/g compared to 0.6 mumol/g for controls. Creatine-P reserves in isoproterenol-stimulated breast muscles of all dietary groups were essentially exhausted within the first hour of ischemia. In contrast, breast muscle of chicks fed either 1 or 0.5% cyclocreatine still contained 28 and 19 mumol/g of cyclocreatine-P, respectively, after 1 h of ischemia; after 2 h of ischemia, the respective cyclocreatine-P values were 20 and 13 mumol/g. Isoproterenol-stimulated chick breast muscle provides the first skeletal muscle model system for studying the molecular mechanisms by which dietary cyclocreatine helps sustain ATP levels during ischemia. Although adaptive factors are also involved, it is suggested that a significant portion of the ATP-sustaining activity of dietary cyclocreatine in ischemic breast muscle can be attributed to the unique thermodynamic properties of the accumulated cyclocreatine-P. These properties enable cyclocreatine-P to continue to thermodynamically buffer the adenylate system and transport high energy phosphate throughout the long muscle fibers at cytosolic pH values and phosphorylation potentials well below the range where the creatine-P system can function effectively. Synergism between glycolysis and this long-acting synthetic phosphagen might well help delay depletion of ATP levels in skeletal muscles during ischemia. Cyclocreatine feeding provides a unique experimental tool for quantitative evaluation of the proposed protective role of ATP against irreversible cellular damage in skeletal and cardiac muscles during ischemic episodes."
https://openalex.org/W1529757753,"The binding of (-)-[3H]nicotine to membrane fragments and a detergent solubilized fraction of goldfish brain was characterized. (-)-[3H]nicotine binding was not displaced by alpha-bungarotoxin, but was displaced by (-)nicotine and carbamoylcholine with Ki of approximately 8.6 and 86 nM, respectively. Preincubation of solubilized membrane extract with alpha-bungarotoxin-coupled Sepharose resulted in the loss of approximately 50% of the (-)-[3H]nicotine binding protein from the eluent and an increase in (-)-[3H]nicotine binding to the gel compared to control, non-alpha-bungarotoxin Sepharose. 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding protein in the eluent from the same preincubation experiments was totally removed. In addition, incubation of the solubilized tissue extracts with alpha-bungarotoxin-coupled Sepharose resulted in an increase in the affinity for (-)-[3H]nicotine in the eluent (mean KD = 3.1) compared to control solubilized tissue extracts (KD = 6.4 nM). Specific (-)-[3H]nicotine binding sites could be eluted from the alpha-bungarotoxin-coupled Sepharose with carbamoylcholine and D-tubocurarine. Similar to previously reported 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding data, eye removal resulted in an approximately 40% decrease in (-)-[3H]nicotine binding in the contralateral tectum compared to that in the ipsilateral tectum. These data indicate that at least two distinct subtypes of (-)nicotine binding sites may be present in goldfish brain, one which binds alpha-bungarotoxin and (-)nicotine and another which binds only (-)nicotine."
https://openalex.org/W1506158633,"A cloned fragment of Bombyx mori genomic DNA containing a pair of chorion genes was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. The RNA transcribed from the injected template was examined by primer extension analysis for the presence of transcripts initiated correctly from the two chorion genes. Using as primers a number of fragments derived from various parts of the injected DNA, we have found that transcription initiation around the cap sites of the chorion genes was considerably more frequent than that at other, seemingly random sites of the template. Injection of different quantities of template into the oocytes revealed that at high DNA concentrations, most transcripts were randomly initiated. However, when reduced amounts of DNA were injected into the oocytes, the extent of specific transcription increased dramatically while the proportion of nonspecific transcripts correspondingly decreased. The relative rates of specific initiation from the two chorion genes in injected oocytes resembled closely those observed in choriogenic follicles. Finally, the primer extension analysis revealed the presence of chorion antisense transcripts not only in injected oocytes but also in total RNA derived from follicular cells. The possible origin of these transcripts is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1553598348,"Rat pineal hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity in crude homogenates is reduced by treatment with disulfides. Cystamine (IC50 = 128 microM) and selenocystamine (IC50 = 13 microM) are the most potent compounds tested. Reduced cystamine (cysteamine) and diaminohexane are inactive. N,N'-Diacetylcystamine, penicillamine disulfide, and glutathione disulfide are less potent or inactive; but several peptides (oxytocin, vasopressin, and arginine vasotocin) are active. Inactivation by cystamine is time- and temperature-dependent and is accelerated at higher pH. Disulfide treatment of intact pinealocytes also inactivates the enzyme. Addition of dithiothreitol during the enzyme assay completely reactivates inactivated enzyme formed by disulfide treatment of homogenates or intact cells. Rat hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase is also inactivated in the absence of added disulfides and dissolved O2. This spontaneous inactivation is time-, temperature-, and pH-dependent and can be completely prevented, but not reversed, by dithiothreitol. In contrast to the inhibitory effects of cystamine on the rat enzyme, cystamine does not alter bovine hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase and increases ovine hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activity. The bovine and ovine enzymes do not become inactive in the absence of added disulfides. Together these observations indicate that rat pineal hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase can be inactivated by a protein thiol:disulfide exchange mechanism. This mechanism may contribute to the physiological regulation of this enzyme in the rat pineal gland but does not appear to be a common feature of pineal hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase regulation in all species."
https://openalex.org/W1551121901,"The selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase in the presence of GSH effectively replaced catalase in the in vitro assay for gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase. Quantitatively, glutathione peroxidase was an order of magnitude more efficient than catalase, with maximal activity at less than 0.1 microM glutathione peroxidase in a standard reaction. Glutathione peroxidase prevented the loss of gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase during preliminary incubation with ferrous ions but without other substrates as well as in the course of the reaction. Regardless of whether glutathione peroxidase or catalase was present in the assay, the ascorbate concentrations needed to achieve half-maximal rates were similar (about 1 mM). Phosphate stimulated the rate of L-carnitine synthesis. Ferrous ion saturation indicated a pronounced effect of phosphate on the maximal velocity of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, but its mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Based on the subcellular distribution of gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, the role of glutathione peroxidase assumes importance. However, initial studies indicated that the assayable activity of liver gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase and L-carnitine concentrations in liver, blood plasma, and muscle were not significantly altered in selenium-deficient rats."
