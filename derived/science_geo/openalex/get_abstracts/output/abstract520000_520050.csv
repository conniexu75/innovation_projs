https://openalex.org/W2037218287,"This paper examines men’s lifetime physical intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration across eight low- and middle-income countries to better understand key risk factors that interventions can target in order to promote gender equality and reduce IPV. We use data from men (n = 7806) that were collected as part of the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Chile, Croatia, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), India, Mexico, and Rwanda. Results show that there is wide variation across countries for lifetime self-reported physical violence perpetration (range: 17% in Mexico to 45% in DRC), men’s support for equal roles for men and women, and acceptability of violence against women. Across the sample, 31% of men report having perpetrated physical violence against a partner in their lifetime. In multivariate analyses examining risk factors for men ever perpetrating physical violence against a partner, witnessing parental violence was the strongest risk factor, reinforcing previous research suggesting the inter-generational transmission of violence. Additionally, having been involved in fights not specifically with an intimate partner, permissive attitudes towards violence against women, having inequitable gender attitudes, and older age were associated with a higher likelihood of ever perpetrating physical IPV. In separate analyses for each country, we found different patterns of risk factors in countries with high perpetration compared to countries with low perpetration. Findings are interpreted to identify key knowledge gaps and directions for future research, public policies, evaluation, and programming."
https://openalex.org/W2050937759,"RIG-I pathway signaling of innate immunity against RNA virus infection is organized between the ER and mitochondria on a subdomain of the ER called the mitochondrial-associated ER membrane (MAM). The RIG-I adaptor protein MAVS transmits downstream signaling of antiviral immunity, with signaling complexes assembling on the MAM in association with mitochondria and peroxisomes. To identify components that regulate MAVS signalosome assembly on the MAM, we characterized the proteome of MAM, ER, and cytosol from cells infected with either chronic (hepatitis C) or acute (Sendai) RNA virus infections, as well as mock-infected cells. Comparative analysis of protein trafficking dynamics during both chronic and acute viral infection reveals differential protein profiles in the MAM during RIG-I pathway activation. We identified proteins and biochemical pathways recruited into and out of the MAM in both chronic and acute RNA viral infections, representing proteins that drive immunity and/or regulate viral replication. In addition, by using this comparative proteomics approach, we identified 3 new MAVS-interacting proteins, RAB1B, VTN, and LONP1, and defined LONP1 as a positive regulator of the RIG-I pathway. Our proteomic analysis also reveals a dynamic cross-talk between subcellular compartments during both acute and chronic RNA virus infection, and demonstrates the importance of the MAM as a central platform that coordinates innate immune signaling to initiate immunity against RNA virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2073441380,"Background Research on aging has consistently demonstrated an increased chance of survival for older adults who are integrated into rich networks of social relationships. Theoretical explanations state that personal networks offer indirect psychosocial and direct physiological pathways. We investigate whether effects on and pathways to mortality risk differ between functional and structural characteristics of the personal network. The objective is to inquire which personal network characteristics are the best predictors of mortality risk after adjustment for mental, cognitive and physical health. Methods and Findings Empirical tests were carried out by combining official register information on mortality with data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). The sample included 2,911 Dutch respondents aged 54 to 85 at baseline in 1992 and six follow-ups covering a time span of twenty years. Four functional characteristics (emotional and social loneliness, emotional and instrumental support) and four structural characteristics (living arrangement, contact frequency, number of contacts, number of social roles) of the personal network as well as mental, cognitive and physical health were assessed at all LASA follow-ups. Statistical analyses comprised of Cox proportional hazard regression models. Findings suggest differential effects of personal network characteristics on survival, with only small gender differences. Mortality risk was initially reduced by functional characteristics, but disappeared after full adjustment for the various health variables. Mortality risk was lowest for older adults embedded in large (HR = 0.986, 95% CI 0.979—0.994) and diverse networks (HR = 0.948, 95% CI 0.917—0.981), and this effect continued to show in the fully adjusted models. Conclusions Functional characteristics (i.e. emotional and social loneliness) are indirectly associated with a reduction in mortality risk, while structural characteristics (i.e. number of contacts and number of social roles) have direct protective effects. More research is needed to understand the causal mechanisms underlying these relations."
https://openalex.org/W2009642254,"Few studies have quantified social mixing in remote rural areas of developing countries, where the burden of infectious diseases is usually the highest. Understanding social mixing patterns in those settings is crucial to inform the implementation of strategies for disease prevention and control. We characterized contact and social mixing patterns in rural communities of the Peruvian highlands.This cross-sectional study was nested in a large prospective household-based study of respiratory infections conducted in the province of San Marcos, Cajamarca-Peru. Members of study households were interviewed using a structured questionnaire of social contacts (conversation or physical interaction) experienced during the last 24 hours. We identified 9015 reported contacts from 588 study household members. The median age of respondents was 17 years (interquartile range [IQR] 4-34 years). The median number of reported contacts was 12 (IQR 8-20) whereas the median number of physical (i.e. skin-to-skin) contacts was 8.5 (IQR 5-14). Study participants had contacts mostly with people of similar age, and with their offspring or parents. The number of reported contacts was mainly determined by the participants' age, household size and occupation. School-aged children had more contacts than other age groups. Within-household reciprocity of contacts reporting declined with household size (range 70%-100%). Ninety percent of household contact networks were complete, and furthermore, household members' contacts with non-household members showed significant overlap (range 33%-86%), indicating a high degree of contact clustering. A two-level mixing epidemic model was simulated to compare within-household mixing based on observed contact networks and within-household random mixing. No differences in the size or duration of the simulated epidemics were revealed.This study of rural low-density communities in the highlands of Peru suggests contact patterns are highly assortative. Study findings support the use of within-household homogenous mixing assumptions for epidemic modeling in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W2000256732,"The numerous connections between neuronal cell bodies, made by their dendrites and axons, are vital for information processing in the brain. While dendrites and synapses have been extensively studied, axons have remained elusive to a large extent. We present a novel platform to study axonal physiology and information processing based on combining an 11,011-electrode high-density complementary metal-oxide semiconductor microelectrode array with a poly(dimethylsiloxane) channel device, which isolates axons from somas and, importantly, significantly amplifies recorded axonal signals. The combination of the microelectrode array with recording and stimulation capability with the microfluidic isolation channels permitted us to study axonal signal behavior at great detail. The device, featuring two culture chambers with over 30 channels spanning in between, enabled long-term recording of single spikes from isolated axons with signal amplitudes of 100 μV up to 2 mV. Propagating signals along axons could be recorded with 10 to 50 electrodes per channel. We (i) describe the performance and capabilities of our device for axonal electrophysiology, and (ii) present novel data on axonal signals facilitated by the device. Spontaneous action potentials with characteristic shapes propagated from somas along axons between the two compartments, and these unique shapes could be used to identify individual axons within channels that contained many axonal branches. Stimulation through the electrode array facilitated the identification of somas and their respective axons, enabling interfacing with different compartments of a single cell. Complex spike shapes observed in channels were traced back to single cells, and we show that more complicated spike shapes originate from a linear superposition of multiple axonal signals rather than signal distortion by the channels."
https://openalex.org/W2024150383,"Introduction Male involvement (MI) is vital for the uptake of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) interventions. Partner notification (PN) is among the strategies identified for MI in PMTCT services. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an invitation card to the male partners as a strategy for MI in PMTCT services by comparing the proportion of pregnant women that were accompanied by their partners between the intervention and the non-intervention study groups. Methods Pregnant women attending antenatal care without a male partner at South Lunzu and Mpemba health centres in Blantyre, Malawi, were enrolled in the study from June to December 2013. In an intention-to-treat analysis, we compared all participants that were randomized in the invitation card group with the standard of care (SoC) group. Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed to assess the efficacy of the invitation card. Results Of the 462 randomized women, 65/230 (28.26%) of the women in the invitation card group reported to the antenatal care clinic with their partners compared to 44/232 (18.97%) women in the SoC group. In an unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis women in the invitation card group were 50% more likely to be accompanied by their male partners than those in the SoC group RR: 1.49 (95% CI: 1.06-2.09); p = 0.02. Our random effects analysis showed that there was no clustering by site of recruitment with an inter cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 1.98x 10-3, (95% CI: 1.78 x10-7 - 0.96 x 10-1); p =0.403. Conclusion An invitation card significantly increased the proportion of women who were accompanied by their male partners for the PMTCT services. An invitation card is a feasible strategy for MI in PMTCT."
https://openalex.org/W2019557137,"The primary assumption within the recent personality and political orientations literature is that personality traits cause people to develop political attitudes. In contrast, research relying on traditional psychological and developmental theories suggests the relationship between most personality dimensions and political orientations are either not significant or weak. Research from behavioral genetics suggests the covariance between personality and political preferences is not causal, but due to a common, latent genetic factor that mutually influences both. The contradictory assumptions and findings from these research streams have yet to be resolved. This is in part due to the reliance on cross-sectional data and the lack of longitudinal genetically informative data. Here, using two independent longitudinal genetically informative samples, we examine the joint development of personality traits and attitude dimensions to explore the underlying causal mechanisms that drive the relationship between these features and provide a first step in resolving the causal question. We find change in personality over a ten-year period does not predict change in political attitudes, which does not support a causal relationship between personality traits and political attitudes as is frequently assumed. Rather, political attitudes are often more stable than the key personality traits assumed to be predicting them. Finally, the results from our genetic models find that no additional variance is accounted for by the causal pathway from personality traits to political attitudes. Our findings remain consistent with the original construction of the five-factor model of personality and developmental theories on attitude formation, but challenge recent work in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2070363305,"Alcohol consumption throughout pregnancy can cause metabolic dysregulation, including glucose intolerance in progeny. This study determined if periconceptional (PC) alcohol (12% v/v in a liquid diet) (PC:EtOH) consumed exclusively around conception results in similar outcomes in Sprague-Dawley rats. Control (C) rats were given a liquid diet containing no alcohol but matched to ensure equal caloric intake. PC maternal alcohol intake (from 4 days before conception until day 4 of gestation), resulted in offspring with elevated fasting plasma glucose (~10–25%, P < 0.05), impaired glucose tolerance (P < 0.05), and decreased insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01) at 6 months of age. This was associated with increased hepatic gluconeogenesis and sex-specific alterations in peripheral protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. These changes were accompanied by increased mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 1, 3a, and 3b (1.5- to 1.9-fold, P < 0.05) in fetal liver in late gestation, suggesting PC:EtOH may cause epigenetic changes that predispose offspring to metabolic dysfunction. Exposure to a postnatal (PN) high-fat and cholesterol diet (HFD) from 3 months of age caused hyperinsulinemia (~2-fold increase, P < 0.001) and exacerbated the metabolic dysfunction in male offspring exposed to PC:EtOH but had no additive effects in females. Given many women may drink alcohol while planning a pregnancy, it is crucial to increase public awareness regarding the effects of alcohol consumption around conception on offspring health.—Gårdebjer, E.

https://openalex.org/W2084360917,"The proper functioning of many organs and tissues containing smooth muscles greatly depends on the intricate organization of the smooth muscle cells oriented in appropriate directions. Consequently controlling the cellular orientation in three-dimensional (3D) cellular constructs is an important issue in engineering tissues of smooth muscles. However, the ability to precisely control the cellular orientation at the microscale cannot be achieved by various commonly used 3D tissue engineering building blocks such as spheroids. This paper presents the formation of coiled spring-shaped 3D cellular constructs containing circumferentially oriented smooth muscle-like cells differentiated from dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells. By using the cell fiber technology, DFAT cells suspended in a mixture of extracellular proteins possessing an optimized stiffness were encapsulated in the core region of alginate shell microfibers and uniformly aligned to the longitudinal direction. Upon differentiation induction to the smooth muscle lineage, DFAT cell fibers self-assembled to coiled spring structures where the cells became circumferentially oriented. By changing the initial core-shell microfiber diameter, we demonstrated that the spring pitch and diameter could be controlled. 21 days after differentiation induction, the cell fibers contained high percentages of ASMA-positive and calponin-positive cells. Our technology to create these smooth muscle-like spring constructs enabled precise control of cellular alignment and orientation in 3D. These constructs can further serve as tissue engineering building blocks for larger organs and cellular implants used in clinical treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2151945606,"Coyotes recently expanded into the eastern U.S. and potentially have caused localized white-tailed deer population declines. Research has focused on quantifying coyote predation on neonates, but little research has addressed the potential influence of bedsite characteristics on survival. In 2011 and 2012, we radiocollared 65 neonates, monitored them intensively for 16 weeks, and assigned mortality causes. We used Program MARK to estimate survival to 16 weeks and included biological covariates (i.e., sex, sibling status [whether or not it had a sibling], birth weight, and Julian date of birth). Survival to 16 weeks was 0.141 (95% CI = 0.075-0.249) and the top model included only sibling status, which indicated survival was lower for neonates that had a sibling. Predation was the leading cause of mortality (35 of 55; 64%) and coyotes were responsible for the majority of depredations (30 of 35; 86%). Additionally, we relocated neonates for the first 10 days of life and measured distance to firebreak, visual obstruction, and plant diversity at bedsites. Survival of predation to 10 days (0.726; 95% CI = 0.586-0.833) was weakly associated with plant diversity at bedsites but not related to visual obstruction. Our results indicate that neonate survival was low and coyote predation was an important source of mortality, which corroborates several recent studies from the region. Additionally, we detected only weak support for bedsite cover as a covariate to neonate survival, which indicates that mitigating effects of coyote predation on neonates may be more complicated than simply managing for increased hiding cover."
https://openalex.org/W2081459655,"Nasoalveolar molding (NAM) has gained wide acceptance and evidence in cleft therapy. However, standardized treatment protocols and experiences recorded from European centres are lacking. The results of 40 infants with cleft lip and palate treated with presurgical NAM according to the Grayson technique were analyzed. Standardized parameters of cleft width and nasal symmetry were measured in pre- and posttreatment plaster casts and in digitalized 3-dimensional STL models. Statistical analyses were performed by using Student´s t-test in a per-protocol manner. 27 out of 40 infants completed NAM and were analyzed. In 13 patients NAM was either temporarily interrupted or terminated prematurely due to skin irritations or lack of parental support. These cases were excluded from statistical analysis, resulting in a drop-out rate of 32.5%. Intersegmental alveolar distance (ISAD), intersegmental lip distance (ISLD), nostril height (NH), nostril width (NW) and columella deviation angle (CDA) were significantly changed in unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) (n = 8). In unilateral cleft lip (UCL) (n = 9), only ISLD, NH and CDA were significantly changed. ISAD of the right and left side, ISLD of the right and left side, premaxilla deviation angle, nostril height and columella length were changed significantly in bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP) cases (n = 10). NAM is a suitable presurgical treatment modality. A positive effect has been seen in UCLP and BCLP infants, as compared with their birth status."
https://openalex.org/W2017514802,"In beating hearts, phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) at a single site to 0.45 mol of phosphate/mol by cardiac myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK) increases Ca2+ sensitivity of myofilament contraction necessary for normal cardiac performance. Reduction of RLC phosphorylation in conditional cMLCK knock-out mice caused cardiac dilation and loss of cardiac performance by 1 week, as shown by increased left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole and decreased fractional shortening. Decreased RLC phosphorylation by conventional or conditional cMLCK gene ablation did not affect troponin-I or myosin-binding protein-C phosphorylation in vivo. The extent of RLC phosphorylation was not changed by prolonged infusion of dobutamine or treatment with a β-adrenergic antagonist, suggesting that RLC is constitutively phosphorylated to maintain cardiac performance. Biochemical studies with myofilaments showed that RLC phosphorylation up to 90% was a random process. RLC is slowly dephosphorylated in both noncontracting hearts and isolated cardiac myocytes from adult mice. Electrically paced ventricular trabeculae restored RLC phosphorylation, which was increased to 0.91 mol of phosphate/mol of RLC with inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). The two RLCs in each myosin appear to be readily available for phosphorylation by a soluble cMLCK, but MLCP activity limits the amount of constitutive RLC phosphorylation. MLCP with its regulatory subunit MYPT2 bound tightly to myofilaments was constitutively phosphorylated in beating hearts at a site that inhibits MLCP activity.

MLCP is composed of a regulatory targeting subunit, a catalytic subunit, and a small subunit of unknown function (3Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Signaling to myosin regulatory light chain in sarcomeres.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 9941-9947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The myosin-targeting regulatory subunit for MLCP in striated muscles is MYPT2, which targets the catalytic subunit PP1cδ to myosin filaments (19Moorhead G. Johnson D. Morrice N. Cohen P. The major myosin phosphatase in skeletal muscle is a complex between the β-isoform of protein phosphatase 1 and the MYPT2 gene product.FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similar to the MYPT1 in smooth muscles, phosphorylation of MYPT2 reduces MLCP activity toward RLC (20Okamoto R. Kato T. Mizoguchi A. Takahashi N. Nakakuki T. Mizutani H. Isaka N. Imanaka-Yoshida K.

Signal. 2006; 18: 1408-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MYPT2 in the heart causes a decrease in RLC phosphorylation due to accumulation of the catalytic subunit PP1cδ (21Mizutani H. Okamoto R. Moriki N. Konishi K. Taniguchi M. Fujita S.

RLC phosphorylation is consistently reported as 0.40–0.50 mol of phosphate/mol of RLC in beating hearts from various mammals (22Herring B.P. England P.J.

Additionally, the maximal extent of RLC phosphorylation appears to be limited to 0.5 mol/mol, because it was not increased in hearts after β-adrenergic stimulation that increases [Ca2+]i and myocardial contractility (25Dias F.A.

We asked whether the extent of RLC phosphorylation is limited by negative cooperativity or steric constraints in myofibrils, resulting in a fast phosphorylation rate for 50% of RLC with a slower phosphorylation rate in the remaining 50% of RLC. These considerations are related to cardiac myosin being a dimer of two heavy chains, each containing an RLC as well as the complex structure of the sarcomere involving myosin heavy chains interacting with other sarcomeric proteins. Hearts from conventional cMLCK knock-out mice have 0.10 mol of phosphate/mol of RLC (11Chang A.N. Huang J. Battiprolu P.K. Hill J.A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T.

To determine whether the dilated phenotype caused by cMLCK knockout is preceded by a loss of cardiac performance associated with decreased RLC phosphorylation and phosphorylation of other sarcomeric proteins, we developed a conditional gene ablation mouse model for an acute cMLCK knockout. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Guidelines at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center with all animal experimental procedures reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Animals were housed under standard conditions in the rodent facility. A conventional knock-out of cMLCK (CKO) was generated from the floxed mice described previously (12Ding P. Huang J. Battiprolu P.K. Hill J.A. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Cardiac myosin light chain kinase is necessary for myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation and cardiac performance in vivo.J. Biol.

Mice with floxed alleles were bred with the CAG-Cre transgenic line, which allowed for excision of the floxed allele irrespective of transmission of the CAG-Cre gene (28Sakai K. Miyazaki J. A transgenic mouse line that retains Cre recombinase activity in mature oocytes irrespective of the cre transgene transmission.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Heterozygous animals that had the knock-out allele but not the CAG-Cre gene, Mylk3+/−, were selected for subsequent breeding. A conditional knock-out model (CFM) was generated by crossing mice with the floxed allele with the tamoxifen-inducible MerCreMer transgenic line. Cre-positive WT littermates were used as controls. Mice were injected with 0.5 mg tamoxifen (intraperitoneally) for 5 consecutive days. All lines were back-crossed into the C57BL6 inbred WT line (Jackson Laboratory) for at least 5 generations. For all studies, 12–15-week-old male mice were used. A conventional knockin of the R21C mutation in cardiac TnI was described previously (29Dweck D. Sanchez-Gonzalez M.A. Chang A.N. Dulce R.A.

All protocols and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Miami and the Florida State University following the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. R21C mice have a homozygous knock-in mutation in the TNNI3 gene (encoding cardiac troponin I), which substitutes an arginine at residue 21 with cysteine (R21C) and completely prevents PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-23/24 of cTnI (30Wang Y.

Hearts of knock-in mice and age-matched littermates were collected from anesthetized mice and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Force measurements with mouse cardiac trabeculae were performed with wild type mice (C57BL/6J; Jackson Laboratory) in the laboratory of Dr. Anthony J. Baker at the University of California, San Francisco. This institution is accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (Institutional PHS Assurance Number A3476-01). The study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Subcommittee of the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Protocol 13-013) and conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (revised 2011). Echocardiograms were performed on conscious, gently restrained mice using a Vevo 2100 system with a MS400C scan head. Left ventricular internal diameter at end-diastole (LVEDD) and end-systole (LVESD) were measured from M-mode recordings. The percentage of fractional shortening was calculated as ((LVEDD − LVESD)/LVEDD) × 100. Measurements of interventricular septum thickness, left ventricular internal diameter, and left ventricular posterior wall thickness were made from two-dimensional parasternal short axis views in diastole (31Collins K.A. Korcarz C.E. Shroff S.G. Bednarz J.E. Fentzke R.C. Lin H. Leiden J.M. Lang R.M. Accuracy of echocardiographic estimates of left ventricular mass in mice.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1954-H1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All measurements were made at the level of papillary muscles. Dobutamine (5 ng/g/min) was infused though the jugular vein of mice anesthetized with isoflurane. At the end of the treatment, whole hearts were immediately excised, and ventricles were snap-frozen with clamps prechilled in liquid nitrogen. All tissue collections were performed in the afternoon between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. For propranolol-treated samples, mice were injected with 1 mg/kg propranolol (intraperitoneally) 20 min prior to heart excision. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical evaluation was carried out in GraphPad Prism using an unpaired Student's t test for two comparisons or paired t test for comparison of the same sample before and after treatment. Analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls post-test were used for multiple comparisons. Significance was accepted at a value of p < 0.05. Frozen ventricles were ground in liquid nitrogen, and an aliquot was thawed in 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. Precipitated protein was washed free of acid with three 5-min washes in ethyl ether and resuspended by vigorous agitation in urea sample buffer (8 m urea, 20 mm Tris base, 23 mm glycine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.6) using an orbital shaker (IKA Vibrax VXR) set at 1400 rpm for 30 min at room temperature. Complete denaturation and solubilization was achieved by additional urea crystals and prolonged agitation until crystals did not dissolve. Protein samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and protein concentration in supernatant fractions was measured by a Bradford assay. Proteins (2–20 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE after boiling in Laemmli buffer and transferred to PVDF (Immobilon-P, Millipore) or nitrocellulose (Protran, Whatman) and blotted by standard procedures. The amount of protein loaded was optimized empirically for each antibody to ensure density measurements were proportional to the amount of protein. Measurements of RLC phosphorylation in heart homogenates were performed by urea/glycerol-PAGE and immunoblotting, as described previously (32Kamm K.E. Hsu L.C. Kubota Y. Stull J.T. Phosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin heavy and light chains: effects of phorbol dibutyrate and agonists.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21223-21229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The urea/glycerol-PAGE system separates phosphorylated RLC from non-phosphorylated RLC, allowing a direct quantitative measure of RLC phosphorylation in terms of the fraction of phosphorylated RLC to total RLC (nonphosphorylated plus phosphorylated). Because the separation results from a single phosphate, data may also be calculated as mol of phosphate/mol of RLC. Although it was reported that a small amount of cardiac RLC may be diphosphorylated (33Scruggs S.B. Hinken A.C. Thawornkaiwong A. Robbins J. Walker L.A. de Tombe P.P. Geenen D.L. Buttrick P.M.

Chem. 2009; 284: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we found that the amount relative to monophosphorylated RLC was too small to reliably measure by quantitative immunoblotting. Briefly, polyacrylamide gels containing 40% glycerol were pre-electrophoresed for 1 h at 400 V at room temperature in a minigel apparatus. Reservoir buffer contained 20 mm Tris base and 23 mm glycine, pH 8.6; thioglycolate and dithiothreitol (2.3 mm each) were included in the upper reservoir. Samples (2 μg of protein in urea sample buffer) were subjected to electrophoresis for 90 min at 400 V at room temperature and then transferred to a PVDF membrane for 1 h at 0.3 A at 4 °C. Post-transfer, proteins were fixed onto the PVDF membrane with 0.4% glutaraldehyde/PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The membrane was then rinsed three times in PBS and immunoblotted with antibody to cardiac RLC. Antibodies to RLC, cMLCK, and skeletal MLCK were reported previously (12Ding P. Huang J.

Polyclonal antibody raised against full-length cMLCK protein for cMLCK protein measurement studies was generated by the antibody production program at the Animal Resources Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Antibody to phosphorylated-phospholamban, pPLB_Thr17, were purchased from Badrilla Ltd.; antibody to cardiac pTnI_Ser23/24 (catalog no. 4004) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology; and antibodies to total cardiac TnI (MAB1691), total PLB (05-205), and pPLB_Ser16 (07-052) were purchased from Millipore. Antibody to cardiac pMyBP-C_Ser282 (ALX 215-057) was purchased from Enzo Life. Antibody to total MYPT1 (residues 661–710) (LS-C117671) was purchased from LifeSpan BioSciences. Antibody to pMYPT1_Thr696 (ABS45) was purchased from Millipore. Polyclonal antibody for total MYPT2 was raised against mouse MYPT2 residues 673–848 by Proteintech. Male C57BL/6J mice (∼13 weeks old) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and heparinized (100 units). Hearts were removed and immediately immersed in ice-cold arrest solution (120 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2) and then perfused through the aorta with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (112 mm NaCl, 15 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm Na2SO4, 2 mm NaHPO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2). The perfusate was oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 to give a pH of 7.4 at 22 °C. The free wall of right ventricle was removed from the heart, and a trabecula that was free running between the right ventricle wall and tricuspid valve was dissected. Trabeculae were ∼1 mm long with an elliptical cross-section. The width, thickness, and cross-sectional area of trabeculae were 184.0 ± 18.6 μm, 136.5 ± 11.9 μm, and 0.022 ± 0.004 mm2, respectively (n = 19). Trabeculae were placed in a muscle chamber (3 × 3 × 15 mm) and mounted on stainless steel pins with the valvular end attached to a micromanipulator and the ventricular end attached to a force transducer (AE-801, Kronex, Oakland, CA). Sarcomeres were observed using a ×40 objective, and sarcomere length was assessed using a video-based system (model 900B, Aurora Scientific, Inc., Ontario, Canada). Diastolic sarcomere length was set to 2.1 μm. Trabeculae were equilibrated for 1 h in Krebs-Henseleit solution (5 ml/min) as described above, but with 5 mm KCl. The calcium level of the solution was increased to 2 mm in increments of 0.3 mm, and contractions were evoked by electrical field stimulation, using 4-ms square wave stimuli at supramaximal voltage. Trabeculae were subjected to one of the following conditions: 30 min of no electrical pacing, pacing at 0.5 Hz, or pacing at 1.5 Hz.

Because instruments that measure the actual quality and quantity of specific activities in daily life are lacking, a new measure needs to be developed. The aims of this study are to a) elucidate the techniques used to identify upper extremity activities, b) provide a proof-of-principle of this method using a set of activities tested in a healthy adult and in a stroke patient, and c) provide an example of the method’s applicability in daily life based on readings taken from a healthy adult. Multiple devices, each of which contains a tri-axial accelerometer, a tri-axial gyroscope and a tri-axial magnetometer were attached to the dominant hand, wrist, upper arm and chest of 30 healthy participants and one stroke patient, who all performed the tasks ‘drinking’, ‘eating’ and ‘brushing hair’ in a standardized environment. To establish proof-of-principle, a prolonged daily life recording of 1 participant was used to identify the task ‘drinking’. The activities were identified using multi-array signal feature extraction and pattern recognition algorithms and 2D-convolution. The activities ‘drinking’, ‘eating’ and ‘brushing hair’ were unambiguously recognized in a sequence of recordings of multiple standardized daily activities in a healthy participant and in a stroke patient. It was also possible to identify a specific activity in a daily life recording. The long term aim is to use this method to a) identify arm-hand activities that someone performs during daily life, b) determine the quantity of activity execution, i.e. amount of use, and c) determine the quality of arm-hand skill performance."
https://openalex.org/W2054209424,"Hearing loss, presbycusis, is one of the most common sensory declines in the ageing population. Presbycusis is characterised by a deterioration in the processing of temporal sound features as well as a decline in speech perception, thus indicating a possible central component. With the aim to explore the central component of presbycusis, we studied the function of the auditory cortex by functional MRI in two groups of elderly subjects (>65 years) and compared the results with young subjects (<lt;30 years). The elderly group with expressed presbycusis (EP) differed from the elderly group with mild presbycusis (MP) in hearing thresholds measured by pure tone audiometry, presence and amplitudes of transient otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and distortion-product oto-acoustic emissions (DPOAE), as well as in speech-understanding under noisy conditions. Acoustically evoked activity (pink noise centered around 350 Hz, 700 Hz, 1.5 kHz, 3 kHz, 8 kHz), recorded by BOLD fMRI from an area centered on Heschl’s gyrus, was used to determine age-related changes at the level of the auditory cortex. The fMRI showed only minimal activation in response to the 8 kHz stimulation, despite the fact that all subjects heard the stimulus. Both elderly groups showed greater activation in response to acoustical stimuli in the temporal lobes in comparison with young subjects. In addition, activation in the right temporal lobe was more expressed than in the left temporal lobe in both elderly groups, whereas in the young control subjects (YC) leftward lateralization was present. No statistically significant differences in activation of the auditory cortex were found between the MP and EP groups. The greater extent of cortical activation in elderly subjects in comparison with young subjects, with an asymmetry towards the right side, may serve as a compensatory mechanism for the impaired processing of auditory information appearing as a consequence of ageing."

In this work, we introduce Boundary Stress Microscopy to quantify the non-uniform surface stresses in sheared collagen gels. We find local stresses exceeding average stresses by an order of magnitude, with variations over length scales much larger than the network mesh size. The strain stiffening behavior observed over a wide range of network mesh sizes can be parameterized by a single characteristic strain and associated stress, which describes both the strain stiffening regime and network yielding. The characteristic stress is approximately proportional to network density, but the peak boundary stress at both the characteristic strain and at yielding are remarkably insensitive to concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1984397780,"Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection is an important contributor to the progression of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. The cornerstone treatment for Pa infection is the use of inhaled antibiotics. However, there is substantial lung disease heterogeneity within and between patients that likely impacts deposition patterns of inhaled antibiotics. Therefore, this may result in airways below the minimal inhibitory concentration of the inhaled agent. Very little is known about antibiotic concentrations in small airways, in particular the effect of structural lung abnormalities. We therefore aimed to develop a patient-specific airway model to predict concentrations of inhaled antibiotics and to study the impact of structural lung changes and breathing profile on local concentrations in airways of patients with CF. Methods In- and expiratory CT-scans of children with CF (5–17 years) were scored (CF-CT score), segmented and reconstructed into 3D airway models. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed on 40 airway models to predict local Aztreonam lysine for inhalation (AZLI) concentrations. Patient-specific lobar flow distribution and nebulization of 75 mg AZLI through a digital Pari eFlow model with mass median aerodynamic diameter range were used at the inlet of the airway model. AZLI concentrations for central and small airways were computed for different breathing patterns and airway surface liquid thicknesses. Results In most simulated conditions, concentrations in both central and small airways were well above the minimal inhibitory concentration. However, small airways in more diseased lobes were likely to receive suboptimal AZLI. Structural lung disease and increased tidal volumes, respiratory rates and larger particle sizes greatly reduced small airway concentrations. Conclusions CFD modeling showed that concentrations of inhaled antibiotic delivered to the small airways are highly patient specific and vary throughout the bronchial tree. These results suggest that anti-Pa treatment of especially the small airways can be improved."
https://openalex.org/W2061745059,"Individuals with a higher education are more likely to migrate, increasing the chance of meeting a spouse with a different ancestral background. In this context, the presence of strong educational assortment can result in greater ancestry differences within more educated spouse pairs, while less educated individuals are more likely to mate with someone with whom they share more ancestry. We examined the association between educational attainment and Froh (= the proportion of the genome consisting of runs of homozygosity [ROHs]) in ~2,000 subjects of Dutch ancestry. The subjects’ own educational attainment showed a nominally significant negative association with Froh (p = .045), while the contribution of parental education to offspring Froh was highly significant (father: p < 10-5; mother: p = 9×10-5), with more educated parents having offspring with fewer ROHs. This association was significantly and fully mediated by the physical distance between parental birthplaces (paternal education: pmediation = 2.4 × 10-4; maternal education: pmediation = 2.3 × 10-4), which itself was also significantly associated with Froh (p = 9 × 10-5). Ancestry-informative principal components from the offspring showed a significantly decreasing association with geography as parental education increased, consistent with the significantly higher migration rates among more educated parents. Parental education also showed a high spouse correlation (Spearman’s ρ = .66, p = 3 × 10-262). We show that less educated parents are less likely to mate with the more mobile parents with a higher education, creating systematic differences in homozygosity due to ancestry differences not directly captured by ancestry-informative principal components (PCs). Understanding how behaviors influence the genomic structure of a population is highly valuable for studies on the genetic etiology of behavioral, cognitive, and social traits."
https://openalex.org/W2022473987,"In recent years, corn rootworm (CRW)-resistant maize events producing two or more CRW-active Bt proteins have been commercialized to enhance efficacy against the target pest(s) by providing multiple modes of action (MoA). The maize hybrid MON 87411 has been developed that produces the CRW-active Cry3Bb1 Bt protein (hereafter Cry3Bb1) and expresses a RNAi-mediated MoA that also targets CRW. As part of an environmental risk assessment for MON 87411, the potential for an interaction between the CRW-active DvSnf7 RNA (hereafter DvSnf7) and Cry3Bb1 was assessed in 12-day diet incorporation bioassays with the southern corn rootworm (SCR, Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi). The potential for an interaction between DvSnf7 and Cry3Bb1 was evaluated with two established experimental approaches. The first approach evaluated each substance alone and in combination over three different response levels. For all three response levels, observed responses were shown to be additive and not significantly different from predicted responses under the assumption of independent action. The second approach evaluated the potential for a fixed sub-lethal concentration of Cry3Bb1 to decrease the median lethal concentration (LC50) of DvSnf7 and vice-versa. With this approach, the LC50 value of DvSnf7 was not altered by a sub-lethal concentration of Cry3Bb1 and vice-versa. In addition, the potential for an interaction between the Cry3Bb1 and DvSnf7 was tested with Colorado potato beetle (CPB, Leptinotarsa decemlineata), which is sensitive to Cry3Bb1 but not DvSnf7. CPB assays also demonstrated that DvSnf7 does not alter the activity of Cry3Bb1. The results from this study provide multiple lines of evidence that DvSnf7 and Cry3Bb1 produced in MON 87411 have independent action."

In these settings, centralized water treatment is ineffective, while household-level water treatment technologies have not been brought to scale. This study compares a novel low-cost technology designed to passively (automatically) dispense chlorine at shared handpumps with a household-level intervention providing water disinfection tablets (Aquatab), safe water storage containers, and behavior promotion. Twenty compounds were enrolled in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and randomly assigned to one of three groups: passive chlorinator, Aquatabs, or control. Over a 10-month intervention period, the mean percentage of households whose stored drinking water had detectable total chlorine was 75% in compounds with access to the passive chlorinator, 72% in compounds receiving Aquatabs, and 6% in control compounds. Both interventions also significantly improved microbial water quality. Aquatabs usage fell by 50% after behavioral promotion visits concluded, suggesting intensive promotion is necessary for sustained uptake. The study findings suggest high potential for an automated decentralized water treatment system to increase consistent access to clean water in low-income urban communities."

To determine if the ocelloid is functionally photoreceptive, we investigated the warnowiid dinoflagellate Erythropsidinium. Here, we show that the morphology of the retinal body changed depending on different illumination conditions and the hyalosome manifests the refractile nature. Identifying a rhodopsin gene fragment in Erythropsidinium ESTs that is expressed in the retinal body by in situ hybridization, we also show that ocelloids are actually light sensitive photoreceptors. The rhodopsin gene identified is most closely related to bacterial rhodopsins. Taken together, we suggest that the ocelloid is an intracellular camera-type eye, which might be originated from endosymbiotic origin."
https://openalex.org/W2053758024,"Iron is an essential metal cofactor that is required for many biological processes. Eukaryotic cells have consequently developed different strategies for its acquisition. Until now, Schizosaccharomyces pombe was known to use reductive iron uptake and siderophore-bound iron transport to scavenge iron from the environment. Here, we report the identification of a gene designated shu1+ that encodes a protein that enables S. pombe to take up extracellular heme for cell growth. When iron levels are low, the transcription of shu1+ is induced, although its expression is repressed when iron levels rise. The iron-dependent down-regulation of shu1+ requires the GATA-type transcriptional repressor Fep1, which strongly associates with a proximal promoter region of shu1+ in vivo in response to iron repletion. HA4-tagged Shu1 localizes to the plasma membrane in cells expressing a functional shu1+-HA4 allele. When heme biosynthesis is selectively blocked in mutated S. pombe cells, their ability to acquire exogenous hemin or the fluorescent heme analog zinc mesoporphyrin IX is dependent on the expression of Shu1. Further analysis by absorbance spectroscopy and hemin-agarose pulldown assays showed that Shu1 interacts with hemin, with a KD of ∼2.2 μm. Taken together, results reported here revealed that S. pombe possesses an unexpected pathway for heme assimilation, which may also serve as a source of iron for cell growth.

When iron levels are low, the transcription of shu1+ is induced, although its expression is repressed when iron levels rise. The iron-dependent down-regulation of shu1+ requires the GATA-type transcriptional repressor Fep1, which strongly associates with a proximal promoter region of shu1+ in vivo in response to iron repletion. HA4-tagged Shu1 localizes to the plasma membrane in cells expressing a functional shu1+-HA4 allele. When heme biosynthesis is selectively blocked in mutated S. pombe cells, their ability to acquire exogenous hemin or the fluorescent heme analog zinc mesoporphyrin IX is dependent on the expression of Shu1. Further analysis by absorbance spectroscopy and hemin-agarose pulldown assays showed that Shu1 interacts with hemin, with a KD of ∼2.2 μm. Taken together, results reported here revealed that S. pombe possesses an unexpected pathway for heme assimilation, which may also serve as a source of iron for cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2023817923,"Clinical value of mitochondrial DNA has been described in colorectal cancer (CRC). To clarify its role in colorectal carcinogenesis, mitochondrial microsatellite instability (mtMSI) and other markers were investigated in CRCs and their precancerous lesions, as a multitier genetic study. DNA was isolated from paired normal and tumoral tissues in 78 tubular adenomas (TAs), 34 serrated polyps (SPs), and 100 CRCs. mtMSI, nucleus microsatellite instability (nMSI), KRAS mutation, and BRAF mutation were investigated in these tumors and their statistical analysis was performed. mtMSI was found in 30% of CRCs and 21.4% of precancerous lesions. Mitochondrial copy number was higher in SPs than TAs and it was associated with mtMSI in low grade TAs. KRAS and BRAF mutations were mutually exclusive in TAs and SPs. CRCs with mtMSI showed shorter overall survival times than the patients without mtMSI. In CRCs without nMSI or BRAF mutation, mtMSI was a more accurate marker for predicting prognosis. The genetic change of mitochondrial DNA is an early and independent event in colorectal precancerous lesions and mtMSI and mitochondrial contents are associated with the tubular adenoma-carcinoma sequence, resulting in poor prognosis. This result suggested that the genetic change in mitochondrial DNA appears to be a possible prognosis marker in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W1996704488,"Calcium dysregulation is causally linked with various forms of neuropathology including seizure disorders, multiple sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s, spinal cerebellar ataxia (SCA) and chronic pain. Carbonic anhydrase-8 (Car8) is an allosteric inhibitor of inositol trisphosphate receptor-1 (ITPR1), which regulates intracellular calcium release fundamental to critical cellular functions including neuronal excitability, neurite outgrowth, neurotransmitter release, mitochondrial energy production and cell fate. In this report we test the hypothesis that Car8 regulation of ITPR1 and cytoplasmic free calcium release is critical to nociception and pain behaviors. We show Car8 null mutant mice (MT) exhibit mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from MT also demonstrate increased steady-state ITPR1 phosphorylation (pITPR1) and cytoplasmic free calcium release. Overexpression of Car8 wildtype protein in MT nociceptors complements Car8 deficiency, down regulates pITPR1 and abolishes thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity. We also show that Car8 nociceptor overexpression alleviates chronic inflammatory pain. Finally, inflammation results in downregulation of DRG Car8 that is associated with increased pITPR1 expression relative to ITPR1, suggesting a possible mechanism of acute hypersensitivity. Our findings indicate Car8 regulates the ITPR1-cytosolic free calcium pathway that is critical to nociception, inflammatory pain and possibly other neuropathological states. Car8 and ITPR1 represent new therapeutic targets for chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2058490656,"Mechanical stress that arises due to deformation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) either stretches or compresses cells. The cellular response to stretching has been actively studied. For example, stretching induces phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) via the RhoA/RhoA-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway, resulting in increased cellular tension. In contrast, the effects of compressive stress on cellular functions are not fully resolved. The mechanisms for sensing and differentially responding to stretching and compressive stress are not known. To address these questions, we investigated whether phosphorylation levels of MRLC were affected by compressive stress. Contrary to the response in stretching cells, MRLC was dephosphorylated 5 min after cells were subjected to compressive stress. Compressive loading induced activation of myosin phosphatase mediated via the dephosphorylation of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (Thr853). Because myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (Thr853) is phosphorylated only by ROCK, compressive loading may have induced inactivation of ROCK. However, GTP-bound RhoA (active form) increased in response to compressive stress. The compression-induced activation of RhoA and inactivation of its effector ROCK are contradictory. This inconsistency was due to phosphorylation of RhoA (Ser188) that reduced affinity of RhoA to ROCK. Treatment with the inhibitor of protein kinase A that phosphorylates RhoA (Ser188) induced suppression of compression-stimulated MRLC dephosphorylation. Incidentally, stretching induced phosphorylation of MRLC, but did not affect phosphorylation levels of RhoA (Ser188). Together, our results suggest that RhoA phosphorylation is an important process for MRLC dephosphorylation by compressive loading, and for distinguishing between stretching and compressing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065103413,"Radiotherapy is a widely used treatment for cancer. However, recent studies suggest that ionizing radiation (IR) can promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Bmi-1, a member of the polycomb group protein family, has been observed as a regulator of oxidative stress and promotes metastasis in some tumors. But, its potential role in the metastasis induced by IR of breast cancer has not been explored. In our study, we found that increased levels of Bmi-1 were correlated to EMT of breast cancer cells. Through analyzing the EMT state and metastasis of breast cancer induced by IR, we found the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells can either be inhibited or accelerated by IR following a time-dependent pattern. Silencing Bmi-1 completely abolished the ability of the IR to alter, reduce or increase, the migration of breast cancer cells. Also, when Bmi-1 was knocked down, the effect of inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling on EMT affected by IR was blocked. These results suggest that Bmi-1 is a key gene in regulation of EMT and migration of breast cancer cells induced by IR through activation of PI3K/AKT signaling; therefore, Bmi-1 could be a new target for inhibiting metastasis caused by IR."
https://openalex.org/W2069156317,"Root turnover is an important carbon flux component in grassland ecosystems because it replenishes substantial parts of carbon lost from soil via heterotrophic respiration and leaching. Among the various methods to estimate root turnover, the root’s radiocarbon signature has rarely been applied to grassland soils previously, although the value of this approach is known from studies in forest soils. In this paper, we utilize the root’s radiocarbon signatures, at 25 plots, in mountain grasslands of the montane to alpine zone of Europe. We place the results in context of a global data base on root turnover and discuss driving factors. Root turnover rates were similar to those of a subsample of the global data, comprising a similar temperature range, but measured with different approaches, indicating that the radiocarbon method gives reliable, plausible and comparable results. Root turnover rates (0.06–1.0 y-1) scaled significantly and exponentially with mean annual temperatures. Root turnover rates indicated no trend with soil depth. The temperature sensitivity was significantly higher in mountain grassland, compared to the global data set, suggesting additional factors influencing root turnover. Information on management intensity from the 25 plots reveals that root turnover may be accelerated under intensive and moderate management compared to low intensity or semi-natural conditions. Because management intensity, in the studied ecosystems, co-varied with temperature, estimates on root turnover, based on mean annual temperature alone, may be biased. A greater recognition of management as a driver for root dynamics is warranted when effects of climatic change on belowground carbon dynamics are studied in mountain grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W2012929174,"It has been known for decades that lowering the circulating glucocorticoid (GC) concentration as in Addison's disease or after removing the adrenals results in thymus enlargement, largely due to thymocyte expansion. This has been attributed to the loss of the proapoptotic effects on thymocytes by adrenal GCs. Here, we test this concept and report that ACTH directly controls thymic growth post-adrenalectomy (ADX) independent of the proapoptotic effect of GCs. This was supported by the finding that ADX caused thymus enlargement and a 1.7-fold (P < 0.001) increase in thymocyte number in GRLckCre mice resistant to GC-induced thymocyte apoptosis, similar to the increase seen in wild-type mice (2.2-fold; P < 0.01). We show by immunostaining that melanocortin receptor subtype 2, which selectively binds ACTH, is partly expressed on the thymic epithelium. Furthermore, ACTH in comparison to vehicle induced a 2.0-fold (P< 0.01) increase in fetal thymic organ culture thymocyte numbers in vitro and enhanced 2.2-fold (P < 0.05) the expression of delta-like ligand 4, a factor that supports T-cell development. Additionally, adrenalectomized GRLckCre mice treated with ACTH under conditions that repressed endogenous ACTH secretion showed increased thymocyte cellularity (1.9-fold; P < 0.01) and splenic naive T-cell numbers (2.5-fold; P < 0.001) compared to when treated with PBS. Altogether, our results show that ACTH directly controls thymocyte homeostasis independent of GCs. These results revise the old paradigm behind compensatory thymus growth following ADX, now demonstrating that ACTH has a central role in regulating thymocyte expansion when systemic GC concentration is low.—Talaber, G., Tuckermann, J.

https://openalex.org/W2024282331,"Recent studies have identified biomarkers related to the severity and pathogenesis of cocaine addiction and common comorbid psychiatric disorders. Monitoring these plasma mediators may improve the stratification of cocaine users seeking treatment. Because the neurotrophic factors are involved in neural plasticity, neurogenesis and neuronal survival, we have determined plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1 binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in a cross-sectional study with abstinent cocaine users who sought outpatient treatment for cocaine (n = 100) and age/body mass matched controls (n = 85). Participants were assessed with the diagnostic interview ‘Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders’. Plasma concentrations of these peptides were not different in cocaine users and controls. They were not associated with length of abstinence, duration of cocaine use or cocaine symptom severity. The pathological use of cocaine did not influence the association of IGF-1 with age observed in healthy subjects, but the correlation between IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 was not significantly detected. Correlation analyses were performed between these peptides and other molecules sensitive to addiction: BDNF concentrations were not associated with inflammatory mediators, lipid derivatives or IGF-1 in cocaine users, but correlated with chemokines (fractalkine/CX3CL1 and SDF-1/CXCL12) and N-acyl-ethanolamines (N-palmitoyl-, N-oleoyl-, N-arachidonoyl-, N-linoleoyl- and N-dihomo-γ-linolenoyl-ethanolamine) in controls; IGF-1 concentrations only showed association with IGFBP-3 concentrations in controls; and IGFBP-3 was only correlated with N-stearoyl-ethanolamine concentrations in cocaine users. Multiple substance use disorders and life-time comorbid psychopathologies were common in abstinent cocaine users. Interestingly, plasma BDNF concentrations were exclusively found to be decreased in users diagnosed with both primary and cocaine-induced disorders for mood and anxiety disorders. In summary, BDNF, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were not affected by a history of pathological use of cocaine supported by the absence of associations with other molecules sensitive to cocaine addiction. However, BDNF was affected by comorbid mood disorders. Further research is necessary to elucidate the role of BDNF and IGF-1 in the transition to cocaine addiction and associated psychiatric comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W1994373063,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the major lethal lesion induced by ionizing radiation (IR). RAD51-dependent homologous recombination (HR) is one of the most important pathways in DSB repair and genome integrity maintenance. However, the mechanism of HR regulation by RAD51 remains unclear. To understand the mechanism of RAD51-dependent HR, we searched for interacting partners of RAD51 by a proteomics analysis and identified lamin B1 in human cells. Lamins are nuclear lamina proteins that play important roles in the structural organization of the nucleus and the regulation of chromosome functions. Immunoblotting analyses revealed that siRNA-mediated lamin B1 depletion repressed the DNA damage-dependent increase of RAD51 after IR. The repression was abolished by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that ***lamin B1 stabilizes RAD51 by preventing proteasome-mediated degradation in cells with IR-induced DNA damage. We also showed that lamin B1 depletion repressed RAD51 focus formation and decreased the survival rates after IR. On the basis of these results, we propose that lamin B1 promotes DSB repair and cell survival by maintaining the RAD51 protein levels for HR upon DSB induction after IR.—Liu, N.-A., Sun, J., Kono, K., Horikoshi, Y., Ikura, T., Tong, X., Haraguchi, T., Tashiro, S.

https://openalex.org/W2158382155,"Background Meal times in France still represent an important moment in everyday life. The model of three rigorously synchronized meals is still followed by a majority of people, while meal frequencies have flattened in other European or North-American countries. We aimed to examine the “French model” of eating behavior by identifying and characterizing distinct meal patterns. Methods Analyses were based on data from the SIRS cohort, a representative survey of the adult population in the Paris area. A clustering algorithm was applied to meal variables (number, time, location, with whom the meal is usually shared and activities associated with meals). Regression models were used to investigate associations between patterns and socio-demographic, social environment and perceived food quality variables. Results Five different patterns were identified among 2994 participants. The first three types (prevalence 33%, 17% and 24%) followed a three-meal pattern, with differences in locations and social interactions mainly related to time constraints and age. More marked differences were observed in the remaining two types. In the fourth type (prevalence 13%), individuals ate one or two meals per day, often with an irregular schedule, at home and in front of the television. They frequently were unemployed and had lower income. Breakfast skipping, increased snacking and a low adherence to dietary guidelines suggested that this behavior might have health consequences. In the fifth type (12%), people also ate two meals or less per day, possibly with the same consequences on food quality. However, meals were often taken outside the home, in social settings, and individuals following this pattern were typically active, integrated, young people, suggesting that this pattern might be an adaptation to a modern urban lifestyle. Conclusions While a majority of the population still follows the three-meal pattern, our analysis distinguished two other eating patterns associated with specific sociological profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2078226166,"Fatty acid- and retinoid-binding protein (FAR) is a nematode-specific protein expressed in the nematode hypodermis. It is involved in nematode development, reproduction, and infection and can disrupt the plant defense reaction. In this study, we obtained the full-length sequence of the far gene from Radopholus similis (Rs-far-1), which is 828 bp long and includes a 558 bp ORF encoding 186 amino acids. A protein homology analysis revealed that Rs-FAR-1 is 75% similar to Mj-FAR-1 from Meloidogyne javanica. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was inferred and showed that Rs-FAR-1 is most similar to Pv-FAR-1 from Pratylenchus vulnus. A fluorescence-based ligand-binding analysis confirmed that Rs-FAR-1 can combine with fatty acids and retinol. qPCR was used to assess Rs-far-1 expression levels at different developmental stages in different R. similis populations, and its expression was 2.5 times greater in the highly pathogenic Rs-C population than in the less pathogenic Rs-P population. The highest expression was found in females, followed by eggs, juveniles and males. When R. similis was treated with Rs-far-1 dsRNA for 36 h, the reproduction and pathogenicity decreased significantly. In situ hybridization revealed Rs-far-1 transcripts in the R. similis hypodermis. Additionally, R. similis treated with Rs-far-1 dsRNA or water were inoculated into Arabidopsis thaliana. Allene oxide synthase (AOS) expression in A. thaliana was upregulated during early infection in both treatments and then returned to the expression levels of the control plant. Compared with the control plant, AOS expression significantly decreased in A. thaliana inoculated with water-treated R. similis but significantly increased in A. thaliana inoculated with Rs-far-1 dsRNA-treated R. similis. This finding indicates that Rs-far-1 regulates AOS expression in A. thaliana. Rs-FAR-1 plays a critical role in R. similis development, reproduction, and infection and can disturb the plant defense reaction. Therefore, Rs-far-1 is an important target gene to control R. similis."
https://openalex.org/W1970671670,"Current research suggests that the neuropathology of dementia-including brain changes leading to memory impairment and cognitive decline-is evident years before the onset of this disease. Older adults with cognitive decline have reduced functional independence and quality of life, and are at greater risk for developing dementia. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that can be easily assessed within the clinical setting and predict cognitive decline is important. Early recognition of cognitive decline could promote timely implementation of preventive strategies.We included 89 community-dwelling adults aged 70 years and older in our study, and collected 32 measures of physical function, health status and cognitive function at baseline. We utilized an L1-L2 regularized regression model (elastic net) to identify which of the 32 baseline measures were strongly predictive of cognitive function after one year. We built three linear regression models: 1) based on baseline cognitive function, 2) based on variables consistently selected in every cross-validation loop, and 3) a full model based on all the 32 variables. Each of these models was carefully tested with nested cross-validation.Our model with the six variables consistently selected in every cross-validation loop had a mean squared prediction error of 7.47. This number was smaller than that of the full model (115.33) and the model with baseline cognitive function (7.98). Our model explained 47% of the variance in cognitive function after one year.We built a parsimonious model based on a selected set of six physical function and health status measures strongly predictive of cognitive function after one year. In addition to reducing the complexity of the model without changing the model significantly, our model with the top variables improved the mean prediction error and R-squared. These six physical function and health status measures can be easily implemented in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W1988438304,"Echiura is traditionally regarded as a small phylum of unsegmented spiralian worms. Molecular analyses, however, provide unquestionable evidence that Echiura are derived annelids that lost segmentation. Like annelids, echiurans possess chaetae, a single ventral pair in all species and one or two additional caudal hemi-circles of chaetae in two subgroups, but their evolutionary origin and affiliation to annelid chaetae are unresolved. Since annelids possess segmental pairs of dorsal (notopodial) and ventral (neuropodial) chaetae that are arranged in a row, the ventral chaetae in Echiura either represent a single or a paired neuropodial group of chaetae, while the caudal circle may represent fused rows of chaetae. In annelids, chaetogenesis is generally restricted to the ventral part of the notopodial chaetal sac and to the dorsal part of the neuropodial chaetal sac. We used the exact position of the chaetal formation site in the echiuran species, Thalassema thalassemum (Pallas, 1766) and Echiurus echiurus (Pallas, 1767), to test different hypotheses of the evolution of echiurid chaetae. As in annelids, a single chaetoblast is responsible for chaetogenesis in both species. Each chaeta of the ventral pair arises from its own chaetal sac and possesses a lateral formation site, evidencing that the pair of ventral chaetae in Echiura is homologous to a pair of neuropodia that fused on the ventral side, while the notopodia were reduced. Both caudal hemi-circles of chaetae in Echiurus echiurus are composed of several individual chaetal sacs, each with its own formative site. This finding argues against a homology of these hemi-circles of chaetae and annelids' rows of chaetae and leads to the hypothesis that the caudal chaetal rings evolved once within the Echiura by multiplication of ventral chaetae."

In this study, we report the discovery of novel NDM-1 inhibitors by multi-step virtual screening. From a 2,800,000 virtual drug-like compound library selected from the ZINC database, we generated a focused NDM-1 inhibitor library containing 298 compounds of which 44 chemical compounds were purchased and evaluated experimentally for their ability to inhibit NDM-1 in vitro. Three novel NDM-1 inhibitors with micromolar IC50 values were validated. The most potent inhibitor, VNI-41, inhibited NDM-1 with an IC50 of 29.6 ± 1.3 μM. Molecular dynamic simulation revealed that VNI-41 interacted extensively with the active site. In particular, the sulfonamide group of VNI-41 interacts directly with the metal ion Zn1 that is critical for the catalysis. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying virtual screening methodologies in identifying novel inhibitors for NDM-1, a metallo-β-lactamase with a malleable active site and provide a mechanism base for rational design of NDM-1 inhibitors using sulfonamide as a functional scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W2007966221,"Aim/Purpose of the Study To develop a one-week storage method, without serum and xenobiotics, that would maintain cell viability, morphology, and phenotype of cultured human limbal epithelial sheets. Materials and Methods Human limbal explants were cultured on intact human amniotic membranes for two weeks. The sheets were stored in a hermetically sealed container at 23°C in either a serum-free medium with selected animal serum-derived compounds (Quantum 286) or a xenobiotic-free medium (Minimal Essential Medium) for 4 and 7 days. Stored and non-stored cultures were analyzed for cell viability, amniotic membrane and epithelial sheet thickness, and a panel of immunohistochemical markers for immature cells (ΔNp63α, p63, Bmi-1, C/EBP∂, ABCG2 and K19), differentiated cells (K3 and Cx43), proliferation (PCNA), and apoptosis (Caspase-3). Results The cell viability of the cultures was 98 ± 1% and remained high after storage. Mean central thickness of non-stored limbal epithelial sheets was 23 ± 3 μm, and no substantial loss of cells was observed after storage. The non-stored epithelial sheets expressed a predominantly immature phenotype with ΔNp63α positivity of more than 3% in 9 of 13 cultures. After storage, the expression of ABCG2 and C/EBP∂ was reduced for the 7 day Quantum 286-storage group; (P = 0.04), and Bmi-1 was reduced after 4 day Quantum 286-storage; (P = 0.02). No other markers varied significantly. The expression of differentiation markers was unrelated to the thickness of the epithelia and amniotic membrane, apart from ABCG2, which correlated negatively with thickness of limbal epithelia (R = -0.69, P = 0.01) and ΔNp63α, which correlated negatively with amniotic membrane thickness (R = -0.59, P = 0.03). Conclusion Limbal epithelial cells cultured from explants on amniotic membrane can be stored at 23°C in both serum-free and xenobiotic-free media, with sustained cell viability, ultrastructure, and ΔNp63α-positivity after both 4 and 7 days."
https://openalex.org/W2005433808,"Recent studies suggest that alpine and arctic organisms may have distinctly different phylogeographic histories from temperate or tropical taxa, with recent range contraction into interglacial refugia as opposed to post-glacial expansion out of refugia. We use a combination of phylogeographic inference, demographic reconstructions, and hierarchical Approximate Bayesian Computation to test for phylodemographic concordance among five species of alpine-adapted small mammals in eastern Beringia. These species (Collared Pikas, Hoary Marmots, Brown Lemmings, Arctic Ground Squirrels, and Singing Voles) vary in specificity to alpine and boreal-tundra habitat but share commonalities (e.g., cold tolerance and nunatak survival) that might result in concordant responses to Pleistocene glaciations. All five species contain a similar phylogeographic disjunction separating eastern and Beringian lineages, which we show to be the result of simultaneous divergence. Genetic diversity is similar within each haplogroup for each species, and there is no support for a post-Pleistocene population expansion in eastern lineages relative to those from Beringia. Bayesian skyline plots for four of the five species do not support Pleistocene population contraction. Brown Lemmings show evidence of late Quaternary demographic expansion without subsequent population decline. The Wrangell-St. Elias region of eastern Alaska appears to be an important zone of recent secondary contact for nearctic alpine mammals. Despite differences in natural history and ecology, similar phylogeographic histories are supported for all species, suggesting that these, and likely other, alpine- and arctic-adapted taxa are already experiencing population and/or range declines that are likely to synergistically accelerate in the face of rapid climate change. Climate change may therefore be acting as a double-edged sword that erodes genetic diversity within populations but promotes divergence and the generation of biodiversity."

The regulation of this process remains largely unknown. In most extracellular matrices hyaluronan is not present as a free polysaccharide but often is found in complex with other small proteins and macromolecules such as proteoglycans. This is especially true in cartilage, where hyaluronan assembles into an aggregate structure with the large proteoglycan termed aggrecan. In this study when purified aggrecan was added to FITC-conjugated hyaluronan, no internalization of hyaluronan was detected. This suggested that the overall size of the aggregate prevented hyaluronan endocytosis and furthermore that proteolysis of the aggrecan was a required prerequisite for local, cell-based turnover of hyaluronan. To test this hypothesis, limited C-terminal digestion of aggrecan was performed to determine whether a size range of aggrecan exists that permits hyaluronan endocytosis. Our data demonstrate that only limited degradation of the aggrecan monomer was required to allow for hyaluronan internalization. When hyaluronan was combined with partially degraded, dansyl chloride-labeled aggrecan, blue fluorescent aggrecan was also visualized within intracellular vesicles. It was also determined that sonicated hyaluronan of smaller molecular size was internalized more readily than high molecular mass hyaluronan. However, the addition of intact aggrecan to hyaluronan chains sonicated for 5 and 10 s reblocked their endocytosis, whereas aggregates containing 15-s sonicated hyaluronan were internalized.

We demonstrate that RhoA activity is suppressed in the epicardial progenitor state, that the cAMP-dependent Rap1 GTP exchange factor (GEF), Epac, known to down-regulate RhoA activity through activation of Rap1 GTPase activity increased, that Rap1 activity increased, and that expression of the RhoA antagonistic Rnd proteins known to activate p190RhoGAP increased and associated with p190RhoGAP.

In conclusion, we have identified new signaling molecules that act together to control RhoA activity and play critical roles in the maintenance of coronary smooth muscle progenitor cells in the embryonic epicardium. We suggest that their eventual manipulation could promote revascularization after myocardial injury. Cardiovascular disease is the most prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Importantly, early revascularization of the myocardium is essential for recovery of cardiac function after ischemic injury (1Tang X.L. Rokosh D.G. Guo Y. Bolli R.

Exciting developments support the possibility that the epicardium can serve as a source of vascular progenitors for cell based therapies (1Tang X.L. Rokosh D.G. Guo Y. Bolli R.

Med. 2008; 3: 633-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This is well illustrated in a study showing that thymosin β4 activates adult epicardial derived cells and facilitates a robust and stable neovascularization of the injured adult heart (7Smart N. Risebro C.A. Melville A.A. Moses K. Schwartz R.J. Chien K.R. Riley P.R. Thymosin β4 induces adult epicardial progenitor mobilization and neovascularization.Nature. 2007; 445: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a seminal paper on zebrafish heart regeneration after resection of the ventricular apex showed that mature epicardium can re-express a developmental sequence, undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and promote coronary angiogenesis in the regenerating myocardium (2Zhou B.

Epicardial progenitors contribute to the cardiomyocyte lineage in the developing heart.Nature. 2008; 454: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). However, this has been more difficult to observe in adult mammalian hearts. Most investigators have studied mechanisms that promote epicardial EMT in embryonic hearts as a way to gain insight into factors missing in adult hearts. In the present study we take a different perspective and hypothesize that identification of signaling pathways that play key roles in the formation and maintenance of the embryonic epicardium, a source of vascular progenitor cells, will provide new insights into how EMT is controlled in mature epicardial cells. smooth muscle (SM) cell mesenchymal transition GTPase exchange factor GTP activating protein Rho kinase epicardial/mesothelial cell embryonic epicardial cell proepicardium phosphodiesterase isobutylmethylxanthine protein ligation assay Western blot PDZ-RhoGEF leukemia-associated RhoGEF bovine FGF.

After EMT, epicardial mesothelial cells populate the sub-epicardial space with mesenchymal cells that invade the myocardium to form the coronary SMCs and cardiac fibroblasts (11Dettman R.W.

Cell. 2009; 20: 4751-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have found in adult vascular, airway, and fundus smooth muscle (SM) that cAMP activates the Rap1-GTPase exchange factor (GEF), Epac1, to suppress RhoA activity (19Zieba B.J. Artamonov M.V. Jin L. Momotani K. Ho R. Franke A.S. Neppl R.L. Stevenson A.S. Khromov A.S. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Somlyo A.V.

Chem. 2011; 286: 16681-16692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This cAMP effect is independent of protein kinase A (PKA) activation. Thus, we reasoned that Epac1 activity could contribute to the suppression of RhoA activity to down-regulate EMT, a focus of the present study. Furthermore, the GEFs that exchange GTP for GDP to activate RhoA and drive EMT are unknown in epicardial cells. Conversely, GTP activating proteins (GAPs) hydrolyze GTP to antagonize RhoA activity. Activation of p190RhoGAP has been reported in adult rat epicardial mesothelial cells stimulated with the α4β1 integrin ligand, VCAM-1, to inhibit TGFβ-induced EMT (20Dokic D. Dettman R.W. VCAM-1 inhibits TGFβ stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transformation by modulating Rho activity and stabilizing intercellular adhesion in epicardial mesothelial cells.Dev. Biol. 2006; 299: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but a role for p190RhoGAP in maintaining the epicardial progenitor phenotype has not been explored. Additionally, members of the RhoA family of small GTPases called Rnds, proteins having a constitutively GTP-bound state and known to act as RhoA antagonists (21Chardin P. Function and regulation of Rnd proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and to bind and activate p190RhoGAP (22Wennerberg K. Forget M.A. Ellerbroek S.M. Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Settleman J. Der C.J. Hansen S.H. Rnd proteins function as RhoA antagonists by activating p190 RhoGAP.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1106-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), may also converge to attenuate RhoA signaling in epicardial cells. Rnd3 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas Rnd1 is abundant in brain and liver, and Rnd2 is primarily found in brain and testis (21Chardin P. Function and regulation of Rnd proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Rnd3 has been shown to play an important functional role in uterine SM where its expression is high during midterm pregnancy to depress contractility and falls at the time of delivery, whereas RhoA and ROCK levels increase to enhance contractions and expulsion of the fetus (23Cario-Toumaniantz C. Reillaudoux G. Sauzeau V. Heutte F. Vaillant N. Finet M. Chardin P. Loirand G. Pacaud P.

Expression of Rnds or their role in epicardial cells is unknown. In this study we use outgrowth of epicardial cells from E9.5 isolated mouse proepicardium (PE) explants and from wild type and Epac null E12.5 mouse hearts, adult rat epicardial cells (EMCs) (24Wada A.M. Smith T.K. Osler M.E. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Epicardial/mesothelial cell line retains vasculogenic potential of embryonic epicardium.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and immortalized mouse embryonic epicardial cells (EECs) (25Austin A.F. Compton L.A. Love J.D. Brown C.B. Barnett J.V. Primary and immortalized mouse epicardial cells undergo differentiation in response to TGFβ.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) as model systems to study signaling pathways that maintain the epicardial progenitor state. We confirm the critical role of RhoA activity in driving EMT in embryonic epicardial cells. We present evidence in epicardial cells for the presence of increased Epac/Rap1, Rnds, and p190RhoGAP activities that antagonize RhoA to suppress EMT. We also show up-regulation of the RhoA-specific GEFs p63RhoGEF and GEF-H1, expression, and activity upon growth factor-induced EMT, which is suppressed by partial silencing of these GEFs. Identification of responsible signaling molecules could provide new molecular targets for eventual manipulation of these SM progenitor cells and should be examined in the future for their roles during revascularization after myocardial injury or hypoxia. All animal experiments were performed according to protocols reviewed and approved by the University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in compliance with United States Public Health Service and Department of Agriculture guidelines for laboratory animal welfare. E9.5 mouse embryos were microdissected in ice-cold PBS treated with 2× antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Invitrogen). The chest wall membranes were opened, and the PEs were cut at their base to avoid inclusion of the liver primordium using tungsten needles. Isolated PEs were then placed in a drop of prewarmed complete medium containing M199 supplemented with 1× antibiotic/antimycotic, 30 mm glucose, 5 mm glutamine, 1.25 mm putrescine, 1× insulin transferrin selenium, and 10% fetal bovine serum on glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp.) and incubated at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. E9.5 and E10.5 whole embryonic mouse samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer with 6% sucrose for 24 h followed by a graded EtOH wash (from 50% to 100%). Samples were then dried using AutoSamdri-815 Critical Point Drying Machine and Gold sputter coated in a Bal-Tec Sputter Coater SCD005 apparatus. Images were then taken using a Zeiss Sigma VP HD field emission scanning electron microscope (University of Virginia Advanced Microscopy Facility). The ventricular chambers of hearts from E12.5 mouse embryos were dissected and placed epicardial side down on three-dimensional gels containing 1% type I collagen (BD Biosciences) and incubated in M199 media supplemented with 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 30 mm glucose, 5 mm glutamine, 1.25 mm putrescine, 1% insulin transferrin selenium ITS, and 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h at 37 °C with/without 30 μm 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (subsequently referred to as 007). Migration of epicardial cells from the heart explants into collagen gels, indicative of EMT, was measured after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsing with PBS, then incubation in 5% and 15% sucrose in PBS. The collagen gel around the heart was excised and embedded in Tissue-TEK O.C.T. compound and frozen in liquid N2. 10-mm-thick serial sections were cut at −25 °C at right angles to the surface of the gel. The sections at selected positions relative to the heart were used for counting, with the edge of the heart taken as zero. The selected sections were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min, washed with PBS, and then incubated in PBS with TOPRO (1:40,000) for 15 min followed by a 2 × 10-min wash with PBS. The sections then were imaged with an Olympus confocal microscope (FV300). The total number of cells at the surface and within the collagen gel as well as the number of cells within the gel were counted in each section and expressed as the ratio of the % of cells migrating into the gel to the total number of cells. Migrating cells were taken to represent cells having undergone EMT. The following sources of cells were used depending on the type of assay required: (i) isolated mouse PE E9.5, (ii) cultured PE outgrowth (72 h), (iii) epicardial outgrowth from E12.5 embryonic heart explants, (iv) EECs from the ImmortoMouse carrying a ts large T-antigen, which undergo growth factor-stimulated EMT provided by and well characterized by Dr. Barnett (25Austin A.F. Compton L.A. Love J.D. Brown C.B. Barnett J.V. Primary and immortalized mouse epicardial cells undergo differentiation in response to TGFβ.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and (v) adult rat EMCs (from Dr. Bader), which maintain vasculogenic potential and provide a large number of cells for biochemical assays (24Wada A.M. Smith T.K. Osler M.E. Reese D.E. Bader D.M. Epicardial/mesothelial cell line retains vasculogenic potential of embryonic epicardium.Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). EECs were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactive fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 units/ml of interferon-γ at 33 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. To induce EMT, the cells were treated with 250 pm TGF-β1 (Humanzyme Inc.) at 37 °C for 24–72 h. EECs were treated with Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μm), Epac activator 007 (50 μm), phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor IBMX (10 μm), or PDE4 inhibitor Rolipram (10 μm) for 1 h before and after TGF-β1 treatment. C3 toxin (3–5 μg/ml) was added 15 h before and after TGF-β1 treatment. To evaluate the localization of Rnd3 and p190, EECs were cultured at 33 °C on coverslips overnight. EMCs were grown in DMEM containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 4 mmol/liter l-glutamine with 10% FBS, and 10 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Incubation conditions were 37 °C and 5% CO2. As tubulin and GAPDH were used for normalization before and after treatments with TGF-β1, tubulin and GAPDH protein content/equal number of cells was measured. The number of cells decreased after treatment, and tubulin and GAPDH scaled to this decreased appropriately. The Epac1 targeting vector was constructed by inserting two loxP sites into Exon 1 and Intron 2 that flanked a portion of Exon 1 and Exon 2. A frt-Neo-frt cassette was inserted into Intron 2 for a positive selection marker. The linearized targeting DNA was electroporated into E14Tg2a embryonic stem cells, then selected and expanded at UNC-Chapel Hill Animal Models Core. The recombinant ES cell clones were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and transferred to pseudo-pregnant foster mice. Male chimeras were mated with female C57BL/6 mice, and progenies with germ line transmission (frt-neo/+) were confirmed by PCR. Male chimeric mice were then crossed with female Flpe +/+ mice for excision of Neo cassette, and excision was confirmed by PCR. Heterozygous Epac1 (−/+) mice were obtained by breeding with ZP3-Cre carrier mice (a gift form Ann E. Sutherland, University of Virginia). Epac1 null (−/−) and wild type (+/+) mice were generated from crossing heterozygous mice. Predesigned siRNAs (Ambion Silencer, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) targeting Epac1 and Epac2 have been used. A mix of two different sequences for each Epac isoform (RapGEF3 and RapGEF4) or scrambled siRNA were delivered by electroporation (Amaxa Nucleofector). After transfection EECs were cultured for 48 h under control conditions at 33 °C then transferred to 37 °C and stimulated by TGFβ1 for another 48 h to induce EMT. Efficiency of Epac knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting. Individual PE explants were harvested at the time of surgery (0 h) or after times in culture (12, 24, or 36 h). EECs where used at 33 °C as well as after transfer to 37 °C and after the subsequent addition of 250 pm TGF-β1. Total RNA extraction was completed with TRIzol (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR was carried out as described previously (26Momotani K. Khromov A.S. Miyake T.

For the detection of p190RhoGAP phosphorylation, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a mouse monoclonal anti-p190RhoGAP antibody and then blotted with a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (Cell Signaling Technology). RhoA-GTP was determined by precipitation of active GTP-bound RhoA (RhoA-GTP) with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of the Rho binding domain of the Rho effector Rhotekin (30Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Determination of GTP loading on Rho.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Active Rap-GTP pulldown was done with the GST-fused Ras binding domain of RalGDS (31van Triest M. Bos J.L. Pulldown assays for guanoside 5′-triphosphate-bound Ras-like guanosine 5′-triphosphatases.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 250: 97-102PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-fused RhoA G17A mutant protein associated with glutathione Superflow Resin (Life Technologies) was produced and used to capture active RhoGEFs as described previously (32García-Mata R. Wennerberg K. Arthur W.T. Noren N.K. Ellerbroek S.M. Burridge K. Analysis of activated GAPs and GEFs in cell lysates.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For construction of shRNA vectors, a plasmid-based system was used (33Szulc J. Wiznerowicz M. Sauvain M.O. Trono D. Aebischer P. A versatile tool for conditional gene expression and knockdown.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Six different target sequences specific for rat GEF-H1 protein (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_001012079.1) were selected: 1) GTACCAAGGTCAAGCAGAA; 2) GGAGTCCCTTATTGATGAA; 3) TGAGTGACTTTGAGATGGA; 4) TGAGAACCTTGAAGATTAT; 5) AAAGGGATGTTTCTGATCA; 6) AGACGAAACTGCAGCAGAA. Sequences were first tested for efficacy in HEK293 T cells co-transfected with GEF-H1 and, respectively, with each of the GEF-H1 shRNAs or pLVHTM Empty. As pLVHTM GEF-H1 #1 was the most potent candidate for suppression of GEF-H1, it was used in our study of epicardial cells. To knock down p63RhoGEF, a previously published siRNA sequence (GCCAAGCTGGATGAAGATGAG) was used (28Momotani K. Artamonov M.V. Utepbergenov D. Derewenda U. Derewenda Z.S. Somlyo A.V. p63RhoGEF couples Gαq/11-mediated signaling to Ca2+ sensitization of vascular smooth muscle contractility.Circ. Res. 2011; 109: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). shRNA constructs include GFP for measurement of transfections efficiency. Vectors pLVHTM, pMD2G, and psPAX2 were kind gifts from Dr. Ian Macara at the University of Virginia. Infected cells were left overnight at control conditions (33 °C, 5% CO2) for rest, and knockdown was induced by doxycycline (5 mg/ml). At 48 h cells were transferred to 37 °C and stimulated by TGFβ1 to induce EMT. Cultured cells and isolated PE explants were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and 48 h, respectively. Cells were permeabilized with 0.03% Triton X-100 for 5 min and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm sodium azide and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Samples were quickly rinsed with PBS and then incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies in blocking buffer. All images for a given experiment were acquired under identical laser power and gain settings using an Olympus Fluoview 300 confocal microscope (Olympus). A PLA assay was performed in epicardial cells fixed and assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Olink). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer and probed with primary antibodies in Blocking Buffer. Detection and quantification of the infrared signal were performed using the Odyssey system software (Li-Cor). The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-MYPT1 (1:1000 Western blot (WB); BD Biosciences); anti-RhoA (1:500 WB; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); anti-Rnd3 (1:100 WB; Millipore); anti-Rnd3 (1:400 for immunolabeling; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); anti-p190RhoGAP (1:500 WB and 1:1500 for immunolabeling; BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-SMA (SM α-actin, 1:200 for immunolabeling and 1:1000 for WB; Sigma); GAPDH (1:5000 WB; Millipore); rabbit polyclonal anti-MYPT1 Thr-853 (1:500 WB; Millipore); anti-MYPT1 Thr-696 (1:500 WB; Millipore); anti-E-cadherin (1:200 immunolabeling/1:2000 WB: Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-SM22 (1:200 immunolabeling/1:5000 WB, Millipore); anti-ZO-1 (1:200 immunolabeling/1:1000 WB: Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-LARG (1:100 WB, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); anti-vinculin (1:500 immunolabeling; Sigma); p63RhoGEF (GEFT) (1:200 WB; Proteintech Group Inc.); anti-vimentin (1:200 WB immunolabeling/1:1000 WB; Sigma); anti-Rap1 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); anti-GEF H1 (1:200 WB; Cell Signaling); goat polyclonal anti-Rnd1 (1:2000 WB, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; anti-Epac1 (1:500 WB; Abcam); anti-Epac 2 (1:200 WB; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Primary antibodies used for immunolabeling were visualized by an Alexa Fluor 488-, 594-, or 633-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes). For WBs, primary antibodies were detected using either a goat anti-mouse Alexa 680 (1:10,000, Invitrogen) or a goat anti-rabbit IRDye800 (1:10,000, Rockland Immunochemicals)-conjugated secondary antibody. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance with respect to control was determined using the two-tailed Student's t test (Microsoft Excel). The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.

The patients' clinicopathological information was available. The ultrasound features of 62 tumors from 62 TNBC patients were interpreted. The immunohistochemical results of cytokertain5/6 (CK5/6) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) were used to classify the tumor into basal-like and normal-like groups. The association of the ultrasound features interpreted by experienced ultrasound doctors with the immunohistochemical classification was studied.Of the 62 TNBC cases, 42 (67.7%) exhibited the basal-like phenotype and 20 (32.3%) exhibited the normal-like phenotype based on the immunohistochemical CK5/6 and EGFR markers. Of all the tumors, 90.3% were invasive carcinomas. The basal-like tumors were significantly associated with a maximum diameter on ultrasound of more than 20 mm (36, 85.7%) (P = 0.0014). The normal-like tumors usually exhibited lateral shadows (15, 75%) (P = 0.0115) as well as microlobulated margins (12, 60%) (P = 0.0204) compared to the basal-like subtype. Other ultrasound features showed no significant differences between the two groups.Although ultrasound cannot yet be used to differentiate between the basal-like subtype and normal-like subtype of TNBC, ultrasound can be used to provide some useful information to the clinicians."
https://openalex.org/W2046017943,"The onset of floral development is a pivotal switch in the life of soybean. Brassinosteroids (BRs), a group of steroidal phytohormones with essential roles in plant growth and development, are associated with flowering induction. Genes involved in BR biosynthesis have been studied to a great extent in Arabidopsis, but the study of these genes has been limited in soybean. In this study, four CPD homologs (GmCPDs) catalyzing BR synthesis were isolated from soybean. Transcripts were mainly confined to cotyledons and leaves and were down-regulated in response to exogenous BR. Bioinformatic analysis showed strong sequence and structure similarity between GmCPDs and AtCPD as well as CPDs of other species. Overexpression of GmCPDs in an Arabidopsis BR-deficient mutant rescued the phenotype by restoring the biosynthesis pathway, revealing the functional roles of each GmCPDs in. Except for the rescue of root development, leaf expansion and plant type architecture, GmCPDs in expression also complemented the late flowering phenotype of Arabidopsis mutants deficient in CPD. Further evidence in soybean plants is that the expression levels of GmCPDs in are under photoperiod control in Zigongdongdou, a photoperiod-sensitive variety, and show a sudden peak upon floral meristem initiation. Together with increased GmCPDs in expression in the leaves and cotyledons of photoperiod-insensitive early-maturity soybean, it is clear that GmCPDs in contribute to flowering development and are essential in the early stages of flowering regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2073065883,"Effective therapy for visual loss caused by optic nerve injury or diseases has not been achieved even though the optic nerve has the regeneration potential after injury. This study was designed to modify amniotic epithelial cells (AECs) with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) gene, preliminarily investigating its effect on transected optic nerve.A human bFGF gene segment was delivered into rat AECs (AECs/hbFGF) by lentiviral vector, and the gene expression was examined by RT-PCR and ELISA. The AECs/hbFGF and untransfected rat AECs were transplanted into the transected site of the rat optic nerve. At 28 days post transplantation, the survival and migration of the transplanted cells was observed by tracking labeled cells; meanwhile retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were observed and counted by employing biotin dextran amine (BDA) and Nissl staining. Furthermore, the expression of growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) within the injury site was examined with immunohistochemical staining.The AECs/hbFGF was proven to express bFGF gene and secrete bFGF peptide. Both AECs/hbFGF and AECs could survive and migrate after transplantation. RGCs counting implicated that RGCs numbers of the cell transplantation groups were significantly higher than that of the control group, and the AECs/hbFGF group was significantly higher than that of the AECs group. Moreover GAP-43 integral optical density value in the control group was significantly lower than that of the cell transplantation groups, and the value in the AECs/hbFGF group was significantly higher than that of the AECs group.AECs modified with bFGF could reduce RGCs loss and promote expression of GAP-43 in the rat optic nerve transected model, facilitating the process of neural restoration following injury."
https://openalex.org/W2084751536,"The plant hormone auxin plays a central role in growth and morphogenesis. In shoot apical meristems, auxin flux is polarized through its interplay with PIN proteins. Concentration-based mathematical models of the flux can explain some aspects of phyllotaxis for the L1 surface layer, where auxin accumulation points act as sinks and develop into primordia. The picture differs in the interior of the meristem, where the primordia act as auxin sources, leading to the initiation of the vascular system. Self-organization of the auxin flux involves large numbers of molecules and is difficult to treat by intuitive reasoning alone; mathematical models are therefore vital to understand these phenomena. We consider a leading computational model based on the so-called flux hypothesis. This model has been criticized and extended in various ways. One of the basic counter-arguments is that simulations yield auxin concentrations inside canals that are lower than those seen experimentally. Contrary to what is claimed in the literature, we show that the model can lead to higher concentrations within canals for significant parameter regimes. We then study the model in the usual case where the response function Φ defining the model is quadratic and unbounded, and show that the steady state vascular patterns are formed of loopless directed trees. Moreover, we show that PIN concentrations can diverge in finite time, thus explaining why previous simulation studies introduced cut-offs which force the system to have bounded PIN concentrations. Hence, contrary to previous claims, extreme PIN concentrations are not due to numerical problems but are intrinsic to the model. On the other hand, we show that PIN concentrations remain bounded for bounded Φ, and simulations show that in this case, loops can emerge at steady state."
https://openalex.org/W2027443147,"A theoretical framework of reinforcement learning plays an important role in understanding action selection in animals. Spiking neural networks provide a theoretically grounded means to test computational hypotheses on neurally plausible algorithms of reinforcement learning through numerical simulation. However, most of these models cannot handle observations which are noisy, or occurred in the past, even though these are inevitable and constraining features of learning in real environments. This class of problem is formally known as partially observable reinforcement learning (PORL) problems. It provides a generalization of reinforcement learning to partially observable domains. In addition, observations in the real world tend to be rich and high-dimensional. In this work, we use a spiking neural network model to approximate the free energy of a restricted Boltzmann machine and apply it to the solution of PORL problems with high-dimensional observations. Our spiking network model solves maze tasks with perceptually ambiguous high-dimensional observations without knowledge of the true environment. An extended model with working memory also solves history-dependent tasks. The way spiking neural networks handle PORL problems may provide a glimpse into the underlying laws of neural information processing which can only be discovered through such a top-down approach."
https://openalex.org/W2124170728,"For diseases that infect humans or livestock, transmission dynamics are at least partially dependent on human activity and therefore human behaviour. However, the impact of human behaviour on disease transmission is relatively understudied, especially in the context of heterogeneous contact structures such as described by a social network. Here, we use a strategic game, coupled with a simple disease model, to investigate how strategic agent choices impact the spread of disease over a contact network. Using beliefs that are based on disease status and that build up over time, agents choose actions that stochastically determine disease spread on the network. An agent’s disease status is therefore a function of both his own and his neighbours actions. The effect of disease on agents is modelled by a heterogeneous payoff structure. We find that the combination of network shape and distribution of payoffs has a non-trivial impact on disease prevalence, even if the mean payoff remains the same. An important scenario occurs when a small percentage (called noncooperators) have little incentive to avoid disease. For diseases that are easily acquired when taking a risk, then even when good behavior can lead to disease eradication, a small increase in the percentage of noncooperators (less than 5%) can yield a large (up to 25%) increase in prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W1992518463,"Apolipoprotein (apo)A-IV is a lipid emulsifying protein linked to a range of protective roles in obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It exists in several states in plasma including lipid-bound in HDL and chylomicrons and as monomeric and dimeric lipid-free/poor forms. Our recent x-ray crystal structure of the central domain of apoA-IV shows that it adopts an elongated helical structure that dimerizes via two long reciprocating helices. A striking feature is the alignment of conserved proline residues across the dimer interface. We speculated that this plays important roles in the structure of the lipid-free protein and its ability to bind lipid. Here we show that the systematic conversion of these prolines to alanine increased the thermodynamic stability of apoA-IV and its propensity to oligomerize. Despite the structural stabilization, we noted an increase in the ability to bind and reorganize lipids and to promote cholesterol efflux from cells. The novel properties of these mutants allowed us to isolate the first trimeric form of an exchangeable apolipoprotein and characterize it by small-angle x-ray scattering and chemical cross-linking. The results suggest that the reciprocating helix interaction is a common feature of all apoA-IV oligomers. We propose a model of how self-association of apoA-IV can result in spherical lipoprotein particles, a model that may have broader applications to other exchangeable apolipoprotein family members."
https://openalex.org/W1969640955,"Objective To compare the time from entry into care for HIV infection until combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) initiation between migrants and non migrants in France, excluding late access to care. Methods Antiretroviral-naïve HIV-1-infected individuals newly enrolled in the FHDH cohort between 2002–2010, with CD4 cell counts &gt;200/μL and no previous or current AIDS events were included. In three baseline CD4 cell count strata (200–349, 350-499, ≥500/μL), we examined the crude time until cART initiation within three years after enrolment according to geographic origin, and multivariable hazard ratios according to geographic origin, gender and HIV-transmission group, with adjustment for baseline age, enrolment period, region of care, plasma viral load, and HBV/HBC coinfection. Results Among 13338 individuals, 9605 (72.1%) were French natives (FRA), 2873 (21.4%) were migrants from sub-Saharan Africa/non-French West Indies (SSA/NFW), and 860 (6.5%) were migrants from other countries. Kaplan-Meier probabilities of cART initiation were significantly lower in SSA/NFW than in FRA individuals throughout the study period, regardless of the baseline CD4 stratum. After adjustment, the likelihood of cART initiation was respectively 15% (95%CI, 1–28) and 20% (95%CI, 2–38) lower in SSA/NFW men than in FRA men who had sex with men (MSM) in the 350-499 and ≥500 CD4 strata, while no difference was observed between other migrant groups and FRA MSM. Conclusion SSA/NFW migrant men living in France with CD4 &gt;350/μL at entry into care are more likely to begin cART later than FRA MSM, despite free access to treatment. Administrative delays in obtaining healthcare coverage do not appear to be responsible."
https://openalex.org/W2020000843,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission routes can be estimated from genotypic analysis of clinical isolates from patients. In Japan, still a middle-incidence country of TB, a unique genotype strain designated as ‘M-strain’ has been isolated nationwide recently. To ascertain the history of the wide spread of the strain, 10 clinical isolates from different areas were subjected to genome-wide analysis based on deep sequencers. Results show that all isolates possessed common mutations to those of referential strains. The greatest number of accumulated single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from the oldest coalescence was 13 nucleotides, indicating high clonality of these isolates. When an SNV common to the isolates was used as a surrogate marker of the clone, authentic clonal isolates with variation in a reliable subset of variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genotyping method can be selected successfully from clinical isolates populations of M. tuberculosis. When the authentic clones can also be assigned to sub-clonal groups by SNVs derived from the genomic comparison, they are classifiable into three sub-clonal groups with a bias of geographical origins. Feedback from genomic analysis of clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis to genotypic markers will be an efficient strategy for the big data in various settings for public health actions against TB."
https://openalex.org/W2090452815,"Creationism is a religiously motivated worldview in denial of biological evolution that has been very resistant to change. We performed a textual analysis by examining creationist and pro-evolutionary texts for aspects of “experiential thinking”, a cognitive process different from scientific thought. We observed characteristics of experiential thinking as follows: testimonials (present in 100% of sampled creationist texts), such as quotations, were a major form of proof. Confirmation bias (100% of sampled texts) was represented by ignoring or dismissing information that would contradict the creationist hypothesis. Scientifically irrelevant or flawed information was re-interpreted as relevant for the falsification of evolution (75–90% of sampled texts). Evolutionary theory was associated to moral issues by demonizing scientists and linking evolutionary theory to atrocities (63–93% of sampled texts). Pro-evolutionary rebuttals of creationist claims also contained testimonials (93% of sampled texts) and referred to moral implications (80% of sampled texts) but displayed lower prevalences of stereotypical thinking (47% of sampled texts), confirmation bias (27% of sampled texts) and pseudodiagnostics (7% of sampled texts). The aspects of experiential thinking could also be interpreted as argumentative fallacies. Testimonials lead, for instance, to ad hominem and appeals to authorities. Confirmation bias and simplification of data give rise to hasty generalizations and false dilemmas. Moral issues lead to guilt by association and appeals to consequences. Experiential thinking and fallacies can contribute to false beliefs and the persistence of the claims. We propose that science educators would benefit from the systematic analysis of experiential thinking patterns and fallacies in creationist texts and pro-evolutionary rebuttals in order to concentrate on scientific misconceptions instead of the scientifically irrelevant aspects of the creationist—evolutionist debate."
https://openalex.org/W2097117088,"Microscopic peculiarities stemming from a temperature increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue (sWAT) after applying a radio-frequency (RF) current, must be strongly dependent on the type of sWAT. This effect is connected with different electrical conductivities of pathways inside (triglycerides in adipocytes) and outside (extra-cellular matrix) the cells and to the different weighting of these pathways in hypertrophic and hyperplastic types of sWAT. The application of the RF current to hypertrophic sWAT, which normally has a strongly developed extracellular matrix with high concentrations of hyaluronan and collagen in a peri-cellular space of adipocytes, can produce, micro-structurally, a highly inhomogeneous temperature distribution, characterized by strong temperature gradients between the peri-cellular sheath of the extra-cellular matrix around the hypertrophic adipocytes and their volumes. In addition to normal temperature effects, which are generally considered in body contouring, these temperature gradients can produce thermo-mechanical stresses on the cells’ surfaces. Whereas these stresses are relatively small under normal conditions and cannot cause any direct fracturing or damage of the cell structure, these stresses can, under some supportive conditions, be theoretically increased by several orders of magnitude, causing the thermo-mechanical cell damage. This effect cannot be realized in sWAT of normal or hyperplastic types where the peri-cellular structures are under-developed. It is concluded that the results of RF application in body contouring procedures must be strongly dependent on the morphological structure of sWAT."
https://openalex.org/W2122109756,"Posttraumatic stress (PTS) is common in survivors from life-threatening events. Little is known, however, about the course of PTS after life threat in the absence of collateral stressors (e.g., bereavement, social stigma, property loss) and there is a scarcity of studies about PTS in the long term. This study assessed the short- and long-term course of PTS, and the influence of gender, education and age on the level and course of PTS, in survivors from a non-fatal airliner emergency landing caused by engine failure at an altitude of 1 km. There were 129 persons on board. A survey including the Impact of Event Scale was distributed to 106 subjects after 1 month, 4 months, 14 months, and 25 months, and to 95 subjects after 19 years (response rates 64–83%). There were initially high levels of PTS. The majority of changes in PTS occurred from 1 to 4 months after the event. There were small changes from 4 to 25 months but further decrease in PTS thereafter. Female gender was associated with higher levels of PTS whereas gender was unrelated to the slope of the short- and long-term trajectories. Higher education was related to a quicker recovery although not to initial or long-term PTS. Age was not associated with PTS. The present findings suggest that a life-threatening experience without collateral stressors may produce high levels of acute posttraumatic stress, yet with a benign prognosis. The findings further implicate that gender is unrelated to trajectories of recovery in the context of highly similar exposure and few collateral stressors."
