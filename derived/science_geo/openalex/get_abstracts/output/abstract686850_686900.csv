https://openalex.org/W4200391585,"The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant suggests that the virus might become globally dominant. Further, the high number of mutations in the viral spike protein raised concerns that the virus might evade antibodies induced by infection or vaccination. Here, we report that the Omicron spike was resistant against most therapeutic antibodies but remained susceptible to inhibition by sotrovimab. Similarly, the Omicron spike evaded neutralization by antibodies from convalescent patients or individuals vaccinated with the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2) with 12- to 44-fold higher efficiency than the spike of the Delta variant. Neutralization of the Omicron spike by antibodies induced upon heterologous ChAdOx1 (Astra Zeneca-Oxford)/BNT162b2 vaccination or vaccination with three doses of BNT162b2 was more efficient, but the Omicron spike still evaded neutralization more efficiently than the Delta spike. These findings indicate that most therapeutic antibodies will be ineffective against the Omicron variant and that double immunization with BNT162b2 might not adequately protect against severe disease induced by this variant."

We describe COVID-19 vaccine uptake and SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women in Scotland, using whole-population data from a national, prospective cohort. Between the start of a COVID-19 vaccine program in Scotland, on 8 December 2020 and 31 October 2021, 25,917 COVID-19 vaccinations were given to 18,457 pregnant women. Vaccine coverage was substantially lower in pregnant women than in the general female population of 18-44 years; 32.3% of women giving birth in October 2021 had two doses of vaccine compared to 77.4% in all women. The extended perinatal mortality rate for women who gave birth within 28 d of a COVID-19 diagnosis was 22.6 per 1,000 births (95% CI 12.9-38.5; pandemic background rate 5.6 per 1,000 births; 452 out of 80,456; 95% CI 5.1-6.2). Overall, 77.4% (3,833 out of 4,950; 95% CI 76.2-78.6) of SARS-CoV-2 infections, 90.9% (748 out of 823; 95% CI 88.7-92.7) of SARS-CoV-2 associated with hospital admission and 98% (102 out of 104; 95% CI 92.5-99.7) of SARS-CoV-2 associated with critical care admission, as well as all baby deaths, occurred in pregnant women who were unvaccinated at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Addressing low vaccine uptake rates in pregnant women is imperative to protect the health of women and babies in the ongoing pandemic."

https://openalex.org/W4206697524,"Severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occur in up to 60% of patients with melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). However, it is unknown whether a common baseline immunological state precedes irAE development. Here we applied mass cytometry by time of flight, single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell V(D)J sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing and bulk T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to study peripheral blood samples from patients with melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy or anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 combination ICIs. By analyzing 93 pre- and early on-ICI blood samples and 3 patient cohorts (n = 27, 26 and 18), we found that 2 pretreatment factors in circulation-activated CD4 memory T cell abundance and TCR diversity-are associated with severe irAE development regardless of organ system involvement. We also explored on-treatment changes in TCR clonality among patients receiving combination therapy and linked our findings to the severity and timing of irAE onset. These results demonstrate circulating T cell characteristics associated with ICI-induced toxicity, with implications for improved diagnostics and clinical management."

https://openalex.org/W4207066074,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise for diagnosing prostate cancer in biopsies. However, results have been limited to individual studies, lacking validation in multinational settings. Competitions have been shown to be accelerators for medical imaging innovations, but their impact is hindered by lack of reproducibility and independent validation. With this in mind, we organized the PANDA challenge-the largest histopathology competition to date, joined by 1,290 developers-to catalyze development of reproducible AI algorithms for Gleason grading using 10,616 digitized prostate biopsies. We validated that a diverse set of submitted algorithms reached pathologist-level performance on independent cross-continental cohorts, fully blinded to the algorithm developers. On United States and European external validation sets, the algorithms achieved agreements of 0.862 (quadratically weighted Îº, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.840-0.884) and 0.868 (95% CI, 0.835-0.900) with expert uropathologists. Successful generalization across different patient populations, laboratories and reference standards, achieved by a variety of algorithmic approaches, warrants evaluating AI-based Gleason grading in prospective clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W4206995206,"HIV-1-infected cells that persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) are frequently considered ""transcriptionally silent,"" but active viral gene expression may occur in some cells, challenging the concept of viral latency. Applying an assay for profiling the transcriptional activity and the chromosomal locations of individual proviruses, we describe a global genomic and epigenetic map of transcriptionally active and silent proviral species and evaluate their longitudinal evolution in persons receiving suppressive ART. Using genome-wide epigenetic reference data, we show that proviral transcriptional activity is associated with activating epigenetic chromatin features in linear proximity of integration sites and in their inter- and intrachromosomal contact regions. Transcriptionally active proviruses were actively selected against during prolonged ART; however, this pattern was violated by large clones of virally infected cells that may outcompete negative selection forces through elevated intrinsic proliferative activity. Our results suggest that transcriptionally active proviruses are dynamically evolving under selection pressure by host factors."
https://openalex.org/W4206379059,"The disialoganglioside GD2 is overexpressed on several solid tumors, and monoclonal antibodies targeting GD2 have substantially improved outcomes for children with high-risk neuroblastoma. However, approximately 40% of patients with neuroblastoma still relapse, and anti-GD2 has not mediated significant clinical activity in any other GD2+ malignancy. Macrophages are important mediators of anti-tumor immunity, but tumors resist macrophage phagocytosis through expression of the checkpoint molecule CD47, a so-called 'Don't eat me' signal. In this study, we establish potent synergy for the combination of anti-GD2 and anti-CD47 in syngeneic and xenograft mouse models of neuroblastoma, where the combination eradicates tumors, as well as osteosarcoma and small-cell lung cancer, where the combination significantly reduces tumor burden and extends survival. This synergy is driven by two GD2-specific factors that reorient the balance of macrophage activity. Ligation of GD2 on tumor cells (a) causes upregulation of surface calreticulin, a pro-phagocytic 'Eat me' signal that primes cells for removal and (b) interrupts the interaction of GD2 with its newly identified ligand, the inhibitory immunoreceptor Siglec-7. This work credentials the combination of anti-GD2 and anti-CD47 for clinical translation and suggests that CD47 blockade will be most efficacious in combination with monoclonal antibodies that alter additional pro- and anti-phagocytic signals within the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W4206699848,"Abstract The OAS1/2/3 cluster has been identified as a risk locus for severe COVID-19 among individuals of European ancestry, with a protective haplotype of approximately 75 kilobases (kb) derived from Neanderthals in the chromosomal region 12q24.13. This haplotype contains a splice variant of OAS1 , which occurs in people of African ancestry independently of gene flow from Neanderthals. Using trans-ancestry fine-mapping approaches in 20,779 hospitalized cases, we demonstrate that this splice variant is likely to be the SNP responsible for the association at this locus, thus strongly implicating OAS1 as an effector gene influencing COVID-19 severity."
https://openalex.org/W4205786643,"Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are receptors for antigen that direct potent immune responses. Tumor escape associated with low target antigen expression is emerging as one potential limitation of their efficacy. Here we edit the TRAC locus in human peripheral blood T cells to engage cell-surface targets through their T cell receptor-CD3 complex reconfigured to utilize the same immunoglobulin heavy and light chains as a matched CAR. We demonstrate that these HLA-independent T cell receptors (HIT receptors) consistently afford high antigen sensitivity and mediate tumor recognition beyond what CD28-based CARs, the most sensitive design to date, can provide. We demonstrate that the functional persistence of HIT T cells can be augmented by constitutive coexpression of CD80 and 4-1BBL. Finally, we validate the increased antigen sensitivity afforded by HIT receptors in xenograft mouse models of B cell leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, targeting CD19 and CD70, respectively. Overall, HIT receptors are well suited for targeting cell surface antigens of low abundance."
https://openalex.org/W4205734592,"Abstract Guided by gut sensory cues, humans and animals prefer nutritive sugars over non-caloric sweeteners, but how the gut steers such preferences remains unknown. In the intestine, neuropod cells synapse with vagal neurons to convey sugar stimuli to the brain within seconds. Here, we found that cholecystokinin (CCK)-labeled duodenal neuropod cells differentiate and transduce luminal stimuli from sweeteners and sugars to the vagus nerve using sweet taste receptors and sodium glucose transporters. The two stimulus types elicited distinct neural pathways: while sweetener stimulated purinergic neurotransmission, sugar stimulated glutamatergic neurotransmission. To probe the contribution of these cells to behavior, we developed optogenetics for the gut lumen by engineering a flexible fiberoptic. We showed that preference for sugar over sweetener in mice depends on neuropod cell glutamatergic signaling. By swiftly discerning the precise identity of nutrient stimuli, gut neuropod cells serve as the entry point to guide nutritive choices."
https://openalex.org/W4206977000,"SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells is initiated by the binding of the viral Spike protein to its cell-surface receptor ACE2. We conducted a targeted CRISPRi screen to uncover druggable pathways controlling Spike protein binding to human cells. Here we show that the protein BRD2 is required for ACE2 transcription in human lung epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and BRD2 inhibitors currently evaluated in clinical trials potently block endogenous ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells, including those of human nasal epithelia. Moreover, pharmacological BRD2 inhibition with the drug ABBV-744 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Syrian hamsters. We also found that BRD2 controls transcription of several other genes induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the interferon response, which in turn regulates the antiviral response. Together, our results pinpoint BRD2 as a potent and essential regulator of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight the potential of BRD2 as a therapeutic target for COVID-19. Samelson et al. report that BRD2 inhibition suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infection in epithelial cells and Syrian hamsters via reducing the transcription of host cell surface receptor ACE2."
https://openalex.org/W4206035175,"Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (VEGFR2, also known as KDR and FLK1) signalling in endothelial cells (ECs) is essential for developmental and reparative angiogenesis. Reactive oxygen species and copper (Cu) are also involved in these processes. However, their inter-relationship is poorly understood. Evidence of the role of the endothelial Cu importer CTR1 (also known as SLC31A1) in VEGFR2 signalling and angiogenesis in vivo is lacking. Here, we show that CTR1 functions as a redox sensor to promote angiogenesis in ECs. CTR1-depleted ECs showed reduced VEGF-induced VEGFR2 signalling and angiogenic responses. Mechanistically, CTR1 was rapidly sulfenylated at Cys189 at its cytosolic C terminus after stimulation with VEGF, which induced CTR1âVEGFR2 disulfide bond formation and their co-internalization to early endosomes, driving sustained VEGFR2 signalling. In vivo, EC-specific Ctr1-deficient mice or CRISPRâCas9-generated redox-dead Ctr1(C187A)-knockin mutant mice had impaired developmental and reparative angiogenesis. Thus, oxidation of CTR1 at Cys189 promotes VEGFR2 internalization and signalling to enhance angiogenesis. Our study uncovers an important mechanism for sensing reactive oxygen species through CTR1 to drive neovascularization. Das et al. show that the copper transporter CTR1 functions as a redox sensor in endothelial cells. CTR1 is modified after redox stress, which induces CTR1âVEGFR2 complex formation and promotes VEGFR2 signalling and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4207013817,"The efficacy of poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 inhibition (PARPi) in BRCA1-deficient cells depends on 53BP1 and shieldin, which have been proposed to limit single-stranded DNA at double-strand breaks (DSBs) by blocking resection and/or through CST-PolÎ±-primase-mediated fill-in. We show that primase (like 53BP1-shieldin and CST-PolÎ±) promotes radial chromosome formation in PARPi-treated BRCA1-deficient cells and demonstrate shieldin-CST-PolÎ±-primase-dependent incorporation of BrdU at DSBs. In the absence of 53BP1 or shieldin, radial formation in BRCA1-deficient cells was restored by the tethering of CST near DSBs, arguing that in this context, shieldin acts primarily by recruiting CST. Furthermore, a SHLD1 mutant defective in CST binding (SHLD1Î) was non-functional in BRCA1-deficient cells and its function was restored after reconnecting SHLD1Î to CST. Interestingly, at dysfunctional telomeres and at DNA breaks in class switch recombination where CST has been implicated, SHLD1Î was fully functional, perhaps because these DNA ends carry CST recognition sites that afford SHLD1-independent binding of CST. These data establish that in BRCA1-deficient cells, CST-PolÎ±-primase is the major effector of shieldin-dependent DSB processing."
https://openalex.org/W4226269440,"Screening programs must balance the benefit of early detection with the cost of overscreening. Here, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for personalized screening, Tempo, and demonstrate its efficacy in the context of breast cancer. We trained our risk-based screening policies on a large screening mammography dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH; USA) and validated this dataset in held-out patients from MGH and external datasets from Emory University (Emory; USA), Karolinska Institute (Karolinska; Sweden) and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH; Taiwan). Across all test sets, we find that the Tempo policy combined with an image-based artificial intelligence (AI) risk model is significantly more efficient than current regimens used in clinical practice in terms of simulated early detection per screen frequency. Moreover, we show that the same Tempo policy can be easily adapted to a wide range of possible screening preferences, allowing clinicians to select their desired trade-off between early detection and screening costs without training new policies. Finally, we demonstrate that Tempo policies based on AI-based risk models outperform Tempo policies based on less accurate clinical risk models. Altogether, our results show that pairing AI-based risk models with agile AI-designed screening policies has the potential to improve screening programs by advancing early detection while reducing overscreening."
https://openalex.org/W4205254628,"Heavy metals are both integral parts of cells and environmental toxicants, and their deregulation is associated with severe cellular dysfunction and various diseases. Here we show that the Hippo pathway plays a critical role in regulating heavy metal homeostasis. Hippo signalling deficiency promotes the transcription of heavy metal response genes and protects cells from heavy metal-induced toxicity, a process independent of its classic downstream effectors YAP and TAZ. Mechanistically, the Hippo pathway kinase LATS phosphorylates and inhibits MTF1, an essential transcription factor in the heavy metal response, resulting in the loss of heavy metal response gene transcription and cellular protection. Moreover, LATS activity is inhibited following heavy metal treatment, where accumulated zinc directly binds and inhibits LATS. Together, our study reveals an interplay between the Hippo pathway and heavy metals, providing insights into this growth-related pathway in tissue homeostasis and stress response."
https://openalex.org/W4205518863,"In this review paper, we are interested in the models and algorithms that allow generic simulation and control of a soft robot. First, we start with a quick overview of modeling approaches for soft robots and available methods for calculating the mechanical compliance, and in particular numerical methods, like real-time Finite Element Method (FEM). We also show how these models can be updated based on sensor data. Then, we are interested in the problem of inverse kinematics, under constraints, with generic solutions without assumption on the robot shape, the type, the placement or the redundancy of the actuators, the material behaviorâ¦ We are also interested by the use of these models and algorithms in case of contact with the environment. Moreover, we refer to dynamic control algorithms based on mechanical models, allowing for robust control of the positioning of the robot. For each of these aspects, this paper gives a quick overview of the existing methods and a focus on the use of FEM. Finally, we discuss the implementation and our contribution in the field for an open soft robotics research."

https://openalex.org/W4206527354,"Ubiquitin (Ub) chain types govern distinct biological processes. K48-linked polyUb chains target substrates for proteasomal degradation, but the mechanism of Ub chain synthesis remains elusive due to the transient nature of Ub handover. Here, we present the structure of a chemically trapped complex of the E2 UBE2K covalently linked to donor Ub and acceptor K48-linked di-Ub, primed for K48-linked Ub chain synthesis by a RING E3. The structure reveals the basis for acceptor Ub recognition by UBE2K active site residues and the C-terminal Ub-associated (UBA) domain, to impart K48-linked Ub specificity and catalysis. Furthermore, the structure unveils multiple Ub-binding surfaces on the UBA domain that allow distinct binding modes for K48- and K63-linked Ub chains. This multivalent Ub-binding feature serves to recruit UBE2K to ubiquitinated substrates to overcome weak acceptor Ub affinity and thereby promote chain elongation. These findings elucidate the mechanism of processive K48-linked polyUb chain formation by UBE2K."
https://openalex.org/W4206705514,"Satellite cells (SCs) are stem cells responsible for post-hatch muscle growth through hypertrophy and in birds are sensitive to thermal stress during the first week after hatch. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which is highly responsive to thermal stress in differentiating turkey pectoralis major (p. major) muscle SCs, regulates protein synthesis and the activities of SCs through a downstream effector, S6 kinase (S6K). The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the effect of heat (43Â°C) and cold (33Â°C) stress on activity of the mTOR/S6K pathway in SCs isolated from the p. major muscle of one-week-old faster-growing modern commercial (NC) turkeys compared to those from slower-growing Randombred Control Line 2 (RBC2) turkeys, and 2) to assess the effect of mTOR knockdown on the proliferation, differentiation, and expression of myogenic regulatory factors of the SCs. Heat stress increased phosphorylation of both mTOR and S6K in both turkey lines, with greater increases observed in the RBC2 line. With cold stress, greater reductions in mTOR and S6K phosphorylation were observed in the NC line. Early knockdown of mTOR decreased proliferation, differentiation, and expression of myoblast determination protein 1 and myogenin in both lines independent of temperature, with the RBC2 line showing greater reductions in proliferation and differentiation than the NC line at 38Â° and 43Â°C. Proliferating SCs are more dependent on mTOR/S6K-mediated regulation than differentiating SCs. Thus, thermal stress can affect breast muscle hypertrophic potential by changing satellite cell proliferation and differentiation, in part, through the mTOR/S6K pathway in a growth-dependent manner. These changes may result in irreversible effects on the development and growth of the turkey p. major muscle."
https://openalex.org/W4205671364,"A new methodology, imputation by feature importance (IBFI), is studied that can be applied to any machine learning method to efficiently fill in any missing or irregularly sampled data. It applies to data missing completely at random (MCAR), missing not at random (MNAR), and missing at random (MAR). IBFI utilizes the feature importance and iteratively imputes missing values using any base learning algorithm. For this work, IBFI is tested on soil radon gas concentration (SRGC) data. XGBoost is used as the learning algorithm and missing data are simulated using R for different missingness scenarios. IBFI is based on the physically meaningful assumption that SRGC depends upon environmental parameters such as temperature and relative humidity. This assumption leads to a model obtained from the complete multivariate series where the controls are available by taking the attribute of interest as a response variable. IBFI is tested against other frequently used imputation methods, namely mean, median, mode, predictive mean matching (PMM), and hot-deck procedures. The performance of the different imputation methods was assessed using root mean squared error (RMSE), mean squared log error (MSLE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), percent bias (PB), and mean squared error (MSE) statistics. The imputation process requires more attention when multiple variables are missing in different samples, resulting in challenges to machine learning methods because some controls are missing. IBFI appears to have an advantage in such circumstances. For testing IBFI, Radon Time Series Data (RTS) has been used and data was collected from 1st March 2017 to the 11th of May 2018, including 4 seismic activities that have taken place during the data collection time."
https://openalex.org/W4206795715,"The accumulation of emerging pollutants in the environment remains a major concern as evidenced by the increasing number of reports citing their potential risk on environment and health. Hence, removal strategies of such pollutants remain an active area of investigation. One way through which emerging pollutants can be eliminated from the environment is by enzyme-mediated bioremediation. Enzyme-based degradation can be further enhanced via advanced protein engineering approaches. In the present study a sensitive and robust bioanalytical liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS)-based approach was used to investigate the ability of a fungal dye decolorizing peroxidase 4 (DyP4) and two of its evolved variants-that were previously shown to be H2O2 tolerant-to degrade a panel of 15 different emerging pollutants. Additionally, the role of a redox mediator was examined in these enzymatic degradation reactions. Our results show that three emerging pollutants (2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), paracetamol, and furosemide) were efficiently degraded by DyP4. Addition of the redox mediator had a synergistic effect as it enabled complete degradation of three more emerging pollutants (methyl paraben, sulfamethoxazole and salicylic acid) and dramatically reduced the time needed for the complete degradation of MBT, paracetamol, and furosemide. Further investigation was carried out using pure MBT to study its degradation by DyP4. Five potential transformation products were generated during the enzymatic degradation of MBT, which were previously reported to be produced during different bioremediation approaches. The current study provides the first instance of the application of fungal DyP4 peroxidases in bioremediation of emerging pollutants."
https://openalex.org/W4205228059,"Atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of mortality worldwide, characterized by the development of endothelial cell dysfunction, increased oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake by macrophages, and the ensuing formation of atherosclerotic plaque. Local blood flow patterns cause uneven atherosclerotic lesion distribution, and endothelial dysfunction caused by disturbed flow is an early step in the development of atherosclerosis. The present research aims to elucidate the mechanism underlying the regulation of Neuropilin 2 (NRP2) under low shear stress (LSS) in the atheroprone phenotype of endothelial cells. We observed that NRP2 expression was significantly upregulated in LSS-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in mouse aortic endothelial cells. Knockdown of NRP2 in HUVECs significantly ameliorated cell apoptosis induced by LSS. Conversely, overexpression of NRP2 had the opposite effect on HUVEC apoptosis. Animal experiments suggest that NRP2 knockdown markedly mitigated the development of atherosclerosis in Apoe-/- mice. Mechanistically, NRP2 knockdown and overexpression regulated PARP1 protein expression in the condition of LSS, which in turn affected the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Moreover, the upstream transcription factor GATA2 was found to regulate NRP2 expression in the progression of atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that NRP2 plays an essential proatherosclerotic role through the regulation of cell apoptosis, and the results reveal that NRP2 is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerotic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4205390123,"Brucellae are intracellular sneaky bacteria and they can elude the host's defensive mechanisms, resulting in therapeutic failure. Therefore, the goal of this investigation was to rapid identification of Brucella species collected from animals and humans in Saudi Arabia, as well as to evaluate their resistance to antibiotics. On selective media, 364 animal samples as well as 70 human blood samples were cultured. Serological and biochemical approaches were initially used to identify a total of 25 probable cultured isolates. The proteomics of Brucella species were identified using the MALDI Biotyper (MBT) system, which was subsequently verified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) and microfluidic electrophoresis assays. Both Brucella melitensis (B. melitensis) and Brucella abortus (B. abortus) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using Kirby Bauer method and the E-test. In total, 25 samples were positive for Brucella and included 11 B. melitensis and 14 B. abortus isolates. Twenty-two out of 25 (88%) and 24/25 (96%) of Brucella strains were recognized through the Vitek 2 Compact system. While MBT was magnificently identified 100% of the strains at the species level with a score value more than or equal to 2.00. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampin, ampicillin-sulbactam, and ampicillin resistance in B. melitensis was 36.36%, 31.82%, 27.27%, and 22.70%, respectively. Rifampin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin-sulbactam resistance was found in 35.71%, 32.14%, 32.14%, and 28.57% of B. abortus isolates, correspondingly. MBT confirmed by microfluidic electrophoresis is a successful approach for identifying Brucella species at the species level. The resistance of B. melitensis and B. abortus to various antibiotics should be investigated in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4205661742,"Toxoplasma gondii, one of the most common parasites, causes toxoplasmosis, one of the most frequent zoonotic diseases worldwide. T. gondii infects about one-third of the world's population. T. gondii infection is generally considered a major risk for spontaneous abortion, prematurity and low birth weight in the animal sphere. Less commonly, a toxoplasma serological profile is correlated with the particular data of delivery. Acute T. gondii infection during pregnancy often leads to spontaneous abortion and/or a severe injury of the eyes, brain, and other structures of the foetus. Latent T. gondii infection of pregnant women could lead to less obvious but important changes during pregnancy, including the end product of pregnancy and the timing of labour. This study aimed to contribute to the current knowledge by comparing serological T. gondii profiles of pregnant women with prematurity and low birth weights of newborns.A retrospective study design was adopted. The study participants included a cohort of 1733 pregnant women who consecutively gave birth to their children and underwent regular antenatal biochemical screening between the 14th and 16th weeks of pregnancy. Prematurity was defined as the liveborn preterm delivery in gestational age of pregnancy <37 weeks. Low birth weight was defined as weight at birth of â¤2499 grams. The complement-fixation test (CFT) provided serological profiles for toxoplasmosis that expresses the overall levels of toxoplasma immunoglobulins of all classes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests for IgG and IgM were used simultaneously. IgM positivity helped to differentiate acute from the latent stage of toxoplasmosis. Birth data, especially the week of delivery and fetal weight, were evaluated accordingly.Of the 1733 pregnant women, 25% were diagnosed as latent toxoplasma positive, and 75% as toxoplasma negative. There were 87 premature deliveries versus 1646 timely births. We observed 88 low birth weights and 1645 normal fetal weights. We found a statistically significant association between latent toxoplasmosis and prematurity, Ï2(1) = 5.471, p = .019 and between latent toxoplasmosis and low birth weight of newborns, Ï2(1) = 7.663, p = .006. There was a 1.707 times higher risk of prematurity for toxoplasma-positive women, while the risk for low birth weight was 1.861 times higher. The strength of both tests of association was mild. We tested the correlation between the levels of CFT titres and week of delivery and weight of newborns. No association was found between the level of latent toxoplasmosis and the week of delivery and fetal weight.Latent toxoplasmosis was associated with premature birth rate and lower birth weight of newborns. The odds of premature delivery was 1.7 and low birth weight 1.9 times higher in women with latent toxoplasmosis compared to toxoplasma negative women. Even though the strength of the association in our large sample is relatively mild, the combination of latent toxoplasmosis with other adverse factors could cause serious harm. Whole CFT and specific IgG levels of latent toxoplasmosis are not linked to the severity of prematurity or low birth weight in newborns."
https://openalex.org/W4205704934,"This paper re-examines the relationships between night-time light (NTL) and gross domestic product (GDP), population, road networks, and carbon emissions in China and India. Two treatments are carried out to those factors and NTL, which include simple summation in each administrative region (total data), and summation normalized by region area (density data). A series of univariate regression and multiple regression experiments are conducted in different countries and at different scales, in order to find the changes in the relationship between NTL and every parameter in different situations. Several statistical metrics, such as R2, Mean Relative Error (MRE), multiple regression weight coefficient, and Pearson's correlation coefficient are given special attention. We found that GDP, as a comprehensive indicator, is more representative of NTL when the administrative region is relatively comprehensive or highly developed. However, when these regions are unbalanced or undeveloped, the representation of GDP becomes weak and other factors can have a more important influence on the multiple regression. Differences in the relationship between NTL and GDP in China and India can also be reflected in some other factors. In many cases, regression after normalization with the administrative area has a higher R2 value than the total regression. But it is highly influenced by a few highly developed regions like Beijing in China or Chandigarh in India. After the scale of the administrative region becomes fragmented, it is necessary to adjust the model to make the regression more meaningful. The relationship between NTL and carbon emissions shows obvious difference between China and India, and among provinces and counties in China, which may be caused by the different electric power generation and transmission in China and India. From these results, we can know how the NTL is reflected by GDP and other factors in different situations, and then we can make some adjustments."

Our objective was to assess associations between socio-demographic and disease-related characteristics, symptom burden and QoL in a sample of cancer patients accessing outpatient services in the Gaza Strip.A cross-sectional, descriptive survey using interviews and medical record review involving patients with cancer accessing oncology outpatient services at Al Rantisi Hospital and European Gaza Hospital (EGH) in the Gaza Strip was employed. Socio-demographic and disease-related data, the Lebanese version of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS-Leb), and the Arabic version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) were collected. Multiple linear regression was used to judge the relative influence of determinants of QoL.Of 414 cancer patients approached, 385 patients consented to participation. The majority were women (64.7%) with a mean age of 52 years (SD = 16.7). Common cancer diagnoses were breast (32.2%), haematological (17.9%) and colorectal (9.1%). The median number of symptoms was 10 (IQR 1.5-18.5). Mean overall QoL was 70.5 (SD 19.9) with common physical and psychological symptoms identified. A higher burden of symptoms was associated with marital status, education and income. Limited access to both opioids and psychological support were reported.A high symptom burden was identified in outpatients with cancer. Increasing provision and access to supportive care for physical and psychological symptoms should be prioritised alongside exploring routine assessment of symptom burden and QoL."
https://openalex.org/W4205353507,"Perinatal asphyxia continues to be a significant clinical concern around the world as the consequences can be devastating. World Health Organization data indicates perinatal asphyxia is encountered amongst 6-10 newborns per 1000 live full-term birth, and the figures are higher for low and middle-income countries. Nevertheless, studies on the prevalence of asphyxia and the extent of the problem in poorly resourced southern Ethiopian regions are limited. This study aimed to determine the magnitude of perinatal asphyxia and its associated factors.A retrospective cross-sectional study design was used from March to April 2020. Data was collected from charts of neonates who were admitted to NICU from January 2016 to December 31, 2019.The review of 311 neonates' medical records revealed that 41.2% of the neonates experienced perinatal asphyxia. Preeclampsia during pregnancy (AOR = 6.2, 95%CI:3.1-12.3), antepartum hemorrhage (AOR = 4.5, 95%CI:2.3-8.6), gestational diabetes mellitus (AOR = 4.2, 95%CI:1.9-9.2), premature rupture of membrane (AOR = 2.5, 95%CI:1.33-4.7) fetal distress (AOR = 3,95%CI:1.3-7.0) and meconium-stained amniotic fluid (AOR = 7.7, 95%CI: 3.1-19.3) were the associated factors.Substantial percentages of neonates encounter perinatal asphyxia, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Focus on early identification and timely treatment of perinatal asphyxia in hospitals should, therefore, be given priority."
https://openalex.org/W4206898659,"Multiple factors are associated with the risk of diabetes and hypertension. In India, they vary widely even from one district to another. Therefore, strategies for controlling diabetes and hypertension should appropriately address local risk factors and take into account the specific causes of the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension at sub-population levels and in specific settings. This paper examines the demographic and socioeconomic risk factors as well as the spatial disparity of diabetes and hypertension among adults aged 15-49 years in Northeast India.The study used data from the Indian Demographic Health Survey, which was conducted across the country between 2015 and 2016. All men and women between the ages of 15 and 49 years were tested for diabetes and hypertension as part of the survey. A Bayesian geo-additive model was used to determine the risk factors of diabetes and hypertension.The prevalence rates of diabetes and hypertension in Northeast India were, respectively, 6.38% and 16.21%. The prevalence was higher among males, urban residents, and those who were widowed/divorced/separated. The functional relationship between household wealth index and diabetes and hypertension was found to be an inverted U-shape. As the household wealth status increased, its effect on diabetes also increased. However, interestingly, the inverse was observed in the case of hypertension, that is, as the household wealth status increased, its effect on hypertension decreased. The unstructured spatial variation in diabetes was mainly due to the unobserved risk factors present within a district that were not related to the nearby districts, while for hypertension, the structured spatial variation was due to the unobserved factors that were related to the nearby districts.Diabetes and hypertension control measures should consider both local and non-local factors that contribute to the spatial heterogeneity. More importance should be given to efforts aimed at evaluating district-specific factors in the prevalence of diabetes within a region."
https://openalex.org/W4207003162,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PAH1-encoded phosphatidate (PA) phosphatase, which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PA to produce diacylglycerol, controls the bifurcation of PA into triacylglycerol synthesis and phospholipid synthesis. Pah1 is inactive in the cytosol as a phosphorylated form and becomes active on the membrane as a dephosphorylated form by the Nem1-Spo7 protein phosphatase. We show that the conserved Trp-637 residue of Pah1, located in the intrinsically disordered region, is required for normal synthesis of membrane phospholipids, sterols, triacylglycerol, and the formation of lipid droplets. Analysis of mutant Pah1-W637A showed that the tryptophan residue is involved in the phosphorylation-mediated/dephosphorylation-mediated membrane association of the enzyme and its catalytic activity. The endogenous phosphorylation of Pah1-W637A was increased at the sites of the N-terminal region but was decreased at the sites of the C-terminal region. The altered phosphorylation correlated with an increase in its membrane association. In addition, membrane-associated PA phosphatase activity in vitro was elevated in cells expressing Pah1-W637A as a result of the increased membrane association of the mutant enzyme. However, the inherent catalytic function of Pah1 was not affected by the W637A mutation. Prediction of Pah1 structure by AlphaFold shows that Trp-637 and the catalytic residues Asp-398 and Asp-400 in the haloacid dehalogenase-like domain almost lie in the same plane, suggesting that these residues are important to properly position the enzyme for substrate recognition at the membrane surface. These findings underscore the importance of Trp-637 in Pah1 regulation by phosphorylation, membrane association of the enzyme, and its function in lipid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4205458712,"Electropermeabilization is a promising phenomenon that occurs when pulsed electric field with high frequency is applied to cells/vesicles. We quantify the required values of pulsed electric fields for the rupture of cell-sized giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) which are prepared under various surface charges, cholesterol contents and osmotic pressures. The probability of rupture and the average time of rupture are evaluated under these conditions. The electric field changes from 500 to 410 Vcm-1 by varying the anionic lipid mole fraction from 0 to 0.60 for getting the maximum probability of rupture (i.e., 1.0). In contrast, the same probability of rupture is obtained for changing the electric field from 410 to 630 Vcm-1 by varying the cholesterol mole fraction in the membranes from 0 to 0.40. These results suggest that the required electric field for the rupture decreases with the increase of surface charge density but increases with the increase of cholesterol. We also quantify the electric field for the rupture of GUVs containing anionic mole fraction of 0.40 under various osmotic pressures. In the absence of osmotic pressure, the electric field for the rupture is obtained 430 Vcm-1, whereas the field is 300 Vcm-1 in the presence of 17 mOsmL-1, indicating the instability of GUVs at higher osmotic pressures. These investigations open an avenue of possibilities for finding the electric field dependent rupture of cell-like vesicles along with the insight of biophysical and biochemical processes."

https://openalex.org/W4206003402,"Background The use of single-tablet regimens (STRs) in HIV treatment is ubiquitous. However, reintroducing the (generic) components as multi-tablet regimens (MTRs) could be an interesting cost-reducing strategy. It is essential to involve patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) to examine the effects of such an approach. Hence, this study compared PROs of people living with HIV taking an STR versus a MTR in a real world setting. Materials and methods This longitudinal study included 188 people living with HIV. 132 remained on a MTR and 56 switched to an STR. At baseline, months 1-3-6-12-18 and 24, participants filled in questionnaires on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), depressive symptoms, HIV symptoms, neurocognitive complaints (NCC), treatment satisfaction and adherence. Generalized linear mixed models and generalized estimation equations mixed models were built. Results Clinical parameters and PROs of the two groups were comparable at baseline. Neurocognitive complaints and treatment satisfaction did differ over time among the groups. In the STR-group, the odds of having NCC increased monthly by 4,1% as compared to the MTR-group (p = 0.035). Moreover, people taking an STR were more satisfied with their treatment after 6 months: the median change score was high: 24 (IQR 7,5â29). Further, treatment satisfaction showed a contrary evolution in the groups: the estimated state score of the STR-group increased by 3,3 while it decreased by 0,2 in the MTR-group (p = 0.003). No differences over time between the groups were observed with regard to HRQoL, HIV symptoms, depressive symptoms and adherence. Conclusions Neurocognitive complaints were more frequently reported among people on an STR versus MTR. This finding contrasts with the higher treatment satisfaction in the STR-group over time. The long-term effects of both PROs should guide the decision-making on STRs vs. (generic) MTRs."
https://openalex.org/W4206433576,"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) and stroke-related events accompanied by atrial fibrillation (AF) can affect morbidity and mortality in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This study sought to evaluate a scoring system predicting cardio-cerebral events in HCM patients using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).We investigated the role of a previous prediction model based on CPET, the HYPertrophic Exercise-derived Risk score for Heart Failure-related events (HyperHF), which is derived from peak circulatory power ventilatory efficiency and left atrial diameter (LAD), for predicting a composite of SCD-related (SCD, serious ventricular arrhythmia, death from cardiac cause, heart failure admission) and stroke-related (new-onset AF, acute stroke) events. The Novel HyperHF risk model using left atrial volume index (LAVI) instead of LAD was proposed and compared with the previous HCM Risk-SCD model.A total of 295 consecutive HCM patients (age 59.9Â±13.2, 71.2% male) who underwent CPET was included in the present study. During a median follow-up of 742 days (interquartile range 384-1047 days), 29 patients (9.8%) experienced an event (SCD-related event: 14 patients (4.7%); stroke-related event: 17 patients (5.8%)). The previous model for SCD risk score showed fair prediction ability (AUC of HCM Risk-SCD 0.670, p = 0.002; AUC of HyperHF 0.691, p = 0.001). However, the prediction power of Novel HyperHF showed the highest value among the models (AUC of Novel HyperHF 0.717, p<0.001).Both conventional HCM Risk-SCD score and CPET-derived HyperHF score were useful for prediction of overall risk of SCD-related and stroke-related events in HCM. Novel HyperHF score using LAVI could be utilized for a better prediction power."
https://openalex.org/W4206817531,"Several studies have reported the relationship of deforestation with increased incidence of infectious diseases, mainly due to the deregulation caused in these environments. The purpose of this study was to answer the following questions: a) is increased loss of vegetation related to dengue cases in the Brazilian Cerrado? b) how do different regions of the tropical savanna biome present distinct patterns for total dengue cases and vegetation loss? c) what is the projection of a future scenario of deforestation and an increased number of dengue cases in 2030? Thus, this study aimed to assess the relationship between loss of native vegetation in the Cerrado and dengue infection. In this paper, we quantify the entire deforested area and dengue infection cases from 2001 to 2019. For data analyses, we used Poisson generalized linear model, descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, non-parametric statistics, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to predict loss of vegetation and fever dengue cases for the next decade. Cluster analysis revealed the formation of four clusters among the states. Our results showed significant increases in loss of native vegetation in all states, with the exception of PiauÃ­. As for dengue cases, there were increases in the states of Minas Gerais, SÃ£o Paulo, and Mato Grosso. Based on projections for 2030, Minas Gerais will register about 4,000 dengue cases per 100,000 inhabitants, SÃ£o Paulo 750 dengue cases per 100,000 inhabitants, and Mato Grosso 500 dengue cases per 100,000 inhabitants. To reduce these projections, Brazil will need to control deforestation and implement public health, environmental and social policies, requiring a joint effort from all spheres of society."
https://openalex.org/W4207039739,"Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to numerous health conditions but understudied in multiple sclerosis (MS). This studyâs objective was to test for the association between ACEs and MS risk and several clinical outcomes. Methods We used a sample of adult, non-Hispanic MS cases (n = 1422) and controls (n = 1185) from Northern California. Eighteen ACEs were assessed including parent divorce, parent death, and abuse. Outcomes included MS risk, age of MS onset, Multiple Sclerosis Severity Scale score, and use of a walking aid. Logistic and linear regression estimated odds ratios (ORs) (and beta coefficients) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ACEs operationalized as any/none, counts, individual events, and latent factors/patterns. Results Overall, more MS cases experienced â¥1 ACE compared to controls (54.5% and 53.8%, respectively). After adjusting for sex, birthyear, and race, this small difference was attenuated (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.18). There were no trends of increasing or decreasing odds of MS across ACE count categories. Consistent associations between individual ACEs between ages 0â10 and 11â20 years and MS risk were not detected. Factor analysis identified five latent ACE factors, but their associations with MS risk were approximately null. Age of MS onset and other clinical outcomes were not associated with ACEs after multiple testing correction. Conclusion Despite rich data and multiple approaches to operationalizing ACEs, no consistent and statistically significant effects were observed between ACEs with MS. This highlights the challenges of studying sensitive, retrospective events among adults that occurred decades before data collection."
https://openalex.org/W4226147662,"Many enteric viruses are found in pig farms around the world and can cause death of animals or important production losses for breeders. Among the wide spectrum of enteric viral species, porcine Sapelovirus (PSV), porcine Kobuvirus (PKoV) and porcine Astrovirus (PAstV) are frequently found in pig feces. In this study we investigated sixteen pig farms in Corsica, France, to evaluate the circulation of three enteric viruses (PKoV, PAstV-1 and PSV). In addition to the three viruses studied by RT-qPCR (908 pig feces samples), 26 stool samples were tested using the Next Generation Sequencing method (NGS). Our results showed viral RNA detection rates (i) of 62.0% [58.7-65.1] (n = 563/908) for PSV, (ii) of 44.8% [41.5-48.1] (n = 407/908) for PKoV and (iii) of 8.6% [6.8-10.6] (n = 78/908) for PAstV-1. Significant differences were observed for all three viruses according to age (P-value = 2.4e-13 for PAstV-1; 2.4e-12 for PKoV and 0.005 for PSV). The type of breeding was significantly associated with RNA detection only for PAstV-1 (P-value = 9.6e-6). Among the 26 samples tested with NGS method, consensus sequences corresponding to 10 different species of virus were detected. This study provides first insight on the presence of three common porcine enteric viruses in France. We also showed that they are frequently encountered in pigs born and bred in Corsica, which demonstrates endemic local circulation."
https://openalex.org/W4205774397,"Background Most studies on rapid response system (RRS) have simply focused on its role and effectiveness in reducing in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCAs) or hospital mortality, regardless of the predictability of IHCA. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of IHCAs including predictability of the IHCAs as our RRS matures for 10 years, to determine the best measure for RRS evaluation. Methods Data on all consecutive adult patients who experienced IHCA and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation in general wards between January 2010 and December 2019 were reviewed. IHCAs were classified into three groups: preventable IHCA (P-IHCA), non-preventable IHCA (NP-IHCA), and inevitable IHCA (I-IHCA). The annual changes of three groups of IHCAs were analyzed with Poisson regression models. Results Of a total of 800 IHCA patients, 149 (18.6%) had P-IHCA, 465 (58.1%) had NP-IHCA, and 186 (23.2%) had I-IHCA. The number of the RRS activations increased significantly from 1,164 in 2010 to 1,560 in 2019 (P = 0.009), and in-hospital mortality rate was significantly decreased from 9.20/1,000 patients in 2010 to 7.23/1000 patients in 2019 (P = 0.009). The trend for the overall IHCA rate was stable, from 0.77/1,000 patients in 2010 to 1.06/1,000 patients in 2019 (P = 0.929). However, while the incidence of NP-IHCA (P = 0.927) and I-IHCA (P = 0.421) was relatively unchanged over time, the incidence of P-IHCA decreased from 0.19/1,000 patients in 2010 to 0.12/1,000 patients in 2019 (P = 0.025). Conclusions The incidence of P-IHCA could be a quality metric to measure the clinical outcomes of RRS implementation and maturation than overall IHCAs."
https://openalex.org/W4205955659,"The cellular energy metabolism is one of the most conserved processes, as it is present in all living organisms. Mitochondria are providing the eukaryotic cell with energy and thus their genome and gene expression has been of broad interest for a long time. Mitochondrial gene expression changes under different conditions and is regulated by genes encoded in the nucleus of the cell. In this context, little is known about non-model organisms and we provide the first large-scaled gene expression analysis of mitochondrial-linked genes in laying hens. We analysed 28 mitochondrial and nuclear genes in 100 individuals in the context of five life-stages and strain differences among five tissues. Our study showed that mitochondrial gene expression increases during the productive life span, and reacts tissue and strain specific. In addition, the strains react different to potential increased oxidative stress, resulting from the increase in mitochondrial gene expression. The results suggest that the cellular energy metabolism as part of a complex regulatory system is strongly affected by the productive life span in laying hens and thus partly comparable to model organisms. This study provides a starting point for further analyses in this field on non-model organisms, especially in laying-hens."

We previously reported that the nonpolyadenylated 3â²-UTR of viral mRNA (vmRNA), which is derived from the noncoding intergenic region (IGR), regulates viral protein levels at the posttranscriptional level. This finding provided the basis for the development of novel live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs) against human pathogenic mammarenaviruses. Detailed information about the roles of specific vmRNA 3â²-UTR sequences in controlling translation efficiency will help in understanding the mechanism underlying attenuation by IGR manipulations. Here, we characterize the roles of cis-acting mRNA regulatory sequences of a prototypic mammarenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), in modulating translational efficiency. Using in vitro transcribed RNA mimics encoding a reporter gene, we demonstrate that the 3â²-UTR of nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA without a poly(A) tail promotes translation in a poly(A)-binding protein-independent manner. Comparison with the 3â²-UTR of glycoprotein precursor mRNA, which is translated less efficiently, revealed that a 10-nucleotide sequence proximal to the NP open reading frame is essential for promoting translation. Modification of this 10-nucleotide sequence also impacted reporter gene expression in recombinant LCMV.

Rodent-borne mammalian arenaviruses (mammarenaviruses) include several human pathogenic agents that are responsible for diseases ranging from mild febrile illnesses to life-threatening viral hemorrhagic fever. Lassa virus (LASV) is the most significant agent among mammarenaviruses, and it raises special public health concerns in West African countries (1Richmond J.K. Baglole D.J. Lassa fever: Epidemiology, clinical features, and social consequences.BMJ. 2003; 327: 1271-1275Google Scholar). LASV infects several hundred thousand individuals yearly, which results in a high number of Lassa fever cases with significant mortality. Moreover, a novel mammarenavirus, Lujo virus, was identified from patients of the recent cluster of hemorrhagic fever cases in Zambia and the Republic of South Africa, which raises concerns about the potential future emergence of novel mammarenaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever (2Briese T.

Despite their significant impact on human health, medical countermeasures against human pathogenic mammarenaviruses are limited. There are no licensed vaccines against LASV, and off-label use of ribavirin is currently the most practical approach for treating patients with Lassa fever. However, ribavirin is only partially effective and associated with significant adverse effects (8McCormick J.B. King I.J. Webb P.A. Scribner C.L. Craven R.B. Johnson K.M. Elliott L.H.

Mammarenaviruses have a bisegmented single-stranded RNA genome that uses an ambisense coding strategy to direct the expression of viral mRNAs from two viral genes arranged in opposite orientations, separated by a noncoding intergenic region (IGR) (11Buchmeier M.J. De la Torre C. Peters C.J. Arenaviridae.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Cohen J.I. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Racaniello V.R. Roizman B. Fields Virology. 6th Ed. Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2013: 1283-1303Google Scholar). The S segment RNA encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC). The GPC is cotranslationally processed by signal peptidase to generate a stable signal peptide (SSP) and posttranslationally processed by site 1 protease to generate the mature virion surface glycoproteins GP1 and GP2. GP1 and GP2 together with the SSP form the glycoprotein complex, which is responsible for receptor recognition and cell entry. The L segment RNA encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the matrix RING finger protein (Z). Unlike most cellular mRNAs, mammarenaviral mRNA has a nonpolyadenylated 3â²-UTR. Transcription by the L protein is initiated from the 3â²-termini of genomic and antigenomic RNAs using a 5â²-capped RNA fragment for priming obtained from cellular mRNA by cap snatching, and transcription terminates within the IGR, generating 5â²-capped and 3â²-nonpolyadenylated viral mRNA (vmRNA) (12Meyer B.J.

Rep. 2017; 7: 4679Google Scholar). Although the IGR plays a critical role in mammarenaviral multiplication, limited information on the roles of specific vmRNA 3â²-UTR regions in controlling translation efficiency has hampered a detailed understanding of the mechanism underlying attenuation by the modified IGR. In this study, we further investigated the contribution of the 3â²-UTR sequence of LCMV mRNA to translation regulation employing a reporter system using in vitro transcribed mRNA that mimics 5â²-capped and 3â²-nonpolyadenylated vmRNA. We demonstrate that the 3â²-UTR of NP mRNA with no poly(A) tail promotes translation in a poly(A)-binding protein (PABP)-independent manner. We show that a 10-nucleotide (nt) sequence located on the 5â² side of the 3â² UTR of the NP mRNA is essential for promoting translation. Importantly, the reporter protein level was altered in cells infected with recombinant LCMV in which the 10-nt sequence immediately downstream of the reporter gene was modified. Our findings will enable rational design of the 10-nt sequence to further improve our mammarenavirus LAV candidates and to develop a novel LCMV vector capable of controlling foreign gene expression. Using a minigenome system, we previously demonstrated that IGR sequences play a critical role in vmRNA translation efficiency (17Iwasaki M. Ngo N. Cubitt B. Teijaro J.R. de la Torre J.C. General molecular strategy for development of arenavirus live-attenuated vaccines.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 12166-12177Google Scholar). To further investigate the roles of specific regions in the cis-acting regulatory sequence of LCMV mRNA, we used a reporter system with an in vitro transcribed vmRNA-like mRNA (vlmRNA) for the fluorescent reporter gene ZsGreen (ZsG), flanked by a capped 5â²-UTR and nonpolyadenylated 3â²-UTR (Fig. 1A). This reporter system allows the accurate assessment of protein levels driven by the UTR sequences of vmRNA without being affected by viral transcription and replication activities. Intriguingly, the 3â² end of the LCMV NP mRNA has been reported to have a high degree of heterogeneity (12Meyer B.J. Southern P.J. Concurrent sequence analysis of 5' and 3' RNA termini by intramolecular circularization reveals 5' nontemplated bases and 3' terminal heterogeneity for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus mRNAs.J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2621-2627Google Scholar). To examine whether the length of the 3â²-UTR of LCMV NP mRNA plays a critical role in translation efficiency, we assessed ZsG levels in cells transfected with a series of 3â²-end-truncated vlmRNAs. We generated vlmRNAs using PCR fragments containing the 3â²-UTR that were serially truncated from 64 nt (full length of the S-IGR) as templates for in vitro transcription. Among the vlmRNAs with 3â²-UTRs 64 to 40 nt long, the ZsG levels (signal intensities) were highest in HEK293 cells that were transfected with vlmRNAs that had 55- and 50-nt-long 3â²-UTRs (Fig. 1B). Further truncation did not improve the ZsG levels (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that LCMV NP mRNAs with 3â²-UTRs 50 to 55 nt long exhibit better translation efficiency among NP mRNAs with variable lengths of 3â²-UTR. We used a 55-nt-long 3â²-UTR as the representative 3â²-UTR of LCMV NP vmRNA for the subsequent experiments. In contrast to the significant heterogeneity of the 3â² ends of NP mRNA, the 3â² ends of GPC mRNA formed a cluster at the distal side of the IGR (12Meyer B.J. Southern P.J. Concurrent sequence analysis of 5' and 3' RNA termini by intramolecular circularization reveals 5' nontemplated bases and 3' terminal heterogeneity for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus mRNAs.J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2621-2627Google Scholar). Accordingly, for the GPC vlmRNA, we used the 53-nt-long 3â²-UTR that was the longest among clones of PCR fragments containing the 3â²-UTR of LCMV GPC mRNA because we considered that it would contain all of the functional domains involved in translation regulation. We generated vlmRNAs containing 5â²- and 3â²-UTRs of NP mRNA [vlmRNA(NP-NP)] or GPC mRNA [vlmRNA(GPC-GPC)] and assessed the effects of the viral 5â²- and 3â²-UTR sequences on protein levels and RNA stability in the transfected cells. The signal intensity of ZsG in the cells transfected with vlmRNA(GPC-GPC) was approximately seven times lower than that in cells transfected with vlmRNA(NP-NP) without significant reduction of the vlmRNA level (Fig. 1, D and E), which indicates that production of viral protein is regulated by the UTRs of vmRNA at the translational level. In a previous study, we used an LCMV minigenome system and demonstrated that the vmRNA 3â²-UTR, not the 5â²-UTR, played a critical role in controlling viral protein levels (17Iwasaki M. Ngo N. Cubitt B. Teijaro J.R. de la Torre J.C. General molecular strategy for development of arenavirus live-attenuated vaccines.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 12166-12177Google Scholar). We aimed to reproduce these previous observations in our reporter system by generating a series of vlmRNAs with viral 5â²- and 3â²-UTRs swapped between the NP and GPC mRNAs. As expected, the ZsG levels were significantly reduced when the 3â²-UTR of vlmRNA(NP-NP) was replaced with the 3â²-UTR of GPC mRNA [vlmRNA(NP-GPC)] and significantly increased when the 3â²-UTR of vlmRNA(GPC-GPC) was replaced with the 3â²-UTR of NP mRNA [vlmRNA(GPC-NP)] (Fig. 1F). Unlike the nonpolyadenylated mRNA of rotavirus, which requires a nonstructural rotavirus protein, NSP3, to promote translation (22Piron M. Vende P. Cohen J. Poncet D. Rotavirus RNA-binding protein NSP3 interacts with eIF4GI and evicts the poly(A) binding protein from eIF4F.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5811-5821Google Scholar, 23Vende P. Piron M. Castagne N. Poncet D.

Four nucleotides are the minimal requirement for RNA recognition by rotavirus non-structural protein NSP3.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4165-4173Google Scholar), our in vitro transcribed vlmRNA reporter system demonstrated that translation could be executed in the absence of viral proteins, suggesting that vmRNA translation is mediated by viral protein-independent cellular machinery. PABP interacts with the poly(A) tail of cellular mRNA and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), which results in the formation of circular mRNA and facilitates repetitive use of a released ribosome for efficient translation (26Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. A newly identified N-terminal amino acid sequence of human eIF4G binds poly(A)-binding protein and functions in poly(A)-dependent translation.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Google Scholar, 27Otero L.J. Ashe M.P. Sachs A.B.

Sachs A.B. Association of the yeast poly(A) tail binding protein with translation initiation factor eIF-4G.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Google Scholar). To gain insight into vmRNA translation, we next investigated whether, similar to cellular mRNAs, vmRNA also associated with PABP and eIF4G to promote translation. We generated vlmRNAs containing the 5â²-UTR of NP mRNA and the 3â²-UTR of NP or GPC mRNA incorporating 5-bromouridine (BrU). A portion of vlmRNA(NP-NP) incorporating BrU was polyadenylated [vlmRNA(NP-NPAn)]. A vlmRNA(NP-NP) lacking BrU was used as a negative control. HEK293 cells were then transfected with the vlmRNAs. At 5 h posttransfection, we prepared total cell lysates for RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays using an agarose resin coated with an anti-5-bromo-2â²-deoxyuridine (BrdU) antibody that cross-reacts with BrU (Fig. 2A). PABP was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with vlmRNA(NP-NPAn), but not with vlmRNA(NP-NP) or vlmRNA(NP-GPC). Likewise, eIF4G was barely detected at similar levels by Western blotting of the anti-BrdU antibody immunoprecipitates of vlmRNA(NP-NP) and vlmRNA(NP-GPC), and eIF4G protein levels were significantly lower than that of vlmRNA(NP-NPAn). To rule out the possibility that different efficiency of coimmunoprecipitation of PABP and eIF4G was due to inconsistent immunoprecipitation efficiency, we also examined the levels of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR), which is known to bind to double-strand RNA (29Barraud P. Allain F.H. ADAR proteins: Double-stranded RNA and Z-DNA binding domains.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2012; 353: 35-60Google Scholar). As we expected, ADAR levels were compatible among anti-BrdU immunoprecipitates of BrU-incorporated vlmRNAs that form a double-stranded stem structure at the 3â²-UTR. To further investigate the role of PABP in LCMV mRNA translation, we examined the impact of siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of PABP on the translation of vlmRNAs with or without poly(A) (Fig. 2B). KD of PABP significantly reduced ZsG levels in cells transfected with vlmRNA(NP-NPAn), but not with vlmRNA(NP-NP) or vlmRNA(GPC-GPC) (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that vmRNA translation is regulated in a PABP-independent manner. The LCMV S-IGR contains a putative hairpin structure with a 21-nt paired stem. Because of the perfect complementarity of the stem region, the 3â²-UTR sequences derived from the stem region of the NP and GPC mRNAs were identical. In addition, we used 55-nt- and 53-nt-long 3â²-UTRs as representative 3â²-UTRs of NP and GPC mRNAs, respectively, resulting in generation of the same 3â²-termini. Therefore, the 3â²-UTR unique to vlmRNA(NP-NP) and vlmRNA(NP-GPC) can be limited to the region located upstream of the stem region (proximal region, PR) and loop region (LR) within the putative hairpin structure (Fig. 3A). To examine the contributions of the PR and LR sequences to translation regulation, we generated vlmRNAs with the 5â²-UTR of NP mRNA containing chimeric 3â²-UTRs with the PR and LR from NP mRNA and GPC mRNA in all possible combinations. Replacing the PR of vlmRNA(NP-NP) with that of GPC mRNA [vlmRNA(PRGPC-LRNP)] decreased the ZsG level to a value similar to that for vlmRNA(NP-GPC) (Fig. 3B). Conversely, replacement of the PR of vlmRNA(NP-GPC) with that of NP mRNA [vlmRNA(PRNP-LRGPC)] significantly increased the ZsG level to a value that was moderately lower (32%) than that of vlmRNA(NP-NP). These results indicate that the PR sequence of vmRNA is essential for translation regulation, whereas the LR sequence only partially contributes to vmRNA translation. To identify the PR sequence that promotes translation, we generated vlmRNA(NP-NP)-deletion mutants with 2-nt deletions in the PR. Because the 10-nt PR of the NP mRNA contains a CUCU sequence, the 2-nt deletions within the PR resulted in four vlmRNA(NP-NP)-deletion mutants (del1âdel4) (Fig. 4A). The ZsG levels were significantly decreased in cells transfected with these vlmRNA(NP-NP)-deletion mutants, although the reductions varied from 48% to 70% (Fig. 4B), which indicates that the absence of any of the 2-nt pairs reduced the translation efficiency of NP mRNA. This result and the finding that the PRs of the NP and GPC mRNAs were 10 and 8 nt long, respectively, led us to explore the possibility that the PR length was important for translation regulation. For this, we examined ZsG levels in cells transfected with vlmRNA(NP-NP) containing random 10-nt or 8-nt sequences instead of the actual PR sequence of NP mRNA. The ZsG levels in cells transfected with the two vlmRNA(NP-NP) mutants with the random 10-nt or 8-nt sequences as well as those with vlmRNA(NP-GPC) were significantly reduced when compared with those of the cells transfected with vlmRNA(NP-NP), which indicates that the PR length was not a sufficient condition to promote translation (Fig. 4C). The 3â²-UTRs of the L and Z mRNAs transcribed from L segment RNA also play a critical role in translation regulation (17Iwasaki M. Ngo N. Cubitt B. Teijaro J.R. de la Torre J.C. General molecular strategy for development of arenavirus live-attenuated vaccines.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 12166-12177Google Scholar). To examine this further, we determined whether the PR sequence from L or Z mRNA also supported low or high translation efficiency, respectively, in the context of the NP mRNA 3â²-UTR. For this, we replaced the PR sequence of vlmRNA(NP-NP) with an 8-nt or 10-nt sequence just downstream of the translation termination codon of L mRNA (low translation efficiency) [vlmRNA(PRL-LRNP)] or Z mRNA (high translation efficiency) [vlmRNA(PRZ-LRNP)], respectively. vlmRNA(PRZ-LRNP) drove efficient production of ZsG equal to that with vlmRNA(NP-NP) (Fig. 5A). Conversely, the ZsG levels in cells transfected with vlmRNA(PRL-LRNP) were significantly reduced compared with the level with vlmRNA(NP-NP) and similar to that with vlmRNA(PRGPC-LRNP). Intriguingly, the PR sequence of Z mRNA (PRZ) had a high degree of sequence identity with that of NP mRNA (PRNP), where seven of the 10 nts were identical (Fig. 5B, i). To identify nt bases in PRZ that were identical to those in PRNP required for efficient translation of vlmRNA(NP-NP), we introduced nt substitutions so that the newly generated vlmRNA did not contain the original nt bases in the three parts of PRNP, ACC, UC, and GG, identical to PRZ, of vlmRNA(NP-NP). The resulting vlmRNAs both showed significant reductions in ZsG levels, but to different degrees (39%â74%) (Fig. 5B, ii). Because we failed to clearly identify specific nt bases in the PRNP critical for NP mRNA translation, we considered whether the secondary structure, rather than the primary sequence, was involved in translation regulation by PRNP. For this, we compared the predicted secondary structures of the 3â²-UTRs of vlmRNA(NP-NP) and vlmRNA(PRGPC-LRNP) using MFOLD (30Zuker M. Mfold web server for nucleic acid folding and hybridization prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Google Scholar). We found a small hairpin structure in PRNP (Fig. 5C) that was not found in the PRGPC secondary structure. Intriguingly, the predicted structure of the 3â²-UTR of vlmRNA(PRZ-LRNP) also contained a small hairpin structure, but its base-paired stem was shorter than that of vlmRNA(NP-NP). To examine whether the small hairpin structure contributed to NP mRNA translation, we designed a PR sequence (synthetic PRNP-structure-forming sequence, PRsyn) that formed a small stem-loop structure that mimicked the small hairpin found in PRNP but contained drastic (nine out of 10 nts) substitutions in the PR of vlmRNA(NP-NP) (Fig. 5C). The ZsG levels were retained at approximately 60% in cells transfected with vlmRNA(PRsyn-LRNP) compared with the ZsG levels in cells transfected with vlmRNA(NP-NP) (Fig. 5D). However, the PR sequence was largely changed, having substitutions in positions where substitutions led to impaired translation efficiency equivalent to vlmRNA(PRGPC-LRNP) (e.g., substitutions in GG residues in PRNP, Fig. 5B). These results indicate that, in addition to the primary sequence, the small hairpin structure in the PR of NP mRNA may play an important role in translation. Consistent with this, the 60- or 64-nt-long 3â²-UTR of NP mRNA, with which translation efficiency of vlmRNA was significantly reduced compared with vlmRNA(NP-NP), was not predicted to form the small stem loop structure at the PR (Fig. 5E). The results from our reporter system indicated that the PR in NP and GPC mRNAs is a major determinant of translation efficiency. To validate our findings at the virus level, we took advantage of a recombinant trisegmented LCMV (r3LCMV) platform (31Martinez-Sobrido L. Cheng B.Y. de la Torre J.C. Reverse genetics approaches to control arenavirus.Methods Mol. Biol. 2016; 1403: 313-351Google Scholar, 32Emonet S.F. Garidou L. McGavern D.B. de la Torre J.C. Generation of recombinant lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses with trisegmented genomes stably expressing two additional genes of interest.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2009; 106: 3473-3478Google Scholar). The r3LCMV platform developed by separating two essential genes, NP and GPC, into two different S segments provides two additional transcriptional units into which one or two genes of interest can be inserted. With this approach, we generated r3LCMV, where the ZsG sequence was inserted into the NP locus on the opposite side of the GPC gene (r3LCMV/ZsG) (Fig. 6A). To investigate the impact of manipulation of the PR on the expression of its upstream gene in virus-infected cells, the PR sequence of r3LCMV/ZsG was replaced with that of PRsyn (moderately less translation efficiency than PRNP) or PRL (low translation efficiency, similar to PRGPC), which resulted in the generation of r3LCMV/ZsG-PRsyn and r3LCMV/ZsG-PRL, respectively. We inoculated these three r3LCMVs into Vero E6 cells and determined the ZsG and NP levels in the virus-infected cells 48 h postinfection. Although the ZsG levels varied from cell to cell, the overall ZsG levels, consistent with the results from our reporter system, appeared to be decreased when the PR sequence of r3LCMV/ZsG was replaced with that of PRsyn and decreased further with PRL, with no apparent differences in NP levels (Fig. 6B). Quantitative analysis by measuring the ZsG signal intensity of each well using a fluorescence plate reader confirmed the stepwise decrease in overall ZsG levels by the replacement of the PR sequence (Fig. 6C). Asymmetric NP and GPC levels are well documented, and NP production has been shown to be significantly higher than GPC production in LCMV-infected cells. This expression balance is critical for LCMV because abrogation of the balance by replacing the S-IGR with the L-IGR resulted in nonviable virus (17Iwasaki M. Ngo N. Cubitt B. Teijaro J.R. de la Torre J.C. General molecular strategy for development of arenavirus live-attenuated vaccines.J. Virol. 2015; 89: 12166-12177Google Scholar). Similar to that of other negative-strand RNA viruses, mammarenaviral polymerase generates significantly higher levels of genomic RNA species than the complementary a"

This study describes antibiotic prescribing patterns before, during, and after Ramadan in a primary care setting within the Pakistani and Bangladeshi populations in the UK, most of whom are Muslims, compared to those who do not observe Ramadan. Method Retrospective controlled interrupted time series analysis of electronic health record data from primary care practices. The study consists of two groups: Pakistanis/Bangladeshis and white populations. For each group, we constructed a series of aggregated, daily prescription data from 2007 to 2017 for the 30 days preceding, during, and after Ramadan, respectively. Findings Controlling for the rate in the white population, there was no evidence of increased antibiotic prescription in the Pakistani/Bangladeshi population during Ramadan, as compared to before Ramadan (IRR: 0.994; 95% CI: 0.988â1.001, p = 0.082) or after Ramadan (IRR: 1.006; 95% CI: 0.999â1.013, p = 0.082). Interpretation In this large, population-based study, we did not find any evidence to suggest that fasting was associated with an increased susceptibility to infection."
https://openalex.org/W4225508602,"Using visual search displays of interacting and non-interacting pairs, it has been demonstrated that detection of social interactions is facilitated. For example, two people facing each other are found faster than two people with their backs turned: an effect that may reflect social binding. However, recent work has shown the same effects with non-social arrow stimuli, where towards facing arrows are detected faster than away facing arrows. This latter work suggests a primary mechanism is an attention orienting process driven by basic low-level direction cues. However, evidence for lower level attentional processes does not preclude a potential additional role of higher-level social processes. Therefore, in this series of experiments we test this idea further by directly comparing basic visual features that orient attention with representations of socially interacting individuals. Results confirm the potency of orienting of attention via low-level visual features in the detection of interacting objects. In contrast, there is little evidence for the representation of social interactions influencing initial search performance."
https://openalex.org/W4206694885,"In mitochondria, cysteine desulfurase (Nfs1) plays a central role in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters, cofactors critical for activity of many cellular proteins. Nfs1 functions both as a sulfur donor for cluster assembly and as a binding platform for other proteins functioning in the process. These include not only the dedicated scaffold protein (Isu1) on which FeS clusters are synthesized but also accessory FeS cluster biogenesis proteins frataxin (Yfh1) and ferredoxin (Yah1). Yfh1 has been shown to activate cysteine desulfurase enzymatic activity, whereas Yah1 supplies electrons for the persulfide reduction. While Yfh1 interaction with Nfs1 is well understood, the Yah1-Nfs1 interaction is not. Here, based on the results of biochemical experiments involving purified WT and variant proteins, we report that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yah1 and Yfh1 share an evolutionary conserved interaction site on Nfs1. Consistent with this notion, Yah1 and Yfh1 can each displace the other from Nfs1 but are inefficient competitors when a variant with an altered interaction site is used. Thus, the binding mode of Yah1 and Yfh1 interacting with Nfs1 in mitochondria of S. cerevisiae resembles the mutually exclusive binding of ferredoxin and frataxin with cysteine desulfurase reported for the bacterial FeS cluster assembly system. Our findings are consistent with the generally accepted scenario that the mitochondrial FeS cluster assembly system was inherited from bacterial ancestors of mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W4221058507,"Bacteriophages exhibit a vast spectrum of relatedness and there is increasing evidence of close genomic relationships independent of host genus. The variability in phage similarity at the nucleotide, amino acid, and gene content levels confounds attempts at quantifying phage relatedness, especially as more novel phages are isolated. This study describes three highly similar novel Arthrobacter globiformis phagesâPowerpuff, Lego, and YesChefâwhich were assigned to Cluster AZ using a nucleotide-based clustering parameter. Phages in Cluster AZ, Microbacterium Cluster EH, and the former Microbacterium singleton Zeta1847 exhibited low nucleotide similarity. However, their gene content similarity was in excess of the recently adopted Microbacterium clustering parameter, which ultimately resulted in the reassignment of Zeta1847 to Cluster EH. This finding further highlights the importance of using multiple metrics to capture phage relatedness. Additionally, Clusters AZ and EH phages encode a shared integrase indicative of a lysogenic life cycle. In the first experimental verification of a Cluster AZ phageâs life cycle, we show that phage Powerpuff is a true temperate phage. It forms stable lysogens that exhibit immunity to superinfection by related phages, despite lacking identifiable repressors typically required for lysogenic maintenance and superinfection immunity. The ability of phage Powerpuff to undergo and maintain lysogeny suggests that other closely related phages may be temperate as well. Our findings provide additional evidence of significant shared phage genomic content spanning multiple actinobacterial host genera and demonstrate the continued need for verification and characterization of life cycles in newly isolated phages."

To understand the molecular processing essential for ccRCC tumorigenicity, we conducted an integrative in silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC dataset and clustered randomly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening dataset of ccRCC cell lines from Depmap. We identified spindle pole body component 24 homolog (SPC24) as an essential gene for ccRCC cell lines with prognostic significance in the TCGA database. Targeting SPC24 by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout attenuated ccRCC proliferation, metastasis, and in vivo tumor growth. Furthermore, we found that SPC24 regulates metastasis genes expression in a SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2)-dependent manner. The anti-proliferative effects of SPC24 knockout were strengthened with SOX2 knockdown. Collectively, our findings suggest SPC24 has a pivotal function in promoting ccRCC progression, providing a new insight for the treatment of ccRCC."

We performed a retrospective chart review on the data of patients treated with antithrombotic agents who have undergone ab interno trabeculotomy through Tanito microhook combined with cataract surgery at the Asahi General Hospital and the Tokyo University Hospital, with 6 months of follow-up. The patients were classified into two groups depending on whether they discontinued (AT-) or continued (AT+) antithrombotic therapy during the perioperative phase. The demographics, pre- and postoperative IOP, medication score, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and postoperative complications were analyzed preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 week and 1-6 months. The series included 44 eyes from 44 Japanese patients. The AT- and AT+ groups included 21 eyes from 21 patients and 23 eyes from 23 patients, respectively. The decrease in IOP from the baseline at 1 week postoperative was significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.009), but there were no significant differences observed in the other visits. Hyphema and IOP spikes exceeding 30 mmHg occurred in 10% and 10% of AT- participants, and in 43% and 26% of AT+ participants, respectively. Hyphema and spikes with hyphema occurred more frequently in the AT+ than in the AT- group (p = 0.02 and p = 0.05). The number of patients who had spikes was not significantly different (p = 0.27). In trabeculotomy using the Tanito microhookÂ®, discontinuing antithrombotic therapy had better IOP-lowering effects and less postoperative complications."
https://openalex.org/W4205407171,"Purpose We aimed to analyze the prevalence, causes, and clinical settings of 4-year critical radiologic reports (CRRs) notified from the musculoskeletal section of the radiology department. Then, we investigated the communication outcomes. Methods This study was approved by our institutional review board. We retrospectively included 175 musculoskeletal CRRs from our database between January 2017 and December 2020. The CRRs were analyzed by two musculoskeletal radiologists, who categorized the CRRs by clinical setting (emergency department(ED) patient, outpatient, and inpatient), body part, type of image modality, reason for CRR, incidental lesion, and clinical outcome. The clinical outcome was retrieved from the electronic medical records. Results The 175 musculoskeletal CRRs accounted for 5.4% of the CRRs ( n = 3217) available in the study period. Most CRRs (94.9%, 166/175) corresponded to the musculoskeletal system, while the remaining ones (5.1%, 9/175) corresponded to the non-musculoskeletal system. In addition, the spine, extremities, and thoracic cage accounted for 52.6%, 40.6%, and 1.7% of the musculoskeletal CRRs, respectively. Moreover, most patients presented to the ED (50.3%, 88/175), followed by inpatients (30.9%, 54/175), and outpatients (18.9%, 33/175). The CRR reasons included missed fracture (54.3%), suspected malignancy (16%), clinical emergency (10.3%), unexpected infection/inflammation (11.4%), and others (8%). Furthermore, 11 (6.3%) incidental lesions were not related to the primary imaging purpose. Referring clinicians actively acknowledged 80% of the CRRs. The loss to follow-up action was the highest in the ED patients (35.2%, 31/88; p &lt; 0.001), being significantly higher than that in outpatients (6.1%, 2/33) and inpatients (3.7%, 2/54). Conclusion Missed fractures were the most common cause of musculoskeletal CRRs. ED showed prevalence in musculoskeletal CRRs and reflected the highest loss to follow-up action. ED physicians should pay more attention to CRRs to enhance patient care."
https://openalex.org/W4206544312,"We aimed to determine the risk factors of perioperative drug hypersensitivity reaction (DHR) and develop a predictive score for use in clinical practice.A case-control study was conducted in patients who underwent anesthesia at a tertiary hospital in Thailand, between 2015-2018. DHR cases were graded clinically from 1 to 4 according to the World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists by two anesthesiologists. Controls were randomly matched with cases (ratio 2:1) by age group and month and type of surgery. Patient and anesthesia-related factors and agents given intraoperatively were recorded. A risk score was derived from the coefficients of the significant predictors of the final multivariate logistic regression model. Risk scores, adjusted odds ratios (OR) for perioperative DHR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined.Overall, 325 cases and 650 controls were recruited. The severity of DHR was grade 1 (72.9%), grade 2 (24%), and grade 3 (3.1%). Our risk predictive tools for perioperative DHR provided a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 65%. Predictive scores of subgroups of moderate to severe DHR showed high specificity (80%) but low sensitivity (47%). Common predictors of overall DHR and moderate to severe DHR were history of drug allergy to 2 or more drug categories (score 2.5-3.5), being allergic to analgesics (score 2.5-4.0), and intraoperative morphine use (score of 1). The sole predictor of high-risk perioperative DHR (score â¥3.5) was airway management with an endotracheal tube intubation (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.2-14.4) whereas history of allergic rhinitis (OR 11.7, 95% CI 1.3-105.1) was a predictor of high-risk moderate to severe DHR (score â¥2.5).Our predictive tool for perioperative DHR provided a modest predictive ability. History of drug allergies, rhinitis, morphine use and endotracheal intubation were significant risk factors of DHR after adjusting for age and type of surgery."
