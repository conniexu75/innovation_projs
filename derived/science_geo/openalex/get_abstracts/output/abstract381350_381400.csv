https://openalex.org/W2169123200,"Brown algae (Phaeophyceae) are complex photosynthetic organisms with a very different evolutionary history to green plants, to which they are only distantly related. These seaweeds are the dominant species in rocky coastal ecosystems and they exhibit many interesting adaptations to these, often harsh, environments. Brown algae are also one of only a small number of eukaryotic lineages that have evolved complex multicellularity (Fig. 1). We report the 214 million base pair (Mbp) genome sequence of the filamentous seaweed Ectocarpus siliculosus (Dillwyn) Lyngbye, a model organism for brown algae, closely related to the kelps (Fig. 1). Genome features such as the presence of an extended set of light-harvesting and pigment biosynthesis genes and new metabolic processes such as halide metabolism help explain the ability of this organism to cope with the highly variable tidal environment. The evolution of multicellularity in this lineage is correlated with the presence of a rich array of signal transduction genes. Of particular interest is the presence of a family of receptor kinases, as the independent evolution of related molecules has been linked with the emergence of multicellularity in both the animal and green plant lineages. The Ectocarpus genome sequence represents an important step towards developing this organism as a model species, providing the possibility to combine genomic and genetic approaches to explore these and other aspects of brown algal biology further."

https://openalex.org/W2063007653,"Large-scale genome-wide association (GWA) studies have become an important tool in human genomics, mostly focused on disease but also on adaptive variations such as skin colour. The technique is now shown to be similarly useful in plants. Atwell et al. report a GWA study of over a hundred phenotypes in naturally occurring inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. The results range from significant associations, usually for single genes, to more difficult-to-interpret findings that indicate confounding by complex genetics and population structure. The accompanying paper by Todesco et al. demonstrates the ability of this technique to detect major-effect gene loci. Using forward genetics and GWA analyses, they show that variation at a single locus (ACD6) in Arabidopsis underlies phenotypic variation in vegetative growth as well as resistance to infection. The strong enhancement of resistance mediated by one of the alleles at this locus explains its persistence in natural populations throughout the world, despite it drastically reducing new leaf production. Here, a combination of forward genetics and genome-wide association analyses has been used to show that variation at a single genetic locus in Arabidopsis thaliana underlies phenotypic variation in vegetative growth as well as resistance to infection. The strong enhancement of resistance mediated by one of the alleles at this locus explains the allele's persistence in natural populations throughout the world, even though it drastically reduces the production of new leaves. Plants can defend themselves against a wide array of enemies, from microbes to large animals, yet there is great variability in the effectiveness of such defences, both within and between species. Some of this variation can be explained by conflicting pressures from pathogens with different modes of attack1. A second explanation comes from an evolutionary ‘tug of war’, in which pathogens adapt to evade detection, until the plant has evolved new recognition capabilities for pathogen invasion2,3,4,5. If selection is, however, sufficiently strong, susceptible hosts should remain rare. That this is not the case is best explained by costs incurred from constitutive defences in a pest-free environment6,7,8,9,10,11. Using a combination of forward genetics and genome-wide association analyses, we demonstrate that allelic diversity at a single locus, ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 6 (ACD6)12,13, underpins marked pleiotropic differences in both vegetative growth and resistance to microbial infection and herbivory among natural Arabidopsis thaliana strains. A hyperactive ACD6 allele, compared to the reference allele, strongly enhances resistance to a broad range of pathogens from different phyla, but at the same time slows the production of new leaves and greatly reduces the biomass of mature leaves. This allele segregates at intermediate frequency both throughout the worldwide range of A. thaliana and within local populations, consistent with this allele providing substantial fitness benefits despite its marked impact on growth."

https://openalex.org/W2084914723,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, still represents a major public health threat in many countries. Bioluminescence, the production of light by luciferase-catalyzed reactions, is a versatile reporter technology with multiple applications both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) represents one of its most outstanding uses by allowing the non-invasive localization of luciferase-expressing cells within a live animal. Despite the extensive use of luminescent reporters in mycobacteria, the resultant luminescent strains have not been fully applied to BLI.One of the main obstacles to the use of bioluminescence for in vivo imaging is the achievement of reporter protein expression levels high enough to obtain a signal that can be detected externally. Therefore, as a first step in the application of this technology to the study of mycobacterial infection in vivo, we have optimised the use of firefly, Gaussia and bacterial luciferases in mycobacteria using a combination of vectors, promoters, and codon-optimised genes. We report for the first time the functional expression of the whole bacterial lux operon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. smegmatis thus allowing the development of auto-luminescent mycobacteria. We demonstrate that the Gaussia luciferase is secreted from bacterial cells and that this secretion does not require a signal sequence. Finally we prove that the signal produced by recombinant mycobacteria expressing either the firefly or bacterial luciferases can be non-invasively detected in the lungs of infected mice by bioluminescence imaging.While much work remains to be done, the finding that both firefly and bacterial luciferases can be detected non-invasively in live mice is an important first step to using these reporters to study the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis and other mycobacterial species in vivo. Furthermore, the development of auto-luminescent mycobacteria has enormous ramifications for high throughput mycobacterial drug screening assays which are currently carried out either in a destructive manner using LuxAB or the firefly luciferase."
https://openalex.org/W2086634927,"Within a Kondo lattice, the strong hybridization between electrons localized in real space (r-space) and those delocalized in momentum-space (k-space) generates exotic electronic states called ‘heavy fermions’. In URu2Si2 these effects begin at temperatures around 55 K but they are suddenly altered by an unidentified electronic phase transition at To = 17.5 K. Whether this is conventional ordering of the k-space states, or a change in the hybridization of the r-space states at each U atom, is unknown. Here we use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunnelling microscopy (SI-STM) to image the evolution of URu2Si2 electronic structure simultaneously in r-space and k-space. Above To, the ‘Fano lattice’ electronic structure predicted for Kondo screening of a magnetic lattice is revealed. Below To, a partial energy gap without any associated density-wave signatures emerges from this Fano lattice. Heavy-quasiparticle interference imaging within this gap reveals its cause as the rapid splitting below To of a light k-space band into two new heavy fermion bands. Thus, the URu2Si2 ‘hidden order’ state emerges directly from the Fano lattice electronic structure and exhibits characteristics, not of a conventional density wave, but of sudden alterations in both the hybridization at each U atom and the associated heavy fermion states. A long-standing mystery in condensed matter physics is that of the appearance of a 'hidden order' state in URu2Si2 at low temperature, an unexpected phase change that is accompanied by a sharp change in bulk properties of the material. The problem is related to the appearance of a 'heavy fermion' state (already at a higher temperature) where electron-like charge carriers propagate through the solid with an effective mass thousands of times larger than that of a free electron. Schmidt et al. have now used scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy to visualize the electronic structure of URu2Si2 with subatomic resolution. In the process, they observe the electronic structure associated with a magnetic 'Kondo' lattice, which was assumed to cause heavy fermion effects, but never observed directly. Further, the spectroscopic findings show how the hidden order state evolves with decreasing temperature from this lattice.

https://openalex.org/W1974903823,"The domestication of Asian rice (Oryza sativa) was a complex process punctuated by episodes of introgressive hybridization among and between subpopulations. Deep genetic divergence between the two main varietal groups (Indica and Japonica) suggests domestication from at least two distinct wild populations. However, genetic uniformity surrounding key domestication genes across divergent subpopulations suggests cultural exchange of genetic material among ancient farmers.In this study, we utilize a novel 1,536 SNP panel genotyped across 395 diverse accessions of O. sativa to study genome-wide patterns of polymorphism, to characterize population structure, and to infer the introgression history of domesticated Asian rice. Our population structure analyses support the existence of five major subpopulations (indica, aus, tropical japonica, temperate japonica and GroupV) consistent with previous analyses. Our introgression analysis shows that most accessions exhibit some degree of admixture, with many individuals within a population sharing the same introgressed segment due to artificial selection. Admixture mapping and association analysis of amylose content and grain length illustrate the potential for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits in domesticated plant populations.Genes in these regions control a myriad of traits including plant stature, blast resistance, and amylose content. These analyses highlight the power of population genomics in agricultural systems to identify functionally important regions of the genome and to decipher the role of human-directed breeding in refashioning the genomes of a domesticated species."

https://openalex.org/W1980217038,"Ecological interactions are crucial to understanding both the ecology and the evolution of organisms. Because the phenotypic traits regulating species interactions are largely a legacy of their ancestors, it is widely assumed that ecological interactions are phylogenetically conserved, with closely related species interacting with similar partners. However, the existing empirical evidence is inadequate to appropriately evaluate the hypothesis of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological interactions, because it is both ecologically and taxonomically biased. In fact, most studies on the evolution of ecological interactions have focused on specialized organisms, such as some parasites or insect herbivores, belonging to a limited subset of the overall tree of life. Here we study the evolution of host use in a large and diverse group of interactions comprising both specialist and generalist acellular, unicellular and multicellular organisms. We show that, as previously found for specialized interactions, generalized interactions can be evolutionarily conserved. Significant phylogenetic conservatism of interaction patterns was equally likely to occur in symbiotic and non-symbiotic interactions, as well as in mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Host-use differentiation among species was higher in phylogenetically conserved clades, irrespective of their generalization degree and taxonomic position within the tree of life. Our findings strongly suggest a shared pattern in the organization of biological systems through evolutionary time, mediated by marked conservatism of ecological interactions among taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2038500838,"The role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress has been extensively characterized in the aetiology of sarcopenia (aging-associated loss of muscle mass) and muscle wasting as a result of muscle disuse. What remains less clear is whether the decline in skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity is purely a function of the aging process or if the sedentary lifestyle of older adult subjects has confounded previous reports. The objective of the present study was to investigate if a recreationally active lifestyle in older adults can conserve skeletal muscle strength and functionality, chronic systemic inflammation, mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity, and cellular antioxidant capacity. To that end, muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis of young and age-matched recreationally active older and sedentary older men and women (N = 10/group; ♀ = ♂). We show that a physically active lifestyle is associated with the partial compensatory preservation of mitochondrial biogenesis, and cellular oxidative and antioxidant capacity in skeletal muscle of older adults. Conversely a sedentary lifestyle, associated with osteoarthritis-mediated physical inactivity, is associated with reduced mitochondrial function, dysregulation of cellular redox status and chronic systemic inflammation that renders the skeletal muscle intracellular environment prone to reactive oxygen species-mediated toxicity. We propose that an active lifestyle is an important determinant of quality of life and molecular progression of aging in skeletal muscle of the elderly, and is a viable therapy for attenuating and/or reversing skeletal muscle strength declines and mitochondrial abnormalities associated with aging."
https://openalex.org/W2006818360,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor that regulates fundamental cellular processes in response to changes in oxygen concentration. HIFalpha protein levels are increased in most solid tumours and correlate with patient prognosis. The link between HIF and apoptosis, a major determinant of cancer progression and treatment outcome, is poorly understood. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans HIF-1 protects against DNA-damage-induced germ cell apoptosis by antagonizing the function of CEP-1, the homologue of the tumour suppressor p53. The antiapoptotic property of HIF-1 is mediated by means of transcriptional upregulation of the tyrosinase family member TYR-2 in the ASJ sensory neurons. TYR-2 is secreted by ASJ sensory neurons to antagonize CEP-1-dependent germline apoptosis. Knock down of the TYR-2 homologue TRP2 (also called DCT) in human melanoma cells similarly increases apoptosis, indicating an evolutionarily conserved function. Our findings identify a novel link between hypoxia and programmed cell death, and provide a paradigm for HIF-1 dictating apoptotic cell fate at a distance."

https://openalex.org/W2096803605,"Background The accessory gene regulator (agr) and staphylococcal accessory regulator (sarA) play opposing roles in Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation. There is mounting evidence to suggest that these opposing roles are therapeutically relevant in that mutation of agr results in increased biofilm formation and decreased antibiotic susceptibility while mutation of sarA has the opposite effect. To the extent that induction of agr or inhibition of sarA could potentially be used to limit biofilm formation, this makes it important to understand the epistatic relationships between these two loci. Methodology/Principal Findings We generated isogenic sarA and agr mutants in clinical isolates of S. aureus and assessed the relative impact on biofilm formation. Mutation of agr resulted in an increased capacity to form a biofilm in the 8325-4 laboratory strain RN6390 but had little impact in clinical isolates S. aureus. In contrast, mutation of sarA resulted in a reduced capacity to form a biofilm in all clinical isolates irrespective of the functional status of agr. This suggests that the regulatory role of sarA in biofilm formation is independent of the interaction between sarA and agr and that sarA is epistatic to agr in this context. This was confirmed by demonstrating that restoration of sarA function restored the ability to form a biofilm even in the corresponding agr mutants. Mutation of sarA in clinical isolates also resulted in increased production of extracellular proteases and extracellular nucleases, both of which contributed to the biofilm-deficient phenotype of sarA mutants. However, studies comparing different strains with and without proteases inhibitors and/or mutation of the nuclease genes demonstrated that the agr-independent, sarA-mediated repression of extracellular proteases plays a primary role in this regard. Conclusions and Significance The results we report suggest that inhibitors of sarA-mediated regulation could be used to limit biofilm formation in S. aureus and that the efficacy of such inhibitors would not be limited by spontaneous mutation of agr in the human host."
https://openalex.org/W2027441044,"The relativistic Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution gives a good description of our expanding Universe on the grand scale. But closer to home, where we can observe galactic properties in detail, its predictions go awry. For instance, some of the largest galaxies in our neighbourhood are found in less crowded regions, contrary to standard-model predictions. And the region known as the Local Void contains many fewer galaxies than expected. The observations of nearby galaxies are more understandable if it is assumed that matter forms more rapidly into galaxies and clusters than current theory allows. Jim Peebles and Adi Nusser outline recent efforts by cosmologists to adapt fundamental theory to let new physics operate on the scale of galaxies, yet preserve the properties of the present model on cosmological scales. The relativistic Big Bang theory is a good description of our expanding Universe. But — as discussed in this review article — a still better theory would describe a mechanism by which matter is more rapidly gathered into galaxies and groups of galaxies, better fitting the observations. The great advances in the network of cosmological tests show that the relativistic Big Bang theory is a good description of our expanding Universe. However, the properties of nearby galaxies that can be observed in greatest detail suggest that a better theory would describe a mechanism by which matter is more rapidly gathered into galaxies and groups of galaxies. This more rapid growth occurs in some theoretical ideas now under discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2067878796,"The role of mentorship in protégé performance is a matter of importance to academic, business and governmental organizations. Although the benefits of mentorship for protégés, mentors and their organizations are apparent, the extent to which protégés mimic their mentors' career choices and acquire their mentorship skills is unclear. The importance of a science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce to economic growth and the role of effective mentorship in maintaining a 'healthy' such workforce demand the study of the role of mentorship in academia. Here we investigate one aspect of mentor emulation by studying mentorship fecundity-the number of protégés a mentor trains-using data from the Mathematics Genealogy Project, which tracks the mentorship record of thousands of mathematicians over several centuries. We demonstrate that fecundity among academic mathematicians is correlated with other measures of academic success. We also find that the average fecundity of mentors remains stable over 60 years of recorded mentorship. We further discover three significant correlations in mentorship fecundity. First, mentors with low mentorship fecundities train protégés that go on to have mentorship fecundities 37% higher than expected. Second, in the first third of their careers, mentors with high fecundities train protégés that go on to have fecundities 29% higher than expected. Finally, in the last third of their careers, mentors with high fecundities train protégés that go on to have fecundities 31% lower than expected."
https://openalex.org/W2083760583,"Predicting and abating the loss of natural habitats present a huge challenge in science, conservation and management. Algal forests are globally threatened by loss and severe recruitment failure, but our understanding of resilience in these systems and its potential disruption by anthropogenic factors lags well behind other habitats. We tested hypotheses regarding triggers for decline and recovery potential in subtidal forests of canopy-forming algae of the genus Cystoseira.By using a combination of historical data, and quantitative in situ observations of natural recruitment patterns we suggest that recent declines of forests along the coasts of the north Adriatic Sea were triggered by increasing cumulative impacts of natural- and human-induced habitat instability along with several extreme storm events. Clearing and transplantation experiments subsequently demonstrated that at such advanced stages of ecosystem degradation, increased substratum stability would be essential but not sufficient to reverse the loss, and that for recovery to occur removal of the new dominant space occupiers (i.e., opportunistic species including turf algae and mussels) would be required. Lack of surrounding adult canopies did not seem to impair the potential for assisted recovery, suggesting that in these systems recovery could be actively enhanced even following severe depletions.We demonstrate that sudden habitat loss can be facilitated by long term changes in the biotic and abiotic conditions in the system, that erode the ability of natural ecosystems to absorb and recover from multiple stressors of natural and human origin. Moreover, we demonstrate that the mere restoration of environmental conditions preceding a loss, if possible, may be insufficient for ecosystem restoration, and is scarcely cost-effective. We conclude that the loss of complex marine habitats in human-dominated landscapes could be mitigated with appropriate consideration and management of incremental habitat changes and of attributes facilitating system recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2067323542,"Hibernation and daily torpor are energy- and water-saving adaptations employed to survive unfavourable periods mostly in temperate and arctic environments, but also in tropical and arid climates. Heterothermy has been found in a number of mammalian orders, but within the primates so far it seems to be restricted to one family of Malagasy lemurs. As currently there is no evidence of heterothermy of a primate outside of Madagascar, the aim of our study was to investigate whether small primates from mainland Africa are indeed always homeothermic despite pronounced seasonal changes in weather and food availability.One of the nearest relatives of Malagasy lemurs, the African lesser bushbaby, Galago moholi, which inhabits a highly seasonal habitat with a hot wet-season and a cold dry-season with lower food abundance, was investigated to determine whether it is capable of heterothermy. We measured skin temperature of free-ranging individuals throughout the cool dry season using temperature-sensitive collars as well as metabolic rate in captured individuals. Torpor was employed by 15% of 20 animals. Only one of these animals displayed heterothermy in response to natural availability of food and water, whereas the other animals became torpid without access to food and water.Our results show that G. moholi are physiologically capable of employing torpor. However they do not use it as a routine behaviour, but only under adverse conditions. This reluctance is presumably a result of conflicting selective pressures for energy savings versus other ecological and evolutionary forces, such as reproduction or territory defence. Our results support the view that heterothermy in primates evolved before the division of African and Malagasy Strepsirhini, with the possible implication that more primate species than previously thought might still have the potential to call upon this possibility, if the situation necessitates it."
https://openalex.org/W2128271902,"Background The use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in treating osteosarcoma has improved patients' average 5 year survival rate from 20% to 70% in the past 30 years. However, for patients who progress after chemotherapy, its effectiveness diminishes due to the emergence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) after prolonged therapy. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to overcome both the dose-limiting side effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents and the therapeutic failure resulting from MDR, we designed and evaluated a novel drug delivery system for MDR1 siRNA delivery. Novel biocompatible, lipid-modified dextran-based polymeric nanoparticles were used as the platform for MDR1 siRNA delivery; and the efficacy of combination therapy with this system was evaluated. In this study, multi-drug resistant osteosarcoma cell lines (KHOSR2 and U-2OSR2) were treated with the MDR1 siRNA nanocarriers and MDR1 protein (P-gp) expression, drug retention, and immunofluoresence were analyzed. Combination therapy of the MDR1 siRNA loaded nanocarriers with increasing concentrations of doxorubicin was also analyzed. We observed that MDR1 siRNA loaded dextran nanoparticles efficiently suppresses P-gp expression in the drug resistant osteosarcoma cell lines. The results also demonstrated that this approach may be capable of reversing drug resistance by increasing the amount of drug accumulation in MDR cell lines. Conclusions/Significance Lipid-modified dextran-based polymeric nanoparticles are a promising platform for siRNA delivery. Nanocarriers loaded with MDR1 siRNA are a potential treatment strategy for reversing MDR in osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2022732422,"The melanocortin 1 receptor gene is a main determinant of human pigmentation, and a melanoma susceptibility gene, because its variants that are strongly associated with red hair color increase melanoma risk. To test experimentally the association between melanocortin 1 receptor genotype and melanoma susceptibility, we compared the responses of primary human melanocyte cultures naturally expressing different melanocortin 1 receptor variants to α-melanocortin and ultraviolet radiation. We found that expression of 2 red hair variants abolished the response to α-melanocortin and its photoprotective effects, evidenced by lack of functional coupling of the receptor, and absence of reduction in ultraviolet radiation-induced hydrogen peroxide generation or enhancement of repair of DNA photoproducts, respectively. These variants had different heterozygous effects on receptor function. Microarray data confirmed the observed differences in responses of melanocytes with functional vs. nonfunctional receptor to α-melanocortin and ultraviolet radiation, and identified DNA repair and antioxidant genes that are modulated by α-melanocortin. Our findings highlight the molecular mechanisms by which the melanocortin 1 receptor genotype controls genomic stability of and the mutagenic effect of ultraviolet radiation on human melanocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2042011439,"SNAP25 plays an essential role in neuronal exocytosis pathways. SNAP25a and SNAP25b are alternatively spliced isoforms differing by only nine amino acids, three of which occur within the palmitoylated cysteine-rich domain. SNAP23 is 60% identical to SNAP25 and has a distinct cysteine-rich domain to both SNAP25a and SNAP25b. Despite the conspicuous differences within the palmitoylated domains of these secretory proteins, there is no information on their comparative interactions with palmitoyl transferases. We report that membrane association of all SNAP25/23 proteins is enhanced by Golgi-localized DHHC3, DHHC7, and DHHC17. In contrast, DHHC15 promoted a statistically significant increase in membrane association of only SNAP25b. To investigate the underlying cause of this differential specificity, we examined a SNAP23 point mutant (C79F) designed to mimic the cysteine-rich domain of SNAP25b. DHHC15 promoted a marked increase in membrane binding and palmitoylation of this SNAP23 mutant, demonstrating that the distinct cysteine-rich domains of SNAP25/23 contribute to differential interactions with DHHC15. The lack of activity of DHHC15 toward wild-type SNAP23 was not overcome by replacing its DHHC domain with that from DHHC3, suggesting that substrate specificity is not determined by the DHHC domain alone. Interestingly, DHHC2, which is closely related to DHHC15, associates with the plasma membrane in PC12 cells and can palmitoylate all SNAP25 isoforms. DHHC2 is, thus, a candidate enzyme to regulate SNAP25/23 palmitoylation dynamics at the plasma membrane. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of specific Golgi-localized DHHC proteins active against SNAP25/23 proteins perturbs the normal secretion of human growth hormone from PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2069047064,"In platelets, STIM1 has been recognized as the key regulatory protein in store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) with Orai1 as principal Ca(2+) entry channel. Both proteins contribute to collagen-dependent arterial thrombosis in mice in vivo. It is unclear whether STIM2 is involved. A key platelet response relying on Ca(2+) entry is the surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), which accomplishes platelet procoagulant activity. We studied this response in mouse platelets deficient in STIM1, STIM2, or Orai1. Upon high shear flow of blood over collagen, Stim1(-/-) and Orai1(-/-) platelets had greatly impaired glycoprotein (GP) VI-dependent Ca(2+) signals, and they were deficient in PS exposure and thrombus formation. In contrast, Stim2(-/-) platelets reacted normally. Upon blood flow in the presence of thrombin generation and coagulation, Ca(2+) signals of Stim1(-/-) and Orai1(-/-) platelets were partly reduced, whereas the PS exposure and formation of fibrin-rich thrombi were normalized. Washed Stim1(-/-) and Orai1(-/-) platelets were deficient in GPVI-induced PS exposure and prothrombinase activity, but not when thrombin was present as co-agonist. Markedly, SKF96365, a blocker of (receptor-operated) Ca(2+) entry, inhibited Ca(2+) and procoagulant responses even in Stim1(-/-) and Orai1(-/-) platelets. These data show for the first time that: (i) STIM1 and Orai1 jointly contribute to GPVI-induced SOCE, procoagulant activity, and thrombus formation; (ii) a compensating Ca(2+) entry pathway is effective in the additional presence of thrombin; (iii) platelets contain two mechanisms of Ca(2+) entry and PS exposure, only one relying on STIM1-Orai1 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2058226842,"Background Massive die-offs of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) have been occurring since 2006 in hibernation sites around Albany, New York, and this problem has spread to other States in the Northeastern United States. White cottony fungal growth is seen on the snouts of affected animals, a prominent sign of White Nose Syndrome (WNS). A previous report described the involvement of the fungus Geomyces destructans in WNS, but an identical fungus was recently isolated in France from a bat that was evidently healthy. The fungus has been recovered sparsely despite plentiful availability of afflicted animals. Methodology/Principal Findings We have investigated 100 bat and environmental samples from eight affected sites in 2008. Our findings provide strong evidence for an etiologic role of G. destructans in bat WNS. (i) Direct smears from bat snouts, Periodic Acid Schiff-stained tissue sections from infected tissues, and scanning electron micrographs of bat tissues all showed fungal structures similar to those of G. destructans. (ii) G. destructans DNA was directly amplified from infected bat tissues, (iii) Isolations of G. destructans in cultures from infected bat tissues showed 100% DNA match with the fungus present in positive tissue samples. (iv) RAPD patterns for all G. destructans cultures isolated from two sites were indistinguishable. (v) The fungal isolates showed psychrophilic growth. (vi) We identified in vitro proteolytic activities suggestive of known fungal pathogenic traits in G. destructans. Conclusions/Significance Further studies are needed to understand whether G. destructans WNS is a symptom or a trigger for bat mass mortality. The availability of well-characterized G. destructans strains should promote an understanding of bat–fungus relationships, and should aid in the screening of biological and chemical control agents."
https://openalex.org/W2058358490,"Background Predators preferentially attack vital body parts to avoid prey escape. Consequently, prey adaptations that make predators attack less crucial body parts are expected to evolve. Marginal eyespots on butterfly wings have long been thought to have this deflective, but hitherto undemonstrated function. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report that a butterfly, Lopinga achine, with broad-spectrum reflective white scales in its marginal eyespot pupils deceives a generalist avian predator, the blue tit, to attack the marginal eyespots, but only under particular conditions—in our experiments, low light intensities with a prominent UV component. Under high light intensity conditions with a similar UV component, and at low light intensities without UV, blue tits directed attacks towards the butterfly head. Conclusions/Significance In nature, birds typically forage intensively at early dawn, when the light environment shifts to shorter wavelengths, and the contrast between the eyespot pupils and the background increases. Among butterflies, deflecting attacks is likely to be particularly important at dawn when low ambient temperatures make escape by flight impossible, and when insectivorous birds typically initiate another day's search for food. Our finding that the deflective function of eyespots is highly dependent on the ambient light environment helps explain why previous attempts have provided little support for the deflective role of marginal eyespots, and we hypothesize that the mechanism that we have discovered in our experiments in a laboratory setting may function also in nature when birds forage on resting butterflies under low light intensities."
https://openalex.org/W2076138863,"IL-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine bridging innate and adaptive immunity by playing a role in the activation of naive T cells and in development of Th1 cells. Additionally, recent evidence supports a role for IL-27 in the activation of monocytic cells. Both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities have been attributed to IL-27; however, the role played by IL-27 in the activation of human monocytic cells in terms of cytokine production has not been well described. Our results show that IL-27 is a strong inducer of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression, including enhancement of IL-6, IP-10, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and TNF-alpha expression in human primary monocytes. Furthermore, we observed that IL-27-induced cytokine and chemokine production was mediated by STAT1, STAT3, and NF-kappaB activation. Understanding how IL-27 exerts its effects on monocytic cells will identify important molecular mechanisms in the regulation of immune responses, particularly in the modulation of monocyte activation."
https://openalex.org/W2080347068,"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a multifunctional glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney and cardiovascular diseases. Although transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is a known inducer of PAI-1, how it controls PAI-1 expression remains enigmatic. Here we investigated the mechanism underlying TGF-β1 regulation of PAI-1 in kidney tubular epithelial cells (HKC-8). Surprisingly, overexpression of Smad2 or Smad3 in HKC-8 cells blocked PAI-1 induction by TGF-β1, whereas knockdown of them sensitized the cells to TGF-β1 stimulation, suggesting that Smad signaling is not responsible for PAI-1 induction. Blockade of several TGF-β1 downstream pathways such as p38 MAPK or JNK, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and ERK1/2, only partially inhibited PAI-1 expression. TGF-β1 stimulated β-catenin activation in tubular epithelial cells, and ectopic expression of β-catenin induced PAI-1 expression, whereas inhibition of β-catenin abolished its induction. A functional T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-binding site was identified in the promoter region of the PAI-1 gene, which interacted with T cell factor upon β-catenin activation. Deletion or site-directed mutation of this site abolished PAI-1 response to β-catenin or TGF-β1 stimulation. Similarly, ectopic expression of Wnt1 also activated PAI-1 expression and promoter activity. In vivo, PAI-1 was induced in kidney tubular epithelia in obstructive nephropathy. Delivery of Wnt1 gene activated β-catenin and promoted PAI-1 expression after obstructive injury, whereas blockade of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by Dickkopf-1 gene inhibited PAI-1 induction. Collectively, these studies identify PAI-1 as a direct downstream target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and demonstrate that PAI-1 induction could play a role in mediating the fibrogenic action of this signaling. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a multifunctional glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney and cardiovascular diseases. Although transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is a known inducer of PAI-1, how it controls PAI-1 expression remains enigmatic. Here we investigated the mechanism underlying TGF-β1 regulation of PAI-1 in kidney tubular epithelial cells (HKC-8). Surprisingly, overexpression of Smad2 or Smad3 in HKC-8 cells blocked PAI-1 induction by TGF-β1, whereas knockdown of them sensitized the cells to TGF-β1 stimulation, suggesting that Smad signaling is not responsible for PAI-1 induction. Blockade of several TGF-β1 downstream pathways such as p38 MAPK or JNK, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and ERK1/2, only partially inhibited PAI-1 expression. TGF-β1 stimulated β-catenin activation in tubular epithelial cells, and ectopic expression of β-catenin induced PAI-1 expression, whereas inhibition of β-catenin abolished its induction. A functional T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-binding site was identified in the promoter region of the PAI-1 gene, which interacted with T cell factor upon β-catenin activation. Deletion or site-directed mutation of this site abolished PAI-1 response to β-catenin or TGF-β1 stimulation. Similarly, ectopic expression of Wnt1 also activated PAI-1 expression and promoter activity. In vivo, PAI-1 was induced in kidney tubular epithelia in obstructive nephropathy. Delivery of Wnt1 gene activated β-catenin and promoted PAI-1 expression after obstructive injury, whereas blockade of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by Dickkopf-1 gene inhibited PAI-1 induction. Collectively, these studies identify PAI-1 as a direct downstream target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and demonstrate that PAI-1 induction could play a role in mediating the fibrogenic action of this signaling.

Aside from its classical role in inhibiting the activity of tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators, PAI-1 influences numerous cellular behaviors via diverse mechanisms. It binds with high affinity to extracellular protein vitronectin, thereby modulating its interaction with αvβ3 integrin. PAI-1 is also known to bind to urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor complex on the cell surface, regulating internalization and intracellular signaling (1Eddy A.A. Fogo A.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 2999-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Through a multitude of actions, PAI-1 plays an important role in diverse cellular processes such as cell migration, wound healing, tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. It becomes increasingly clear that the functions of PAI-1 extend far beyond its ability to block plasminogen activation.PAI-1 is expressed in almost all cell types, predominantly in endothelial cells, adipocytes, and hepatocytes (3Nagamine Y.

In the past several years, extensive experimental studies using genetically modified animal models have revealed that PAI-1 is a powerful fibrogenic factor that promotes inflammatory cell recruitment and extracellular matrix accumulation (1Eddy A.A.

Conversely, transgenic mice with PAI-1 overexpression are more susceptible to renal injury and develop more severe fibrotic lesions than wild-type controls (11Kitching A.R. Kong Y.Z. Huang X.R.

Based on these findings, PAI-1 has been proposed as a promising therapeutic target for developing new strategies for treatment of progressive kidney diseases (1Eddy A.A. Fogo A.B. J. Am. Soc.

Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F1045-F1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).The expression of PAI-1 in kidney tissues is tightly controlled by a diverse array of signals, such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), angiotensin II, and other extracellular cues (3Nagamine Y. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 100: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Nakamura S. Nakamura I. Ma L. Vaughan D.E. Fogo A.B. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 251-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In light of an increased production of these pathogenic factors in diseased kidneys (15Liu Y. Kidney Int. 2006; 69: 213-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 16Böttinger E.P. Semin. Nephrol. 2007; 27: 309-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), up-regulation of PAI-1 likely represents a convergent pathway that mediates their fibrogenic actions. Of many extracellular cues regulating PAI-1 expression, TGF-β1 is the most studied and is considered a major and potent inducer under pathologic conditions. However, the mechanism governing TGF-β1 regulation of PAI-1 expression remains poorly understood.In this study, we have investigated the regulation of the PAI-1 gene by TGF-β1 in kidney tubular epithelial cells. Unexpectedly, we show that Smads, the principal downstream mediators of TGF-β1 signaling (17Massagué J. Gomis R.R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), actually inhibit TGF-β1-mediated PAI-1 induction. We further demonstrate that the canonical pathway of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is activated in fibrotic kidneys (18He W. Dai C. Li Y. Zeng G. Monga S.P. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), is responsible, at least partially, for PAI-1 induction. Our studies identify PAI-1 as a direct downstream target of the canonical pathway of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and unravel a potential mechanism underlying this signal pathway in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis.DISCUSSIONPAI-1 is arguably one of the most studied TGF-β-targeted genes (3Nagamine Y. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 100: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism and intracellular mediators dictating PAI-1 gene regulation by TGF-β1 remain incompletely understood. In this study, we have presented compelling evidence suggesting that PAI-1 is a transcriptional target of the canonical pathway of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence. First, overexpression of stabilized β-catenin in kidney tubular epithelial cells induces PAI-1 expression under both basal and TGF-β1-stimulated conditions. Second, inhibition of β-catenin by small molecule inhibitor abolishes PAI-1 induction by TGF-β1. Third, the PAI-1 gene promoter region harbors a functional TBE, which mediates the interaction with TCF in response to β-catenin activation. Fourth, activation of β-catenin by overexpressing Wnt1 induces PAI-1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Finally, modulation of β-catenin signaling by ectopic expression of DKK1 inhibits PAI-1 gene expression in kidney tubular epithelia in vivo. Given that TGF-β1 activates β-catenin in tubular epithelial cells, this signal pathway likely plays an important role in mediating TGF-β1-triggered PAI-1 induction. Collectively, our present study provides significant and novel insights into the mechanism governing PAI-1 gene regulation. Furthermore, these results suggest that PAI-1 induction could play a critical role in mediating the fibrogenic action of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in kidney development and the pathogenesis of various kinds of renal diseases (18He W. Dai C. Li Y. Zeng G. Monga S.P. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 22Dai C. Stolz D.B. Kiss L.P. Monga S.P. Holzman L.B. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc.

Wnt signal is transmitted through their receptors, the Frizzled (Fzd) family of proteins, and coreceptors, members of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 or -6. Upon binding to their plasma membrane receptors, Wnt proteins induce a series of downstream signaling events, resulting in dephosphorylation of β-catenin. This leads to the stabilization of β-catenin, rendering it to translocate into the nuclei, where it binds to TCF/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor and recruits the coactivator and its associated transcriptional machinery to initiate the expression of the Wnt-targeted genes (37Huang H. He X. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 38White B.D. Nguyen N.K. Moon R.T. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the majority of 19 different Wnt genes are up-regulated with distinct patterns in the kidneys after obstructive injury, which leads to a dramatic accumulation and activation of β-catenin, predominantly in renal tubular epithelia (18He W. Dai C. Li Y. Zeng G. Monga S.P. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Such an activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in diseased kidney is clearly associated with the pathogenesis of renal fibrotic lesions (40Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2010; 21: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), because inhibition of the canonical Wnt signaling by DKK1 reduces renal fibrosis in the mouse model of obstructive nephropathy. This notion is further strengthened by the present study demonstrating that PAI-1 is a transcriptional target of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.Our finding that Smad2 and Smad3 inhibit PAI-1 induction is quite surprising, in view of the fact that Smads are the principal downstream effectors of TGF-β1 signaling. Upon binding to its Type II and type I receptors, TGF-β1 triggers Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation at serine residues in the C termini, induces their association with common partner Smad4 and subsequently translocation into the nuclei, where they control the transcription of TGF-β1-responsive genes (17Massagué J. Gomis R.R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 41Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). Although there are so-called CAGA boxes, also known as SBE, in the PAI-1 gene promoter region (42Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar), overexpression of either Smad2 or Smad3 in tubular epithelial cells does not stimulate PAI-1 induction in response to TGF-β1. Rather, Smads significantly block endogenous PAI-1 induction (Fig. 1). This unexpected observation is confirmed by knocking down of endogenous Smads using siRNA strategy (Fig. 2). The exact reasons behind the discrepancy between this study and previous reports regarding the role of Smads in PAI-1 expression are unknown. It could simply reflect the differences in cell types and cellular contexts, because Smad signaling is well known for its ability to cross-talk with other signal inputs (43Zhang X. Yang J. Li Y. Liu Y. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2005; 288: F16-F26Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 44Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that many previous studies on PAI-1 gene regulation solely rely on a highly artificial system to perform functional analysis of its promoter, in which multiple (often 9–12) copies of SBE were linked to a heterologous promoter (42Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 45Lu Z. Lam K.S. Wang N. Xu X. Cortes M. Andersen B. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2920-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It remains an open question whether this kind of artificial promoter-reporter assay truly imitates the endogenous gene regulation. On the contrary, the present study demonstrates that endogenous PAI-1 gene expression in tubular epithelial cells is suppressed by Smad signaling.TGF-β1 is capable of activating multiple downstream signal pathways, including Smad, PI3K, MAPK, and β-catenin. Besides Smad signaling, PI3K also negatively regulates PAI-1 expression, because its inhibition leads to an exaggerated PAI-1 induction in response to TGF-β1 stimulation (Fig. 3). This is consistent with earlier reports showing that PI3K inhibits PAI-1 gene expression in vascular endothelial cells and adipocytes (46Mukai Y. Wang C.Y. Rikitake Y. Liao J.K. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H1937-H1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 47Venugopal J. Hanashiro K. Nagamine Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears clear that some branches of the TGF-β1 downstream signals, such as Smad and PI3K, actually inhibit PAI-1 induction in tubular epithelial cells. Of note, in addition to β-catenin signaling, p38 MAPK and JNK, but not ERK-1/2, are imperative in stimulating PAI-1 expression (Fig. 3). Because the PAI-1 gene promoter also harbors a functional AP1 site, it is not surprising that MAPK signal pathway also plays a role in regulating PAI-1 induction after TGF-β1 stimulation. Taken together, multiple negative and positive signal pathways downstream of TGF-β1 participate in PAI-1 gene regulation, creating a multifaceted regulatory system with great complexity and versatility.Despite a negative regulation by Smad and PI3K signals, the net effect of TGF-β1 stimulation in tubular epithelial cells is a dramatic induction of PAI-1 expression, underscoring the strength of the positive signals elicited by β-catenin, p38 MAPK, and JNK for PAI-1 induction. In tubular epithelial cells overexpressing β-catenin, inhibition of p38 MAPK or JNK also repressed PAI-1 expression under both basal and TGF-β1-stimulated conditions, suggesting that β-catenin and these MAPK signals may cross-talk and work in concert to up-regulate PAI expression (48Bikkavilli R.K. Malbon C.C. Commun. Integr. Biol. 2009; 2: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is of interest to point out that p38 MAPK has been shown to directly phosphorylate GSK-3β at its C terminus, leading to its inactivation and subsequent β-catenin stabilization and accumulation (49Thornton T.M. Pedraza-Alva G. Deng B. Wood C.D. Aronshtam A. Clements J.L. Sabio G. Davis R.J. Matthews D.E. Doble B. Rincon M. Science. 2008; 320: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 50Bikkavilli R.K. Feigin M.E. Malbon C.C. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3598-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, β-catenin could theoretically mediate the action of p38 MAPK in inducing PAI-1 expression after TGF-β1 stimulation. Of note, we cannot exclude the possibility that a noncanonical pathway of Wnt may also play a role in regulating PAI-1 expression through activation of p38 MAPK and JNK signaling (51Caverzasio J. Manen D. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 5323-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 52Saadeddin A. Babaei-Jadidi R. Spencer-Dene B. Nateri A.S. Mol.

Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1110-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).In summary, we have shown herein that PAI-1 is a direct transcriptional target of the canonical pathway of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. By inducing this powerful fibrogenic factor, Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a critical role in promoting the development and progression of renal fibrotic lesions. In addition, this signaling is known to induce the expression of numerous fibrosis-related genes such as fibronectin, Snail, and Twist in kidney cells (18He W. Dai C. Li Y. Zeng G. Monga S.P. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 22Dai C. Stolz D.B. Kiss L.P. Monga S.P. Holzman L.B. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In this context, it is desirable to develop feasible and specific strategies to constrain Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vivo and to test their ability to inhibit the progression of chronic kidney diseases.

Renal Physiol. 2009; 297: F1045-F1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).The expression of PAI-1 in kidney tissues is tightly controlled by a diverse array of signals, such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), angiotensin II, and other extracellular cues (3Nagamine Y. Thromb. Haemost. 2008; 100: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Nakamura S. Nakamura I. Ma L. Vaughan D.E. Fogo A.B.

Kidney Int. 2006; 69: 213-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 16Böttinger E.P. Semin. Nephrol. 2007; 27: 309-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), up-regulation of PAI-1 likely represents a convergent pathway that mediates their fibrogenic actions. Of many extracellular cues regulating PAI-1 expression, TGF-β1 is the most studied and is considered a major and potent inducer under pathologic conditions. However, the mechanism governing TGF-β1 regulation of PAI-1 expression remains poorly understood.In this study, we have investigated the regulation of the PAI-1 gene by TGF-β1 in kidney tubular epithelial cells. Unexpectedly, we show that Smads, the principal downstream mediators of TGF-β1 signaling (17Massagué J. Gomis R.R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), actually inhibit TGF-β1-mediated PAI-1 induction. We further demonstrate that the canonical pathway of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which is activated in fibrotic kidneys (18He W. Dai C. Li Y. Zeng G. Monga S.P. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), is responsible, at least partially, for PAI-1 induction. Our studies identify PAI-1 as a direct downstream target of the canonical pathway of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and unravel a potential mechanism underlying this signal pathway in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis.

We have previously shown that daily ingestion of Lactobacillus reuteri (LR) for 9 d inhibits the pseudoaffective cardiac response and spinal single-fiber discharge evoked by visceral distension, and decreases intestinal motility and myenteric AH cell slow afterhy-perpolarization (sAHP) by inhibiting a Ca-activated K (IKCa) channel. We tested whether luminal LR could acutely decrease motility in an ex vivo perfusion model of naive Balb/c jejunum. Live LR dose dependently decreased motor complex pressure wave amplitudes with 9- to 16-min onset latency and an IC50 of 5 × 107 cells/ml Krebs. Heat-killed LR or another live commensal, Lactobacillus salivarius, were without effect. The IKCa channel blocker TRAM-34, but neither the opener (DCEBIO) nor the hyperpolarization-activated cationic channel inhibitor ZD7288 (5 µM) (or TTX 1 µM), mimicked the LR effect on motility acutely ex vivo. We provide evidence for a rapid, strain-specific, dose-dependent action of a live Lactobacillus on small intestinal motility reflexes that recapitulates the long-term effects of LR ingestion. These observations may be useful as a first step to unraveling the pathways involved in bacteria to the nervous system communication.—Wang, B., Mao, Y.-K., Diorio, C., Pasyk, M., Wu, R.Y., Bienenstock, J., Kunze, W.

https://openalex.org/W2007423023,"The insulin receptor exists as two isoforms, IR-A and IR-B, which result from alternative splicing of exon 11 in the primary transcript. These two isoforms show a cell-specific distribution, and their relative proportions also vary during development, aging, and in different disease states. We have previously demonstrated that both intron 10 and the alternatively spliced exon 11 contain regulatory sequences that affect insulin receptor splicing both positively and negatively and that these sequences bind the serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins SRp20 and SF2/ASF and the CELF protein CUG-BP1. In this study, we describe a new intronic splicing element within intron 11 that is highly conserved across species. Using minigenes carrying deletion mutations within intron 11, we demonstrated that this sequence functions as an intronic splicing enhancer. We subsequently used RNA affinity chromatography to identify Mbnl1 as a splicing factor that recognizes this enhancer. By ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation, we also established that Mbnl1 binds specifically to the INSR (insulin receptor gene) RNA. Overexpression or knockdown of Mbnl1 in hepatoma and embryonic kidney cells altered the levels of exon 11 inclusion. Finally, we showed that deletion of the intronic enhancer eliminates the ability of Mbnl1 to promote exon inclusion. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a role for Mbnl1 in controlling insulin receptor exon 11 inclusion via binding to a downstream intronic enhancer element."
https://openalex.org/W2049345261,"Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the main cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. Bacterial surface proteins play a major role in GBS binding to and invasion of different host surfaces. The scpB and lmb genes, coding for fibronectin-binding and laminin-binding surface proteins, are present in almost all human GBS isolates. The scpB-lmb intergenic region is a hot spot for integration of two mobile genetic elements (MGEs): the insertion element IS1548 or the group II intron GBSi1. We studied the structure of scpB-lmb intergenic region in 111 GBS isolates belonging to the intraspecies major clonal complexes (CCs). IS1548 was mostly found (72.2%) in CC19 serotype III strains recovered more specifically (92.3%) from neonatal meningitis. GBSi1 was principally found (70.6%) in CC17 strains, mostly (94.4%) of serotype III, but also (15.7%) in CC19 strains, mostly (87.5%) of serotype II. No MGE was found in most strains of the other CCs (76.0%), notably CC23, CC10 and CC1. Twenty-six strains representing these three genetic configurations were selected to investigate the transcription and expression levels of scpB and lmb genes. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that lmb transcripts were 5.0- to 9.6-fold higher in the group of strains with IS1548 than in the other two groups of strains (P<0.001). Accordingly, the binding ability to laminin was 3.8- to 6.6-fold higher in these strains (P< or =0.001). Moreover, Lmb amount expressed on the cell surface was 2.4- to 2.7-fold greater in these strains (P<0.001). By contrast, scpB transcript levels and fibronectin binding ability were similar in the three groups of strains. Deletion of the IS1548 sequence between scpB and lmb genes in a CC19 serotype III GBS strain substantially reduced the transcription of lmb gene (13.5-fold), the binding ability to laminin (6.2-fold), and the expression of Lmb protein (5.0-fold). These data highlight the importance of MGEs in bacterial virulence and demonstrate the up-regulation of lmb gene by IS1548; the increased lmb gene expression observed in CC19 serotype III strains with IS1548 may play a role in their ability to cause neonatal meningitis and endocarditis."
https://openalex.org/W2064597790,"Mechanisms by which HIV affects the thymus are multiple and only partially known, and the role of thymic dysfunction in HIV/AIDS immunopathogenesis remains poorly understood. To evaluate the effects of HIV infection on intra-thymic precursors of T cells in HIV-infected adults, we conducted a detailed immunophenotypic study of thymic tissue isolated from 7 HIV-infected and 10 HIV-negative adults who were to undergo heart surgery. We found that thymuses of HIV-infected individuals were characterized by a relative depletion of CD4+ single positive T cells and a corresponding enrichment of CD8+ single positive T cells. In addition, thymocytes derived from HIV-infected subjects showed increased levels of activated and proliferating cells. Our analysis also revealed a decreased expression of interleukin-7 receptor in early thymocytes from HIV-infected individuals, along with an increase in this same expression in mature double- and single-positive cells. Frequency of regulatory T cells (CD25+FoxP3+) was significantly increased in HIV-infected thymuses, particularly in priorly-committed CD4 single positive cells. Our data suggest that HIV infection is associated with a complex set of changes in the immunophenotype of thymocytes, including a reduction of intrathymic CD4+ T cell precursors, increased expression of activation markers, changes in the expression pattern of IL-7R and enrichment of T regulatory cells generation."
https://openalex.org/W2077512363,"Reversible protein phosphorylation is a prevalent signaling mechanism which modulates cellular metabolism in response to changing environmental conditions. In this study, we focus on previously uncharacterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ser/Thr protein kinase (STPK) PknJ, a putative transmembrane protein. PknJ is shown to possess autophosphorylation activity and is also found to be capable of carrying out phosphorylation on the artificial substrate myelin basic protein (MyBP). Previous studies have shown that the autophosphorylation activity of M. tuberculosis STPKs is dependent on the conserved residues in the activation loop. However, our results show that apart from the conventional conserved residues, additional residues in the activation loop may also play a crucial role in kinase activation. Further characterization of PknJ reveals that the kinase utilizes unusual ions (Ni(2+), Co(2+)) as cofactors, thus hinting at a novel mechanism for PknJ activation. Additionally, as shown for other STPKs, we observe that PknJ possesses the capability to dimerize. In order to elucidate the signal transduction cascade emanating from PknJ, the M. tuberculosis membrane-associated protein fraction is treated with the active kinase and glycolytic enzyme Pyruvate kinase A (mtPykA) is identified as one of the potential substrates of PknJ. The phospholabel is found to be localized on serine and threonine residue(s), with Ser(37) identified as one of the sites of phosphorylation. Since Pyk is known to catalyze the last step of glycolysis, our study shows that the fundamental pathways such as glycolysis can also be governed by STPK-mediated signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2159318264,"Fat storage-Inducing Transmembrane proteins 1 & 2 (FIT1/FITM1 and FIT2/FITM2) belong to a unique family of evolutionarily conserved proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum that are involved in triglyceride lipid droplet formation. FIT proteins have been shown to mediate the partitioning of cellular triglyceride into lipid droplets, but not triglyceride biosynthesis. FIT proteins do not share primary sequence homology with known proteins and no structural information is available to inform on the mechanism by which FIT proteins function. Here, we present the experimentally-solved topological models for FIT1 and FIT2 using N-glycosylation site mapping and indirect immunofluorescence techniques. These methods indicate that both proteins have six-transmembrane-domains with both N- and C-termini localized to the cytosol. Utilizing this model for structure-function analysis, we identified and characterized a gain-of-function mutant of FIT2 (FLL(157-9)AAA) in transmembrane domain 4 that markedly augmented the total number and mean size of lipid droplets. Using limited-trypsin proteolysis we determined that the FLL(157-9)AAA mutant has enhanced trypsin cleavage at K86 relative to wild-type FIT2, indicating a conformational change. Taken together, these studies indicate that FIT2 is a 6 transmembrane domain-containing protein whose conformation likely regulates its activity in mediating lipid droplet formation."
https://openalex.org/W2027634841,"Straight chain fatty acid α-oxidation increases during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, leading to a marked accumulation of odd chain length fatty acyl moieties. Potential roles of this pathway in adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis are unknown. Mammalian fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) was recently identified and suggested to catalyze the initial step of straight chain fatty acid α-oxidation. Accordingly, we examined whether FA2H modulates adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis in mature adipocytes. FA2H level markedly increases during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and small interfering RNAs against FA2H inhibit the differentiation process. In mature adipocytes, depletion of FA2H inhibits basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and lipogenesis, which are partially rescued by the enzymatic product of FA2H, 2-hydroxy palmitic acid. Expression of fatty-acid synthase and SCD1 was decreased in FA2H-depleted cells, and levels of GLUT4 and insulin receptor proteins were reduced. 2-Hydroxy fatty acids are enriched in cellular sphingolipids, which are components of membrane rafts. Accelerated diffusional mobility of raft-associated lipids was shown to enhance degradation of GLUT4 and insulin receptor in adipocytes. Consistent with this, depletion of FA2H appeared to increase raft lipid mobility as it significantly accelerated the rates of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements of lipid rafts labeled with Alexa 488-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B. Moreover, the enhanced recovery rates were partially reversed by treatment with 2-hydroxy palmitic acid.

Peroxisomal α-oxidation produces fatty acyl moieties with one less carbon (odd chain length) without generating acetyl-CoA (1Foulon V. Sniekers M. Huysmans E. Asselberghs S. Mahieu V. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Casteels M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9802-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is well known that peroxisomal α-oxidation is important for catabolism of branched-chain FA and also for very long chain FA (2Wanders R.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Its contribution to catabolism of other long chain FA is not known, so its role in whole cell energy homeostasis remains unclear. There is evidence for up-regulation of FA α-oxidation during the preadipocyte to adipocyte transition as cells begin accumulating lipids. Using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry, we and others demonstrated during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells a marked increase in activity of peroxisomal FA α-oxidation, which was reflected in accumulation of odd chain length acyl moieties in major lipid species (3Su X. Han X. Yang J. Mancuso D.J. Chen J. Bickel P.E. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5033-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 4Roberts L.D. Virtue S. Vidal-Puig A. Nicholls A.W. Griffin J.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 39: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanisms for this change and the functions of the α-oxidation pathway in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism in mature adipocytes have not been explored.Although straight chain FA α-oxidation was first reported in 1964 (5Levis G.M. Mead J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 77-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a detailed understanding of the enzymatic pathway is still unclear. It was postulated that α-oxidation is initiated by 2-hydroxylation of free FA, followed by thioesterification, formation of aldehyde, and dehydrogenation to form an FA with one less carbon. The FA can then undergo more α-oxidation cycles or be incorporated into lipid species (1Foulon V. Sniekers M. Huysmans E. Asselberghs S. Mahieu V. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Casteels M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9802-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Hama H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1801: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Another effect of active α-oxidation is to increase the proportion of lipids with shorter acyl chains and acyl chains with modifications (e.g. 2-hydroxy FA (2-OH FA)). The physiological significance of these changes in lipid composition has not been explored.In mammalian cells, two types of fatty acid 2-hydroxylase have been identified, phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (7Wanders R.J. Jansen G.A. Lloyd M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) (8Alderson N.L. Rembiesa B.M. Walla M.D. Bielawska A. Bielawski J. Hama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48562-48568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9Eckhardt M. Yaghootfam A. Fewou S.N. Zöller I. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase is an α-ketoglutarate-dependent acyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase, and its primary function is the degradation of 3-methyl FA, which cannot be degraded by β-oxidation pathway (7Wanders R.J. Jansen G.A. Lloyd M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Previous reports on the enzymatic activity of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase on straight chain fatty acids or their CoA esters are controversial (10Mukherji M. Kershaw N.J. Schofield C.J. Wierzbicki A.S. Lloyd M.D. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Foulon V. Asselberghs S. Geens W. Mannaerts G.P. Casteels M. Van Veldhoven P.P. J.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, its roles in 2-hydroxylation and α-oxidation of straight chain FA are not clear. Mammalian FA2H is an NAD(P)H-dependent monooxygenase that was cloned independently by two research groups (8Alderson N.L. Rembiesa B.M. Walla M.D. Bielawska A. Bielawski J. Hama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48562-48568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9Eckhardt M. Yaghootfam A. Fewou S.N. Zöller I. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Mammalian sphingolipids are enriched in 2-OH FA generated by FA2H (6Hama H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1801: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids are important constituents of membrane raft domains that are thought to coordinate intracellular trafficking and signaling (13Lingwood D. Simons K. Science. 2010; 327: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). FA2H is highly expressed in brain and epidermis. Absence of 2-OH FA sphingolipids has no effect on neural development but causes late-onset axon and myelin sheath degeneration (14Zöller I. Meixner M. Hartmann D. Büssow H. Meyer R. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9741-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the epidermis, 2-OH FA ceramides are essential for the permeability barrier function, and FA2H provides the precursor 2-OH FA for their synthesis. Interestingly, FA2H is required for epidermal lamellar membrane formation during keratinocyte differentiation (15Uchida Y. Hama H. Alderson N.L. Douangpanya S. Wang Y. Crumrine D.A. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13211-13219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Physiological functions of FA2H in other cell types/organs are largely unknown.In this study, we focused on FA2H, which catalyzes the initial step of the FA α-oxidation pathway, resulting in production of 2-OH FA. We studied the regulation of FA2H during adipocyte differentiation and asked whether it influences lipogenesis in mature adipocytes. Lateral mobility of raft-associated lipids might be important in adipogenesis because enhanced raft lipid mobility accelerates the trafficking of GLUT4 to lysosomes and its degradation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16González-Muñoz E. López-Iglesias C. Calvo M. Palacín M. Zorzano A. Camps M. Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 3493-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we also evaluated the importance of FA2H in regulating lateral mobility of raft-associated lipids, co-localization of GLUT4 with lysosomes and GLUT4 protein levels.DISCUSSIONLipid rafts are plasma membrane microdomains that are highly enriched with cholesterol and sphingolipids. A variety of receptors, transporters, and other proteins assemble in these nanoscale compartments to provide platforms that function in membrane signaling and trafficking (36Hanzal-Bayer M.F. Hancock J.F. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 37Laude A.J. Prior I.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 38Bickel P.E. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E1-E10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lateral mobility of membrane lipids and proteins plays important roles in regulating their internalization and intracellular trafficking (34Kwik J. Boyle S. Fooksman D. Margolis L. Sheetz M.P. Edidin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13964-13969Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 39Roettger B.F. Pinon D.I. Burghardt T.P. Miller L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C539-C547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly of the rafts is determined largely by lipid structures and their interactions. In this study, we identified FA2H as a likely regulator of the mobility of raft-associated lipids and showed that this could play an important role in lipogenesis in adipocytes. First, levels of FA2H markedly increase during hormone-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and siRNAs against FA2H block this process. Second, depletion of FA2H decreases the protein levels of GLUT4 and IR, leading to impaired glucose uptake and lipogenesis under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions. Third, decreased glucose uptake impairs the lipogenic pathway by reducing FAS and SCD1 gene expression. Fourth, the decreased levels of GLUT4 and IR in FA2H-depleted adipocytes are likely due to increased diffusional mobility of raft-associated lipids, which promotes degradation of GLUT4 and IR. Finally, localization of GLUT4 in lysosomes increases in FA2H-depleted adipocytes. Collectively, these data document a novel role of FA2H and 2-OH FA in modulating adipocyte lipogenesis.Previous studies (3Su X. Han X. Yang J. Mancuso D.J. Chen J. Bickel P.E. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5033-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 4Roberts L.D. Virtue S. Vidal-Puig A. Nicholls A.W. Griffin J.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 39: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of a straight chain fatty acid α-oxidation pathway in adipocytes and the activation of this pathway during adipocyte differentiation. 2-OH FA generated in the initial step of FA α-oxidation could be further oxidized or incorporated into lipid species (e.g. sphingolipids). This study demonstrates an important role of straight chain FA 2-hydroxylation by FA2H in adipocyte metabolism. FA2H generation of 2-OH FA modulates protein levels of GLUT4, IR, and thus lipogenesis in adipocytes possibly via altering composition and fluidity of lipid rafts (Fig. 9C). It is not clear how mobility of CTxB molecules is modulated by FA2H as we observed. Altered organization of cell actin has been shown to regulate membrane lateral mobility (34Kwik J. Boyle S. Fooksman D. Margolis L. Sheetz M.P. Edidin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13964-13969Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, our data demonstrated that regulation of mobility of CTxB by FA2H depletion is not due to modulation of actin cytoskeleton organization. There are many other potential mechanisms that could account for FA2H-mediated mobility of CTxB molecules. For example, FA2H has been shown to regulate cell migration (40Maldonado E.N. Alderson N.L. Monje P.V. Wood P.M. Hama H. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 153-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), so modulation of extracellular matrix could be one potential mechanism. Other possibilities include the changes of membrane lipid compositions, expression, and recruitment of specific membrane proteins. Moreover, because 2-OH palmitic acid cannot totally reverse the effects of FA2H depletion, FA2H may regulate some hydroxylation-independent pathways. The observation we reported is a novel pathway regulating lipogenesis, and many more experiments are required to understand its detailed biochemical mechanisms.The relation between membrane mobility and GLUT4 trafficking/degradation was also supported by several previous studies on membrane cholesterol. Lateral diffusion of membrane proteins is reduced by a decreased membrane cholesterol content chronically by using lipoprotein-free media or acutely by treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (34Kwik J. Boyle S. Fooksman D. Margolis L. Sheetz M.P. Edidin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13964-13969Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cholesterol depletion also significantly blocks efficient internalization of GLUT4, presumably leading to its delayed degradation in lysosomes (41Shigematsu S. Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10683-10690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanisms on how membrane lipid mobility mediates internalization and intracellular trafficking of GLUT4 and IR are not known. Tumor necrosis factor α-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is accompanied by a decrease of GLUT4 levels (42Stephens J.M. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 971-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that a decrease of GLUT4 level in FA2H knockdown adipocytes may be partially due to the loss of IR protein.We have shown effects of FA2H production of 2-OH FA on mobility of raft-associated lipids, but it is likely that other effects of these FA also occur in adipocytes. It has been well documented that chemical structures of lipid species are major determinants of physical properties of lipid membranes and their intracellular trafficking. For example, lipid-mimetic dialkylindocarbocyanine derivatives with short or unsaturated hydrocarbon chains enter the endocytic recycling compartment efficiently, whereas lipid analogs with long, saturated tails are sorted out of this pathway and targeted to the late endosomes/lysosomes (43Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 44Hao M. Mukherjee S. Sun Y. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14171-14178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similarly, short chain sphingomyelins recycle to the PM more effectively, whereas long chain sphingomyelins are preferentially routed to the late endocytic pathway (45Koivusalo M. Jansen M. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 5113-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).How chemical modifications of lipid acyl moieties (e.g. hydroxylation) influence vesicular trafficking is less clear. FA2H catalyzes the 2-hydroxylation of straight chain FAs and is responsible for the formation of 2-hydroxylated sphingolipids (14Zöller I. Meixner M. Hartmann D. Büssow H. Meyer R. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9741-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 40Maldonado E.N. Alderson N.L. Monje P.V. Wood P.M. Hama H. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 153-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains with defective SCS7/FA2H are resistant to the antifungal syringomycin E (30Hama H. Young D.A. Radding J.A. Ma D. Tang J. Stock S.D. Takemoto J.Y. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the antitumor compound PM02734 (46Herrero A.B. Astudillo A.M. Balboa M.A. Cuevas C. Balsinde J. Moreno S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 9779-9787Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that 2-hydroxylated sphingolipids could influence the physical properties of some plasma membrane microdomains/lipid rafts and their internalization. This is supported by biophysical studies of membranes in reconstituted systems (47Jenske R. Lindström F. Gröbner G. Vetter W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2008; 154: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 48Shah J. Atienza J.M. Rawlings A.V. Shipley G.G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1945-1955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we provide direct evidence that FA2H depletion modulates diffusional mobility of raft-associated lipids and co-localization of GLUT4 with lysosomes, leading to decreased GLUT4 level in a mammalian adipocyte model system. Moreover, FA2H was also required for epidermal lamellar membrane formation, suggesting a role in the exocytic pathway (15Uchida Y. Hama H. Alderson N.L. Douangpanya S. Wang Y. Crumrine D.A. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13211-13219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). How FA2H mediates translocation of membrane proteins (e.g. GLUT4 and IR) to lipid rafts and regulates distinct intracellular trafficking pathways warrants investigation. Detailed proteomic and lipidomic analysis of raft-associated fractions in the presence and absence of FA2H will be greatly helpful to understand the underlying biochemical mechanisms.Differentiation of pre-adipocytes into adipocytes requires the coordination of a complex network of transcription factors, cofactors, and signaling molecules (49MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 50Rosen E.D. MacDougald O.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). Hormone-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes is a commonly used model to recapitulate the biochemical, molecular biological, and ultrastructural characteristics of differentiated mammalian adipocytes. Our data showed the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation by two independent siRNAs recognizing FA2H, suggesting FA2H activity is required for this process. A study using lentivirus-mediated shRNA show that GLUT4 is not required for adipogenic differentiation but is necessary for full lipogenic capacity of differentiated adipocytes (51Liao W. Nguyen M.T. Imamura T. Singer O. Verma I.M. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2245-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similar results were presented using caveolin-1 knockdown 3T3-L1 cells (16González-Muñoz E. López-Iglesias C. Calvo M. Palacín M. Zorzano A. Camps M. Endocrinology. 2009; 150: 3493-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this respect, accelerated degradation of GLUT4 and IR cannot fully account for the finding that knockdown of FA2H results in inhibition of differentiation. One intriguing possibility is that FA2H may mediate some signaling pathways or generate some lipid ligands for activation of transcription factors necessary for adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, whether FA2H contributes to the commitment of a mesenchymal stem cell to the adipocyte lineage is of great interest for future study.The effect of FA2H on lipid rafts might reflect the fact that this enzyme localizes to the ER where sphingolipids are made. FA2H contains a putative ER targeting signal in its C terminus and is co-localized with the ER marker calnexin (9Eckhardt M. Yaghootfam A. Fewou S.N. Zöller I. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 2-OH FAs generated by FA2H are activated to CoA thioesters and utilized for sphingolipid synthesis (52Mizutani Y. Kihara A. Chiba H. Tojo H. Igarashi Y. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2356-2364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the 2-OH fatty acyl-CoA could be utilized by peroxisomal 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA lyase via the α-oxidation pathway, leading to the generation of odd chain length fatty acids (1Foulon V. Sniekers M. Huysmans E. Asselberghs S. Mahieu V. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Casteels M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9802-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Many details regarding the generation site or the fate of 2-OH FA are still lacking. It is possible that 2-OH FA is generated in the ER prior to delivery to the peroxisome for further degradation by α-oxidation. The role of peroxisomal phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, initially thought to generate 2-OH FA is now unclear (10Mukherji M. Kershaw N.J. Schofield C.J. Wierzbicki A.S. Lloyd M.D. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Foulon V. Asselberghs S. Geens W. Mannaerts G.P. Casteels M. Van Veldhoven P.P. J.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 629-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of another FA 2-hydroxylase in peroxisome cannot be excluded. 2-Hydroxylation generates a chiral carbon in fatty acids, and both enantiomers are detected in brain samples (53Jenske R. Vetter W. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2008; 56: 11578-11583Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting the presence of multiple 2-hydroxylases with opposite stereospecificities. In this respect, it would be informative to gain a better understanding of the stereospecificity of FA2H. Our results showed the ability of racemic 2-OH FA to partially reverse the inhibitory effects of FA2H depletion on lipogenesis. It is important to resolve the enantiomers of 2-OH FA and examine the different roles of the two enantiomers in adipocyte lipogenesis. Some other explanation why 2-OH palmitic acid cannot totally reverse the effects of FA2H depletion may exist. It is not clear whether unsaturated FAs (e.g. oleic acid) are good substrates for FA2H. Moreover, FA2H may have some hydroxylation-independent effects.Collectively, this study provides multiple lines of evidence to support the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis by FA2H. This study might open a door to explore potential roles of an underappreciated fatty acid catabolic pathway in adipocyte physiology. IntroductionIn addition to mitochondrial β-oxidation, fatty acids (FA) 2The abbreviations used are: FAfatty acidsFA2Hfatty acid 2-hydroxylase2-OH FA2-hydroxy FAIRinsulin receptorTAGtriacylglycerolsiRNAsmall interfering RNADMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFRAPfluorescence recovery after photobleachingLAMP1lysosome associated membrane protein 1PMplasma membraneTIRFtotal internal reflection fluorescencePCphosphatidylcholineCTxBcholera toxin subunit BFASfatty-acid synthaseRT-PCRreal time-PCRROIregion of interestERendoplasmic reticulumMfmobile fraction. can also be oxidized in peroxisomes, where they can undergo β- as well as α-oxidation. Peroxisomal α-oxidation produces fatty acyl moieties with one less carbon (odd chain length) without generating acetyl-CoA (1Foulon V. Sniekers M. Huysmans E. Asselberghs S. Mahieu V. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Casteels M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9802-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is well known that peroxisomal α-oxidation is important for catabolism of branched-chain FA and also for very long chain FA (2Wanders R.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Its contribution to catabolism of other long chain FA is not known, so its role in whole cell energy homeostasis remains unclear. There is evidence for up-regulation of FA α-oxidation during the preadipocyte to adipocyte transition as cells begin accumulating lipids. Using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry, we and others demonstrated during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells a marked increase in activity of peroxisomal FA α-oxidation, which was reflected in accumulation of odd chain length acyl moieties in major lipid species (3Su X. Han X. Yang J. Mancuso D.J. Chen J. Bickel P.E. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5033-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 4Roberts L.D. Virtue S. Vidal-Puig A. Nicholls A.W. Griffin J.L. Physiol. Genomics. 2009; 39: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanisms for this change and the functions of the α-oxidation pathway in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism in mature adipocytes have not been explored.Although straight chain FA α-oxidation was first reported in 1964 (5Levis G.M. Mead J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 77-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a detailed understanding of the enzymatic pathway is still unclear. It was postulated that α-oxidation is initiated by 2-hydroxylation of free FA, followed by thioesterification, formation of aldehyde, and dehydrogenation to form an FA with one less carbon. The FA can then undergo more α-oxidation cycles or be incorporated into lipid species (1Foulon V. Sniekers M. Huysmans E. Asselberghs S. Mahieu V. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Casteels M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9802-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Hama H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1801: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Another effect of active α-oxidation is to increase the proportion of lipids with shorter acyl chains and acyl chains with modifications (e.g. 2-hydroxy FA (2-OH FA)). The physiological significance of these changes in lipid composition has not been explored.In mammalian cells, two types of fatty acid 2-hydroxylase have been identified, phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (7Wanders R.J. Jansen G.A. Lloyd M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) (8Alderson N.L. Rembiesa B.M. Walla M.D. Bielawska A.

J. 2005; 388: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase is an α-ketoglutarate-dependent acyl-CoA 2-hydroxylase, and its primary function is the degradation of 3-methyl FA, which cannot be degraded by β-oxidation pathway (7Wanders R.J. Jansen G.A. Lloyd M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1631: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Previous reports on the enzymatic activity of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase on straight chain fatty acids or their CoA esters are controversial (10Mukherji M. Kershaw N.J. Schofield C.J. Wierzbicki A.S.

Ca2+ sensitivity is thought to be conferred by synaptotagmin, although the ubiquitous Ca2+-effector calmodulin has also been implicated in SNARE-dependent membrane fusion. To examine the molecular mechanisms involved, we examined the direct action of calmodulin and synaptotagmin in vitro, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer to assay lipid mixing between target- and vesicle-SNARE liposomes. Ca2+/calmodulin inhibited SNARE assembly and membrane fusion by binding to two distinct motifs located in the membrane-proximal regions of VAMP2 (KD = 500 nm) and syntaxin 1 (KD = 2 μm). In contrast, fusion was increased by full-length synaptotagmin 1 anchored in vesicle-SNARE liposomes. When synaptotagmin and calmodulin were combined, synaptotagmin overcame the inhibitory effects of calmodulin. Furthermore, synaptotagmin displaced calmodulin binding to target-SNAREs. These findings suggest that two distinct Ca2+ sensors act antagonistically in SNARE-mediated fusion.

Neurotransmitter release at axonal terminals entails calcium-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicle contents into the synaptic cleft, a process involving several distinct steps (reviewed in Ref. 1Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar). First, priming reactions fill a readily releasable pool in which vesicles are immediately available for triggering by Ca2+ entry. Triggering opens a fusion pore connecting the vesicle lumen to the extracellular medium, which then expands as the vesicle collapses into the plasma membrane with total release of contents. Alternatively, the pore may open and close without expanding, allowing transient (kiss-and-run) exocytosis, a mechanism conferring partial release of transmitter while avoiding incorporation of vesicles into the plasma membrane (2Harata N.C. Aravanis A.M. Tsien R.W. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1546-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Smith S.M. Renden R. von Gersdorff H. Trends Neurosci. 2008; 31: 559-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ca2+ ions not only trigger fusion itself but also regulate pre- and post-fusion events, including priming and fusion pore closure (4Neher E. Sakaba T.

VAMP2 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 2, a v-SNARE, also known as synaptobrevin) is anchored in the synaptic vesicle membrane via a C-terminal transmembrane region, whereas the t-SNAREs syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa) are predominantly inserted in the plasma membrane via a C-terminal transmembrane region and palmitoylation of centrally located cysteine residues, respectively (1Sudhof T.C.

The key role of synaptic SNAREs is underlined by the fact that they are specifically cleaved by the endoprotease activity of botulinum and tetanus (TeNT) neurotoxins, which potently inhibit neurotransmitter release (9Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Although the precise role of SNAREs is still debated, vesicle fusion requires the assembly of SNARE complexes at the interface between a docked synaptic vesicle and the target membrane (10Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed SNAREs reconstituted into liposomes mediate membrane fusion, and fluorimetric monitoring of lipid mixing provides an assay to analyze the molecular mechanisms that control trans-SNARE assembly (11Weber T.

SNAREs do not display intrinsic Ca2+ sensitivity. Ca2+ dependence of fast neurotransmitter release is generally thought to be conferred by synaptotagmins, a family of Ca2+-sensor proteins that interact with SNAREs (1Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar, 12Chapman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 615-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin 1 is a synaptic vesicle protein with tandem C2 domains that bind Ca2+, promoting the interactions of synaptotagmin with t-SNAREs and anionic phospholipids (1Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev.

Electrophysiological analysis of neurotransmitter release from neurons of synaptotagmin null flies and mice suggests that synaptotagmin ensures the synchronization of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis with the presynaptic action potential (13Yoshihara M.

Furthermore, in SNARE liposome fusion assays, addition of the soluble cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin (sytC2AB) or incorporation of full-length lipid-anchored synaptotagmin into v-SNARE liposomes promotes lipid mixing in a Ca2+-dependent manner (16Tucker W.C.

Synaptotagmin, however, is not the only Ca2+ effector that regulates release, and considerable evidence supports a role for calmodulin in SNARE-mediated membrane traffic throughout evolution, from yeast vacuoles to mammalian neuroexocytosis (21Burgoyne R.D.

Unraveling the mode of action of calmodulin in cellular assays is a complex task, because multiple proteins implicated in exocytosis are targets of calmodulin (e.g. Ca2+ channels, Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II, Rab3A and Munc13). Our laboratory has previously identified direct molecular interactions between calmodulin and a v-SNARE. Ca2+/calmodulin binds to VAMP2 via a conserved basic amphipathic motif overlapping the C-terminal end of its SNARE domain (29Quetglas S. Leveque C. Miquelis R. Sato K. Seagar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9695-9700Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and mutations of basic or hydrophobic residues strongly inhibit Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (30Quetglas S. Iborra C. Sasakawa N. De Haro L. Kumakura K. Sato K. Leveque C. Seagar M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3970-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This membrane-proximal region of VAMP2 also interacts with acidic phospholipids that limit trans-SNARE complex assembly (31Hu K. Carroll J. Fedorovich S. Rickman C. Sukhodub A. Davletov B. Nature. 2002; 415: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 32Kweon D.H. Kim C.S. Shin Y.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Hu K. Rickman C. Carroll J. Davletov B. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 781-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional analysis of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells is consistent with the conclusion that calmodulin regulates events just before fusion is triggered (22Chamberlain L.H.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 1119-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), although it has also been suggested that calmodulin operates post-fusionally in endocytosis (34Artalejo C.R.

To determine whether direct binding of calmodulin to the SNARE machinery can confer Ca2+-dependent regulation on membrane fusion, we have used a fluorimetric assay to monitor lipid mixing between v- and t-SNARE liposomes in the presence or absence of synaptotagmin. Our data indicate that Ca2+/calmodulin specifically restricts trans-SNARE complex assembly and inhibits membrane fusion by binding to VAMP2 and to a newly identified motif in syntaxin 1. Furthermore, they are consistent with the hypothesis that Ca2+ regulation of SNARE-mediated fusion involves the antagonistic action of calmodulin and synaptotagmin. Human calmodulin and biotinylated bovine calmodulin were from Calbiochem. Plasmids used to generate VAMP2 constructs (residues 1–116 and 1–92 subcloned into pET28a; residues 1–96 in pGEX-2T) and the syntaxin 1a/SNAP25 heterodimer (co-expressed or individually expressed from pGEX-KG and pET28a respectively) were provided by G. Schiavo (London Research Institute, London, UK). Syntaxin 1a(186–265) (H3ΔTM, pGEX-4T) was generated from a 186–286 construct (36Sheng Z.H. Rettig J. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) provided by W. A. Catterall (University of Washington, Seattle), and point mutations were performed using a Stratagene PCR kit. cDNAs encoding calmodulin and calmodulin mutants (pGEX-4T), TeNT light chain (pET28a), and the C2AB fragment of synaptotagmin 1 (pGEX-2T) were obtained from A. Lee (Emory University, Atlanta, GA), H. Niemann (Medizinische Hochschule, Hannover, Germany), and J. Lang (Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France), respectively. Proteins were purified using standard methods and were either eluted or cleaved from their tags by thrombin, and sytC2AB was purified as reported previously (37Charvin N. L'evêque C. Walker D.

Full-length synaptotagmin was incorporated with VAMP2 at a ratio of 1:4.5 (mol/mol) using exactly the same procedure but in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (19Stein A. Radhakrishnan A. Riedel D. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Lipid compositions (from Avanti Polar Lipids) were 85% (mol/mol) 1-palmitoyl,2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (PC), 15% 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylserine (PS) for the v-SNARE liposomes, and 83% PC, 15% PS, 1.5% (mol/mol) N-(7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1,2 dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE), and 1.5% (mol/mol) N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (rhodamine-PE) for t-SNARE liposomes. Dried lipids were resuspended in VAMP2 or syntaxin 1/SNAP25 heterodimer solutions in 1.5% (w/v) sodium cholate (Sigma), at a 1:100 (mol/mol) protein-to-lipid ratio. Liposomes were obtained by rapid dilution and extensive dialysis in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad), and unincorporated proteins and aggregates were removed by a 4-h centrifugation (250,000 × g) on a discontinuous Optiprep (Abcys) gradient (31Hu K. Carroll J. Fedorovich S. Rickman C. Sukhodub A. Davletov B. Nature. 2002; 415: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In each fusion reaction, 2 μl of t-SNARE liposomes (100–150 nm full-length syntaxin 1a/SNAP25 dimer) were mixed on ice with 10 μl of v-SNARE liposomes (2–2.5 μm VAMP2) in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm EGTA, and the appropriate amount of Ca2+ in a total volume of 50 μl, and then fusion was monitored at 37 °C. Calmodulin was preincubated 30 min on ice with t-SNARE liposomes prior to v- and t-SNARE mixing. In control experiments, t-SNARE liposomes were preincubated with 10 μm VAMPΔTM W89A,W90A for 2 h before mixing to define SNARE-independent fusion. This mutation in the calmodulin-binding site precludes interactions with calmodulin or anionic phospholipids (30Quetglas S. Iborra C. Sasakawa N. De Haro L. Kumakura K. Sato K. Leveque C. Seagar M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3970-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Each assay condition was carried out in triplicate. Fluorescence values obtained by maximal dequenching with excess sodium cholate at the end of each reaction were set to 100%. Representative experiments illustrating absolute amounts of fusion as dequenching (% total fluorescence) are illustrated in Fig. 1. In all other figures, data were normalized to the control fluorescence level at 60 min, and unless otherwise specified, means from at least three totally independent experiments using different liposome preparations are presented ± S.E. Experiments were performed in Nunclon fluorescence plates using a BioTek Sirius HT injector plate reader and KC4 software to monitor fluorescence at 525 nm with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and data acquisition every 2 min. For data analysis, the lowest values obtained in controls, after the initial drop in fluorescence due to fluorophore warming (16Tucker W.C. Weber T. Chapman E.R. Science. 2004; 304: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), were set to t = 0, and all the conditions were analyzed from the same time point. His-VAMP2(1–92) (10 pmol) was incubated with t-SNARE liposomes (35 pmol of the syntaxin 1/SNAP25 dimer) to form complexes in the presence or absence of recombinant calmodulin. At the indicated time, 60 pmol of TeNT was added, and samples were incubated for 2 h to cleave uncomplexed His-VAMP2(1–92). Samples were then boiled and processed for Western blotting. His-VAMP2(1–92) that had been protected from TeNT cleavage by SNARE complex assembly was revealed with a polyclonal antibody directed against the N terminus of VAMP2. SPR spectroscopy was performed at 25 °C on a Biacore 3000 system (GE Healthcare). Biotinylated bovine brain calmodulin (Calbiochem) or peptides were loaded onto a neutravidin-coated CM5 sensor chip to yield 400–600 or 300 resonance units, respectively, and then both control and experimental flow cells were saturated with biotin. SNAREs or calmodulin were injected in the running buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, 140 mm KCl, pH 7.4, in presence of either 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA). Sensorgrams illustrate the difference between signals from experimental and control cells. To monitor SNARE complex assembly, His-VAMP(1–92) (2000–3000 resonance units) was coupled to the sensor chip and syntaxin1/SNAP-25 dimer injected into the flow buffer. Glutathione-coated microwell plates (Pierce) were saturated with wild-type or mutant GST-calmodulin at 4 °C. After washing with 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, v- or t-SNARE liposomes were added (5 pmol of proteins) with 4 mm EGTA or 50 μm CaCl2 and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, with each assay condition in triplicate. Wells were then washed four times with CaCl2 or EGTA buffers, and bound SNAREs were detected with either anti-VAMP2 polyclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml) or the anti-syntaxin1 antibody (mAb10H5, 5 μg/ml) and peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1 h at 37 °C, followed by four washes). 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine liquid peroxidase substrate (Sigma) was then added to each well; the reaction was stopped at 20 min with 1 m H2SO4, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm using the BioTek plate reader. GST-H3ΔTM (5 pmol) was preincubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of sytC2AB and then incubated with calmodulin-agarose beads for 90 min at 37 °C with 0.3 mm CaCl2 or 4 mm EGTA. Beads were washed four times with CaCl2 or EGTA buffers, and samples were processed for Western blotting. Bound proteins were stained with an anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare) and a monoclonal anti-synaptotagmin 1 antibody (mAb1D12). Fusion between v-SNARE and t-SNARE liposomes was measured using a fluorescence (rhodamine/NBD) dequenching assay to monitor lipid mixing. Initial experiments were performed in the two possible liposome configurations (i.e. fluorophores integrated in either v- or t-SNARE liposomes). A predominant SNARE-dependent component of fusion was measured as the fraction inhibited either by treatment with TeNT light chain, which specifically cleaves VAMP2 (Fig. 1A), or by saturating t-SNAREs with an excess of soluble VAMP2 cytosolic domain (Fig. 1B). In all subsequent experiments, we integrated rhodamine-PE and NBD-PE in t-SNARE liposomes and used VAMPΔTM to define SNARE-driven fusion. In the presence of Ca2+, purified calmodulin from brain inhibited fusion by about 50% (Fig. 1C). Ca2+/calmodulin selectively reduced the SNARE-dependent component, as it had no effect in the presence of VAMPΔTM (Fig. 1C). Similar data were obtained with bacterially expressed wild-type calmodulin, which inhibited fusion in the presence of 50 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 1D), whereas mutant calmodulin (CaM1234) with alanine substitutions for aspartate residues that impair Ca2+ coordination in both N- and C-lobes of calmodulin was ineffective (38Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition by wild-type calmodulin was abolished in the presence of EGTA confirming that it is Ca2+-dependent (Fig. 1E). Finally, inhibition of the SNARE-dependent component of fusion displayed concentration dependence, with a threshold at 0.3 μm reaching close to 50% inhibition at 10 μm (Fig. 1F). As the level of inhibition attained was about 50%, we asked whether Ca2+/calmodulin might stabilize a hemi-fused state in which outer phospholipid leaflets have merged, but inner leaflets are separate. Preincubation with sodium dithionite selectively extinguishes outer leaflet fluorescence and consequently reduced fluorescence by half (Fig. 2A). In these conditions, Ca2+/calmodulin still produced 50% inhibition of fusion (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that 10 μm calmodulin does not promote hemifusion but globally reduces lipid mixing by 50%. Is inhibition of fusion by calmodulin the consequence of a reduction in SNARE complex assembly? Assembly of VAMP2 into SNARE complexes protects it from the proteolytic action of tetanus neurotoxin (39Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Thus, acquisition of resistance to TeNT can be used to monitor the formation of SNARE complexes. Preliminary experiments (data not shown) with liposomes containing full-length SNAREs yielded multiple high molecular weight SDS-resistant complexes that were poorly resolved by PAGE and difficult to quantify. Thus, as reported (19Stein A. Radhakrishnan A. Riedel D. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 904-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), SNARE assembly was achieved by incubating cytosolic VAMP2 domain with t-SNARE liposomes. Experiments were carried out in the presence or absence of Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 3), and then a large excess of TeNT light chain was added at the indicated times to digest unassembled VAMP2. Incubations were stopped by boiling in SDS, and TeNT-resistant monomeric VAMP was quantified by Western blotting yielding an index of SNARE assembly. In the absence of t-SNARE liposomes, VAMP2 was almost totally proteolyzed by TeNT, and proteolysis was not affected by calmodulin alone (Fig. 3A, right panel). When t-SNARE liposomes were added, an increase in TeNT-resistant VAMP2 occurred at 5 and 30 min, but this increase was clearly restricted in the presence of 1 or 10 μm calmodulin and Ca2+ (Fig. 3, A, left panel, and B). Thus, SNARE assembly shielded VAMP2 from TeNT. Protection from cleavage was reduced in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 3, A–C), but to a lesser extent with mutant CaM1234, which has a reduced affinity for Ca2+ (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, SPR (Biacore) measurements indicated that assembly of cytoplasmic SNARE domains into complexes was blocked by wild-type but not by mutant calmodulin (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that calmodulin inhibits SNARE complex formation in a Ca2+-dependent manner, which in turn attenuates liposome fusion. Where are the calmodulin-binding sites located that account for inhibition of SNARE assembly and fusion? We have previously reported a Ca2+/calmodulin-binding motif, close to the transmembrane region of VAMP2, overlapping the C-terminal extremity of the SNARE domain (29Quetglas S. Leveque C. Miquelis R. Sato K. Seagar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9695-9700Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A VAMP(77–90) peptide bound Ca2+/calmodulin, and the interaction was strongly reduced by the W89A,W90A mutation (30Quetglas S. Iborra C. Sasakawa N. De Haro L. Kumakura K. Sato K. Leveque C. Seagar M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3970-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To determine whether this calmodulin-binding motif underlies inhibition of SNARE-mediated fusion, experiments were performed using v-SNARE liposomes with mutant VAMP (W89A,W90A) and wild-type t-SNARE liposomes. Intriguingly, Ca2+/calmodulin still strongly inhibited fusion, although binding to VAMP was reduced (see below and Fig. 6D). These findings suggest that SNAREs must contain another previously undetected calmodulin-binding motif. This hypothesis was explored using SPR. Biotinylated calmodulin was coupled to a neutravidin sensor chip, and cytosolic domains of SNARE proteins were injected into the flow cell. Injections at a single concentration (0.4 μm) did not reveal interactions of calmodulin with GST (not shown) or SNAP-25 (Fig. 4A). However, a strong SPR signal was generated by GST-VAMP and to a lesser degree by GST-syntaxin H3 domain (Fig. 4A). We next asked whether assembly of syntaxin/SNAP-25 heterodimers might influence calmodulin binding to syntaxin 1. SPR measurements indicated that preincubation of GST-syntaxinΔTM with a 10-fold molar excess of HisSNAP-25 led to a 1.6-fold increment in SPR signal (Fig. 4B). This result is close to the 1.4-fold increase expected (because of the increment in bound molecular mass) when 1:1 syntaxin/SNAP-25 heterodimers rather than syntaxin monomers interact with calmodulin. These data indicate that SNAP-25 does not interfere with calmodulin binding to syntaxin. They are consistent with binding of calmodulin to pre-assembled t-SNARE heterodimers via syntaxin. In contrast, when pre-assembled trimeric SNARE complexes were injected, no interaction with calmodulin was detected (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that calmodulin-binding sites on VAMP2 and syntaxin 1 are occluded when the SNARE complex is fully zipped. The Ca2+/calmodulin binding affinity of syntaxin 1 H3 domain was determined by SPR, KD = 2.3 μm ± 0.6, n = 6 (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. 2). Analysis of the syntaxin 1 sequence in the calmodulin target data base strongly predicted a single calmodulin-binding motif in the C-terminal region (Asp250–Arg262), overlapping the SNARE domain. Thus, a peptide encompassing syntaxin(246–265) was immobilized on an SPR sensor chip. Recombinant calmodulin at 2 μm, but not mutant CaM1234, displayed specific association (Fig. 5B). For comparison, a peptide containing the calmodulin-binding domain of VAMP (VAMP(77–94)) was analyzed in a parallel cell on the same sensor chip. VAMP(77–94) peptide bound significantly more calmodulin than syntaxin(246–265) (Fig. 5B), consistent with the KD = 0.5 μm for GST-VAMPΔTM (29Quetglas S. Leveque C. Miquelis R. Sato K. Seagar M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9695-9700Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which is about 4-fold lower than GST-H3ΔTM. Thus, syntaxin 1 also carries a calmodulin-binding motif in a membrane-proximal position, topologically analogous to the calmodulin motif in VAMP. Globally, KD values are compatible with inhibition of SNARE liposome fusion at low micromolar calmodulin. To confirm the location of the calmodulin-binding motif and to ascertain whether interactions between Ca2+/calmodulin and syntaxin 1 are involved in regulating SNARE-dependent fusion, we designed mutations that perturb binding. The K260E,K264E mutations in the basic C-terminal stretch of amino acids strongly reduced Ca2+-dependent interaction with calmodulin (Fig. 5, C and D), leading to an estimated 10-fold increase in KD (determined as in Fig. 5A, results not shown). Furthermore, calmodulin binding to H3ΔTM was eliminated when 4 mm EGTA was substituted for Ca2+ (Fig. 5D). These observations probably explain why we previously failed to detect calmodulin binding to syntaxin 1 using a GST-syntaxin(1–261) construct that lacked the critical C-terminal residues (29Quetglas S.

https://openalex.org/W2037019266,"Protein kinase C and protein kinase D are potently activated by agonist-evoked increases in diacylglycerol. Using live cell-imaging probes for kinase activity, we have shown that both kinases are robustly activated at the Golgi following stimulation of G(q)-coupled receptor signaling pathways, displaying activation signatures at the Golgi that are distinct from those at the plasma membrane. Here we report that Ca(2+) is the mediator that allows signals received at the plasma membrane to activate these two protein kinases at the Golgi. Specifically, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based reporters to image diacylglycerol production, we show that Ca(2+) is necessary and sufficient to elevate diacylglycerol levels at the Golgi. First, raising intracellular Ca(2+) by treating cells with thapsigargin induces diacylglycerol production at the Golgi. Second, chelation of intracellular Ca(2+) prevents UTP-stimulated increases in diacylglycerol at the Golgi. Thus, agonist-evoked increases in intracellular Ca(2+) cause increases in Golgi diacylglycerol, allowing this intracellular membrane to serve as a platform for signaling by protein kinases C and D."

Previously, we showed that diet-induced HHcy accelerated the AD-like phenotype of a transgenic mouse model, i.e., Tg2576. In the present work, we tested whether an HHcy-lowering strategy in this model would be beneficial. Tg2576 mice received methionine-rich or regular chow diet for 5 mo. Next, while the chow control group was kept on the same regimen, the other mice were randomized into two groups: one was kept on the methionine-rich diet (Met On), the other switched to chow (Met Off). Compared with controls, 5 mo on the methionine-rich diet resulted in HHcy (plasma Hcy level, treated: 12.7±1.2 µM vs. control: 3.1±0.4 µM) and significant behavioral impairments (% freezing, treated: 2.4±1.4% vs. control: 19.9±6.9%). At the end of the study, while the Met On group kept Hcy level elevated, the Met Off group had these values indistinguishable from the controls. The reduction in Hcy levels resulted in a significant improvement of the fear-conditioning performance, and an amelioration of the brain amyloidosis.

Herein we have identified the mononuclear dicitrate iron complex [Fe(cit)2H4-x](1+x)− as the species responsible for the specific inhibition of Mφ PTP activity. By using biochemical and computational approaches, we show that [Fe(cit)2]5− targets the catalytic pocket of the PTP SHP-1, competitively inhibiting its interaction with an incoming phosphosubstrate. In vitro and in vivo inhibition of PTP activity by iron-citrate results in protein hyperphosphorylation and enhanced MAPK signaling in response to LPS stimulation. We propose that iron-citrate-mediated PTP inhibition represents a novel and biologically relevant regulatory mechanism of signal transduction.

The balance of protein phosphorylation, maintained by the concerted action of protein kinases and protein phosphatases, is fundamental in determining the outcome of multiple cellular functions ranging from cell proliferation to cell death (1Johnson L.N. Lewis R.J. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2209-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar).

Vang T. Bottini N. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Progress has been achieved in understanding the mechanisms of PTP regulation, including receptor PTP dimerization (3Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), oxidation (4Tonks N.K.

However, with more than 100 family members, a broad structural diversity, varying subcellular localizations and substrate specificities (5Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Friedberg I.

Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein-1, NRAMP-1, is a divalent metal transporter localized to the late endosome/lysosomal compartment of Mφs (6Gruenheid S. Pinner E. Desjardins M. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and present in gelatinase positive tertiary granules of neutrophils (7Canonne-Hergaux F. Calafat J. Richer E. Cellier M. Grinstein S. Borregaard N. Gros P. Blood. 2002; 100: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Upon phagocytosis, NRAMP-1 is recruited to the phagolysosomal membrane where it mediates the export of Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, and potentially other metals including Zn2+ from the vesicle into the cytoplasmic compartment (8Forbes J.R. Gros P. Blood. 2003; 102: 1884-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9Goswami T. Bhattacharjee A. Babal P. Searle S. Moore E. Li M. Blackwell J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Functional NRAMP-1 expression has been linked to innate resistance to Leishmania donovani and other unrelated intracellular pathogens (10Vidal S. Tremblay M.L. Govoni G. Gauthier S. Sebastiani G. Malo D. Skamene E. Olivier M. Jothy S. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been associated with the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory Mφ functions such as MHC II expression (11Wojciechowski W. DeSanctis J. Skamene E. Radzioch D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2688-2696PubMed Google Scholar), IL-1β (12Blackwell J.M. Roach T.I. Atkinson S.E. Ajioka J.W. Barton C.H. Shaw M.A. Immunol.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 1994-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that functional expression of NRAMP-1 results in lower Mφ PTP activity and increased protein phosphorylation, in part explaining the pleiotropic effects of NRAMP-1 (15Gomez M.A. Li S. Tremblay M.L. Olivier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36190-36198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest a model linking metal transport and the regulation of Mφ functions: NRAMP-1 mediated iron transport directly or indirectly (by catalyzing the formation of reactive oxygen species, ROS) inhibits PTP activity, promoting protein phosphorylation and positive signal transduction. This results in the up-regulation of effector Mφ functions such as NO production, which contributes to the control of intracellular pathogen infections (15Gomez M.A. Li S. Tremblay M.L. Olivier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36190-36198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here we have extended our observations and studied the mechanisms underlying the iron-dependent Mφ PTP regulation. The involvement of Mφs as host, accessory and effector cells in the development of infectious diseases, together with their central role in iron homeostasis, place these immune cells as key players in the interface between iron and infection (16Theurl I. Fritsche G. Ludwiczek S. Garimorth K. Bellmann-Weiler R. Weiss G. Biometals. 2005; 18: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Herein show that Mφs regulate MAPK signaling in part by modulating PTP activity in an iron-dependent manner. We propose that this novel mechanism may represent a biologically relevant PTP regulatory event, which could be exploited as a therapeutic approach. 4-Nitrophenylphosphate disodium salt hexahydrate (pNPP), LPS (Escherichia coli, serotype 0111:B4), catalase, superoxide dismutase, poly(Glu,Tyr), iron (III) chloride (FeCl3), and iron (II) sulfate (FeSO4)were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from GE Healthcare. Guanidine hydrochloride and citric acid were purchased from Laboratoire MAT (Beauport, QC, Canada). B10R murine Mφ cell line was kept in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mml-glutamine at 37 °C and 5% CO2. As previously described (17Blanchette J. Racette N. Faure R. Siminovitch K.A. Olivier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), B10R Mφs were collected, lysed in PTP lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (ME), 1% Igepal, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin) and kept on ice 45 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and protein content determined by Bradford’s method. 10 μg of protein extract were incubated in phosphatase reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 0.1% β-ME, 10 mm pNPP) for 30 min. Absorbance was taken at 405 nm. Three different stock solutions of iron-citrate (Fe-cit) were prepared with variations in the iron-to-citrate (Fe:cit) molar ratio: 1:1, 1:4, and 1:10. A stock solution of 0.5 m FeCl3 was prepared and added dropwise to citric acid (H4cit) solutions to obtain a final concentration of 100 mm Fe3+ in all preparations. 100 mm, 400 mm, and 1 m citric acid solutions were used to generate 1:1, 1:4, and 1:10 Fe:cit preparations respectively. Solutions were slowly stirred for 1 h at room temperature and protected from light to avoid photoreduction of Fe3+. Fe-cit preparations were kept at room temperature and used for a maximum of one month after preparation. The ESI-MS experiments were performed on a LCQ-ion trap (Finnigan-Thermoquest, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray source. Electrospray full scan spectra, in the range of m/z 50–1200, were obtained by infusion through fused silica tubing at 2–10 μl min−1. The LCQ calibration (m/z 50–2000) was achieved according to the standard calibration procedure from the manufacturer (mixture of caffeine, MRFA and Ultramark 1621). The temperature of the heated capillary of the LCQ was set to 100 °C, the ion spray voltage was in the range of 1–6 kV with an injection time of 5–200 ms. Solutions were analyzed in the negative mode. Experimental peak values throughout this study were identified by the m/z ratio of the most abundant peak in the parent group. Calculated m/z values tabulated are those based on the most abundant isotopes. Peak intensities are cited as percentages of the base major peak intensity. When citric acid was in excess in the solution (1:4 and 1:10), the peaks ([H3cit]−m/z 191; ([H4cit][H3cit]−m/z 383) become the major species, so spectra were represented in the range of 200 (or 400) to 900 for clarity. As protonation occurs during the ionization process in the spectrometer, a single species can be detected with different degrees of protonation. Mass spectrometry allows to establish the FeIII:citrate stoichiometry of the complexes. The nuclearity of complexes is in accordance with the result of isotopic pattern calculation. For ESI-MS analyses, 1:1, 1:4, and 1:10 Fe:cit solutions (1 mm Fe3+) were prepared 20 h prior to be analyzed, and kept in the dark. The pH of the 1:1 and 1:4 solutions was 3.5, and 2.4 for Fe:cit 1:10. Results do not vary with time, showing that the mixture has reached equilibrium at the time when the experiments were performed, consistent with data obtained from solutions prepared with the iron(III) salt (Fe(ClO4)3·9H2O) used in the previous analysis (18Gautier-Luneau I. Merle C. Phanon D. Lebrun C. Biaso F. Serratrice G. Pierre J.L. Chem. Eur. J. 2005; 11: 2207-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of the catalytic domain of the PTP SHP-1 (PDB code: 1GWZ) (19Yang J. Liang X. Niu T. Meng W. Zhao Z. Zhou G.W. J. Biol.

Molecular docking simulations of the Fe-cit complexes with SHP-1 were carried out using the program FlexX (21Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar) embedded in the SYBYL7.3 (Tripos, Inc). The water molecules were removed from the proteins and the essential hydrogen atoms were added prior to docking. Protein conformations were kept rigid during all experiments. H2O, NH4, and Him molecules were removed from the Fe-cit complexes (C7, (NH4)5[Fe(Cit)2]·2H2O; C2, (Him)2[Fe2(Cit)2(H2O)2]· 2H2O) (18Gautier-Luneau I. Merle C. Phanon D. Lebrun C. Biaso F. Serratrice G. Pierre J.L. Chem. Eur. J. 2005; 11: 2207-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ligand charges were calculated using Gasteiger-Huckel method and their structures were minimized using Tripos Force Field. For each individual ligand the first thirty docking solutions were ranked and the results of top ranked conformation were analyzed. 10 μg of total B10R Mφ cell lysates were incubated for 10 min at RT with FeCl3, Fe:cit 1:1, Fe:cit 1:4, Fe:cit 1:10, or FeSO4 to a final iron concentration of 500 μm, and PTP activity assay performed as described above. Alternatively, B10R Mφs were incubated for different time periods with Fe:cit 1:1, Fe:cit 1:10, FeCl3 or FeSO4 in serum-free DMEM. Cells were then lysed in PTP lysis buffer and PTP activity evaluated by pNPP hydrolysis. In-gel PTP assay was performed as previously described (15Gomez M.A. Li S. Tremblay M.L. Olivier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36190-36198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(Glu,Tyr) substrate was tyrosine-phosphorylated by overnight (O/N) incubation with GST-FER protein kinase (10 μg) and 150 μCi [γ-32P]dATP. The substrate was then incorporated in a 10 SDS-polyacrylamide gel mixture at a concentration of 2 × 105 cpm/ml. Mφ protein extracts, prepared as described above, were denatured for SDS-PAGE and loaded onto the gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was incubated O/N in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 20% isopropanol), washed twice with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.3% β-ME), and followed by full protein denaturation in Buffer B containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1 mm EDTA. Gels were washed twice in Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% β-ME, and 0.04% Tween 20) and incubated for final renaturation O/N in Buffer C with or without 500 μm Fe:cit 1:10. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Active PTPs were detected as clear bands on the film. Western blots were performed as previously described (23Jaramillo M. Godbout M. Olivier M. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were α-phosphotyrosine clone 4G10 (Millipore), α-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), α-ERK1/2, α-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), and α-SAPK/JNK (Cell Signaling). Band densitometry was performed using the alpha-DigiDoc software. GST-tagged PTP1B, 1–321 amino acids, PTP-PEST, 1–453 amino acids, and full-length TCPTP and SHP-1 constructs were expressed in E. coli BL21. Fusion proteins were isolated by 1 h of incubation of bacterial lysates and glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C. Isolated fusion proteins were incubated with Fe-cit for 10 min at room temperature and PTP activity evaluated by pNPP hydrolysis. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and t test. Statistically significant difference between groups was considered when p < 0.05 or p < 0.01. All data are presented as the means ± S.E. Having previously observed that Fe-cit strongly inhibits PTP activity in vitro (15Gomez M.A. Li S. Tremblay M.L. Olivier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36190-36198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we investigated whether different iron donors excreted a similar effect. Only iron in the form of Fe-cit, but not FeSO4 or FeCl3, was able to inhibit total Mφ PTP activity (Fig. 1A). Moreover, Fe-cit inhibited by more than 50% the specific enzymatic activities of the classic PTPs SHP-1, TCPTP, PTP1B, and PTP-PEST (Fig. 1B). The complexity of Fe-cit solutions is evidenced by the formation of numerous Fe-cit species found in equilibrium in any given solution. These may vary in the number of coordinated iron nuclei, citrate molecules, and protonation states (24Pierre J.L. Gautier-Luneau I. Biometals. 2000; 13: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These complexes can range from simple mononuclear complexes such as [Fe(cit)2]5− (25Matzapetakis M. Raptopoulou C.P. Tsohos A. Papaefthymiou V. Moon N. Salifoglou A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 13266-13267Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or [Fe(Hcit)(cit)]4− (18Gautier-Luneau I. Merle C. Phanon D. Lebrun C. Biaso F. Serratrice G. Pierre J.L. Chem. Eur. J. 2005; 11: 2207-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), binuclear complexes such as [Fe2(cit)2(H2O)2]2− or [Fe2(Hcit)3]3− (18Gautier-Luneau I. Merle C. Phanon D. Lebrun C. Biaso F. Serratrice G. Pierre J.L. Chem. Eur. J. 2005; 11: 2207-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Shweky I. Bino A. Goldberg D.P. Lippard S.J. Inorganic Chem. 1994; 33: 5161-5162Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), or trinuclear species characterized in solid state as the [Fe9O(cit)8(H2O)3]7− nonanuclear complex (18Gautier-Luneau I.

Inorganic Chem. 1998; 37: 5168-5172Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The formation of specific Fe-cit complexes is dependent on the pH, temperature, and particularly on the molar iron-to-citrate ratio (Fe:cit), among others (18Gautier-Luneau I. Merle C. Phanon D. Lebrun C. Biaso F. Serratrice G. Pierre J.L. Chem. Eur. J. 2005; 11: 2207-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this line of thought, we evaluated the impact of Fe:cit ratios on the PTP inhibitory capacity of different Fe-cit solutions. As shown in Fig. 2A, the Fe:cit ratio is critical for the capacity of Fe-cit solutions to inhibit Mφ PTP activity. Whereas Fe-cit solutions prepared with 1:1 and 1:2 ratios did not inhibit PTP activity (50–500 μm), strong enzymatic inhibition was observed with 1:4 and 1:10 Fe:cit preparations (Fig. 2A). The Fe-cit-mediated inhibition of PTPs was specific to Fe-cit complexes as neither citric acid (Fig. 2B) nor FeCl3 (Fig. 1A) alone could inhibit PTP activity. The composition of each individual preparation was investigated in an attempt to unravel putative Fe-cit complexes responsible for the inhibitory effect. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectra of 1:1, 1:4, and 1:10 Fe:cit solutions (Fig. 3) revealed the multicomplex nature of these preparations (Table 1).TABLE 1Fe-cit species detected by ESI-MSFe:cit ratiom/z calculatedm/z measuredSpecies*1:1279.9279.9[FecitHCl]−315.9315.9[FecitH2Cl2]2−524.8524.7([FecitH]2Cl)−243.9243.9[Fe2(cit)2]2−261.9261.9[Fe2(cit)2H Cl]2−488.9488.8[Fe2(cit)2H]−297.4297.4[Fe3O3(cit)2H3]2−366.4366.4[Fe3(cit)3H]2−375.4375.3[Fe3O(cit)3H3]2−1:4279.9279.9[Fe(cit)H Cl]−436.0435.9[Fe(cit)>2H4]−628.0627.7[H4cit] [Fe(cit)2H4]−820.0819.3[H4cit]2 [Fe(cit)2H4]−243.9243.9[Fe2(cit)2]2−339.9339.9[H4cit] [Fe2(cit)2]2−488.9488.8[Fe2(cit)2H]−462.4462.3[Fe3(cit)4H5]2−366.4366.4[Fe3(cit)3H]2−375.4375.3[Fe3O(cit)3H3]2−680.9680.8[H4cit] [Fe2(cit)2H]−1:10436.0435.9[Fe(cit)2H4]−628.0627.7[H4cit] [Fe(cit)2H4]−820.0819.3[H4cit]2 [Fe(cit)2H4]−488.9488.8[Fe2(cit)2H]−680.9680.8[H4cit] [Fe2(cit)2H]−724.0723.5[H4cit]5[Fe2(cit)2]2− Open table in a new tab The composition of 1:1 Fe:cit solution consisted mainly of binuclear and trinuclear iron complexes. The peaks at m/z 243.9 and 488.9 were assigned to [Fe2(cit)2]2− and [Fe2(cit)2H]− anions respectively, corresponding to the [Fe2(cit)2(H2O)2]2− binuclear complex characterized in solid state. The peaks at m/z 366.5 and 375.5 were assigned to [Fe3(cit)3H]2−, [Fe3O(cit)3H3]2− trinuclear species, which are the precursor building blocks observed in the [Fe9O(cit)8(H2O)3]7− nonanuclear complex. Some mononuclear species (([Fe(Hcit)Cl]−m/z 279.9); ([Fe(H2cit)Cl2]2−m/z 315.9); ([Fe(Hcit)]2Cl)−m/z 524.8)) associated with chloride coming from the iron salt were observed. Chloride anion is a strong ligand and coordinates the iron at acidic pH. In these species, the iron is in tetrahedral geometry as suggested by the presence of the [FeCl4]− species (m/z 198) in the 1:1 Fe:cit solution, citrate ligand being bidentate or tridentate. The intensity of the [Fe(Hcit)Cl]− peak is lower in the 1:4 Fe:cit solution, and is not observed in 1:10 Fe:cit. The 1:4 Fe:cit solution had a predominant abundance of bi and trinuclear complexes. Interestingly, peaks at m/z 436, 628, and 820 were detected, representing the mononuclear iron dicitrate species [Fe(H2cit)2]−, [H4cit][Fe(H2cit)2]−, and [H4cit]2[Fe(H2cit)2]−, respectively, these last two associated with free citric acid. This mononuclear dicitrate complex has been characterized in its solid state as [Fe(cit)2]5− and [Fe(Hcit)(cit)]4− crystallized from solution at pH >7 and pH 6, respectively (18Gautier-Luneau I. Merle C. Phanon D. Lebrun C. Biaso F. Serratrice G. Pierre J.L. Chem. Eur. J. 2005; 11: 2207-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). At more acidic pH, in solution, this species should be [Fe(Hcit)2]3−, [Fe(H2cit)(Hcit)]2−, or [Fe(H2cit)2]−, and for the remaining of the text we refer to the mononuclear iron dicitrate species with the general formula [Fe(cit)2H4-x](1+x)−. The 1:10 Fe:cit preparation, which in vitro exerts the strongest PTP inhibitory activity, contained mononuclear dicitrate complexes in greater relative abundance compared with binuclear or trinuclear species (Fig. 3). Most interestingly is the absence of mononuclear dicitrate species in the 1:1 Fe:cit preparation, which in vitro has no PTP inhibitory activity, strongly suggests that mononuclear dicitrate complexes could represent the active PTP inhibitory species. The importance of iron as a biologically active transition metal stems from its ability to engage in one-electron oxidation-reduction reactions. However, this same property is responsible for its toxic effects, where free reactive ions can catalyze the formation of ROS via Habber Weiss and Fenton chemistry (1) O2|· + Fe3+ ⇆ Fe2+ + O2; (2) 2 O2|· + 2H+ → H2O2 + O2; (3) Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH· + OH− (28Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4442) Google Scholar). ROS play an important role in the regulation of PTP activity. Oxidation of the conserved catalytic cysteine residue in the PTP domain impairs enzymatic activity (4Tonks N.K. Cell. 2005; 121: 667-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the Fe-cit PTP inhibition could result from PTP oxidation mediated by ROS. Incubation of Mφ protein lysates with 1:10 Fe:cit solution in the presence or absence of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), SOD+CAT or DTT, did not rescue PTP activity (Fig. 4A), suggesting that generation of ROS is likely not the mechanism of Fe-cit PTP inhibition. Increased PTP activity observed upon treatment with 5 mm DTT could result from total reduction of the PTPs catalytic Cys after protein lysis. In-gel PTP activity assays have provided a good tool for studying the regulation of cellular PTPs. In this assay, PTPs are denatured and subsequently renatured within the gel, recovering PTP enzymatic activity (15Gomez M.A. Li S. Tremblay M.L. Olivier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36190-36198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal.

Addition of 1:10 Fe:cit during the renaturation steps in an in-gel PTP assay of total Mφ PTPs abolished complete recovery of enzymatic activity (Fig. 4B). This suggests that Fe-cit could physically interact with the PTP active site (Fig. 4B). Computational molecular docking of Fe-cit complexes on the macrophage PTP SHP-1 (PDB code: 1GWZ) showed that the most energetically favorable interaction with the mononuclear dicitrate complex C7 ([Fe(cit)2]5−) occurred within the catalytic domain (Fig. 5). The mononuclear dicitrate complex occupied this pocket, forming favorable interactions with residues lining the wall, such as Tyr278, Ser456, and Arg461, the later involved in both substrate binding and stabilization of the phosphoenzyme intermediate (30Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Møller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) Molecular docking of [Fe(cit)2]5− and the crystal structure of SHP-1 in complex with a tyrosine phosphopeptide (PDB code: 1FPR.pdb) suggests that mononuclear dicitrate complexes block access to the PTP active site, potentially acting as competitive PTP inhibitors (supplemental Fig. S1). In line with our biochemical data, modeling experiments of SHP-1 and the binuclear Fe-cit complex C2 ([Fe2(cit)2(H2O)2]2−) showed no convincing interaction with the PTP catalytic domain. A nonspecific, presumably low affinity, binding site could be modeled, but its location was far away from the mononuclear binding pocket (∼20 Å). This correlates with the inability of the binuclear Fe-cit complex to inhibit PTP activity. Collectively, these results corroborate our biochemical observations, and identify the mononuclear dicitrate complex [Fe2(cit)2]5− (or in other protonated state [Fe(cit)2H4-x](1+x)−) as the active PTP inhibitory species. Incubation B10R murine Mφs with 1:1 and 1:10 Fe:cit solutions showed ∼50% inhibition of PTP activity as early as 5 min following Fe:cit delivery (Fig. 6A). Surprisingly, intracellular PTP inhibition also occurred with 1:1 Fe:cit preparation (which shows no inhibitory capacity in vitro, Fig. 2A), possibly attributable to intracellular metabolism of multinuclear Fe:cit complexes to more stable mononuclear species. Substantiating the specificity of the regulatory effect of Fe:cit complexes, Mφ incubation with FeCl3 or FeSO4 only marginally inhibited Mφ PTP activity (Fig. 6A). Western blot of total phosphotyrosine showed hyperphosphorylation of Mφ proteins as early as 5 min of incubation with 1:10 Fe:cit (Fig. 6B). Specific phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 and SAPK/JNK MAP kinases was detected, respectively, after 15 min and 5 min of 1:10 Fe:cit treatment (Fig. 6, C and D). When Mφs were incubated for different time periods with 1:10 Fe:cit prior to LPS stimulation, potentiation of ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK hyperphosphorylation was observed in response to LPS-Fe:cit co-treatment, similarly observed at early treatment time points (5–15 min). Of interest, MAPK phosphorylation decreased after 1 h of LPS-Fe:cit co-stimulation, but not during Fe:cit treatment alone, consistent with the regulatory role of inflammation on iron homeostasis. Taken together, these data agree with an iron-dependent PTP inhibition favoring protein kinase activity and protein phosphorylation, ultimately leading to positive signal transduction. Knowledge on the mechanisms underlying intracellular PTP activity regulation is pivotal for understanding the course of signal transduction in response to extracellular and intracellular stimuli, and provides insights into how and when can this group of enzymes be considered as potential targets for therapeutic interventions. The PTP family encompasses a group of enzymes diverse in structural features, cellular distribution, subcellular localization, and substrate specificities, however, maintaining a conserved catalytic domain (5Alonso A.

Similarly, the mechanisms of activity regulation can be diverse, specific and broad. To date, three main events controlling PTP activity have been described: protein phosphorylation, dimerization and oxidation. Whereas the first two have been shown to play a role in the regulation of specific PTPs or PTP subfamilies (3Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P.

https://openalex.org/W2129233814,"Neuregulin1 (NRG1)-ErbB signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer and schizophrenia. We have previously reported that NRG1-stimulated migration of B lymphoblasts is PI3K-AKT1dependent and impaired in patients with schizophrenia and significantly linked to the catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) Val108/158Met functional polymorphism.We have now examined AKT1 activation in NRG1-stimulated B lymphoblasts and other cell models and explored a functional relationship between COMT and AKT1. NRG1-induced AKT1 phosphorylation was significantly diminished in Val carriers compared to Met carriers in both normal subjects and in patients. Further, there was a significant epistatic interaction between a putatively functional coding SNP in AKT1 (rs1130233) and COMT Val108/158Met genotype on AKT1 phosphorylation. NRG1 induced translocation of AKT1 to the plasma membrane also was impaired in Val carriers, while PIP(3) levels were not decreased. Interestingly, the level of COMT enzyme activity was inversely correlated with the cells' ability to synthesize phosphatidylserine (PS), a factor that attracts the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) of AKT1 to the cell membrane. Transfection of SH-SY5Y cells with a COMT Val construct increased COMT activity and significantly decreased PS levels as well as NRG1-induced AKT1 phosphorylation and migration. Administration of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) rescued all of these deficits. These data suggest that AKT1 function is influenced by COMT enzyme activity through competition with PS synthesis for SAM, which in turn dictates AKT1-dependent cellular responses to NRG1-mediated signaling.Our findings implicate genetic and functional interactions between COMT and AKT1 and may provide novel insights into pathogenesis of schizophrenia and other ErbB-associated human diseases such as cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2077532695,"Background Voluntary contraceptive use by HIV-positive women currently prevents more HIV-positive births, at a lower cost, than anti-retroviral drug (ARV) regimens. Despite this evidence, most prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs focus solely on providing ARV prophylaxis to pregnant women and rarely include the prevention of unintended pregnancies among HIV-positive women. Methodology/Principal Findings To strengthen support for family planning as HIV prevention, we systematically identified key individuals in the field of international HIV/AIDS—those who could potentially influence the issue—and sought to determine their perceptions of barriers to and facilitators for implementing this PMTCT strategy. We used a criteria-based approach to determine which HIV/AIDS stakeholders have the most significant impact on HIV/AIDS research, programs, funding and policy and stratified purposive sampling to conduct interviews with a subset of these individuals. The interview findings pointed to obstacles to strengthening linkages between family planning and HIV/AIDS, including the need for: resources to integrate family planning and HIV services, infrastructure or capacity to provide integrated services at the facility level, national leadership and coordination, and targeted advocacy to key decision-makers. Conclusions/Significance The individuals we identified as having regional or international influence in the field of HIV/AIDS have the ability to leverage an increasingly conducive funding environment and a growing evidence base to address the policy, programmatic and operational challenges to integrating family planning with HIV/AIDS. Fostering greater support for implementing contraception for HIV prevention will require the dedication, collaboration and coordination of many such actors. Our findings can inform a targeted advocacy campaign."

We used serial sectioning combined with manual registration and segmentation of images to develop a comprehensive and detailed three-dimensional atlas of the honeybee head-neck system. This interactive atlas includes skeletal structures of the head and prothorax, the neck musculature, and the nervous system. The scope and resolution of the model exceeds atlases previously developed on similar sized animals, and the interactive nature of the model provides a far more accessible means of interpreting and comprehending insect anatomy and neuroanatomy."

https://openalex.org/W2023262643,"Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 1 (Nod1) is an intracellular protein involved in recognition of the bacterial component peptidoglycan. This recognition event induces a host defense response to eliminate invading pathogens. The genetic variation of Nod1 has been linked to several inflammatory diseases and allergies, which are strongly affected by environmental factors. We have found that many of the bacteria that contain DAP-type peptidoglycan release Nod1 ligands into the environment. However, the structures of natural Nod1 ligands in the environment are not well understood. Herein, we report the isolation and structural elucidation of natural human Nod1 (hNod1) ligands from the Escherichia coli K-12 culture supernatant. The supernatant was fractionated with reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), resulting in the isolation of several hNod1 stimulatory fractions. Structural characterization studies demonstrated that the molecular structure of the most active fraction was the native hNod1 ligand GlcNAc-(β1–4)-(anhydro)MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-meso-DAP. We also found other peptidoglycan fragments using the 7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carbonyl labeling method to enhance sensitivity in mass spectroscopy studies. These results suggested that DAP-containing bacteria release certain hNod1 ligands to the environment, and these ligands would accumulate in the environment and regulate the immune system through Nod1."
https://openalex.org/W2018404553,"Background Lateral gene transfer (LGT) appears to promote genotypic and phenotypic variation in microbial communities in a range of environments, including the mammalian intestine. However, the extent and mechanisms of LGT in intestinal microbial communities of non-mammalian hosts remains poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We sequenced two fosmid inserts obtained from a genomic DNA library derived from an agar-degrading enrichment culture of marine iguana fecal material. The inserts harbored 16S rRNA genes that place the organism from which they originated within Clostridium cluster IV, a well documented group that habitats the mammalian intestinal tract. However, sequence analysis indicates that 52% of the protein-coding genes on the fosmids have top BLASTX hits to bacterial species that are not members of Clostridium cluster IV, and phylogenetic analysis suggests that at least 10 of 44 coding genes on the fosmids may have been transferred from Clostridium cluster XIVa to cluster IV. The fosmids encoded four transposase-encoding genes and an integrase-encoding gene, suggesting their involvement in LGT. In addition, several coding genes likely involved in sugar transport were probably acquired through LGT. Conclusion Our phylogenetic evidence suggests that LGT may be common among phylogenetically distinct members of the phylum Firmicutes inhabiting the intestinal tract of marine iguanas."
https://openalex.org/W2037662375,"Background X-chromosome inactivation occurs early in mammalian development and results in the inactive X chromosome acquiring numerous hallmarks of heterochromatin. While XIST is a key player in the inactivation process, the method of action of this ncRNA is yet to be determined. Methodology/Principal Findings To assess which features of heterochromatin may be directly recruited by the expression and localization of the XIST RNA we have analyzed a mouse/human somatic cell hybrid in which expression of human and mouse XIST/Xist has been induced from the active X by demethylation. Such hybrids had previously been demonstrated to disconnect XIST/Xist expression from gene silencing and we confirm maintenance of X-linked gene expression, even close to the Xist locus, despite the localized expression of mouse Xist. Conclusions/Significance Loss of the active chromatin marks H3 acetylation and H3 lysine 4 methylation was not observed upon XIST/Xist expression, nor was there a gain of DNA methylation; thus these marks of facultative heterochromatin are not solely dependent upon Xist expression. Cot-1 holes, regions of depleted RNA hybridization with a Cot-1 probe, were observed upon Xist expression; however, these were at reduced frequency and intensity in these somatic cells. Domains of human Cot-1 transcription were observed corresponding to the human chromosomes in the somatic cell hybrids. The Cot-1 domain of the X was not reduced with the expression of XIST, which fails to localize to the human X chromosome in a mouse somatic cell background. The human inactive X in a mouse/human hybrid cell also shows delocalized XIST expression and an ongoing Cot-1 domain, despite X-linked gene silencing. These results are consistent with recent reports separating Cot-1 silencing from genic silencing, but also demonstrate repetitive element expression from an otherwise silent X chromosome in these hybrid cells."
