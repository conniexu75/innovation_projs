https://openalex.org/W4292360241,"Abstract The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains a 5′ cap that facilitates the translation of viral proteins, protection from exonucleases and evasion of the host immune response 1–4 . How this cap is made in SARS-CoV-2 is not completely understood. Here we reconstitute the N 7- and 2′- O -methylated SARS-CoV-2 RNA cap ( 7Me GpppA 2′- O -Me ) using virally encoded non-structural proteins (nsps). We show that the kinase-like nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) domain 5 of nsp12 transfers the RNA to the amino terminus of nsp9, forming a covalent RNA–protein intermediate (a process termed RNAylation). Subsequently, the NiRAN domain transfers the RNA to GDP, forming the core cap structure GpppA-RNA. The nsp14 6 and nsp16 7 methyltransferases then add methyl groups to form functional cap structures. Structural analyses of the replication–transcription complex bound to nsp9 identified key interactions that mediate the capping reaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a reverse genetics system 8 that the N terminus of nsp9 and the kinase-like active-site residues in the NiRAN domain are required for successful SARS-CoV-2 replication. Collectively, our results reveal an unconventional mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 caps its RNA genome, thus exposing a new target in the development of antivirals to treat COVID-19."

https://openalex.org/W4290779674,"Most environments favor defection over cooperation due to natural selection. Nonetheless, the emergence of cooperation is omnipresent in many biological, social, and economic systems, quite contrary to the well-celebrated Darwinian theory of evolution. Much research has been devoted to better understanding how and why cooperation persists among self-interested individuals despite their competition for limited resources. Here we go beyond a single social dilemma since individuals usually encounter various social challenges. In particular, we propose and study a mathematical model incorporating both the prisoner's dilemma and the snowdrift game. We further extend this model by considering ecological signatures like mutation and selfless one-sided contribution of altruist free space. The nonlinear evolutionary dynamics that results from these upgrades offer a broader range of equilibrium outcomes, and it also often favors cooperation over defection. With the help of analytical and numerical calculations, our theoretical model sheds light on the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity, and it helps to explain the evolution of social order in human societies."
https://openalex.org/W4290720550,"During development, melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) become light sensitive much earlier than rods and cones. IpRGCs project to many subcortical areas, whereas physiological functions of these projections are yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we found that ipRGC-mediated light sensation promotes synaptogenesis of pyramidal neurons in various cortices and the hippocampus. This phenomenon depends on activation of ipRGCs and is mediated by the release of oxytocin from the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) into cerebral-spinal fluid. We further characterized a direct connection between ipRGCs and oxytocin neurons in the SON and mutual projections between oxytocin neurons in the SON and PVN. Moreover, we showed that the lack of ipRGC-mediated, light-promoted early cortical synaptogenesis compromised learning ability in adult mice. Our results highlight the importance of light sensation early in life on the development of learning ability and therefore call attention to suitable light environment for infant care."
https://openalex.org/W4296663362,"Neurons activated by learning have been ascribed the unique potential to encode memory, but the functional contribution of discrete cell types remains poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear whether learning engages specific GABAergic interneurons and, if so, whether they differ functionally from interneurons recruited by other experiences. Here, we show that fear conditioning activates a heterogeneous neuronal population in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that is largely comprised of somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs). Using intersectional genetic approaches, we demonstrate that fear-learning-activated SST-INs exhibit distinct circuit properties and are selectively reactivated to mediate cue-evoked memory expression. In contrast, an orthogonal population of SST-INs activated by morphine experience exerts opposing control over fear and supports reward-like motivational effects. These results outline an important role for discrete subsets of GABAergic cells in emotional learning and point to an unappreciated capacity for functional specialization among SST-INs."
https://openalex.org/W4290779547,"Sorafenib is an oral multi-kinase receptor inhibitor that targets various signaling pathways. It is used as the first line of treatment in advanced hepatocellular and renal cell carcinomas. Sorafenib was reported to induce cardiotoxicity due to myocyte necrosis. Hesperetin is a naturally occurring flavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capabilities. This study investigated the putative protective effect of hesperetin against sorafenib-induced cardiotoxicity in mice through downregulation of NLRP3/TLR4 signaling and inhibition of apoptosis. Twenty-four male Swiss mice were distributed into four groups: untreated control, hesperetin (50 mg/kg/day, orally), sorafenib (100 mg/kg/day, orally), and combination (Hesperetin+Sorafenib). After a three-week treatment period, various biochemical parameters in cardiac tissues were assessed. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels were measured. Moreover, TLR4 and NLRP3 expressions were evaluated using Western blot analysis. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical assessment of apoptotic activity were done. Compared with the sorafenib group, the combination group exhibited reduced TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 levels and lower NLRP3/TLR4 expressions. Histologically, the combination group showed improved myocardial histology and a marked decrease in collagen deposition. Immunohistochemical examination showed decreased caspase-3 and increased Bcl-2 expression. Before recommending hesperetin as an adjuvant, clinical studies are warranted for mitigating sorafenib cardiotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W4291670770,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology that increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer and imposes a lifelong healthcare burden on millions of patients worldwide. Current treatment strategies are associated with significant risks and have been shown to be fairly effective. Hence, discovering new therapies that have better efficacy and safety profiles than currently exploited therapeutic strategies is challenging. It has been well delineated that NF-κB/Nrf2 crosstalk is a chief player in the interplay between oxidative stress and inflammation. Ambroxol hydrochloride, a mucolytic agent, has shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in humans and animals and has not yet been examined for the management of UC. Therefore, our approach was to investigate whether ambroxol could be effective to combat UC using the common acetic acid rat model. Interestingly, a high dose of oral ambroxol (200 mg/kg/day) reasonably improved the microscopic and macroscopic features of the injured colon. This was linked to low disease activity and a reduction in the colonic weight/length ratio. In the context of that, ambroxol boosted Nrf2 activity and upregulated HO-1 and catalase to augment the antioxidant defense against oxidative damage. Besides, ambroxol inactivated NF-κB signaling and its consequent target pro-inflammatory mediators, IL-6 and TNF-α. In contrast, IL-10 is upregulated. Consistent with these results, myeloperoxidase activity is suppressed. Moreover, ambroxol decreased the susceptibility of the injured colon to apoptosis. To conclude, our findings highlight the potential application of ambroxol to modify the progression of UC by its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic properties."
https://openalex.org/W4290779662,"Background Food security is substantially affected directly by COVID-19 and/or indirectly by the measures adopted for the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the impact of COVID-19 on food security and identify the most compromised food security dimension to ease the food security regulators and actors’ intervention prioritisation. Methodology Primary research focused on the impact of COVID-19 on food security will be searched from three online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus), manually using a google scholar search engine, and studies’ reference list were also manually searched. The prevalence of food insecurity in each study and the most compromised food security dimension including their associated factors will be identified. The food insecurity before and after COVID-19 emergence and the status of food security dimension before and after COVID-19 will be compared and interpreted. Discussion The heterogeneity of the studies and the factors for the variability of outcomes will be discussed. COVID-19 had a negative impact on food security if the food insecurity prevalence before the emergence of COVID-19 is less than during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other confounding factors that can contribute to the high food insecurity prevalence like natural disasters, war, and instability will be considered in addition to COVID-19. Registration This systematic review protocol is registered in PROSPERO under the registration number: CRD42022325475 ."
https://openalex.org/W4291282909,"Infection with infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) is a crustacean disease that caused large-scale mortality in Penaeus stylirostris, deformity and growth retardation in Penaeus vannamei and Penaeus monodon. We surveyed the presence of IHHNV in three major shrimp-producing regions in Ecuador, namely Guayas, El Oro, and Esmeralda. The data show that IHHNV is endemic (3.3-100% prevalence) to shrimp farms in these regions. The whole genome sequences of representative circulating IHHNV genotypes in Ecuador and Peru showed that these genotypes formed a separate cluster within the Type II genotypes and were divergent from other geographical isolates of IHHNV originating in Asia, Africa, Australia, and Brazil. In experimental bioassays using specific pathogen-free (SPF) P. vannamei, P. monodon, and P. stylirostris and representative IHHNV isolates from Ecuador and Peru, the virus did not cause any mortality or induce clinical signs in any of the three penaeid species. Although IHHNV-specific Cowdry type A inclusion bodies were histologically detected in experimentally challenged P. vannamei and P. monodon and confirmed by in situ hybridization, no such inclusions were observed in P. stylirostris. Moreover, P. vannamei had the highest viral load, followed by P. monodon and P. stylirostris. Based on IHHNV surveillance data, we conclude that the currently farmed P. vannamei lines in Ecuador are tolerant to circulating IHHNV genotypes. The genome sequence and experimental bioassay data showed that, although the currently circulating genotypes are infectious, they do not induce clinical lesions in the three commercially important penaeid species. These findings suggest a potentially evolving virus-host relationship where circulating genotypes of IHHNV co-exist in equilibrium with P. vannamei raised in Peru and Ecuador."
https://openalex.org/W4290473387,"Human cytochrome P450 8B1 (CYP8B1) is involved in conversion of cholesterol to bile acids. It hydroxylates the steroid ring at C12 to ultimately produce the bile acid cholic acid. Studies implicated this enzyme as a good drug target for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes, but there are no selective inhibitors known for this enzyme and no structures to guide inhibitor development. Herein, the human CYP8B1 protein was generated and used to identify and characterize interactions with a series of azole inhibitors, which tend to be poorly selective P450 inhibitors. Structurally related miconazole, econazole, and tioconazole bound with submicromolar dissociation constants and were effective inhibitors of the native reaction. CYP8B was cocrystallized with S-tioconazole to yield the first X-ray structure. This inhibitor bound in the active site with its azole nitrogen coordinating the heme iron, consistent with inhibitor binding and inhibition assay data. Additionally, the CYP8B1 active site was compared with similar P450 enzymes to identify features that may facilitate the design of more selective inhibitors. Selective inhibitors should promote a better understanding of the role of CYP8B1 inhibition in normal physiology and disease states and provide a possible treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4290779620,"Increase in the variety of development in urban context has made it more complicated and complex for the users of public spaces. Absence of sufficient information to read the surrounding causes psychological anxiousness leading to perceived danger or discomfort for the urbanites. Consequently, perceived safety and comfort of the users is distinctively low in urban contexts, creating neglected and underused spaces. Complexity is one of the information processing variables as per Kaplan and Kaplan's informational model which helps users to comprehend the surrounding environment. The streetscape plays a vital role in the daily movement patterns within the urban cities and is the transition boundary between the public and private realms. Visual complexity of these streets is a result of different configurations of elements within the urban areas. This research is conducted to ascertain the relationship between visual complexity levels of the streets with the perceived safety and comfort of the users. Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) and Fractal dimension analysis were conducted with 48 SVIs (Street View Images) selected within 1km radius of Colpetty junction, Colombo Sri Lanka covering all the possible compositions found within the context. The visual index data extraction had identified ten major components within the selected 48 SVIs. 78 subjective ranking responses for perceived safety, comfort (preference) and perceived complexity were collected from snowball sampling. Findings of the study revealed that perceived safety levels and preference scores for the SVIs are related to the Shannon Diversity Index calculation in an inverted 'U' shape where the highest and lowest SDI values are related with low preference scores and low safety levels. The SVIs with medium SDI values are perceived as the safest and most preferred by the users of urban streets of Colombo Sri Lanka. The SDI and fractal dimension values were significantly correlated with the perceived complexity scores of the users. The results of this study can be accommodated in the planning and designing of urban streetscapes of tropical climates for sustainable and friendly urban expansions."
https://openalex.org/W4292661563,"Necroptosis is defined as a novel programmed cell necrosis that is mediated by receptor interacting serine–threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and other related signals. Necrosis, apoptosis and inflammation are commonly considered as the leading mechanism in acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by gentamicin (GEN), which is a useful antibiotic for treating the infection of Gram-negative bacterial. However, the necroptosis in the pathogenesis of GEN-induced AKI is unknown. In this study, to investigate the process and function of necroptosis in GEN-induced AKI, NRK-52E and HK-2 cells and SD rats were used as the models. The necroptosis-related proteins, including RIPK1, RIPK3, mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) and phosphorylated MLKL (p-MLKL), were all increasing time-dependently when GEN was continuously given. By using the RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 (NEC-1) and RIPK3 inhibitor (CPD42), the GEN-induced toxicity of tubular cells was alleviated. Moreover, it was validated that GEN-induced cell apoptosis and inflammation were attenuated after treating with NEC-1 or CPD42, both in vivo and in vitro. When MLKL was knocked down by siRNA, NEC-1 and CPD42 can not further protect the damage of tubular cells by GEN. Although the using of pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD significantly decreased GEN-induced apoptosis, it enhanced necroptosis and slightly promoted the decreased cell viability in GEN-treated cells, with the protective effects weaker than NEC-1 or CPD42. Finally, in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests and bacteriostatic ring studies showed that NEC-1 did not interfere with the antibiotic effects of GEN. Thus, suppressing necroptosis can serve as a promising strategy for the prevention of GEN-induced nephrotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W4292661636,"In the treatment of patients with locally advanced prostate cancer (PCa), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy by weakening the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. Recently, several studies have suggested that androgen receptor splicing variants (ARvs) may mediate a compensatory DDR pathway when canonical androgen receptor (AR) signaling is inhibited, thus contributing to the resistance of some patients to this combinational treatment. However, the specific roles of certain ARvs as well as the detailed mechanism of how ARvs regulate the DDR are not well understood. Here, we demonstrated that AR splicing variant 7 (ARv7), which is the most abundant form of ARvs, significantly promotes the DDR of PCa cells under severe DNA damage independent of its parental AR by using the ionizing radiation (IR) and doxorubicin (Dox)-treated cell models. Mechanistically, ARv7 is sufficient to upregulate both the homologous recombination (HR) and the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways by forming a positive regulatory loop with poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1). Moreover, the presence of ARv7 impairs the synergistic effect between AR antagonists and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, which has been recently shown to be a promising future treatment strategy for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Combined, our data indicate that constitutively active ARv7 not only contributes to radioresistance after ADT, but may also serve as a potential predictive biomarker for assessing the efficacy of novel PARP inhibitor-based therapy in PCa."
https://openalex.org/W4290779619,"Vaginal microbiota (VMB) is associated with changes in Human papilloma virus (HPV) status, which consequently influences the risk of cervical cancer. This association was often confounded by personal risk factors. This pilot research aimed to explore the relationship between vaginal microbiota, personal risk factors and their interactions with HPV status conversion to identify the vaginal microbiota that was associated with HPV clearance under heterogeneous personal risk factors. A total of 38 women participated by self-collecting a cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) sample that was sent for metagenomics sequencing. Most of the participants also filled in personal risk factors questionnaire through an eHealth platform and authorized the use of their previous HPV genotyping results stored in this eHealth platform. Based on the two HPV results, the participants were grouped into three cohorts, namely HPV negative, HPV persistent infection, and HPV status conversion. The relative abundance of VMB and personal factors were compared among these three cohorts. A correlation investigation was performed between VMB and the significant personal factors to characterize a robustness of the panel for HPV status change using R programming. At baseline, 12 participants were HPV-negative, and 22 were HPV-positive. Within one year, 18 women remained HPV-positive, 12 were HPV-negative and 4 participants showed HPV clearance. The factors in the eHealth questionnaire were systematically evaluated which identified several factors significantly associated with persistent HPV infection, including age, salary, history of reproductive tract infection, and the total number of sexual partners. Concurrent vaginal microbiome samples suggest that a candidate biomarker panel consisting of Lactobacillus gasseri , Streptococcus agalactiae , and Timona prevotella bacteria, which may be associated with HPV clearance. This pilot study indicates a stable HPV status-related vaginal microbe environment. To establish a robust biomarker panel for clinical use, larger cohorts will be recruited into follow-up studies."
https://openalex.org/W4290779710,"Background Sleep disturbances affect 38% of care home residents living with dementia. They are often treated with medication, but non-pharmacological interventions may be safer and effective yet more difficult to implement. In the SIESTA study (Sleep problems In dEmentia: interviews with care home STAff) we explored care home staffs’ experience of managing sleep disturbances in their residents living with dementia. Methods We conducted one-to-one semi-structured interviews in four UK care homes, and purposively recruited a maximum variation sample of 18 nurses and care assistants, who were each interviewed once. We used a topic guide and audio-recorded the interviews. Two researchers independently analysed themes from transcribed interviews. Results Staff used a range of techniques that often worked in improving or preventing residents’ sleep disturbance. During the daytime, staff encouraged residents to eat well, and be physically active and stimulated to limit daytime sleep. In the evening, staff settled residents into dark, quiet, comfortable bedrooms often after a snack. When residents woke at night, they gave them caffeinated tea or food, considered possible pain and discomfort, and reassured residents they were safe. If residents remained unsettled, staff would engage them in activities. They used telecare to monitor night-time risk. Staff found minimising daytime napping difficult, described insufficient staffing at night to attend to reorient and guide awake residents and said residents frequently did not know it was night-time. Conclusions Some common techniques, such as caffeinated drinks, may be counterproductive. Future non-pharmacological interventions should consider practical difficulties staff face in managing sleep disturbances, including struggling to limit daytime napping, identifying residents’ night-time needs, day-night disorientation, and insufficient night-time staffing."
https://openalex.org/W4290779711,"Male academy rugby league players are required to undertake field and resistance training to develop the technical, tactical and physical qualities important for success in the sport. However, limited research is available exploring the training load of academy rugby league players. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantify the field and resistance training loads of academy rugby league players during a pre-season period and compare training loads between playing positions (i.e., forwards vs. backs). Field and resistance training load data from 28 adolescent male (age 17 ± 1 years) rugby league players were retrospectively analysed following a 13-week pre-season training period (85 total training observations; 45 field sessions and 40 resistance training sessions). Global positioning system microtechnology, and estimated repetition volume was used to quantify external training load, and session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) was used to quantify internal training load. Positional differences (forwards n = 13 and backs n = 15) in training load were established using a linear mixed effect model. Mean weekly training frequency was 7 ± 2 with duration totaling 324 ± 137 minutes, and a mean sRPE of 1562 ± 678 arbitrary units (AU). Backs covered more high-speed distance than forwards in weeks two (p = 0.024), and 11 (p = 0.028). Compared to the forwards, backs completed more lower body resistance training volume in week one (p = 0.02), more upper body volume in week three (p&lt; 0.001) and week 12 (p = 0.005). The findings provide novel data on the field and resistance-based training load undertaken by academy rugby league players across a pre-season period, highlighting relative uniformity between playing positions. Quantifying training load can support objective decision making for the prescription and manipulation of future training, ultimately aiming to maximise training within development pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4290779876,"Quasi-stiffness characterizes the dynamics of a joint in specific sections of stance-phase and is used in the design of wearable devices to assist walking. We sought to investigate the effect of simulated reduced gravity and walking speed on quasi-stiffness of the hip, knee, and ankle in overground walking. 12 participants walked at 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 m/s in 1, 0.76, 0.54, and 0.31 gravity. We defined 11 delimiting points in stance phase (4 each for the ankle and hip, 3 for the knee) and calculated the quasi-stiffness for 4 phases for both the hip and ankle, and 2 phases for the knee. The R2 value quantified the suitability of the quasi-stiffness models. We found gravity level had a significant effect on 6 phases of quasi-stiffness, while speed significantly affected the quasi-stiffness in 5 phases. We concluded that the intrinsic muscle-tendon unit stiffness was the biggest determinant of quasi-stiffness. Speed had a significant effect on the R2 of all phases of quasi-stiffness. Slow walking (0.4 m/s) was the least accurately modelled walking speed. Our findings showed adaptions in gait strategy when relative power and strength of the joints were increased in low gravity, which has implications for prosthesis and exoskeleton design."
https://openalex.org/W4293374757,"Accumulation of lipid substances decreased the activity of osteoblasts. Trehalose is a typical stress metabolite to form a protective membrane on cell surface which has been demonstrated to regulate lipid metabolism. This activity of Trehalose indicates the potential effect of osteoporosis treatment. Our study aimed to determine the therapeutic effect of Trehalose in high fat-induced osteoporosis. We used palmitic acid (PA) to mimic the state of high fat and observed the apoptosis ratio of osteoblasts increased. After adding Trehalose, the apoptosis ratio decreased obviously. Autophagy is a regulatory means involved in the process of apoptosis. We detected the autophagy protein and found that the expression of Beclin-1, Atg5, and LC3 II increased, and p62 decreased after Trehalose treatment. When adding an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA), the expression of Beclin-1, Atg5, and LC3 II decreased, and p62 increased. These results indicated autophagy was an important factor involved in the preventive effect of Trehalose in PA-induced apoptosis. SIRT3 is a mitochondrial gene that can inhibit apoptosis, which has been reported to promote autophagy. We used SIRT3-siRNA to silence the expression of SIRT3 and found the effect of Trehalose was counteracted. The apoptosis ratio increased and the expression of Beclin-1, Atg5, and LC3 II decreased, p62 increased. Additionally, we also fed the mice with a high-fat diet (HFD) and intragastrical Trehalose. The results showed that Trehalose could inhibit the bone mass loss with HFD. Our study revealed the effect and mechanism of Trehalose in the treatment of osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W4290779678,"The relationship between the cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance and investment underdiversification is examined. A theoretical link between uncertainty avoidance and ambiguity is established, that is, cultural uncertainty avoidance captures the aversion attitude towards ambiguity at the national group level, thus, cultural dimension of uncertainty avoidance influences investors' behavioral biases of home bias and the investment abroad concentration. The empirical results show that investment underdiversification is significantly and positively affected by the degree of uncertainty avoidance and robustness tests support this conclusion. A further analysis reveals that uncertainty avoidance moderates the effects of ambiguity on investment underdiversification, whereas the effects of uncertainty avoidance are mediated by the status quo bias."
https://openalex.org/W4290779721,"Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers has been established, linking workplace factors with high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia and burnout. Less established is how COVID-19 affects both work, home and social life of nurses and midwives concurrently. This study describes the prevalence and severity of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and insomnia and examines their associations with stressors within the work, home and social environment, among nurses and midwives. A longitudinal, mixed-methods, online survey explored the psychological health of public sector nurses and midwives during the COVID-19 pandemic first year. Surveys were conducted in April (initial) and June 2020 (3-month), and April 2021 (12-month) and consisted of psychological tests including the Patient Health Questionnaire, General Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia Severity Index, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised; workplace and lifestyle questions, together with free-text comments. The relative strengths of the associations between predictor and outcome variables were estimated using repeated measures ordered logistic regression, and free text responses were themed. Data show diagnostic levels of anxiety (23%, 18%, 21%) at surveys one, two and three respectively, depression (26%, 23% and 28%), PTSD (16%, 12% and 10%) and insomnia (19%, 19% and 21%). The strongest predictors of psychological distress were current home and family stress and poor clinical team support. Factors which will help preserve the mental health of nurses and midwives include strong workplace culture, reducing occupational risk, clear communication processes, and supporting stable and functional relationships at home. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the visibility of mental distress on nurses and midwives and established they are pivotal to healthcare. The health service has a duty-of-care for the welfare of nurses and midwives who have entered this psychologically taxing profession to future proof service delivery and safeguard its service-response capacity."
https://openalex.org/W4290779822,"Introduction According to the World Health Organization, the tall cell variant (TCV) is an aggressive subtype of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) comprising at least 30% epithelial cells two to three times as tall as they are wide. In practice, applying this definition is difficult causing substantial interobserver variability. We aimed to train a deep learning algorithm to detect and quantify the proportion of tall cells (TCs) in PTC. Methods We trained the deep learning algorithm using supervised learning, testing it on an independent dataset, and further validating it on an independent set of 90 PTC samples from patients treated at the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa between 2003 and 2013. We compared the algorithm-based TC percentage to the independent scoring by a human investigator and how those scorings associated with disease outcomes. Additionally, we assessed the TC score in 71 local and distant tumor relapse samples from patients with aggressive disease. Results In the test set, the deep learning algorithm detected TCs with a sensitivity of 93.7% and a specificity of 94.5%, whereas the sensitivity fell to 90.9% and specificity to 94.1% for non-TC areas. In the validation set, the deep learning algorithm TC scores correlated with a diminished relapse-free survival using cutoff points of 10% (p = 0.044), 20% (p &lt; 0.01), and 30% (p = 0.036). The visually assessed TC score did not statistically significantly predict survival at any of the analyzed cutoff points. We observed no statistically significant difference in the TC score between primary tumors and relapse tumors determined by the deep learning algorithm or visually. Conclusions We present a novel deep learning–based algorithm to detect tall cells, showing that a high deep learning–based TC score represents a statistically significant predictor of less favorable relapse-free survival in PTC."
https://openalex.org/W4290779926,"Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and specific imaging characteristics of positron emission tomography/computed tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET/CT), contrast enhanced CT (CE-CT), and a combined imaging approach (CE-PET/CT) in patients with infectious/mycotic (MAA), inflammatory (IAA), and non-infected, non-inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Materials and methods In this single-center retrospective cohort study, all imaging data sets of 29 consecutive patients with clinically suspected MAA or IAA were anonymised with different, reshuffled identification numbers and retrospectively and independently analysed by two experienced readers, blinded to all clinical patient data. Readers determined the presence or absence and MAA, IAA and AAA and of predefined imaging characteristics (e.g. fluid collection), and measured metabolic activity and wall thickness of all aneurysms. A multidisciplinary team of specialists served as standard of reference and re-evaluated every clinical case, considering all clinical, laboratory, microbiological, histopathological and imaging results, including all follow-up examinations. Results Diagnostic accuracy was higher in PET/CT as compared to CE-CT in differentiating AAA from MAA and IAA: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) 0 . 81 (95% confidence intervals 0 . 69–0 . 92) and 0 . 63 (0 . 52–0 . 74) (P = 0 . 027) . Specific imaging characteristics were significantly associated with different types of aneurysms (P&lt;0.05), i.e. very high metabolic activity and dorsal sparing of metabolic activity in PET/CT and wall thickening in CE-CT were indicative for IAA; fat stranding and fluid collections in CE-CT were associated with MAA; while low metabolic acitivity and absence of wall thickening in PET/CT, and less fat stranding and absence of wall thickening in CE-CT were indicative for non-infected, non-inflammatory AAA. Conclusion Specific imaging characteristics of PET/CT and CE-CT may be helpful in differentiating between MAA, IAA, and non-infected, non-inflammatory AAA."
https://openalex.org/W4290779988,"Among the projected effects of climate change, water resources are at the center of the matrix. Certainly, the southern African climate is changing, consequently, localized studies are needed to determine the magnitude of anticipated changes for effective adaptation. Utilizing historical observation data over the Olifants River Catchment, we examined trends in temperature and rainfall for the period 1976–2019. In addition, future climate change projections under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for two time periods of 2036–2065 (near future) and 2066–2095 (far future) were analysed using an ensemble of eight regional climate model (RCA4) simulations of the CORDEX Africa initiative. A modified Mann-Kendall test was used to determine trends and the statistical significance of annual and seasonal rainfall and temperature. The characteristics of extreme dry conditions were assessed by computing the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The results suggest that the catchment has witnessed an increase in temperatures and an overall decline in rainfall, although no significant changes have been detected in the distribution of rainfall over time. Furthermore, the surface temperature is expected to rise significantly, continuing a trend already evident in historical developments. The results further indicate that the minimum temperatures over the Catchment are getting warmer than the maximum temperatures. Seasonally, the minimum temperature warms more frequently in the summer season from December to February (DJF) and the spring season from September to November (SON) than in the winter season from June to August (JJA) and in the autumn season from March to May (MAM). The results of the SPI affirm the persistent drought conditions over the Catchment.

https://openalex.org/W4296163306,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most fatal malignancies worldwide. Recently, our group identified purine-rich element binding protein alpha (PURα), a single-stranded DNA/RNA-binding protein, to be significantly associated with the progression of ESCC. Additional immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that PURα forms cytoplasmic stress granules to suppress mRNA translation initiation. The expression level of cytoplasmic PURα in ESCC tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent epithelia and correlated with a worse patient survival rate by immunohistochemistry. Functionally, PURα strongly preferred to bind to UG-/U-rich motifs and mRNA 3´UTR by CLIP-seq analysis. Moreover, PURα knockout significantly increased the protein level of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). In addition, it was further demonstrated that PURα-interacting proteins are remarkably associated with translation initiation factors and ribosome-related proteins and that PURα regulates protein expression by interacting with translation initiation factors, such as PABPC1, eIF3B and eIF3F, in an RNA-independent manner, while the interaction with ribosome-related proteins is significantly dependent on RNA. Specifically, PURα was shown to interact with the mRNA 3´UTR of IGFBP3 and inhibit its expression by suppressing mRNA translation initiation. Together, this study identifies cytoplasmic PURα as a modulator of IGFBP3, which could be a promising therapeutic target for ESCC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4290237383,"Despite recent advances in the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors (BRAFi) for BRAF-mutant melanomas, development of resistance remains a major clinical problem. In addition to genetic alterations associated with intrinsic resistance, several adaptive response mechanisms are known to be rapidly activated to allow cell survival in response to treatment, limiting efficacy. A better understanding of the mechanisms driving resistance is urgently needed to improve the success of BRAF-targeted therapies and to make therapeutic intervention more durable. In this study, we identify the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 as a novel mediator of the adaptive response of melanoma cells to BRAF-targeted therapy. Our findings demonstrate that BRAFi leads to an early increase in p38 activation, which promotes phosphorylation of the transcription factor SOX2 at Ser251, enhancing SOX2 stability, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity. Furthermore, functional studies show that SOX2 depletion increases sensitivity of melanoma cells to BRAFi, whereas overexpression of a phosphomimetic SOX2-S251E mutant is sufficient to drive resistance and desensitize melanoma cells to BRAFi in vitro and in a zebrafish xenograft model. We also found that SOX2 phosphorylation at Ser251 confers resistance to BRAFi by binding to the promoter and increasing transcriptional activation of the ATP-binding cassette drug efflux transporter ABCG2. In summary, we unveil a p38/SOX2-mediated mechanism of adaptive response to BRAFi, which provides prosurvival signals to melanoma cells against the cytotoxic effects of BRAFi prior to acquiring resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4290779426,"The complementary sex determiner (csd) gene is responsible for controlling the sex-determination molecular switch in western honey bees (Apis mellifera): bees that are heterozygous for csd develop into females, whereas bees that are hemizygous or homozygous develop into males. The homozygous diploid males are destroyed at an early stage of their development. It has been proposed that the minimal number of amino acid differences between two csd alleles needed to fully determine femaleness is five and it has also been shown that smaller differences may result in forming an evolutionary intermediate that is not fully capable of female determination, but has increased fitness compared to the homozygous genotype. In this study, we have implemented a terminal restriction length polymorphism-based method of identifying and distinguishing paternal alleles in a given bee colony and assigning them to a particular maternal allele in order to gather information on large number of functional csd pairs and also to identify, to some extent, genotypes that are underrepresented or absent in bee colonies. The main finding of this study is the identification of a fully functional genotype consisting of csd alleles that differed from each other by a one amino acid position. The individuals carrying this genotype expressed only female-specific transcripts of feminizer and double-sex genes. By comparing the sequences differences between the csd pair identified in our study with those described earlier, we conclude that functional heterozygosity of the csd gene is dependent not only on the number of the amino acid differences but also on the sequence context and position of the change. The discovery of a functional allele pair differing by a single amino acid also implies that the generation of a new csd specificity may also occur during a single mutation step with no need for evolutionary intermediates accumulating further mutations."
https://openalex.org/W4290779457,"This study aimed to determine the effect of amaranth leaf meal (ALM) inclusion levels on the productivity of Ross 308 broiler chickens. A total of 200, day-old, Ross 308 broiler chicks were randomly allocated to five dietary treatments in a complete randomized design, with each group having four replicates with ten chicks each. Amaranth leaf meal inclusion levels used in this study were 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20%. Bodyweight and feed intake were measured weekly to calculate the feed conversion ratio. Meat and bone traits of broiler chickens fed amaranth leaf meal at varying levels were also measured whereas the general linear model of statistical analysis software was used to analyze collected data. Amaranth leaf meal inclusion level had no effect (p &gt; 0.05) on initial weight, final weight, average daily gain, and average daily feed intake of Ross 308 broiler chickens aged one to 42 days. Ross 308 broiler chickens which were given diets with 0 and 10% ALM inclusion levels, had higher (p &lt; 0.05) cooking loss than those on diets with 5, 15, and 20% of ALM inclusion levels. Chickens fed with a diet having a 15% ALM inclusion level, had a greater (p &lt; 0.05) tibia diameter than those on 0, 5, 10, and 20% ALM inclusion levels. Ross 308 broiler chickens which were fed with 5 and 15% ALM inclusion levels, had larger (p &lt; 0.05) femur diameters than those on 0, 10, and 20% ALM inclusion levels. Ross 308 broiler chickens fed with diets having a 15% ALM inclusion level, had longer (p &lt; 0.05) tibia lengths than those fed with diets having 0, 5, and 10% ALM inclusion levels. It can be concluded that amaranth leaf meal can be included in the diets of Ross 308 broiler chickens aged one to 42 days at 5, 10, and 15% levels without adverse effects on productivity, meat quality, and the bone characteristics of the chickens. This augurs well for poultry farmers in many parts of Africa where the production of vegetable amaranth is in abundance."
https://openalex.org/W4290779518,"The use of phrases such as ""data/results not shown"" is deemed an obscure way to represent scientific findings. Our aim was to investigate how frequently papers published in dental journals use the phrases and what kind of results the authors referred to with these phrases in 2021.We searched the Europe PubMed Central (PMC) database for open-access articles available from studies published in PubMed-indexed dental journals until December 31st, 2021. We searched for ""data/results not shown"" phrases from the full texts and then calculated the proportion of articles with the phrases in all the available articles. From studies published in 2021, we evaluated whether the phrases referred to confirmatory results, negative results, peripheral results, sensitivity analysis results, future results, or other/unclear results. Journal- and publisher-related differences in publishing studies with the phrases in 2021 were tested with Fisher's exact test using the R v4.1.1 software.The percentage of studies with the relevant phrases from the total number of studies in the database decreased from 13% to 3% between 2010 and 2020. In 2021, out of 2,434 studies published in 73 different journals by eight publishers, 67 (2.8%) used the phrases. Potential journal- and publisher-related differences in publishing studies with the phrases were detected in 2021 (p = 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively). Most commonly, the phrases referred to negative (n = 16, 24%), peripheral (n = 22, 33%) or confirmatory (n = 11, 16%) results. The significance of unpublished results to which the phrases referred considerably varied across studies.Over the last decade, there has been a marked decrease in the use of the phrases ""data/results not shown"" in dental journals. However, the phrases were still notably in use in dental studies in 2021, despite the good availability of accessible free online supplements and repositories."
https://openalex.org/W4290779923,"Purpose We evaluated the prevalence of opioid prescriptions after injury and associated characteristics among workers receiving workers’ compensation for a lost work time injury. Methods Injured workers identified in Michigan’s Workers’ Compensation records from 2016 to 2018 were linked to the opioid prescription history in the Michigan Automated Prescription System. Results Among the 46,934 injured workers with paid claims, the prevalence of receiving an opioid prescription, morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per prescription, number of opioid prescription and probability of receiving opioids prescription&gt;90 days after injury decreased from 2016–2018. Despite the decrease over 50% of the injured workers received an opioid prescription. Being over 34 years, a male, having had an opioid prescription before the injury, working in construction or having an amputation or sprain/strain of the shoulder had a significantly higher probability of receiving an opioid prescription, a higher MME per prescription, a higher number of opioid prescriptions and a higher probability having opioids prescription &gt;90 days after the injury. Conclusions Even though opioid prescribing patterns generally decreased from 2016 to 2018 (64.5–52.8%), injured workers in Michigan had a higher prevalence of opioid prescription after injury, than those reported from other states."
https://openalex.org/W4290779933,"Tetracycline (TC) is widely-used antibiotic pollutant with high toxicity, refractory, persistence and bacteriostasis, and its removal from water needs to be enhanced. In this work, a novel Graphite-UiO-66(Zr)/Ti electrode was successfully prepared and evaluated for electrochemical oxidation degradation of TC. The electrochemical performance tests indicate the Graphite-UiO-66(Zr)/Ti electrode had higher electrochemical oxidation activity, which achieved higher TC removal efficiency (98.1% ± 1.5%) than Ti plate (65.2% ± 3.5%), Graphite-MIL-53(Al)/Ti electrode (79.5% ± 2.9%) and Graphite-MIL-100(Fe)/Ti electrode (89.0% ± 2.6%). The influence of operating condition was also systematically studied, and the optimized condition was pH 5.0, 20 mA/cm 2 current density and 0.1 M electrolyte (Na 2 SO 4 ). Through the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), the TC degradation pathway by Graphite-UiO-66(Zr)/Ti electrode oxidation was proposed. Under the •OH free radical oxidative decomposition effect, the double bond, phenolic group and amine group of TC were attacked. TC was transformed into intermediate product ① (m/z = 447), then was further degraded to intermediates ② (m/z = 401) and ③ (m/z = 417). The latter was fragmented into small fractions ④ (m/z = 194), ⑤but-2-enedioic acid (m/z = 116) and ⑥oxalic acid (m/z = 90, the proposed intermediate). In addition, TC removal remained at 89.6% ± 2.7% in the sixth cycle of operation, which confirmed the efficient reusability and stability for antibiotics removal from water."

https://openalex.org/W4291676681,"Stone artifacts are often the most abundant class of objects found in archaeological sites but their consistent identification is limited by the number of experienced analysts available. We report a machine learning based technology for stone artifact identification as part of a solution to the lack of such experts directed at distinguishing worked stone objects from naturally occurring lithic clasts. Three case study locations from Egypt, Australia, and New Zealand provide a data set of 6769 2D images, 3868 flaked artifact and 2901 rock images used to train and test a machine learning model based on an openly available PyTorch implementation of Faster R-CNN ResNet 50. Results indicate 100% agreement between the model and original human derived classifications, a better performance than the results achieved independently by two human analysts who reassessed the 2D images available to the machine learning model. Machine learning neural networks provide the potential to consistently assess the composition of large archaeological assemblages composed of objects modified in a variety of ways."
https://openalex.org/W4292513077,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths, and the most common primary liver malignancy to present in the clinic. With the exception of liver transplant, treatment options for advanced HCC are limited, but improved tumor stratification could open the door to new treatment options. Previously, we demonstrated that the circadian regulator Aryl Hydrocarbon-Like Receptor Like 1 (ARNTL, or Bmal1) and the liver-enriched nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) are robustly co-expressed in healthy liver but incompatible in the context of HCC. Faulty circadian expression of HNF4α– either by isoform switching, or loss of expression- results in an increased risk for HCC, while BMAL1 gain-of-function in HNF4α-positive HCC results in apoptosis and tumor regression. We hypothesize that the transcriptional programs of HNF4α and BMAL1 are antagonistic in liver disease and HCC. Here, we study this antagonism by generating a mouse model with inducible loss of hepatic HNF4α and BMAL1 expression. The results reveal that simultaneous loss of HNF4α and BMAL1 is protective against fatty liver and HCC in carcinogen-induced liver injury and in the “STAM” model of liver disease. Furthermore, our results suggest that targeting Bmal1 expression in the absence of HNF4α inhibits HCC growth and progression. Specifically, pharmacological suppression of Bmal1 in HNF4α-deficient, BMAL1-positive HCC with REV-ERB agonist SR9009 impairs tumor cell proliferation and migration in a REV-ERB-dependent manner, while having no effect on healthy hepatocytes. Collectively, our results suggest that stratification of HCC based on HNF4α and BMAL1 expression may provide a new perspective on HCC properties and potential targeted therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4290779491,"Previous studies of multiple languages have found processing differences between patient-first and agent-first word orders. However, the results are inconsistent as they do not identify a specific ERP component as a unique correlate of thematic role processing. Furthermore, these studies generally confound word order with frequency, as patient-first structures tend to be infrequent in the languages that have been investigated. There is evidence that frequency at the sentence level plays a significant role in language processing. To address this potential confounding variable, we will test a language where the non-canonical sentences are more frequent and are comparable to the canonical sentences, namely Standard Indonesian. In this language, there is evidence from acquisition, corpus, and clinical data indicates that the use of passive is frequent and salient. One instance of this difference can be demonstrated by the fact that it has been suggested that frequency may be the reason why Indonesian-speaking aphasic speakers do not have impairments in the comprehension of passives, whereas speakers of other languages with aphasia often do. In the present study, we will test 50 native speakers of Indonesian using 100 sentences (50 active and 50 passive sentences). If the neural correlates of thematic role processing are not observed in the critical region of the sentence (the prefix of the verb), this would suggest that the previous results were indeed influenced by frequency, but if we find that specific ERPs are connected to the hypothesized syntactic operations, this would further reinforce the existing evidence of the increased cognitive load required to process more syntactically complicated sentences."
https://openalex.org/W4290779523,"Dormant cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in addition to low metabolic activity and a high level of drug resistance, are characterized by 'non-culturability'-a specific reversible state of the inability of the cells to grow on solid media. The biochemical characterization of this physiological state of the pathogen is only superficial, pending clarification of the metabolic processes that may exist in such cells. In this study, applying LC-MS proteomic profiling, we report the analysis of proteins accumulated in dormant, 'non-culturable' M. tuberculosis cells in an in vitro model of self-acidification of mycobacteria in the post-stationary phase, simulating the in vivo persistence conditions-the raw data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD028849. This approach revealed the preservation of 1379 proteins in cells after 5 months of storage in dormancy; among them, 468 proteins were statistically different from those in the actively growing cells and bore a positive fold change (FC). Differential analysis revealed the proteins of the pH-dependent regulatory system PhoP and allowed the reconstruction of the reactions of central carbon/glycerol metabolism, as well as revealing the salvaged pathways of mycothiol and UMP biosynthesis, establishing the cohort of survival enzymes of dormancy. The annotated pathways mirror the adaptation of the mycobacterial metabolic machinery to life within lipid-rich macrophages: especially the involvement of the methyl citrate and glyoxylate pathways. Thus, the current in vitro model of M. tuberculosis self-acidification reflects the biochemical adaptation of these bacteria to persistence in vivo. Comparative analysis with published proteins displaying antigenic properties makes it possible to distinguish immunoreactive proteins among the proteins bearing a positive FC in dormancy, which may include specific antigens of latent tuberculosis. Additionally, the biotransformatory enzymes (oxidoreductases and hydrolases) capable of prodrug activation and stored up in the dormant state were annotated. These findings may potentially lead to the discovery of immunodiagnostic tests for early latent tuberculosis and trigger the discovery of efficient drugs/prodrugs with potency against non-replicating, dormant populations of mycobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4290779560,"Background Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) are electronic databases that track controlled substance prescriptions in a state. They are underused tools in preventing opioid abuse. Most PDMP education research measures changes in knowledge or confidence rather than behavior. Objective To evaluate the impact of online case-based training on healthcare provider use of the Maryland (USA) PDMP. Methods We used e-mail distribution lists to recruit providers to complete a brief educational module. Using a pre-training and post-training survey in the module, we measured self-reported PDMP use patterns and perceived PDMP value in specific clinical situations and compared pre- and post-training responses. Within the module, we presented three fictional pain cases and asked participants how they would manage each, both before, and then after presenting prescription drug history simulating a PDMP report. We measured changes in the fictional case treatment plans before and after seeing prescription history. Finally, we measured and compared how often each participant accessed the Maryland PDMP database before and after completing the educational module. We used multivariate logistic regression to measure the effect of the intervention on actual PDMP use frequency. Results One hundred and fifty participants enrolled and completed the training module, and we successfully retrieved real-world PDMP use data of 137 of them. Participants’ decisions to prescribe opioids changed significantly after reviewing PDMP data in each of the fictional cases provided in the module. In the months following the training, the rate of PDMP use increased by a median of four use-cases per month among providers in practice for less than 20 years ( p = 0.039) and two use-cases per month among infrequent opioid prescribers ( p = 0.014). Conclusion A brief online case-based educational intervention was associated with a significant increase in the rate of PDMP use among infrequent opioid prescribers and those in practice less than 20 years."
https://openalex.org/W4290779613,"Early adolescents frequently use mobile messaging apps to communicate with peers. The popularity of such messaging apps has a critical drawback because it increases conformity to cyber aggression. Cyber aggression includes aggressive peer behaviors such as nasty comments, nonconsensual image sharing, and social exclusion, to which adolescents subsequently conform. Recent empirical research points to peer group norms and reduced accountability as two essential determinants of conformity to cyber aggression. Therefore, the current study aimed to counteract these two determinants in a 2 (peer group norms counteracted: yes, no) x 2 (reduced accountability counteracted: yes, no) design. We created four intervention conditions that addressed adolescents’ deficits in information, motivation, and behavioral skills. Depending on the condition (peer group norms, reduced accountability, combination, or control), we first informed participants about the influence of the relevant determinant (e.g., peer group norms). Subsequently, participants performed a self-persuasion task and formulated implementation-intentions to increase their motivation and behavioral skills not to conform to cyber aggression. Effectiveness was tested with a messaging app paradigm and self-report among a sample of 377 adolescents ( M age = 12.99, SD age = 0.84; 53.6% boys). Factorial ANCOVAs revealed that none of the intervention conditions reduced conformity to cyber aggression. Moreover, individual differences in susceptibility to peer pressure or inhibitory control among adolescents did not moderate the expected relations. Therefore, there is no evidence that our intervention effectively reduces conformity to cyber aggression. The findings from this first intervention effort point to the complex relationship between theory and practice. Our findings warrant future research to develop potential intervention tools that could effectively reduce conformity to cyber aggression."

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in FOXP2 have been linked to speech- language disorder, autism, cancer and schizophrenia. So, scrutinizing the functional SNPs to better understand their association in disease is an uphill task. The purpose of the current study was to identify the missense SNPs which have detrimental structural and functional effects on the FOXP2 protein. Multiple computational tools were employed to investigate the deleterious role of non-synonymous SNPs. Five variants as Y531H, L558P, R536G and R553C were found to be associated with diseases and located at the forkhead domain of the FOXP2 protein. Molecular docking analysis of FOXP2 DNA binding domain with its most common target sequence 5’-CAAATT-3’ predicted that R553C and L558P mutant variants destabilize protein structure by changing protein-DNA interface interactions and disruption of hydrogen bonds that may reduce the specificity and affinity of the binding. Further experimental investigations may need to verify whether this kind of structural and functional variations dysregulate protein activities and induce formation of disease."
https://openalex.org/W4290779626,"Background Whether abstinence from smoking among cancer patients reduces cancer pain is still unclear. Opioids can act as a surrogate index for evaluating the incidence of severe cancer pain in countries where opioid abuse is infrequent. This study aimed to investigate whether changed smoking behavior after cancer diagnosis influences the incidence of severe cancer pain as determined by strong opioid use. Methods Using a large Japanese insurance claims database (n = 4,797,329), we selected 794,702 insured employees whose annual health checkup data could be confirmed ≥6 times between January 2009 and December 2018. We selected 591 study subjects from 3,256 employees who were diagnosed with cancer pain and had health checkup data at the year of cancer pain diagnosis. Results A significantly greater proportion of patients who continued smoking after cancer diagnosis (“current smoker”, n = 133) received strong opioids (36.8%) compared with patients who had never smoked or had stopped before cancer diagnosis (“non-smoker”, n = 383, 20.6%; p&lt;0.05) but also compared with patients who had quit smoking after cancer diagnosis (“abstainer:”, n = 75, 24.0%; p&lt;0.05). In multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, abstainers had a significantly lower risk of receiving strong opioids than current smokers (hazard ratio: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.328 to 0.997). These findings were consistent across multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that patients who quit smoking after cancer diagnosis have a lower risk of severe cancer pain. This information adds clinical incentives for improving quality of life among those who smoked at the time of cancer diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4290779715,"Aim To evaluate the association between outpatient’s perceived psychosocial impact of dental aesthetics and experiencing discrimination at a Peruvian public hospital. Material and methods Cross-sectional study in a Peruvian public hospital, where 207 outpatients (18–30 years old) were surveyed. We asked participants about self-reported experiences of discrimination in the last six months at a Peruvian public hospital using a question from the Peruvian National Household Survey on Living Conditions and Poverty (ENAHO) 2017. We also measured the perceived psychosocial impact of dental aesthetics with the Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire (PIDAQ). Additionally, we evaluated age, sex, ethnicity, education, income, and reason for being discriminated against. Association was assessed with Poisson regression using a robust estimator of variance and reporting prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals in crude and adjusted models. Results About two out of every five participants having experienced discrimination at a Peruvian public hospital in the last six months. On our adjusted estimates, we found discrimination to be positively associated with two components of the psychosocial impact of dental aesthetics, which were social impact (PR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.04) and the psychological impact (PR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04–1.10). Conversely, dental self-confidence (PR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93–0.98) was negatively associated with discrimination. Conclusions The perceived psychosocial impact of dental aesthetics is associated with experiencing discrimination among outpatients from a Peruvian public hospital. We advocate for structural changes to address discrimination in healthcare spaces by corresponding governmental authorities."
https://openalex.org/W4290779719,"Identifying biological processes that structure natural communities has long interested ecologists. Community structure may be determined by various processes, including differential responses of species to environmental characteristics, regional-level spatial influences such as dispersal, or stochasticity generated from ecological drift. Few studies have used the metacommunity paradigm (interacting communities linked by dispersal) to investigate avian community composition along an urban gradient, yet such a theoretical construct may provide insights into species turnover even in unnatural settings such as rural to urban gradients. We measured the influence of spatial and environmental characteristics on two aspects of avian community structure across a gradient of urbanization: 1) taxonomic composition and 2) functional richness based on diet, foraging strategies, nesting locations and morphology. We also measured the relationship between species traits and environmental variables with an RLQ-fourth corner analysis. Together, environmental and spatial processes were significantly related to taxonomic structure and functional richness, but spatial variables accounted for more variation than environmental variables. Fine spatial scales were positively correlated with insectivorous birds and negatively correlated with body and wing size. Urbanization was positively correlated with birds that forage at the canopy level, while emergent wetlands were negatively correlated with birds that nested in cliffs and frugivorous birds. Functional richness and urbanization were significantly related to fine spatial variables. Spatial and environmental factors played an important role in taxonomic and functional structure in avian metacommunity structure. This study highlights the importance of studying multiple aspects of biodiversity, such as taxonomic and functional dimensions, especially when examining effects of complementary spatial and environmental processes."
https://openalex.org/W4290779985,"Annual monitoring of the spatial distribution of cultivated land is important for maintaining the ecological environment, achieving a status quo of land resource management, and guaranteeing agricultural production. With the gradual development of remote sensing technology, it has become a common practice to obtain cultivated land boundary information on a large scale with the help of satellite Earth observation images. Traditional land use classification methods are affected by multiple types of land cover, which leads to a decrease in the accuracy of cultivated land mapping. In contrast, although the current advanced methods (such as deep learning) can obtain more accurate cultivated land mapping results than traditional methods, such methods often require the use of a massive amount of training samples, large computing power, and highly complex model tuning processes, increasing the cost of mapping and requiring the involvement of more professionals. This has hindered the promotion of related methods in mapping institutions. This paper proposes a method based on time series vector features (MTVF), which uses vector thinking to establish the features. The advantage of this method is that the introduction of vector features enlarges the differences between the different land cover types, which overcomes the loss of mapping accuracy caused by the influences of the spectra of different ground objects and ensures the calculation efficiency. Moreover, the MTVF uses a traditional method (random forest) as the classification core, which makes the MTVF less demanding than advanced methods in terms of the number of training samples. Sentinel-2 satellite images were used to carry out cultivated land mapping for 2020 in northern Henan Province, China. The results show that the MTVF has the potential to accurately identify cultivated land. Furthermore, the overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy of the overall study area and four sub-study areas were all greater than 90%. In addition, the cultivated land mapping accuracy of the MTVF is significantly better than that of the maximum likelihood, support vector machine, and artificial neural network methods."
