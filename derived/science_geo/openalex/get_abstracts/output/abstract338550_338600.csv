https://openalex.org/W2050222000,"A negative isotropic magnetoresistance effect more than three orders of magnitude larger than the typical giant magnetoresistance of some superlattice films has been observed in thin oxide films of perovskite-like La(0.67)Ca(0.33)MnOx. Epitaxial films that are grown on LaAIO(3) substrates by laser ablation and suitably heat treated exhibit magnetoresistance values as high as 127,000 percent near 77 kelvin and approximately 1300 percent near room temperature. Such a phenomenon could be useful for various magnetic and electric device applications if the observed effects of material processing are optimized. Possible mechanisms for the observed effect are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2049670427,"Three published estimates of the frequency of polyploidy in angiosperms (30 to 35 percent, 47 percent, and 70 to 80 percent) were tested by estimating the genome size of extinct woody angiosperms with the use of fossil guard cell size as a proxy for cellular DNA content. The inferred chromosome numbers of these extinct species suggest that seven to nine is the primitive haploid chromosome number of angiosperms and that most angiosperms (approximately 70 percent) have polyploidy in their history."
https://openalex.org/W2035675406,"Experiments on melting and phase transformations on iron in a laser-heated, diamond-anvil cell to a pressure of 150 gigapascals (approximately 1.5 million atmospheres) show that iron melts at the central core pressure of 363.85 gigapascals at 6350 ± 350 kelvin. The central core temperature corresponding to the upper temperature of iron melting is 6150 kelvin. The pressure dependence of iron melting temperature is such that a simple model can be used to explain the inner solid core and the outer liquid core. The inner core is nearly isothermal (6150 kelvin at the center to 6130 kelvin at the inner core-outer core boundary), is made of hexagonal closest-packed iron, and is about 1 percent solid (MgSiO3 + MgO). By the inclusion of less than 2 percent of solid impurities with iron, the outer core densities along a thermal gradient (6130 kelvin at the base of the outer core and 4000 kelvin at the top) can be matched with the average seismic densities of the core."
https://openalex.org/W2055905229,"High-resolution numerical simulations were made of unforced, planetary-scale fluid dynamics. In particular, the simulation was based on the quasi-geostrophic equations for a Boussinesq fluid in a uniformly rotating and stably stratified environment, which is an idealization for large regions of either the atmosphere or ocean. The solutions show significant discrepancies from the long-standing theoretical prediction of isotropy. The discrepancies are associated with the self-organization of the flow into a large population of coherent vortices. Their chaotic interactions govern the subsequent evolution of the flow toward a final configuration that is nonturbulent."

These ""simplest hydrocarbon derivatives of C(70)"" are formed by hydroboration of C(70) at room temperature. Analysis of the platinum-catalyzed equilibration of these isomers yielded a relative free energy at 295 kelvin of 1.4 +/- 0.2 kilocalories per mole, with the 1,9 isomer being more stable. This value is in excellent agreement with the ab initio HF/6-31 G(*) calculated energy difference of 1.3 kilocalories per mole, whereas semiempirical calculations gave poor agreement."

https://openalex.org/W2033956573,"During June to September 1992, a special campaign was held to measure rapid changes in Earth's rotation rate and to relate these measurements to variations in the atmosphere's angular momentum, due principally to changes in zonal winds. A strong rise in both length of day and atmospheric momentum during a particular 6-day subperiod is documented, and this example of a short-period perturbation is identified with a specific regional coupling mechanism. Mountain torques within the southern tropics appear to account for most of the rapid momentum transfer between the solid Earth and atmosphere, with those across South America especially important."
https://openalex.org/W2040261967,"Magnetization and neutron diffraction measurements on polycrystalline BaCuO2+x revealed a combination of magnetic behaviors. The Cu(6) ring clusters and Cu(18) sphere clusters in this compound had ferromagnetic ground states with large spins 3 and 9, respectively. The Cu(6) rings ordered antiferromagnetically below the Néel temperature T(N) = 15 +/- 0.5 kelvin, whereas the Cu(18) spheres remained paramagnetic down to 2 kelvin. The ordered moment below T(N) was 0.89(5) Bohr magnetons per Cu in the Cu(6) rings, demonstrating that quantum fluctuation effects are small in these atomic clusters. The Cu(18) clusters are predicted to exhibit ferromagnetic intercluster order below about 1 kelvin."

Last month's meeting was organized by the Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers, and included a status report on liquid mirror telescopes, discussion of a space observatory that may make optical and x-ray astronomers best friends, and a modest proposal to cover the globe with a network of small, automated telescopes."
