https://openalex.org/W4303449148,"This study was carried out to produce low-emitting biomass pellets biofuel from selected forest trees such as (Cedrus deodara and Pinus wallichiana) and agricultural crop residues such as (Zea mays and Triticum aestivum) in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan using indigenously developed technology called pelletizer machine. Characterization, environmental life cycle impact assessment, and cumulative energy demand of biomass pellets biofuel produced from selected agriculture crops and forest tree residues were conducted. The primary data for biomass pellets production was collected by visiting various wood processing factories, sawmills, and agricultural crop fields in the study area. Biomass pellets are a type of biofuel that is often made by compressing sawdust and crushing biomass material into a powdery form. The particles are agglomerated as the raw material is extensively compressed and pelletized. Biomass pellets have lower moisture content, often less than 12%. Physically, the produced pellets were characterized to determine moisture content, pellet dimensions, bulk density, higher heating value, ash content, lower heating value, and element analysis. A functional unit of one kilogram (kg) biomass pellets production was followed in this study.The life cycle impact assessment of one kg biomass pellets biofuel produced from selected agro-forest species revealed environmental impact categories such as acidification (0.006 kg SO2 eq/kg pellets), abiotic depletion (0.018 kg Sb eq/kg pellets), marine aquatic ecotoxicity (417.803 kg 1,4-DB eq/kg pellets), human toxicity (1.107 kg 1,4-DB eq/kg pellets), freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity (0.191 kg 1,4-DB eq/kg pellets), eutrophication (0.001 kg PO4 eq/kg pellets), global warming (0.802 kg CO2 eq/kg pellets), and terrestrial ecotoxicity (0.008 kg 1,4-DB eq/kg pellets). Fossil fuel consumption was the hotspot source to all environmental impacts investigated. To measure the cumulative energy demand of biomass pellets made from different agroforestry species leftovers showed that the maximum cumulative energy was from wheat straw pellets (13.737 MJ), followed by corncob pellets (11.754 MJ), deodar sawdust pellets (10.905 MJ) and blue pine sawdust pellets (10.877 MJ). Among the various production activities, collection and transportation of primary raw material, crushing, screening, adding adhesives, pelletizing, cooling, final screening, and packing have the maximum contribution to the water scarcity index, followed by lubricating oil (0.00147m3). In contrast, the minimum contribution to water footprint was from electricity (0.00008m3) and wheat starch (0.00005m3). The highest contribution to the ecological footprint impact categories such as carbon dioxide, nuclear, and land occupation was lubricating oil and less contribution of wheat starch and electricity for manufacturing one kg pellets biofuel. It is concluded that physico-mechanical and combustion properties of the biomass pellets biofuel developed in the present study were following the Italian recommended standards. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that the Government of Pakistan should introduce the renewable biomass pellets industry in the country to reduce dependency on fossil fuels for cooking and heating purposes."
https://openalex.org/W4303449722,"Mathematical models have become very influential, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data and code sharing are indispensable for reproducing them, protocol registration may be useful sometimes, and declarations of conflicts of interest (COIs) and of funding are quintessential for transparency. Here, we evaluated these features in publications of infectious disease-related models and assessed whether there were differences before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and for COVID-19 models versus models for other diseases. We analysed all PubMed Central open access publications of infectious disease models published in 2019 and 2021 using previously validated text mining algorithms of transparency indicators. We evaluated 1338 articles: 216 from 2019 and 1122 from 2021 (of which 818 were on COVID-19); almost a six-fold increase in publications within the field. 511 (39.2%) were compartmental models, 337 (25.2%) were time series, 279 (20.9%) were spatiotemporal, 186 (13.9%) were agent-based and 25 (1.9%) contained multiple model types. 288 (21.5%) articles shared code, 332 (24.8%) shared data, 6 (0.4%) were registered, and 1197 (89.5%) and 1109 (82.9%) contained COI and funding statements, respectively. There was no major changes in transparency indicators between 2019 and 2021. COVID-19 articles were less likely to have funding statements and more likely to share code. Further validation was performed by manual assessment of 10% of the articles identified by text mining as fulfilling transparency indicators and of 10% of the articles lacking them. Correcting estimates for validation performance, 26.0% of papers shared code and 41.1% shared data. On manual assessment, 5/6 articles identified as registered had indeed been registered. Of articles containing COI and funding statements, 95.8% disclosed no conflict and 11.7% reported no funding. Transparency in infectious disease modelling is relatively low, especially for data and code sharing. This is concerning, considering the nature of this research and the heightened influence it has acquired."
https://openalex.org/W4303453589,"Inter-individual differences in maturation-associated development can lead to variations in physical performance, resulting in performance (dis)advantages and maturation selection bias within youth sport systems. To address such bias and account for maturational differences, Maturation-based Corrective Adjustment Procedures (Mat-CAPs) could be beneficial. The present study aimed to: (1) determine maturity timing distributions in youth female swimming; (2) quantify the relationship between maturation status and 100-m front-crawl (FC) performance; (3) implement Mat-CAPs to remove maturational influences upon swimming performance. For Aim 1 and 2, participants were 663 female (10–15 years) swimmers who participated in 100-m FC events at Australian regional, state, and national-level competitions between 2016–2020 and underwent anthropometric assessment (mass, height and sitting height) to estimate maturity timing and offset. For Aim 3, participants aged 10–13 years were categorised into maturity timing categories. Maturity timing distributions for Raw (‘All’, ‘Top 50%’ and ‘Top 25%’) and Correctively Adjusted swim times were examined. Chi-square, Cramer’s V and Odds Ratios determined the presence of maturation biases, while Mat-CAPs identified whether such biases were removed in targeted age and selection-groups. Results identified that between 10–13 years, a significantly higher frequency of ‘early’ maturers was apparent, although tapered toward higher frequencies of ‘Late-normative’ maturers by 14–15 years. A curvilinear relationship between maturity-offset and swim performance was identified ( R 2 = 0.51, p&lt;0.001) and utilised for Mat-CAPs. Following Mat-CAPs application, maturity timing biases evident in affected age-groups (10–13 years), and which were magnified at higher selection levels (‘Top 50%’ &amp; ‘25%’ of swim performances) were predominantly removed. Findings highlight how maturation advantages in females occurred until approximately 13 years old, warranting restricted Mat-CAPs application. Mat-CAPS has the potential to improve female swimmer participation experiences and evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4303449480,"To investigate if cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) measures can be used to verify the cochlear implant (CI) map and consequently improve CI outcomes in adults with bilateral hearing loss.CAEPs were measured in CI recipients using the speech tokens /m/, /g/, /t/ and /s/. If CAEP responses were present for all speech tokens, the participant's map was considered ""satisfactory"". If CAEP responses were absent, the CI map was considered ""unsatisfactory"" and therefore adjusted and CAEP measures repeated. This was repeated until auditory potentials were seen in response to all four speech tokens. Speech testing was conducted pre-CI, as well as before and after CAEP-guided map adjustments.108 adult unilateral CI users participated, whose sound processors were previously programmed using subjective methods. 42 CI users elicited a CAEP response to all four speech tokens and therefore no further mapping adjustments were made. 66 subjected lacked a CAEP response to at least one speech token and had their CI map adjusted accordingly. Of those, 31 showed a CAEP response to all four speech tokens, and the average speech score significantly improved after CI map adjustments based on CAEP responses.CAEP's are an objective tool that can be used to guide and verify CI mapping in adults CI users. Significant improvement in speech scores was observed in participants who had their CI map adjusted based on CAEP responses."
https://openalex.org/W4303509356,"We introduce a database (IDEST) of 250 short stories rated for valence, arousal, and comprehensibility in two languages. The texts, with a narrative structure telling a story in the first person and controlled for length, were originally written in six different languages (Finnish, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Turkish), and rated for arousal, valence, and comprehensibility in the original language. The stories were translated into English, and the same ratings for the English translations were collected via an internet survey tool (N = 573). In addition to the rating data, we also report readability indexes for the original and English texts. The texts have been categorized into different story types based on their emotional arc. The texts score high on comprehensibility and represent a wide range of emotional valence and arousal levels. The comparative analysis of the ratings of the original texts and English translations showed that valence ratings were very similar across languages, whereas correlations between the two pairs of language versions for arousal and comprehensibility were modest. Comprehensibility ratings correlated with only some of the readability indexes. The database is published in osf.io/9tga3, and it is freely available for academic research."
https://openalex.org/W4303449126,"This study examined forest structure, composition, and regeneration patterns of two sites, Tolma-Lata-Raini (TLR) and Bhyundar-Ghangaria (BG). Both sites are located within the temperate zone along the altitudinal gradient between 2,800 to 3,400 m asl of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) in the Western Himalayan Region of India. We recorded a total of 223 species of vascular plants (Angiosperm, Gymnosperm, and Pteridophytes) within the study area. Of the recorded species, plants within the family Rosaceae were dominant (17.69%), followed by Asteraceae (14.97%) and Ranunculaceae (12.93%). Betula utilis had the highest tree density (724 and 324 individuals ha-1) and species cover (44% and 36%) at both TLR and BG sites, followed by Pinus wallichiana (24%) and Cedrus deodara (15%), respectively. In BG site, 56% of tree species showed fair regeneration (i.e., seedling density > sapling density ≤ adult density), 22% good (i.e., seedling density > sapling density > adult tree density), 11% exhibited poor (i.e., species survived only in the sapling stage but not in the seedling stage), and the remaining (11%) indicated no regeneration. Comparatively, at TLR site, 40% of the tree species showed fair regeneration, 40% good, and the remaining 20% showed no regeneration. Across the two sites, species richness and diversity significantly decreased as the altitudinal gradient increased. Vegetation structure and soil properties also revealed differences between the southern and northern aspects. The baseline information generated in this study is helpful in designing effective conservation and management measures for these ecologically sensitive and important ecosystems. To effectively monitor changes in vegetation structure, species composition, and regeneration, we suggest that permanent vegetation plots with meteorological stations be established across the region for long-term monitoring of forest dynamics in response to the changing climate and anthropogenic pressures."
https://openalex.org/W4303449319,"Objectives Here we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to understand strain diversity and potential for patient-to-patient transmission of Staphylococcus aureus among children with cystic fibrosis (CF) in Queensland, Australia. Methods S . aureus isolates (n = 401) collected between January 2018 and April 2019 from 184 patients with CF (n = 318 isolates) and 76 patients without CF (n = 83 isolates) were subjected to WGS and subsequent multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and a phylogeny was constructed from core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. The subsequent data was compared with available patient information. Results WGS revealed that patients with CF were essentially colonised by the same genotypes as those seen in patients without CF. Sequence types (ST) for our patients with CF were predominantly ST5 (20.1%), ST30 (7.3%), ST15 (6.3%) and ST8 (5.3%). Two Australian clones, ST93 and ST239, typically seen in skin infections and health-care settings, respectively, were notably absent from our patients with CF. Based on a SNP distance threshold of 14 SNPs, 20 cluster types involving 50/260 patients were evident; of these, 6 clusters contained only patients found to be siblings or otherwise living in the same household. Epidemiological relationships could not be determined for a remaining 14 cluster types involving 38 patients, comprising 2–7 (median 2) patients each. Multiple S . aureus genotypes were observed in 19/73 CF patients who provided more than one sample. Conclusion These results show that WGS is a useful tool for surveillance of S . aureus strains in children with CF and that the strains in our CF cohort were largely consistent with those circulating in patients without CF. Overall, this confirms previous findings and indicates that S . aureus acquisition in children with CF is similar to that of other patient groups, with limited evidence of potential patient-to-patient transmission within this patient group."
https://openalex.org/W4303449421,"Protocols allowing the in vitro culture of human hair follicles in a serum free-medium up to 9 days were developed 30 years ago. By using similar protocols, we achieved the prolonged maintenance in vitro of juvenile feather follicles (FF) microdissected from young chickens. Histology showed a preservation of the FF up to 7 days as well as feather morphology compatible with growth and/or differentiation. The integrity of the FF wall epithelium was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy at Day 5 and 7 of culture. A slight elongation of the feathers was detected up to 5 days for 75% of the examined feathers. By immunochemistry, we demonstrated the maintenance of expression and localization of two structural proteins: scaffoldin and fibronectin. Gene expression (assessed by qRT-PCR) of NCAM, LCAM, Wnt6, Notch1, and BMP4 was not altered. In contrast, Shh and HBS1 expression collapsed, DKK3 increased, and KRT14 transiently increased upon cultivation. This indicates that cultivation modifies the mRNA expression of a few genes, possibly due to reduced growth or cell differentiation in the feather, notably in the barb ridges. In conclusion, we have developed the first method that allows the culture and maintenance of chicken FF in vitro that preserves the structure and biology of the FF close to its in vivo state, despite transcriptional modifications of a few genes involved in feather development. This new culture model may serve to study feather interactions with pathogens or toxics and constitutes a way to reduce animal experimentation."
https://openalex.org/W4303453441,"Visual and cognitive dysfunction are common in Parkinson's disease and relate to balance and gait impairment, as well as increased falls risk and reduced quality of life. Vision and cognition are interrelated (termed visuo-cognition) which makes intervention complex in people with Parkinson's (PwP). Non-pharmacological interventions for visuo-cognitive deficits are possible with modern technology, such as combined mobile applications and stroboscopic glasses, but evidence for their effectiveness in PwP is lacking. We aim to investigate whether technological visuo-cognitive training (TVT) can improve visuo-cognitive function in PwP. We will use a parallel group randomised controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of TVT versus standard care in PwP. Forty PwP who meet our inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of two visuo-cognitive training interventions. Both interventions will be carried out by a qualified physiotherapist in participants own homes (1-hour sessions, twice a week, for 4 weeks). Outcome measures will be assessed on anti-parkinsonian medication at baseline and at the end of the 4-week intervention. Feasibility of the TVT intervention will be assessed in relation to safety and acceptability of the technological intervention, compliance and adherence to the intervention and usability of equipment in participants homes. Additionally, semi structured interviews will be conducted to explore participants' experience of the technology. Exploratory efficacy outcomes will include change in visual attention measured using the Trail Making Test as well as changes in balance, gait, quality of life, fear of falling and levels of activity. This pilot study will focus on the feasibility and acceptability of TVT in PwP and provide preliminary data to support the design of a larger, multi-centre randomised controlled trial. This trial is registered at isrctn.com (ISRCTN46164906)."
https://openalex.org/W4303453474,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) have provided vital services during the COVID-19 pandemic, but existing research consists of quantitative surveys (lacking in depth or context) or qualitative interviews (with limited generalisability). Structural Topic Modelling (STM) of large-scale free-text survey data offers a way of capturing the perspectives of a wide range of HCWs in their own words about their experiences of the pandemic.In an online survey distributed to all staff at 18 geographically dispersed NHS Trusts, we asked respondents, ""Is there anything else you think we should know about your experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic?"". We used STM on 7,412 responses to identify topics, and thematic analysis on the resultant topics and text excerpts.We identified 33 topics, grouped into two domains, each containing four themes. Our findings emphasise: the deleterious effect of increased workloads, lack of PPE, inconsistent advice/guidance, and lack of autonomy; differing experiences of home working as negative/positive; and the benefits of supportive leadership and peers in ameliorating challenges. Themes varied by demographics and time: discussion of home working decreasing over time, while discussion of workplace challenges increased. Discussion of mental health was lowest between September-November 2020, between the first and second waves of COVID-19 in the UK.Our findings represent the most salient experiences of HCWs through the pandemic. STM enabled statistical examination of how the qualitative themes raised differed according to participant characteristics. This relatively underutilised methodology in healthcare research can provide more nuanced, yet generalisable, evidence than that available via surveys or small interview studies, and should be used in future research."
https://openalex.org/W4303453807,"Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. We aimed to investigate, for the first time, the expression profile of serum level of LncRNA THRIL and MiR-125b in IBD patients and their relations with patient’s clinical and biochemical investigations. Methods Our study included 210 subjects divided into 70 healthy subjects considered as control group (male and female), 70 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 70 patients with Crohn’s disease (CD). Blood samples were obtained from all subjects. Expression of LncRNA THRIL and MiR-125b in serum was detected by Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Results Our results showed a significant increase in the fold change of LncRNA THRIL in UC patients (Median = 11.11, IQR; 10.21–12.45, P&lt;0.001) and CD patients (Median = 5.87, IQR; 4.57–7.88, P&lt;0.001) compared to controls. Meanwhile there was a significant decrease in the fold change of MiR-125b in UC patients (Median = 0.36, IQR; 0.19–0.61, P&lt;0.001) and CD patients (Median = 0.69, IQR; 0.3–0.83, P&lt;0.001) compared to controls. Furthermore, there was a negative significant correlation between LncRNA THRIL and MiR-125b in UC patients (r = -0.28, P = 0.016) and in CD patients (r = -0.772, P&lt;0.001). ROC curve analysis was done showing the diagnostic value of these markers as predictors in differentiating between cases of UC, CD, and control. Conclusion Serum LncRNA THRIL and MiR-125b could be used as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W4303453823,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with multiple motor and non-motor characteristics. PD patients commonly face vocal impairments during the early stages of the disease. In this article, the aim is to explain the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) as a measure of the progression of Parkinson's disease using a set of covariates obtained from voice signals. In particular, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model based on a combination of kernel functions is introduced. Theoretically, this proposal, that relies on a mixed kernel (global and local) produces an admissible kernel function. The optimal fitting was obtained for the combination given by the product of radial and polynomial basis. Important results are the non-linear relationships inferred from the features to the response, as well as a considerable improvement in prediction performance metrics, when compared to other learning approaches. Furthermore, with knowledge on factors such as age and gender, it is possible to describe the dynamics of patients' UPDRS from the data collected during their monitoring. In summary, these advances could expand learning processes and intelligent systems to assist in monitoring the evolution of Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W4303453947,"Slaughterhouse or meat factory surveillance to detect factory lesions (FL) at slaughter is an important part of the bovine tuberculosis (bTB) eradication program in Ireland. The objective of this study was to quantify the effectiveness of Irish slaughterhouses or factories in submitting FL and the proportion of those submitted FL confirmed as being due to bTB in slaughtered cattle, and to identify and quantify the association of risk factors at animal, herd, and factory level with FL submission and confirmation. The data consisted of 6,611,854 animals slaughtered in Irish factories from 2014 to 2018 obtained from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine (DAFM), Ireland. Selected risk factors for this study included factory, year and month of slaughter, age, sex, breed, animal movement, ever inconclusive in the standard or severe skin test, herd type, herd size, and bTB history. The association of each risk factor on the FL submission and confirmation risk were analysed with univariable followed by a multivariable logistic regression with herd as random effect. Factories were ranked and compared based on the odds ratio (OR) obtained from the univariable (crude OR) and multivariable (adjusted OR) analysis. The average submission risk of all factories was 20 per 10,000 animals slaughtered, ranging from 1 to 42 per 10,000 animals slaughtered, and the average confirmation risk over all factories was 40.72%, ranging from 0.00 to 61.84%. The odds of submitting and confirming FL as bTB positive were higher in animals over eight years old compared to animals 1-2 years old (OR = 1.91, 95 CI 95% 1.77-2.06 and OR = 4.05, 95% CI 3.17-5.18, respectively), and were higher in animals that ever had inconclusive skin result based on severe interpretation (OR = 2.83, 95% CI 2.44-3.27 and OR = 4.48, 95% CI 2.66-7.54, respectively), animals originating from sucklers herds (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14 and OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55, respectively), or herds with bTB history in the past three years (OR = 4.46, 95% CI 4.28-4.66 and OR = 319.90, 95% CI 237.98-430.04, respectively). The odds of FL submission and confirmation decreased as the herd size increased (OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.96 and OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.78-0.86, respectively). An inverse relationship of FL submission and confirmation was present for variable sex and inconclusive skin result with standard interpretation, where submission odds were higher in males (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.10) and ever inconclusive animals (OR = 74.24, 95% CI 69.39-79.43), although the confirmation odds were lower (males OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.56-0.76; ever inconclusive OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.36-0.54). The crude and adjusted ranking of factories did not differ greatly for FL submission, indicating that factory-related factors may contribute significantly to the submission variation between factories. However, a substantial difference between crude and adjusted confirmation ranking was present which may indicate that animal and herd-related factors were associated to variation in confirmation risk between factories."

Despite being widely used in Arabic-speaking research contexts, it has never been validated in Arabic language. The aim of this study was to translate and validate the MGL tool into Arabic. A standard forward-backward process was used to translate the questionnaire. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was measured to assess internal consistency of the scale. The test-retest reliability measured the consistency of participants' responses over time. Construct validity was evaluated by Explanatory factor analysis (EFA); Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin value and Bartlett's test of sphericity were determined. Convergent validity was assessed using a preexisting medications Arabic Adherence Assessment Tool (AAAT). The model fit was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Associations between the MGL scale scores and the patient demographic/clinical characteristics were tested by linear regressions. A total of 201 participants were included into the study. The MGL scale categorization revealed that 20.9%, 59.2% and 19.9% of the participants had high, moderate and low levels of adherence respectively. Adequate internal consistency (alpha = 0.593) was observed. A significant strong ICC and Pearson's correlations were generated between responses at time 1 and time 2. EFA results elucidated the suitability of the data for factor analysis. Pearson's coefficient (r) revealed a significant strong correlation between MGL scale and AAAT. CFA results confirmed a good fit for the suggested model. Linear regression revealed higher number of medications, more frequent outpatient clinic visits and not experiencing medication adverse effect factors significantly associated with better adherence. The Arabic version of MLG scale is a reliable valid tool to assess adherence among Arabic-speaking communities. Implementing interventions targeting patients not compliant to regular clinic visits and those at higher risk of experiencing medication side effects can greatly enhance medication adherence."

https://openalex.org/W4303449143,"To improve the cybersecurity of Cloud Computing (CC) system. This paper proposes a Network Anomaly Detection (NAD) model based on the Fuzzy-C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. Secondly, the Cybersecurity Assessment Model (CAM) based on Grey Relational Grade (GRG) is creatively constructed. Finally, combined with Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) algorithm, this work proposes a CC network-oriented data encryption technology, selects different data sets for different models, and tests each model through design experiments. The results show that the average Correct Detection Rate (CDR) of the NAD model for different types of abnormal data is 93.33%. The average False Positive Rate (FPR) and the average Unreported Rate (UR) are 6.65% and 16.27%, respectively. Thus, the NAD model can ensure a high detection accuracy in the case of sufficient data. Meanwhile, the cybersecurity situation prediction by the CAM is in good agreement with the actual situation. The error between the average value of cybersecurity situation prediction and the actual value is only 0.82%, and the prediction accuracy is high. The RSA algorithm can control the average encryption time for very large text, about 12s. The decryption time is slightly longer but within a reasonable range. For different-size text, the encryption time is maintained within 0.5s. This work aims to provide important technical support for anomaly detection, overall security situation analysis, and data transmission security protection of CC systems to improve their cybersecurity."

Plateau microalgae have extensive application prospects in environmental purification, biotechnology, medicine and cosmetics, food industry, and renewable energy. To identify the high biomass of microalgae present in nature, microalgae with the greatest biomass were screened from natural water samples through filtration, pre-culture, and plate scribing separation. Following identification via 18S rRNA sequencing as for the Desmodesmus sp., we constructed a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree. The novel Desmodesmus sp. from the Tibetan Yamdrok Lake were identified through polyphasic taxonomy. Simultaneously, the sequence of the experimental samples and the target species were shown different following the identification and analysis of SNP and InDel loci. The light-absorbing properties of plateau Desmodesmus sp. have been investigated previously. The characteristic absorption peak of Desmodesmus sp. on the plateau was measured at 689 nm in the visible spectrum using full wavelength scanning with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. For Desmodesmus sp. which is prone to settling in the process of amplification culture. By monitoring the change trend of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, pH and electrical conductivity in algae solution system, we determined that the logarithmic growth phase and the best transfer window of Desmodesmus sp. were at 15-20 days. This study can provide basic research methods for the study of microalgae in high altitude areas, and lay a foundation for the later study and application of microalgae."
https://openalex.org/W4303450037,"Introduction Transgender persons experience health disparities and are marginalized in many societies worldwide. Even their numbers are unknown in many countries. We conducted the first effort to estimate the population size of transgender women (TGW) and transgender men (TGM) in Bhutan from November 2019 to January 2020. Methods Community-based surveys of TGW and TGM integrated several methods to estimate the size of hidden populations, including key informant mapping, wisdom-of-the-crowd, the service multiplier, and the unique object multiplier. Results of the several methods were synthesized using a Bayesian approach. Results Surveys included 34 TGW and 124 TGM. TGW was persons assigned to the male sex at birth and currently self-identified as “trans women” (91%), “women” (6%), or another gender (3%). TGM were persons assigned female sex at birth and self-identified as “trans men” (100%). Bayesian synthesis of the multiple methods estimated 84 TGW (credible interval 61–110) and 166 TGM (credible interval 124–211) in Bhutan. Conclusions Our study documented that TGW and TGM are part of Bhutanese society, with TGW constituting 0.03% of adult women and TGM 0.06% of adult men. Estimates can help advocate for resources and programs to address the health and well-being of these communities."
https://openalex.org/W4303453506,"Through efforts of the Gender Summits and UN Women, it is evident that all United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets must be viewed from a gender perspective to ensure that the outcomes benefit women and men equally. Our research focuses on the extent to which sex and gender topics are explicitly covered in research related to the SDGs. Expanding on previous studies, we have developed an approach to detect and visualize the volume and proportion of research publications that include explicit mention of sex and gender terms. The approach visualizes the topical coverage of the publications in the corpus of each SDG as a term map, and overlays that view with the proportion of the publications associated with sex and gender topics. We show that attention to sex and gender topics is uneven across the SDGs, and that even where overlap between an SDG and consideration of sex and gender is high, significant topical areas of relevance to the SDG have little explicit connection with sex and gender. This study lays the groundwork for the evidence-based development of a roadmap toward greater integration of sex and gender across all SDGs as well as monitoring integration progress over time."
https://openalex.org/W4303454483,"The persistence of high consequence public health pathogens in a wastewater treatment system can significantly impact worker safety, as well as the public and downstream water bodies, particularly if the system is forced to shut down the treatment processes. This study utilizes organism viability to compare the persistence of three pathogen surrogates in wastewater using a pilot-scale activated sludge treatment (AST) system, operated to mimic treatment processes of large-scale plants. Bacillus globigii spores, surrogate for Bacillus anthracis, persisted in the AST system for at least a 50-day observation period leading to a possible steady condition far beyond the solid retention time for sludge particles. MS2 bacteriophage, surrogate for Poliovirus and other non-enveloped enteric viruses, was observed for up to 35 days after introduction, which largely and expectedly correlated to the measured solid retention time. Phi-6 bacteriophage, a surrogate for Ebola virus and other enveloped viruses, was detected for no more than 4 days after introduction, even though the AST system was operated to provide three times slower solids removal than for the other surrogates. This suggests Phi-6 is subject to inactivation under AST conditions rather than physical removal. These results may suggest similar persistence for the surrogated pathogens, leading to appropriate consequence management actions."
https://openalex.org/W4303519745,"Fetuin-A is a liver derived plasma protein showing highest serum concentrations in utero, preterm infants, and neonates. Fetuin-A is also present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The origin of CSF fetuin-A, blood-derived via the blood-CSF barrier or synthesized intrathecally, is presently unclear. Fetuin-A prevents ectopic calcification by stabilizing calcium and phosphate as colloidal calciprotein particles mediating their transport and clearance. Thus, fetuin-A plays a suppressive role in inflammation. Fetuin-A is a negative acute-phase protein under investigation as a biomarker for multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we studied the association of pediatric inflammatory CNS diseases with fetuin-A glycosylation and phosphorylation. Paired blood and CSF samples from 66 children were included in the study. Concentration measurements were performed using a commercial human fetuin-A/AHSG ELISA. Of 60 pairs, 23 pairs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE following glycosidase digestion with PNGase-F and Sialidase-AU. Phosphorylation was analyzed in 43 pairs by Phos-TagTM acrylamide electrophoresis following alkaline phosphatase digestion. Mean serum and CSF fetuin-A levels were 0.30 ± 0.06 mg/ml and 0.644 ± 0.55 μg/ml, respectively. This study showed that serum fetuin-A levels decreased in inflammation corroborating its role as a negative acute-phase protein. Blood-CSF barrier disruption was associated with elevated fetuin-A in CSF. A strong positive correlation was found between the CSF fetuin-A/serum fetuin-A quotient and the CSF albumin/serum albumin quotient, suggesting predominantly transport across the blood-CSF barrier rather than intrathecal fetuin-A synthesis. Sialidase digestion showed increased asialofetuin-A levels in serum and CSF samples from children with neuroinflammatory diseases. Desialylation enhanced hepatic fetuin-A clearance via the asialoglycoprotein receptor thus rapidly reducing serum levels during inflammation. Phosphorylation of fetuin-A was more abundant in serum samples than in CSF, suggesting that phosphorylation may regulate fetuin-A influx into the CNS. These results may help establish Fetuin-A as a potential biomarker for neuroinflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4303449150,"Text information mining is a key step to data-driven automatic/semi-automatic quality management (QM). For Chinese texts, a word segmentation algorithm is necessary for pre-processing since there are no explicit marks to define word boundaries. Because of intrinsic characteristics of QM-related texts, word segmentation algorithms for normal Chinese texts cannot be directly applied. Hence, based on the analysis of QM-related texts, we summarized six features, and proposed a hybrid Chinese word segmentation model by means of integrating transfer learning (TL), bidirectional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM), multi-head attention (MA), and conditional random field (CRF) to construct the mTL-Bi-LSTM-MA-CRF model, considering insufficient samples of QM-related texts and excessive cutting of idioms. The mTL-Bi-LSTM-MA-CRF model is composed of two steps. Firstly, based on a word embedding space, the Bi-LSTM is introduced for context information learning, and the MA mechanism is selected to allocate attention among subspaces, and then the CRF is used to learn label sequence constraints. Secondly, a modified TL method is put forward for text feature extraction, adaptive layer weights learning, and loss function correction for selective learning. Experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve good word segmentation results with only a relatively small set of samples."

This study aims to investigate any change in how couples formed during the pandemic got to know the partner and experienced sexuality, including factors that could have influenced those changes in comparison with a pre-pandemic period. Particularly, focus groups (N = 26 women) were conducted and an online questionnaire (N = 120; 41 men and 79 women) was administered. Given the exploratory qualitative nature of the present research, no specific hypothesis was tested. Most of the sample reported an increase in sexual desire, sexual frequency, and quality of intercourse, perceiving an early development of intimacy. The results highlight the lack of stress and fear of contagion. The intense state of euphoria, typical of the initial phase of the relationship, has perhaps allowed the couples to overcome the obstacles due to the restrictions. This study underlines the role of being in love in the survival of the species, as it allows for the creation of steady relationships even in moments of danger."
https://openalex.org/W4303449160,"The Baja California Pacific Islands (BCPI) is a seabird hotspot in the southern California Current System supporting 129 seabird breeding populations of 23 species and over one million birds annually. These islands had a history of environmental degradation because of invasive alien species, human disturbance, and contaminants that caused the extirpation of 27 seabird populations. Most of the invasive mammals have been eradicated and colonies have been restored with social attraction techniques. We have recorded the number of breeding pairs annually for most of the colonies since 2008. To assess population trends, we analyzed these data and show results for 19 seabird species on ten island groups. The maximum number of breeding pairs for each nesting season was used to estimate the population growth rate (λ) for each species at every island colony. We performed a moving block bootstrap analysis to assess whether seabird breeding populations are increasing or decreasing. San Benito, Natividad, and San Jerónimo are the top three islands in terms of abundance of breeding pairs. The most widespread species is Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) with 14 colonies. Thirty-one populations of 14 species are significantly increasing while eleven populations of seven species are decreasing. We did not find statistical significance for 19 populations, however, 15 have λ>1 which suggest they are growing. Twelve of the 18 species for which we estimated a regional population trend are significantly increasing, including seven surface-nesting species: Brandt's Cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus), Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis), Caspian Tern (Hydroprogne caspia), Double-crested Cormorant (P. auritus), Elegant Tern (Thalasseus elegans), Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) and Western Gull (Larus occidentalis), and five burrow-nesting species: Ainley's (Hydrobates cheimomnestes), Ashy (H. homochroa) and Townsend's (H. socorroensis) Storm-Petrels, and Craveri's (Synthliboramphus craveri) and Guadalupe (S. hypoleucus) Murrelets. The BCPI support between 400,000 and 1.4 million breeding individuals annually. Our results suggest that these islands support healthy and growing populations of seabirds that have shown to be resilient to extreme environmental conditions such as the ""Blob"", and that such resilience has been strengthen from conservation and restoration actions such as the eradication of invasive mammals, social attraction techniques and island biosecurity."
https://openalex.org/W4303449238,"Fermentable carbohydrates are gaining interest in the field of human nutrition because of their benefits in obesity-related comorbidities. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of fermentable carbohydrates, such as pectin and inulin, in an atherogenic diet on metabolic responses and plaque formation in coronary arteries using a Saddleback pig model. Forty-eight healthy pigs aged five months were divided into four feeding groups (n = 10) and one baseline group (n = 8). Three feeding groups received an atherogenic diet (38% crisps, 10% palm fat, and 2% sugar with or without supplementation of 5% pectin or inulin), and one group received a conventional diet over 15 weeks. Feed intake, weight gain, body condition score, and back fat thickness were monitored regularly. Blood and fecal samples were collected monthly to assess the metabolites associated with high cardiovascular risk and fat content, respectively. At the end of 15 weeks, the coronary arteries of the pigs were analyzed for atherosclerotic plaque formation. Independent of supplementation, significant changes were observed in lipid metabolism, such as an increase in triglycerides, bile acids, and cholesterol in serum, in all groups fed atherogenic diets in comparison to the conventional group. Serum metabolome analysis showed differentiation of the feeding groups by diet (atherogenic versus conventional diet) but not by supplementation with pectin or inulin. Cardiovascular lesions were found in all feeding groups and in the baseline group. Supplementation of pectin or inulin in the atherogenic diet had no significant impact on cardiovascular lesion size. Saddleback pigs can develop naturally occurring plaques in coronary arteries. Therefore, this pig model offers potential for further research on the effects of dietary intervention on obesity-related comorbidities, such as cardiovascular lesions, in humans."

We used a two-time lagged design and paired questionnaire survey. Our analysis indicated that employees' sense of power enhanced supervisors' voice endorsement, and supervisors' perceived voice constructiveness mediated this relationship. Multilevel analyses showed that power distance negatively moderated the influence of sense of power on perceived voice constructiveness and negatively moderated its indirect effect on voice endorsement."
https://openalex.org/W4303449329,"Malaria remains a major public health challenge in Africa where annually, ~250,000 children with malaria experience a neurologic injury with subsequent neuro-disability. Evidence indicates that a higher temperature during the acute illness is a risk factor for post-infectious neurologic sequelae. As such, aggressive antipyretic therapy may be warranted among children with complicated malaria at substantial risk of brain injury. Previous clinical trials conducted primarily in children with uncomplicated malaria and using only a single antipyretic medication have shown limited benefits in terms of fever reduction; however, no studies to date have examined malaria fever management using dual therapies. In this clinical trial of aggressive antipyretic therapy, children hospitalized with central nervous system (CNS) malaria will be randomized to usual care (acetaminophen every 6 hours for a temperature ≥ 38.5°C) vs. prophylactic acetaminophen and ibuprofen every 6 hours for 72 hours.In this double-blinded, placebo controlled, two-armed clinical trial, we will enroll 284 participants from three settings at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi; at the University Teaching Hospitals Children's Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia and at Chipata Central Hospital, Chipata, Zambia. Parents or guardians must provide written informed consent. Eligible participants are 2-11 years with evidence of P. falciparum malaria infection by peripheral blood smear or rapid diagnostic test with CNS symptoms associated with malaria. Eligible children will receive treatment allocation randomization either to standard of care for fever management or to prophylactic, scheduled treatment every 6 hours for 72 hours with dual antipyretic therapies using acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Assignment to treatment groups will be with 1:1 allocation using blocked randomization. The primary outcome will be maximum temperature in the 72 hours after enrolment. Secondary outcomes include parasite clearance as determined by quantitative Histidine Rich Protein II and seizures through 72 hours after enrolment.This clinical trial seeks to challenge the practice paradigm of limited fever treatment based upon hyperpyrexia by evaluating the fever-reduction efficacy of more aggressive antipyretic using two antipyretics and prophylactic administration and will elucidate the impact of antipyretics on parasite clearance and acute symptomatic seizures. If aggressive antipyretic therapy is shown to safely reduce the maximum temperature, a clinical trial evaluating the neuroprotective effects of temperature reduction in CNS malaria is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4303449330,"While some individuals tend to follow norms, others, in the face of tempting but forbidden options, tend to commit rule-breaking when this action is beneficial for themselves. Previous studies have neglected such interindividual differences in rule-breaking. The present study fills this gap by investigating cognitive characteristics of individuals who commit spontaneous deliberative rule-breaking (rule-breakers) versus rule-followers. We developed a computerised task, in which 133 participants were incentivised to sometimes violate set rules which would-if followed-lead to a loss. While 52% of participants tended to break rules to obtain a benefit, 48% tended to follow rules even if this behaviour led to loss. Although rule-breakers experienced significantly more cognitive conflict (measured via response times and mouse movement trajectories) than rule-followers, they also obtained higher payoffs. In rule-breakers, cognitive conflict was more pronounced when violating the rules than when following them, and mainly during action planning. This conflict increased with frequent, recurrent, and early rule-breaking. Our results were in line with the Decision-Implementation-Mandatory switch-Inhibition model and thus extend the application of this model to the interindividual differences in rule-breaking. Furthermore, personality traits such as extroversion, disagreeableness, risk propensity, high impulsiveness seem to play a role in the appreciation of behaviours and cognitive characteristics of rule-followers and rule-breakers. This study opens the path towards the understanding of the cognitive characteristics of the interindividual differences in responses towards rules, and especially in spontaneous deliberative rule-breaking."
https://openalex.org/W4303449342,"Aging is the most significant risk factor for dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for approximately 60-80% of all dementia cases in older adults. This study aimed to examine the relationship between finger movements and brain volume in AD patients using a voxel-based reginal analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) software.Patients diagnosed with AD at the Center for Comprehensive Care and Research on Memory Disorders were included. The diagnostic criteria were based on the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association. A finger-tapping device was used for all measurements. Participants performed the tasks in the following order: with their non-dominant hand, dominant hand, both hands simultaneously, and alternate hands. Movements were measured for 15 s each. The relationship between distance and output was measured. Magnetic resonance imaging measurements were performed, and VSRAD was conducted using sagittal section 3D T1-weighted images. The Z-score was used to calculate the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient analyzed the relationship between the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy and mean values of the parameters in the finger-tapping movements. The statistical significance level was set at <5%. The calculated p-values were corrected using the Bonferroni method.Sixty-two patients were included in the study. Comparison between VSRAD and MoCA-J scores corrected for p-values showed a significant negative correlation with the extent of gray matter atrophy (r = -0. 52; p< 0.001). A positive correlation was observed between the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy and standard deviation (SD) of the distance rate of velocity peak in extending movements in the non-dominant hand (r = 0. 51; p< 0.001).The SD of distance rate of velocity peak in extending movements extracted from finger taps may be a useful parameter for the early detection of AD and diagnosis of its severity."
https://openalex.org/W4303449415,"Herein we report the use of an environmental multimetal(loid)-resistant strain, MF05, to biosynthesize single- or multi-element nanostructures under anaerobic conditions. Inorganic nanostructure synthesis typically requires methodologies and conditions that are harsh and environmentally hazardous. Thus, green/eco-friendly procedures are desirable, where the use of microorganisms and their extracts as bionanofactories is a reliable strategy. First, MF05 was entirely sequenced and identified as an Escherichia coli-related strain with some genetic differences from the traditional BW25113. Secondly, we compared the CdS nanostructure biosynthesis by whole-cell in a design defined minimal culture medium containing sulfite as the only sulfur source to obtain sulfide reduction from a low-cost chalcogen reactant. Under anaerobic conditions, this process was greatly favored, and irregular CdS (ex. 370 nm; em. 520-530 nm) was obtained. When other chalcogenites were tested (selenite and tellurite), only spherical Se0 and elongated Te0 nanostructures were observed by TEM and analyzed by SEM-EDX. In addition, enzymatic-mediated chalcogenite (sulfite, selenite, and tellurite) reduction was assessed by using MF05 crude extracts in anaerobiosis; similar results for nanostructures were obtained; however Se0 and Te0 formation were more regular in shape and cleaner (with less background). Finally, the in vitro nanostructure biosynthesis was assessed with salts of Ag, Au, Cd, and Li alone or in combination with chalcogenites. Several single or binary nanostructures were detected. Our results showed that MF05 is a versatile anaerobic bionanofactory for different types of inorganic NS. synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4303449429,"Research into the experiences of students in mathematics with a marginalized sexual identity has remained largely underexplored, relegating these experiences and individuals to remain invisible. In this study, we leverage Queer Theory to address this gap in research by reporting on the experiences of Queer-spectrum undergraduate students (n = 2,454) enrolled in introductory mathematics courses (Precalculus, Calculus 1, and Calculus 2) across the United States. Drawing on student data (n = 24,327) from the Student Post-Secondary Instructional Practices Survey, we examine reported outcomes of math learning experiences and access to learning environments. Overall, within introductory math courses, sexual identity had a significant relationship with accessing learning environments and mathematical learning experiences. Asexual students were among those that reported higher levels of interactions with peers and instructors, a greater sense of community & participation, positive math affect, and were more likely to access learning environments external to the course yet anticipated receiving a lower course grade when compared to straight students. Bisexual students reported lower levels of interactions with instructors, a diminished sense of community & participation, math engagement, positive math affect, and were less likely to access learning environments compared to straight students. These findings suggest that Queer-spectrum students experience mathematical learning in a different manner than their straight peers and in relation to other Queer spectrum identities. Queer-spectrum students with a sexualized identity perceive that mathematics environments are not normative places to be a part of the community, resulting in negative dispositions, reduced interactions, and lower academic success. The impact of sexual identity, although small, contributes to negative indicators of positive mathematical experiences and suggests that the normative discourses in mathematics that are identity neutral, heteronormative, and aligned with binary thinking are differentially impacting Queer-spectrum students."

Pure Tone Audiometry (PTA), the gold standard for hearing loss screening, is expensive, and not readily available at health sites. Mobile audiometry can bridge this gap. However, there is limited knowledge on its acceptability in low-income countries like Uganda. We aimed to assess the acceptability of using the Wulira App, a validated mobile phone app, in assessing hearing loss among industrial workers in Kampala.We carried out a qualitative study in a steel and iron manufacturing industry in Kampala, in April 2021. Four Focus group discussions (FGDs) with 8 participants per FGD, and 12 In-depth Interviews (IDI), were conducted on the industrial workers. The industrial workers were first tested for hearing loss, then enrolled for the FGDs and IDI. A semi-structured interview guide was used. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim. Themes were derived using thematic content analysis, borrowing from Sekhon's model of Acceptability of Health Interventions.Industrial workers found the Wulira App user friendly, cheap, time saving, and an effective hearing loss assessment tool. However, barriers such as lack of smart phones, difficulty in navigating the app, and fear of getting bad news hindered the App's acceptability, as a hearing assessment tool.Hearing loss assessment using Wulira App was acceptable to the industry workers. There is need of informing industrial workers on the essence of carrying out regular hearing loss screening, such that barriers like fear of getting screened are overcome."
https://openalex.org/W4303449894,"The present study served to test whether emotion modulates auditory distraction in a serial-order reconstruction task. If auditory distraction results from an attentional trade-off between the targets and distractors, auditory distraction should decrease when attention is focused on targets with high negative arousal. Two experiments (with a total N of 284 participants) were conducted to test whether auditory distraction is influenced by target emotion. In Experiment 1 it was examined whether two benchmark effects of auditory distraction-the auditory-deviant effect and the changing-state effect-differ as a function of whether negative high-arousal targets or neutral low-arousal targets are used. Experiment 2 complements Experiment 1 by testing whether target emotion modulates the disruptive effects of reversed sentential speech and steady-state distractor sequences relative to a quiet control condition. Even though the serial order of negative high-arousal targets was better remembered than that of neutral low-arousal targets, demonstrating an emotional facilitation effect on serial-order reconstruction, auditory distraction was not modulated by target emotion. The results provide support of the automatic-capture account according to which auditory distraction, regardless of the specific type of auditory distractor sequence that has to be ignored, is a fundamentally stimulus-driven effect that is rooted in the automatic processing of the to-be-ignored auditory stream and remains unaffected by emotional-motivational factors."

Those approaches give less conservative, exponentially passive criteria for special cases of general stability of a neutral differential system. Furthermore, the results of this study are delay-dependent, which depend on the lower and upper bound with the time-varying delay. Lastly, some numerical examples illustrate the performance of our criteria based on the results obtained and summarize some of the previous achievements."
https://openalex.org/W4303449977,"Background Frailty is associated with adverse outcomes in traumatically injured geriatric patients but has not been well-studied in geriatric Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Objective To assess relationships between frailty and outcomes after TBI Methods The records of all patients aged 70 or older admitted from home to the neurosurgical service of a single institution for non-operative TBI between January 2020 and July 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcome was adverse discharge disposition (either in-hospital expiration or discharge to skilled nursing facility (SNF), hospice, or home with hospice). Secondary outcomes included major inpatient complication, 30-day readmission, and length of stay. Results 100 patients were included, 90% of whom presented with Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) 14–15. The mean length of stay was 3.78 days. 7% had an in-hospital complication, and 44% had an unfavorable discharge destination. 49% of patients attended follow-up within 3 months. The rate of readmission within 30 days was 13%. Patients were characterized as low frailty (FRAIL score 0–1, n = 35, 35%) or high frailty (FRAIL score 2–5, n = 65, 65%). In multivariate analysis controlling for age and other factors, frailty category (aOR 2.63, 95CI [1.02, 7.14], p = 0.005) was significantly associated with unfavorable discharge. Frailty was not associated with increased readmission rate, LOS, or rate of complications on uncontrolled univariate analyses. Conclusion Frailty is associated with increased odds of unfavorable discharge disposition for geriatric patients admitted with TBI."
https://openalex.org/W4303453391,"In a viral epidemic, the emergence of a novel strain with increased transmissibility (larger value of basic reproduction number R 0 ) sparks the fear that the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to an increase in disease severity. It is required to investigate if a new, more contagious strain will be necessarily dominant in the population and resulting in more disease severity. In this paper, the impact of the asymptomatic transmission and the emergence time of a more transmissible variant of a multi-strain viral disease on the disease prevalence, disease severity, and the dominant variant in an epidemic was investigated by a proposed 2-strain epidemic model. The simulation results showed that considering only R 0 , is insufficient to predict the outcome of a new, more contagious strain in the population. A more transmissible strain with a high fraction of asymptomatic cases can substantially reduce the mortality rate. If the emergence time of the new strain is closer to the start of the epidemic, the new, more contagious variant has more chance to win the viral competition and be the dominant strain; otherwise, despite being more contagious, it cannot dominate previous strains. In conclusion, three factors of R 0 , the fraction of asymptomatic transmission, and the emergence time of the new strain are required to correctly determine the prevalence, disease severity, and the winner of the viral competition."

A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different ABA concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10 and 20 μmol/L) on the physiological characteristics and Se absorption capacity of P. frutescens. Application of 5, 10 and 20 μmol/L ABA increased the shoot biomass of P. frutescens, and only 5 and 10 μmol/L ABA increased the root biomass. Application of 5, 10, and 20 μmol/L ABA increased the contents of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid), superoxide dismutase activity, peroxidase activity, and soluble protein content of P. frutescens, and decreased the malondialdehyde content in P. frutescens. Only 5 and 10 μmol/L ABA used in the present study increased the catalase activity of P. frutescens. For the Se uptake, only 5 μmol/L ABA increased the Se content, Se extraction and Se bioconcentration factor of both roots and shoots. The findings of the present study indicate that 5 and 10 μmol/L ABA promotes the growth of P. frutescens, whereas 5 μmol/L ABA enhances the Se accumulation capacity in P. frutescens."

https://openalex.org/W4303453570,"The sequelae of moderate-severe acquired brain injury (ABI) encompass motor, cognitive, sensory, emotional and behavioural areas that affect meaningful occupational participation and quality of life, with a high prevalence of associated mental disorders. When the patient returns to community life after discharge from the hospital, specialised care is generally insufficient due to the lack of consideration of the dual condition of mental disorder and ABI. Since there is a negative impact on competence and thus on occupational participation, occupational therapy represents a convenient way of intervention. On these assumptions, a community-based occupational therapy protocol on mental health for people with moderate/severe acquired brain injury (COT-MHABI) is presented. It is focused on meaningful occupational participation and looks for improvement in the quality of life.This study aims: (i) to design a protocol to evaluate the effectiveness of a community occupational therapy intervention based on MOHO for patients with a dual (mental health/ABI) for improving quality of life and self-perceived occupational performance; (ii) to analyse the outcomes of occupational and social variables (occupational balance, participation level, satisfaction with occupation and performed roles and community integration) after the COT-MHABI process; (iii) to analyse the impact of quality of life on satisfaction with occupations performed by this population. A non-randomised controlled clinical trial will be performed. Patients assigned to the experimental group will receive over one year of on-site and telematic occupational therapy sessions, 16 sessions on average. Variables such as quality of life, community integration or satisfaction with occupational performance will be collected at baseline, 6, and 12 months.The needs for the dual mental/ABI population in their reintegration into the community are related to the associated deficits and to the absence of specialised services for the complexity of this patient profile. Few studies consider the coexistence of mental health and ABI issues. The COT-MHABI protocol is proposed to provide continuity to the community needs of this population, conceptualised from occupational participation, person-centred and focused on meaningful activities.Trial identifier and registry name ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04586842 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04586842?term=252136&draw=2&rank=1; Pre-results; Community-based Occupational Therapy Intervention on Mental Health for People With Acquired Brain Injury (COT-MHABI)."
https://openalex.org/W4303453573,"Use of a standardized verbal autopsy (VA) questionnaire, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) instrument, can improve the consistency and reliability of the data it collects. Systematically revising a questionnaire, however, requires evidence about the performance of its questions. The purpose of this investigation was to use a mixed methods approach to evaluate the performance of questions related to 14 previously reported issues in the 2016 version of the WHO questionnaire, where there were concerns of potential confusion, redundancy, or inability of the respondent to answer the question. The results from this mixed methods analysis are discussed across common themes that may have contributed to the underperformance of questions and have been compiled to inform decisions around the revision of the current VA instrument.Quantitative analysis of 19,150 VAs for neonates, children, and adults from five project teams implementing VAs predominately in Sub-Saharan Africa included frequency distributions and cross-tabulations to evaluate response patterns among related questions. The association of respondent characteristics and response patterns was evaluated using prevalence ratios. Qualitative analysis included results from cognitive interviewing, an approach that provides a detailed understanding of the meanings and processes that respondents use to answer interview questions. Cognitive interviews were conducted among 149 participants in Morocco and Zambia. Findings from the qualitative and quantitative analyses were triangulated to identify common themes.Four broad themes contributing to the underperformance or redundancy within the instrument were identified: question sequence, overlap within the question series, questions outside the frame of reference of the respondent, and questions needing clarification. The series of questions associated with one of the 14 identified issues (the series of questions on injuries) related to question sequence; seven (tobacco use, sores, breast swelling, abdominal problem, vomiting, vaccination, and baby size) demonstrated similar response patterns among questions within each series capturing overlapping information. Respondent characteristics, including relationship to the deceased and whether or not the respondent lived with the deceased, were associated with differing frequencies of non-substantive responses in three question series (female health related issues, tobacco use, and baby size). An inconsistent understanding of related constructs was observed between questions related to sores/ulcers, birth weight/baby size, and diagnosis of dementia/presence of mental confusion. An incorrect association of the intended construct with that which was interpreted by the respondent was observed in the medical diagnosis question series.In this mixed methods analysis, we identified series of questions which could be shortened through elimination of redundancy, series of questions requiring clarification due to unclear constructs, and the impact of respondent characteristics on the quality of responses. These changes can lead to a better understanding of the question constructs by the respondents, increase the acceptance of the tool, and improve the overall accuracy of the VA instrument."
https://openalex.org/W4303453720,"Introduction Primary brain calcification (PBC) is a rare and intractable neurodegenerative disease. SLC20A2 and PDGFB are two major causative genes. As there is no effective treatment to avoid further progression or to prevent the onset of the disease, the patients may experience psychological distress. There is a qualitative study on the experiences of patients with primary brain calcification with SLC20A2 variants. However, the experiences of patients with PDGFB variants of the disease have not been explored. The purpose of this study is to identify the experiences of patients with PDGFB variants after diagnosis. Materials and methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted once or twice a year for three years with five patients over the age of 21. The data were analyzed using inductive qualitative methods. Results Seven categories, 15 subcategories, and 129 codes were extracted. The seven categories are as follows: [Shock at hearing the term ‘brain calcification’ for the first time], [Anxiety regarding the risk of heredity], [Anxiety, along with severe headaches, and various other symptoms], [Gratitude for the family members who care], [Accepting the disease as a non-life-threatening illness], [Feeling alienated due to the rare intractable disease], and [Modifying lifestyle due to the illness]. Discussion The most stressful aspect of the disease was the headache that persisted even with the use of analgesics, which was different from patients with the SLC20A2 variants. In addition, we found unique concepts such as anxiety regarding the risk of heredity and a feeling of alienation due to the rare and intractable disease."
https://openalex.org/W4303453730,"Disturbance gradients are particularly useful for understanding the relative influences of competition and dispersal. Shortly after disturbance, plant composition should be influenced more strongly by dispersal than competition; over time, this should reverse, with competition becoming more important. As such, we predicted that plant functional traits associated with high dispersal ability would be over-represented shortly after a disturbance event occurs, while those associated with high competitive ability would have increased representation as time progresses. Additionally, it has been suggested that competitive interactions may contribute to negative co-occurrence patterns; if this is the case, negative co-occurrence patterns should also increase as time-since-disturbance increases. Here, we examine how functional trait and co-occurrence patterns change over time following a herbicide-based disturbance, compared to undisturbed vegetation, in a temperate, old-field grassland dominated by herbaceous perennials. In our study system, negative co-occurrence patterns were most pronounced in disturbed plots one year after herbicide application, consistent with several lines of evidence that dispersal can strongly impact both composition and co-occurrence patterns. Over three years post-disturbance, co-occurrence patterns in disturbed plots decreased, becoming more similar to control plots. This pattern is inconsistent with the expectation that competition contributes to negative co-occurrence patterns, at least over three growing seasons. More pronounced negative co-occurrence patterns were associated with higher species evenness among plots. Functional traits related to increased dispersal (mean seed mass, and proportion of stoloniferous/rhizomatous species) and competitive ability (mean species height, and mean specific leaf area) did not differ significantly across treatments, with the exception of mean height in the third-year post-disturbance; however, the overall trajectory of this trait was inconsistent with theoretical expectations. Overall, co-occurrence patterns changed across the gradient of time-since disturbance, but not as expected; functional trait patterns (trait means, functional diversity measures) were not responsive to our experimental disturbance gradient."
https://openalex.org/W4303453748,"Nowadays, the burden of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been increasing in the world, particularly in developing nations. This could be related to the poor prognosis of the disease due to late presentation at diagnosis and poor treatment outcomes. In Ethiopia, studies related to the stage of colorectal cancer at diagnosis and its determinants are limited. Therefore, the study was intended to assess advanced stage presentation and its associated factors among colorectal cancer patients in northwest Ethiopia.An institution-based retrospective study was conducted among 367 CRC patients at two oncologic centers (the University of Gondar and Felege Hiwot comprehensive specialized hospitals) from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020. Data were entered into EPi-data 4.2.0.0 and transferred to STATA version 14 statistical software for analysis. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the outcome variable. All variables with P-value < 0.2 during bi-variable analysis were considered for multivariable logistic regression. The level of statistical significance was declared at P-value <0.05.The magnitude of advanced stage presentation of colorectal cancer was 83.1%. Being rural dwellers (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.6; 95% CI: 1.8,7.2), not medically insured (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.9,7.8), patients delay (AOR = 6.5; 95% CI:3.2, 13.3), recurrence of the disease (AOR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1,4.7), and no comorbidity illness (AOR = 4.4; 95% CI: 2.1, 9.1) were predictors of advanced stage presentation of CRC.The current study revealed that the advanced-stage presentation of colorectal cancer patients was high. It is recommended that the community shall be aware of the signs and symptoms of the disease using different media, giving more emphasis to the rural community, expanding health insurance, and educating patients about the recurrence chance of the disease. Moreover, expansion of colorectal treatment centers and screening of colorectal cancer should be given emphasis."
https://openalex.org/W4303453820,"Background Trachoma is a public health issue in more than 50 nations worldwide, mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where hundreds of millions of people are considered blind. Ethiopia is projected to have 30% of the global active trachoma burden. The frequency of Trachoma Folliculitis in children aged 1 to 9 years old is 30% in the Oromia Region. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of active trachoma and associated variables among children aged 1 to 9 years old in Arsi Negele Town, West Arsi Zone, Oromia Regional State, Southern Ethiopia, December 24–26, 2019. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Arsi Negele town community on December 24–26, 2019. A total of 178 study volunteers were recruited using a single population proportion formula and assigned to families in the town’s three kebeles in proportion. A simple random selection procedure was used to choose study participants from the identified households. Madda Walabu University provided ethical approval, and different government structures provided letters of permission. Pre-tested structured questionnaires and binocular loupes X 2.5 were used to collect data from either mothers or fathers of eligible children for eye examination; torches with bottles of alcohol were used to gather data from either mothers or fathers of eligible children for eye examination. For analysis, data was entered into (IBM, SPSS) version 22. To assess factors associated with active trachoma, bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used. The crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to investigate the degree of association between the independent variables and active trachoma. Multivariate logistic regression was used to find connections between dependent and independent variables with a p≤ 0.05 confidence levels and a 95% confidence interval. Result The prevalence of active trachoma was determined to be 21.91% TF among 178 children aged 1 to 9 years. Flies on children’s faces (AOR = 3.427; 95 percent CI: 1.432–8.171), unclean children’s faces (AOR = 3.99; 95 percent CI: 1.427–11.158), face washing habits (AOR = 3.064; 95 percent CI: 1.273–7.373), and not using soap while face washing (AOR = 4.564; 95 percent CI 1.561–13.342) were found to be statistically significant associated factors with the prevalence of active trachoma. Conclusion The prevalence of active trachoma was found to be relatively high. Face washing practices and the lack of soap use while washing faces were found as associated factors requiring optimal interventions to prevent trachoma infection among children aged 1–9 years in Arsi Negele town."
https://openalex.org/W4303454036,"Whether mammalian embryos develop normally under microgravity remains to be determined. However, embryos are too small to be handled by inexperienced astronauts who orbit Earth on the International Space Station (ISS). Here we describe the development of a new device that allows astronauts to thaw and culture frozen mouse 2-cell embryos on the ISS without directly contacting the embryos. First, we developed several new devices using a hollow fiber tube that allows thawing embryo without practice and observations of embryonic development. The recovery rate of embryos was over 90%, and its developmental rate to the blastocyst were over 80%. However, the general vitrification method requires liquid nitrogen, which is not available on the ISS. Therefore, we developed another new device, Embryo Thawing and Culturing unit (ETC) employing a high osmolarity vitrification method, which preserves frozen embryos at -80°C for several months. Embryos flushed out of the ETC during thawing and washing were protected using a mesh sheet. Although the recovery rate of embryos after thawing were not high (24%-78%) and embryonic development in ETC could not be observed, thawed embryos formed blastocysts after 4 days of culture (29%-100%) without direct contact. Thus, this ETC could be used for untrained astronauts to thaw and culture frozen embryos on the ISS. In addition, this ETC will be an important advance in fields such as clinical infertility and animal biotechnology when recovery rate of embryos were improved nearly 100%."
https://openalex.org/W4303454488,"In multiple-criteria decision making/aiding/analysis (MCDM/MCDA) weights of criteria constitute a crucial input for finding an optimal solution (alternative). A large number of methods were proposed for criteria weights derivation including direct ranking, point allocation, pairwise comparisons, entropy method, standard deviation method, and so on. However, the problem of correct criteria weights setting persists, especially when the number of criteria is relatively high. The aim of this paper is to approach the problem of determining criteria weights from a different perspective: we examine what weights' values have to be for a given alternative to be ranked the best. We consider a space of all feasible weights from which a large number of weights in the form of n-tuples is drawn randomly via Monte Carlo method. Then, we use predefined dominance relations for comparison and ranking of alternatives, which are based on the set of generated cases. Further on, we provide the estimates for a sample size so the results could be considered robust enough. At last, but not least, we introduce the concept of central weights and the measure of its robustness (stability) as well as the concept of alternatives' multi-dominance, and show their application to a real-world problem of the selection of the best wind turbine."
https://openalex.org/W4303503528,"To investigate the predictive value of neutrophil, D-dimer and diseases associated with stroke for short-term outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS).By collecting the subitems of laboratory data especially routine blood and coagulation test in AIS patients, and recording their clinical status, the correlation, regression and predictive value of each subitem with the short-term outcomes of AIS were analyzed. The predict model was constructed.The neutrophil count multiplied by D-dimer (NDM) had the best predictive value among the subitems, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve reached 0.804. When clinical information was not considered, the Youden index of NDM was calculated to be 0.48, corresponding to an NDM value of 7.78, a diagnostic sensitivity of 0.79, specificity of 0.69, negative predictive value of 96%. NDM were divided into 5 quintiles, the five grade of NDM (quintile) were < = 1.82, 1.83-2.41, 2.42-3.27, 3.28-4.49, 4.95+, respectively. The multivariate regression analysis was conducted between NDM (quintile), Babinski+, pneumonia, cardiac disease and poor outcomes of AIS. Compared with the first grade of NDM (quintile), the second grade of NDM (quintile) was not significant, but the third grade of NDM (quintile) showed 7.061 times, the fourth grade of NDM (quintile) showed 11.776 times, the fifth grade of NDM (quintile) showed 23.394 times in short-term poor outcomes occurrence. Babinski sign + showed 1.512 times, pneumonia showed 2.995 times, cardiac disease showed 1.936 times in short-term poor outcomes occurrence compared with those negative patients.NDM combined with pneumonia may better predict short-term outcomes in patients with AIS. Early prevention, regular examination and timely intervention should be emphasized for patients, which may reduce the risk of short-term poor outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4303515394,"Wind energy is one of the renewable energy sources like solar energy, and accurate wind power prediction can help countries deploy wind farms at particular locations yielding more electricity. For any prediction problem, determining the optimal time step (lookback) information is of primary importance, and using information from previous timesteps can improve the prediction scores. This article uses simulated annealing to find an optimal time step for wind power prediction. Finding an optimal timestep is computationally expensive and may require brute-forcing to evaluate the deep learning model at each time. This article uses simulated annealing to find an optimal time step for wind power prediction. The computation time was reduced from 166 hours to 3 hours to find an optimal time step for wind power prediction with a simulated annealing-based approach. We tested the proposed approach on three different wind farms with a training set of 50%, a validation set of 25%, and a test set of 25%, yielding MSE of 0.0059, 0.0074, and 0.010 for each wind farm. The article presents the results in detail, not just the mean square root error."
