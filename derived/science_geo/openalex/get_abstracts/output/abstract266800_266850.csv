Such animals, moreover, show a rise in plasma inorganic phosphate and blood sugar. They also show in the liver a decrease in glycogen and in the total acid-soluble phosphates. An increase in liver inorganic phosphate occurs with a concurrent fall in adenosine pyrophosphate and other organo-phosphates. Hence the rise in plasma inorganic phosphate during coma is at least partially due to a loss of liver phosphate. It is probable that this rise in plasma inorganic phosphate results from a breakdown of organo-phosphates which result from the depressed oxidations associated with insulin lack. Insulin, when administered in exceptionally large doses, tends to cause improvement in both the clinical and chemical state of comatose rats."

Unbalance of sex hormones stimulates lymphoblastic tissue and increases tumor incidence. Inanition and radiation reduce the number of circulating lymphocytes and also the growth and occurrence of tumors. The nucleus of the lymphocyte is considered to be a possible factor causing a disturbance of the nucleoproteins."
