https://openalex.org/W2557056342,"Making liquid biopsy testing widely available requires a concept to ship whole blood at ambient temperatures while retaining the integrity of the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) population and stability of blood cells to prevent dilution of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) with wild-type genomic DNA. The cell- and DNA-stabilizing properties of Streck Cell-Free DNA BCT blood collection tubes (cfDNA BCTs) were evaluated to determine if they can be utilized in combination with highly sensitive mutation detection technologies.Venous blood from healthy donors or patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) was collected in cfDNA BCTs and standard K2EDTA tubes. Tubes were stored at different temperatures for various times before plasma preparation and DNA extraction. The isolated cfDNA was analyzed for overall DNA yield of short and long DNA fragments using qPCR as well as for mutational changes using BEAMing and Plasma Safe-Sequencing (Safe-SeqS).Collection of whole blood from healthy individuals in cfDNA BCTs and storage for up to 5 days at room temperature did not affect the DNA yield and mutation background levels (n = 60). Low-frequency mutant DNA spiked into normal blood samples as well as mutant circulating tumor DNA in blood samples from CRC patients collected in cfDNA BCTs were reliably detected after 3 days of storage at room temperature. However, blood samples stored at ≤ 10°C and at 40°C for an extended period of time showed elevated normal genomic DNA levels and an abnormally large cellular plasma interface as well as lower plasma volumes.Whole blood shipped in cfDNA BCTs over several days can be used for downstream liquid biopsy testing using BEAMing and Safe-SeqS. Since the shipping temperature is a critical factor, special care has to be taken to maintain a defined room temperature range to obtain reliable mutation testing results."
https://openalex.org/W2554810510,"Background Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are life-threatening diseases; however, it is hard to estimate their incidence due to the rarity of these diseases. We evaluated the incidence of SJS and TEN using a nationwide administrative database. Methods We used a national medical insurance review system (Health Insurance Review and Assessment) database which contained the claim data of the entire nation from 2009 to 2013 to estimate the accurate incidence of SJS and TEN in Korea. The diagnostic codes of L511 (SJS) or L512 (TEN) from the International Classification of Diseases-10th revision were used to define the target study population. We also retrospectively followed up a 2011 SJS and TEN cohort for 24 months in order to assess the in-hospital mortality, related complications and total claims cost due to SJS and TEN. Results A total of 1,167 (938 SJS and 229 TEN) cases were newly diagnosed from 2010 to 2013. The age- and sex-standardized annual incidences estimated in this study were 3.96 to 5.03 in SJS and 0.94 to 1.45 in TEN per million. There was no significant change in annual incidence throughout the study periods. When analyzed by 10-year age groups, the annual incidence was the lowest in group 20–29 years and the highest in group 70 for both SJS and TEN. Based on the 2011 cohort analysis, the in-hospital mortality were 5.7 and 15.1% for SJS and TEN, respectively. The mortality increased with age, particularly, after 40 years of age. Among the complications related with SJS or TEN, ocular sequelae was the most common (43.1 and 43.4% of SJS and TEN patients, respectively) followed by urethral sequelae (5.7 and 9.4% of SJS and TEN patients, respectively). Conclusion Overall, our data suggest that SJS, and TEN are infrequent but constantly arise throughout the years."
https://openalex.org/W2550542562,"Nucleotide signaling networks are key to facilitate alterations in gene expression, protein function, and enzyme activity in response to diverse stimuli. Cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is an important secondary messenger molecule produced by the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and is involved in regulating a number of physiological processes including potassium transport. S. aureus must ensure tight control over its cellular levels as both high levels of the dinucleotide and its absence result in a number of detrimental phenotypes. Here we show that in addition to the membrane-bound Asp-His-His and Asp-His-His-associated (DHH/DHHA1) domain-containing phosphodiesterase (PDE) GdpP, S. aureus produces a second cytoplasmic DHH/DHHA1 PDE Pde2. Although capable of hydrolyzing c-di-AMP, Pde2 preferentially converts linear 5'-phosphadenylyl-adenosine (pApA) to AMP. Using a pde2 mutant strain, pApA was detected for the first time in S. aureus, leading us to speculate that this dinucleotide may have a regulatory role under certain conditions. Moreover, pApA is involved in a feedback inhibition loop that limits GdpP-dependent c-di-AMP hydrolysis. Another protein linked to the regulation of c-di-AMP levels in bacteria is the predicted regulator protein YbbR. Here, it is shown that a ybbR mutant S. aureus strain has increased acid sensitivity that can be bypassed by the acquisition of mutations in a number of genes, including the gene coding for the diadenylate cyclase DacA. We further show that c-di-AMP levels are slightly elevated in the ybbR suppressor strains tested as compared with the wild-type strain. With this, we not only identified a new role for YbbR in acid stress resistance in S. aureus but also provide further insight into how c-di-AMP levels impact acid tolerance in this organism."
https://openalex.org/W2556869277,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) after pediatric cardiac surgery is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Modifiable risk factors for postoperative AKI including perioperative anesthesia-related parameters were assessed. The authors conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of 220 patients (aged 10 days to 19 years) who underwent congenital cardiac surgery between January and December 2012. The incidence of AKI within 7 days postoperatively was determined using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Ninety-two patients (41.8%) developed AKI and 18 (8.2%) required renal replacement therapy within the first postoperative week. Among patients who developed AKI, 57 patients (25.9%) were KDIGO stage 1, 27 patients (12.3%) were KDIGO stage 2, and eight patients (3.6%) were KDIGO stage 3. RACHS-1 (Risk-Adjusted classification for Congenital Heart Surgery) category, perioperative transfusion and fluid administration as well as fluid overload were compared between patients with and without AKI. Multivariable logistic regression analyses determined the risk factors for AKI. AKI was associated with longer hospital stay or ICU stay, and frequent sternal wound infections. Younger age (<12 months) [odds ratio (OR), 4.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.77-9.06], longer cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.24-4.84), and low preoperative hemoglobin (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.07-5.40) were independent risk factors for AKI. Fluid overload was not a significant predictor for AKI. When a variable of hemoglobin concentration increase (>3 g/dl) from preoperative level on POD1 was entered into the multivariable analysis, it was independently associated with postoperative AKI (OR, 6.51; 95% CI, 2.23-19.03 compared with no increase). This association was significant after adjustment with patient demographics, medication history and RACHS-1 category (hemoglobin increase >3g/dl vs. no increase: adjusted OR, 6.94; 95% CI, 2.33-20.69), regardless of different age groups and cyanotic or non-cyanotic heart disease. Prospective trials are required to evaluate whether correction of preoperative anemia and prevention of hemoconcentration may ameliorate postoperative AKI in patients who underwent congenital cardiac surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2552206015,"Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3, mouse homolog Gtl2) encodes a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is expressed in many normal tissues, but is suppressed in various cancer cell lines and tumors, suggesting it plays a functional role as a tumor suppressor. Hypermethylation has been shown to contribute to this loss of expression. We now demonstrate that MEG3 expression is regulated by the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) pathway and correlates with a change in cell proliferation. Microarray analysis of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from mice with genetic deletion of all three Rb family members (TKO) revealed a significant silencing of Gtl2/MEG3 expression compared to WT MEFs, and re-expression of Gtl2/MEG3 caused decrease in cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. MEG3 levels also were suppressed in A549 lung cancer cells compared with normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, and, similar to the TKO cells, re-constitution of MEG3 led to a decrease in cell proliferation and elevated apoptosis. Activation of pRb by treatment of A549 and SK-MES-1 cells with palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, increased the expression of MEG3 in a dose-dependent manner, while knockdown of pRb/p107 attenuated this effect. In addition, expression of phosphorylation-deficient mutant of pRb increased MEG3 levels in both lung cancer cell types. Treatment of these cells with palbociclib also decreased the expression of pRb-regulated DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), while conversely, knockdown of DNMT1 resulted in increased expression of MEG3. As gene methylation has been suggested for MEG3 regulation, we found that palbociclib resulted in decreased methylation of the MEG3 locus similar to that observed with 5-aza-deoxycytidine. Anti-sense oligonucleotide silencing of drug-induced MEG3 expression in A549 and SK-MES-1 cells partially rescued the palbociclib-mediated decrease in cell proliferation, while analysis of the TCGA database revealed decreased MEG3 expression in human lung tumors harboring a disrupted RB pathway. Together, these data suggest that disruption of the pRb-DNMT1 pathway leads to a decrease in MEG3 expression, thereby contributing to the pro-proliferative state of certain cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2554949213,"Sarcopenia is a condition diagnosed when the patient presents low muscle mass, plus low muscle strength or low physical performance. Muscle weakness in the oldest (dynapenia) is a major public health concern because it predicts future all-cause mortality and is associated with falls, disability, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Grip strength is a simple method for assessment of muscle function in clinical practice.To estimate the grip strength and identify factors associated with handgrip strength variation in elderly people with low socioeconomic status.Cross-sectional study based on a multidimensional assessment of primary care users that were 60 years or older. The sample size was calculated using an estimated prevalence of depression in older adults of 20%. A kappa coefficient of 0.6 with a 95% confidence interval was used to generate a conservative sample size of 180 individuals. Procedures: tests and scales to assess humor, cognition (MMSE), basic (ADL) and instrumental activities (IADL) of daily living, mobility (Timed Up and Go), strength, height, Body Mass Index (BMI) and social support were applied. Questions about falls, chronic diseases and self-rated health (SRH) were also included. Statistical Analysis: Mean, standard deviation and statistical tests were used to compare grip strength means by demographic and health factors. A multivariate linear model was used to explain the relationship of the predictors with grip strength.The group was composed predominantly by women (73%) with a very low level of education (mean 3 years of schooling), mean age of 73.09 (± 7.05) years old, good mobility and without IADL impairment. Mean grip strength of male and female were 31.86Kg (SD 5.55) and 21.69Kg (SD 4.48) [p- 0.0001], respectively. Low grip strength was present in 27.7% of women and 39.6% of men. As expected, men and younger participants had higher grip strength than women and older individuals. In the adjusted model, age (p- 0.03), female sex (p- 0.0001), mobility (p- 0.05), height (p- 0.03) and depression (p- 0.03) were independently associated with low grip strength. For every second more in the mobility test, there was a mean decrease of 0.08 Kg in the grip strength. Elders with depression had a mean reduction of 1.74Kg in the grip strength in relation to those in the comparison groups. There was an average reduction of 8.36Kg in the grip strength of elderly females relative to males. For each year of age after 60 years, it was expected an average reduction of 0.11 Kg in the grip strength.our results suggest that low grip strength is associated with age, female sex, height, depression and mobility problems in poor elderly. Grip strength can be a simple, quick and inexpensive means of stratifying elders' risk of sarcopenia in the primary care setting. Efforts should be made to recognize weaker persons and the conditions associated to low grip strength in order to target early interventions to prevent frailty and disability."
https://openalex.org/W2549367001,"Increasing equitable access to health care is a main challenge African policy makers are facing. The Ghanaian government implemented the National Health Insurance Scheme in 2004 and the aim of this study is to evaluate its early effects on maternal and infant healthcare use. We exploit data on births before and after the intervention and apply propensity score matching to limit the bias arising from self-selection into the health insurance. About forty percent of children had a mother who is enrolled in this insurance. The scheme significantly increased the proportion of pregnancies with at least four antenatal care visits with 7 percentage points and had a significant effect on attended deliveries (10 percentage points). Caesarean sections increased (6 percentage points) and the number of children born from an unwanted pregnancy decreased (7 percentage points). Insurance enrollment had almost no effect on child vaccinations. Among the poorest forty percent of the sample, the effects of the scheme on antenatal care and attended deliveries were similar. However, the effects of the scheme on caesarean sections were about half the size (3 percentage points) and the reduction in unwanted pregnancies was larger (10 percentage points) compared to the effects in the full sample. We conclude that in the first years of operation, the National Health Insurance Scheme had a modest impact on the use of antenatal and delivery care. This is important for other African countries currently introducing or considering a national health insurance as a means towards universal health coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2556157926,"Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral pandemic disease that is widespread in the tropical and subtropical areas. Dengue virus uses human mannose-binding receptor (MR) and DC-SIGN on macrophages as primary receptors, and CLEC5A as signaling receptor to sense the dengue virus invasion and then to signal and stimulate macrophages to secrete cytokines. But the interplay between MR/DC-SIGN and CLEC5A is unknown. Here we demonstrate a plausible mechanism for the interaction, i.e. MR/DC-SIGN first attracts the virus with high avidity, and the virus concurrently interacts with CLEC5A in close proximity to form a multivalent hetero-complex and facilitate CLEC5A-mediated signal transduction. Our study suggests that the cooperation between a high-avidity lectin-virus interaction and a nearby low-avidity signaling receptor provides a necessary connection between binding and signaling. Understanding this mechanism may lead to the development of a new antiviral strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2551678781,"Risk assessment of congestive heart failure (CHF) is essential for detection, especially helping patients make informed decisions about medications, devices, transplantation, and end-of-life care. The majority of studies have focused on disease detection between CHF patients and normal subjects using short-/long-term heart rate variability (HRV) measures but not much on quantification. We downloaded 116 nominal 24-hour RR interval records from the MIT/BIH database, including 72 normal people and 44 CHF patients. These records were analyzed under a 4-level risk assessment model: no risk (normal people, N), mild risk (patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-II, P1), moderate risk (patients with NYHA III, P2), and severe risk (patients with NYHA III-IV, P3). A novel multistage classification approach is proposed for risk assessment and rating CHF using the non-equilibrium decision-tree–based support vector machine classifier. We propose dynamic indices of HRV to capture the dynamics of 5-minute short term HRV measurements for quantifying autonomic activity changes of CHF. We extracted 54 classical measures and 126 dynamic indices and selected from these using backward elimination to detect and quantify CHF patients. Experimental results show that the multistage risk assessment model can realize CHF detection and quantification analysis with total accuracy of 96.61%. The multistage model provides a powerful predictor between predicted and actual ratings, and it could serve as a clinically meaningful outcome providing an early assessment and a prognostic marker for CHF patients."
https://openalex.org/W2553174556,"Objectives It has been reported that low skeletal muscle mass correlates with knee osteoarthritis in obese individuals. This study aimed to investigate whether lower limb skeletal muscle mass is independently associated with knee osteoarthritis in the general population. Materials and Methods This cross-sectional study used public data from the Fourth and Fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Subjects included 4924 community-dwelling adults aged ≥50 years (821 subjects with knee osteoarthritis and 4,103 controls). Skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) was calculated from the appendicular skeletal muscle mass measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Independent effects of total and lower limb SMI values on knee osteoarthritis were determined using odds ratios (OR) adjusted for age, sex, obesity, total femur bone mineral density, serum vitamin D level, diabetes mellitus status, and physical activity on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results The adjusted logistic regression model revealed that older age, female sex, and obesity were significantly associated with knee osteoarthritis. A higher serum vitamin D level was also positively correlated with knee osteoarthritis (OR, 1.015; 95% CI, 1.003–1.027; P = 0.010). Although total SMI was not significantly associated with knee osteoarthritis (OR, 0.976; 95% CI, 0.946–1.007; P = 0.127), a low lower limb SMI had an independent effect on knee osteoarthritis (OR, 0.941; 95% CI, 0.900–0.983; P = 0.006). Conclusions Low skeletal muscle mass in the lower limbs but not in the whole body was independently associated with knee osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2550620362,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important viral pathogen of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI). Limited data are available on molecular epidemiology of RSV from Saudi Arabia. A total of 130 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children less than 5 years of age with ARI symptoms attending the Emergency Department at King Khalid University Hospital and King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between October and December, 2014. RSV was identified in the 26% of the hospitalized children by reverse transcriptase PCR. Group A RSV (77%) predominated during the study as compared to group B RSV (23%). The phylogenetic analysis of 28 study strains clustered group A RSV in NA1 and ON1 genotypes and group B viruses in BA (BA9) genotype. Interestingly, 26% of the positive samples clustered in genotypes with duplication in the G protein gene (ON1 for group A and BA for group B). Both the genotypes showed enhanced O-linked glycosylation in the duplicated region, with 10 and 2 additional sites in ON1 and BA respectively. Selection pressure analysis revealed purifying selection in both the ON1 and BA genotypes. One codon each in the ON1 (position 274) and BA genotypes (position 219) were positively selected and had high entropy values indicating variations at these amino acid positions. This is the first report describing the presence of ON1 genotype and the first report on co-circulation of two different genotypes of RSV with duplication in the G protein gene from Saudi Arabia. The clinical implications of the simultaneous occurrence of genotypes with duplication in G protein gene in a given population especially in the concurrent infections should be investigated in future. Further, the ongoing surveillance of RSV in this region will reveal the evolutionary trajectory of these two genotypes with duplication in G protein gene from largest country in the Middle East."
https://openalex.org/W2553963831,"Understanding the genetic, molecular and evolutionary basis of cysteine-stabilized antifungal proteins (AFPs) from fungi is important for understanding whether their function is mainly defensive or associated with fungal growth and development. In the current study, a transcriptome meta-analysis of the Aspergillus niger γ-core protein AnAFP was performed to explore co-expressed genes and pathways, based on independent expression profiling microarrays covering 155 distinct cultivation conditions. This analysis uncovered that anafp displays a highly coordinated temporal and spatial transcriptional profile which is concomitant with key nutritional and developmental processes. Its expression profile coincides with early starvation response and parallels with genes involved in nutrient mobilization and autophagy. Using fluorescence- and luciferase reporter strains we demonstrated that the anafp promoter is active in highly vacuolated compartments and foraging hyphal cells during carbon starvation with CreA and FlbA, but not BrlA, as most likely regulators of anafp. A co-expression network analysis supported by luciferase-based reporter assays uncovered that anafp expression is embedded in several cellular processes including allorecognition, osmotic and oxidative stress survival, development, secondary metabolism and autophagy, and predicted StuA and VelC as additional regulators. The transcriptomic resources available for A. niger provide unparalleled resources to investigate the function of proteins. Our work illustrates how transcriptomic meta-analyses can lead to hypotheses regarding protein function and predict a role for AnAFP during slow growth, allorecognition, asexual development and nutrient recycling of A. niger and propose that it interacts with the autophagic machinery to enable these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2552175069,"Viperin is an endoplasmic reticulum-associated antiviral responsive protein that is highly up-regulated in eukaryotic cells upon viral infection through both interferon-dependent and independent pathways. Viperin is predicted to be a radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) enzyme, but it is unknown whether viperin actually exploits radical SAM chemistry to exert its antiviral activity. We have investigated the interaction of viperin with its most firmly established cellular target, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS). Numerous enveloped viruses utilize cholesterol-rich lipid rafts to bud from the host cell membrane, and it is thought that by inhibiting FPPS activity (and therefore cholesterol synthesis), viperin retards viral budding from infected cells. We demonstrate that, consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of viperin in human embryonic kidney cells reduces the intracellular rate of accumulation of FPPS but does not inhibit or inactivate FPPS. The endoplasmic reticulum-localizing, N-terminal amphipathic helix of viperin is specifically required for viperin to reduce cellular FPPS levels. However, although viperin reductively cleaves SAM to form 5′-deoxyadenosine in a slow, uncoupled reaction characteristic of radical SAM enzymes, this cleavage reaction is independent of FPPS. Furthermore, mutation of key cysteinyl residues ligating the catalytic [Fe4S4] cluster in the radical SAM domain, surprisingly, does not abolish the inhibitory activity of viperin against FPPS; indeed, some mutations potentiate viperin activity. These observations imply that viperin does not act as a radical SAM enzyme in regulating FPPS.

https://openalex.org/W2549820613,"""Perioceutics"" including antimicrobial therapy and host modulatory therapy has emerged as a vital adjunctive treatment of periodontal disease. Melatonin level was significantly reduced in patients with periodontal diseases suggesting melatonin could be applied as a potential ""perioceutics"" treatment of periodontal diseases. This study aims to investigate the effects of melatonin receptor agonists (melatonin and ramelteon) on Porphyromonas gingivalis virulence and Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS)-induced inflammation.Effects of melatonin receptor agonists on Porphyromonas gingivalis planktonic cultures were determined by microplate dilution assays. Formation, reduction, and viability of Porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms were detected by crystal violet staining and MTT assays, respectively. Meanwhile, biofilms formation was also observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The effects on gingipains and hemolytic activities of Porphyromonas gingivalis were evaluated using chromogenic peptides and sheep erythrocytes. The mRNA expression of virulence and iron/heme utilization was assessed using RT-PCR. In addition, cell viability of melatonin receptor agonists on human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) was evaluated by MTT assays. After pretreatment of melatonin receptor agonists, HGFs were stimulated with Pg-LPS and then release of cytokines (IL-6 and lL-8) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Melatonin and ramelteon did exhibit antimicrobial effects against planktonic culture. Importantly, they inhibited biofilm formation, reduced the established biofilms, and decreased biofilm viability of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Furthermore, they at sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) concentrations markedly inhibited the proteinase activities of gingipains and hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner. They at sub-MIC concentrations significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of virulence factors (kgp, rgpA, rgpB, hagA, and ragA), while increasing the mRNA expression of ferritin (ftn) or hemolysin (hem). They did not show obvious cytotoxicity toward HGFs. They inhibited Pg-LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion, which was reversed by luzindole, the melatonin receptor antagonist.Melatonin receptor agonists can inhibit planktonic and biofilm growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis by affecting the virulent properties, as well as Pg-LPS-induced inflammatory response. Our study provides new evidence that melatonin receptor agonists might be useful as novel ""perioceutics"" agents to prevent and treat Porphyromonas gingivalis-associated periodontal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2553016516,"Background Repeated CB1 binding due to THC results in downregulation of the endocannabinoid system in cortex and limbic regions, perhaps disrupting frontolimbic functioning. This is particularly a concern in young adults who are still undergoing neurodevelopment in frontal and limbic regions. Such disruptions may be linked to increased depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and executive dysfunction, and decreased behavioral approach. Objectives Here we examine the influence of young adult marijuana use on anxiety, depressive symptoms, behavioral approach, and executive dysfunction. The influence of alcohol and gender were also assessed. Methods 84 participants (42 MJ, 42 controls) aged 18–25 were balanced for gender (39 F). Exclusion criteria included: MRI contraindications, left handed, comorbid Axis-I disorders, major medical or neurologic disorders, prenatal issues, or prenatal alcohol/illicit drug exposure, or excessive other drug use. Participants completed the FrsBE, BIS/BAS, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (State), and BDI-II. Multiple regressions were run to predict anxiety, depressive symptoms, behavioral approach, and executive dysfunction from MJ group status, past year alcohol use, gender, and MJ*gender interactions, controlling for cotinine and ecstasy. Results MJ group predicted increased depressive symptoms (p =.049). Decreased fun-seeking (p =.04), reward response (p =.01), and BAS total (p =.01) were predicted by MJ group. Gender predicted decreased reward responsiveness in females (p =.049) and decreased BIS in females (p =.03). Female marijuana users had increased anxiety symptoms (p =.04) and increased disinhibition (p =.04). Increased cotinine predicted increased drive (p =.046), reward responsiveness (p =.008) and BAS Total (p =.02). Apathy and Executive Dysfunction were not predicted by any measures. All results had small effect sizes. Conclusions/Importance Depressive symptoms were greater in MJ users, while behavioral approach was decreased. Cotinine levels predicted increased behavioral approach. Female MJ users also had greater anxiety and disinhibition. In sum, these findings suggest sub-clinical threshold deficits related to regular marijuana use that are indicative of a need to prevent marijuana use in adolescents and young adults."
https://openalex.org/W2549356255,"We aimed at quantifying the extent to which agricultural management practices linked to animal production and land use affect environmental outcomes at a larger scale. Two practices closely linked to farm environmental performance at a larger scale are farming intensity, often resulting in greater off-farm environmental impacts (land, non-renewable energy use etc.) associated with the production of imported inputs (e.g. concentrates, fertilizer); and the degree of self-sufficiency, i.e. the farm’s capacity to produce goods from its own resources, with higher control over nutrient recycling and thus minimization of losses to the environment, often resulting in greater on-farm impacts (eutrophication, acidification etc.). We explored the relationship of these practices with farm environmental performance for 185 French specialized dairy farms. We used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling to build, and relate, latent variables of environmental performance, intensification and self-sufficiency. Proxy indicators reflected the latent variables for intensification (milk yield/cow, use of maize silage etc.) and self-sufficiency (home-grown feed/total feed use, on-farm energy/total energy use etc.). Environmental performance was represented by an aggregate ‘eco-efficiency’ score per farm derived from a Data Envelopment Analysis model fed with LCA and farm output data. The dataset was split into two spatially heterogeneous (bio-physical conditions, production patterns) regions. For both regions, eco-efficiency was significantly negatively related with milk yield/cow and the use of maize silage and imported concentrates. However, these results might not necessarily hold for intensive yet more self-sufficient farms. This requires further investigation with latent variables for intensification and self-sufficiency that do not largely overlap- a modelling challenge that occurred here. We conclude that the environmental ‘sustainability’ of intensive dairy farming depends on particular farming systems and circumstances, although we note that more self-sufficient farms may be preferable when they may benefit from relatively low land prices and agri-environment schemes aimed at maintaining grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W2549499583,"How the hypothalamus transmits hunger information to other brain regions to govern whole brain function to orchestrate feeding behavior has remained largely unknown. Our present study suggests the importance of a recently found lateral hypothalamic neuropeptide, QRFP, in this signaling. Qrfp-/- mice were hypophagic and lean, and exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior, and were hypoactive in novel circumstances as compared with wild type littermates. They also showed decreased wakefulness time in the early hours of the dark period. Histological studies suggested that QRFP neurons receive rich innervations from neurons in the arcuate nucleus which is a primary region for sensing the body's metabolic state by detecting levels of leptin, ghrelin and glucose. These observations suggest that QRFP is an important mediator that acts as a downstream mediator of the arcuate nucleus and regulates feeding behavior, mood, wakefulness and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2555282473,"Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are the enzymes responsible for posttranslational methylation of protein arginine residues in eukaryotic cells, particularly within the histone tails. A detailed mechanistic model of PRMT-catalyzed methylation is currently lacking, but it is essential for understanding the functions of PRMTs in various cellular pathways and for efficient design of PRMT inhibitors as potential treatments for a range of human diseases. In this work, we used stopped-flow fluorescence in combination with global kinetic simulation to dissect the transient kinetics of PRMT1, the predominant type I arginine methyltransferase. Several important mechanistic insights were revealed. The cofactor and the peptide substrate bound to PRMT1 in a random manner and then followed a kinetically preferred pathway to generate the catalytic enzyme-cofactor-substrate ternary complex. Product release proceeded in an ordered fashion, with peptide dissociation followed by release of the byproduct S-adenosylhomocysteine. Importantly, the dissociation rate of the monomethylated intermediate from the ternary complex was much faster than the methyl transfer. Such a result provided direct evidence for distributive arginine dimethylation, which means the monomethylated substrate has to be released to solution and rebind with PRMT1 before it undergoes further methylation. In addition, cofactor binding involved a conformational transition, likely an open-to-closed conversion of the active site pocket. Further, the histone H4 peptide bound to the two active sites of the PRMT1 homodimer with differential affinities, suggesting a negative cooperativity mechanism of substrate binding.

It is unclear how people think about privacy in the context of these emerging health technologies. An open question is whether early adopters of these advances conceptualize privacy in different ways than non-early adopters.This study sought to understand privacy attitudes of early adopters of emerging health technologies.Transcripts from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with early adopters of genome sequencing and health devices and apps were analyzed with a focus on participant attitudes and perceptions of privacy. Themes were extracted using inductive content analysis.Although interviewees were willing to share personal data to support scientific advancements, they still expressed concerns, as well as uncertainty about who has access to their data, and for what purpose. In short, they were not dismissive of privacy risks. Key privacy-related findings are organized into four themes as follows: first, personal data privacy; second, control over personal information; third, concerns about discrimination; and fourth, contributing personal data to science.Early adopters of emerging health technologies appear to have more complex and nuanced conceptions of privacy than might be expected based on their adoption of personal health technologies and participation in open science. Early adopters also voiced uncertainty about the privacy implications of their decisions to use new technologies and share their data for research. Though not representative of the general public, studies of early adopters can provide important insights into evolving attitudes toward privacy in the context of emerging health technologies and personal health data research."
https://openalex.org/W2554603764,"Background Vascular access failure is a huge burden for patients undergoing hemodialysis. Many efforts have been made to maintain vascular access patency, including pharmacotherapy. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and calcium channel blocker (CCB) are known for their antihypertensive and cardio-protective effects, however, their effects on long-term vascular access patency are still inconclusive. Design, setting, participants and measurements We retrospectively enrolled patients commencing maintenance hemodialysis between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2006 by using National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Primary patency was defined as the date of first arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG) creation to the time of access thrombosis or any intervention aimed to maintain or re-establish vascular access patency. Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust the influences of patient characteristics, co-morbidities and medications. Results Total 42244 patients were enrolled in this study, 37771 (89.4%) used AVF, 4473 (10.6%) used AVG as their first long term dialysis access. ACE-I, ARB, and CCB use were all associated with prolonged primary patency of AVF [hazard ratio (HR) 0.586, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.557–0.616 for ACE-I use; HR 0.532, CI 0.508–0.556 for ARB use; HR 0.485, CI 0.470–0.501 for CCB use] and AVG (HR 0.557, CI 0.482–0.643 for ACE-I use, HR 0.536, CI 0.467–0.614 for ARB use, HR 0.482, CI 0.442–0.526 for CCB use). Conclusions In our analysis, ACE-I, ARB, and CCB were strongly associated with prolonged primary patency of both AVF and AVG. Further prospective randomized studies are still warranted to prove the causality."
https://openalex.org/W2554733659,"D-dimer level in cancer patients is associated with risk of venous thromboembolism and deep venous thrombosis. Most cancer patients have ""abnormal"" D-dimer levels based on the current normal reference range. To investigate tumor-specific D-dimer reference range, we compared D-dimer levels for nine different tumour types with healthy controls by using simultaneous quantile regression and constructing a median, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile model of normal tumour D-dimer concentration. Associations with tumour primary site, stage, pathological type, and treatment were also explored. Additionally, 190 patients were tracked to reveal the relevance of initial D-dimer levels to cancer prognosis. D-dimer ranges (median, 5th, 95th) in various cancers (mg/L) were: liver 1.12, 0.27, 5.25; pancreatic 0.96, 0.23, 4.81; breast 0.44, 0.2, 2.17; gastric 0.65, 0.22, 5.03; colorectal 0.73, 0.22, 4.45; lung 0.7, 0.25, 4.0; gynaecological 0.61, 0.22, 3.98; oesophageal 0.23, 0.7, 3.45; and head and neck 0.22, 0.44, 2.19. All were significantly higher than that of healthy controls (0.18, 0.07, 0.57). D-dimer peaked 1-2 days postoperatively but had decreased to the normal range by 1 week. Additionally, cancer patients with high initial D-dimer were shown a tendency of poor prognosis in survival rate. In conclusion, D-dimer levels in cancer depend on patient age, tumour primary site, and tumour stage. Thrombosis prevention is necessary if D-dimer has not decreased to the tumor-specific baseline a week after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2555857721,"Background Due to their increased vulnerability, immigrants are considered a priority group for communicable disease prevention and control in Europe. This study aims to compare influenza vaccination coverage (IVC) between regular immigrants and Italian citizens at risk for its complications and evaluate factors affecting differences. Methods Based on data collected by the National Institute of Statistics during a population-based cross-sectional survey conducted in Italy in 2012–2013, we analysed information on 42,048 adult residents (≥ 18 years) at risk for influenza-related complications and with free access to vaccination (elderly residents ≥ 65 years and residents with specific chronic diseases). We compared IVC between 885 regular immigrants and 41,163 Italian citizens using log-binomial models and stratifying immigrants by area of origin and length of stay in Italy (recent: < 10 years; long-term: ≥ 10 years). Results IVC among all immigrants was 16.9% compared to 40.2% among Italian citizens (vaccination coverage ratio (VCR) = 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36–0.49). Adjusting for sex, age and area of residence, this difference was greatly reduced but remained statistically significant (VCR = 0.71, 95 CI: 0.61–0.81). Further adjustment for socio-economic factors (education, occupation, family composition and economic status) and a composite indicator of health-services utilization did not affect the difference (VCR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.68–0.90). However, after adjustments, only long-term immigrants from Africa (VCR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.28–0.85) and recent immigrants (VCR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.43–0.78) showed a significantly different IVC compared to Italian citizens. Conclusions Differences in demographic characteristics, socio-economic conditions and health-services utilization explained the reduced IVC in most long-term immigrants compared to Italian citizens. By contrast, these differences did not explain the reduced IVC in long-term immigrants from Africa and recent immigrants. This suggests that IVC in these sub-groups is affected by other informal barriers (e.g., cultural and linguistic) that need to be investigated to promote effective immunization access strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2554238436,"Introduction There is accumulating evidence supporting the use of probiotics, which are defined as “live micro-organisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host”, as a preventive measure against respiratory tract infections (RTI). Two recent meta-analyses showed probiotic consumption (daily intake of 107 to 1010 CFU in any form for up to 3 months) significantly reduced RTI duration, frequency, antibiotic use and work absenteeism. Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the impact of probiotic use in terms of number of RTI episodes and days averted, and the number of antibiotic prescriptions and missed workdays averted, in the general population of Canada. In addition, the corresponding economic impact from both a healthcare payer and a productivity perspective was estimated. Methods A microsimulation model was developed to reproduce the Canadian population (sample rate of 1/1000 = 35 540 individuals) employing age and gender. RTI incidence was taken from FluWatch consultation rates for influenza-like illness (2013–14) and StatCan all-cause consultations statistics. The model was calibrated on a 2.1% RTI annual incidence in the general population (5.2 million RTI days) and included known risk factors (smoking status, shared living conditions and vaccination status). RTI-related antibiotic prescriptions and work absenteeism were obtained from the literature. Results The results indicate that probiotic use saved 573 000–2.3 million RTI-days, according to the YHEC–Cochrane scenarios respectively. These reductions were associated with an avoidance of 52 000–84 000 antibiotic courses and 330 000–500 000 sick-leave days. A projection of corresponding costs reductions amounted to Can$1.3–8.9 million from the healthcare payer perspective and Can$61.2–99.7 million when adding productivity losses. Conclusion The analysis shows that the potential of probiotics to reduce RTI-related events may have a substantial clinical and economic impact in Canada."

The enzyme in conjunction with Pah1 PA phosphatase controls the levels of PA and DAG for the synthesis of triacylglycerol and membrane phospholipids, the growth of the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and the formation of lipid droplets. Little is known about how DAG kinase activity is regulated by posttranslational modification. In this work, we examined the phosphorylation of Dgk1 DAG kinase by casein kinase II (CKII). When phosphate groups were globally reduced using nonspecific alkaline phosphatase, Triton X-100-solubilized membranes from DGK1-overexpressing cells showed a 7.7-fold reduction in DAG kinase activity; the reduced enzyme activity could be increased 5.5-fold by treatment with CKII. Dgk1(1–77) expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli was phosphorylated by CKII on a serine residue, and its phosphorylation was dependent on time as well as on the concentrations of CKII, ATP, and Dgk1(1–77). We used site-specific mutagenesis, coupled with phosphorylation analysis and phosphopeptide mapping, to identify Ser-45 and Ser-46 of Dgk1 as the CKII target sites, with Ser-46 being the major phosphorylation site. In vivo, the S46A and S45A/S46A mutations of Dgk1 abolished the stationary phase-dependent stimulation of DAG kinase activity. In addition, the phosphorylation-deficient mutations decreased Dgk1 function in PA production and in eliciting pah1Δ phenotypes, such as the expansion of the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane, reduced lipid droplet formation, and temperature sensitivity.

https://openalex.org/W2552381738,"Recent advances in sensor technologies and predictive analytics are fueling the growth in point-of-care (POC) therapies for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other sleep disorders. The effectiveness of POC therapies can be enhanced by providing personalized and real-time prediction of OSA episode onsets. Previous attempts at OSA prediction are limited to capturing the nonlinear, nonstationary dynamics of the underlying physiological processes. This paper reports an investigation into heart rate dynamics aiming to predict in real time the onsets of OSA episode before the clinical symptoms appear. A prognosis method based on a nonparametric statistical Dirichlet-Process Mixture-Gaussian-Process (DPMG) model to estimate the transition from normal states to an anomalous (apnea) state is utilized to estimate the remaining time until the onset of an impending OSA episode. The approach was tested using three datasets including (1) 20 records from 14 OSA subjects in benchmark ECG apnea databases (Physionet.org), (2) records of 10 OSA patients from the University of Dublin OSA database and (3) records of eight subjects from previous work. Validation tests suggest that the model can be used to track the time until the onset of an OSA episode with the likelihood of correctly predicting apnea onset in 1 min to 5 mins ahead is 83.6 ± 9.3%, 80 ± 8.1%, 76.2 ± 13.3%, 66.9 ± 15.4%, and 61.1 ± 16.7%, respectively. The present prognosis approach can be integrated with wearable devices, enhancing proactive treatment of OSA and real-time wearable sensor-based of sleep disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2553008515,"This study investigated the contribution of shrimp stocks in supporting the production of valuable predator species. Fishery-independent data on white shrimp, brown shrimp, and selected fish species (spotted seatrout, red drum, and southern flounder) were collected from 1986 to 2014 by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, and converted to catch-per-unit effort (CPUE). Here, the associations between the CPUEs of fish species as predators and those of shrimp species as prey in each sampled bay and sampling season were analyzed using co-integration analysis and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Co-integration analysis revealed significant associations between 31 of 70 possible fish/shrimp pairings. The analysis also revealed discernible seasonal and spatial patterns. White shrimp in August and brown shrimp in May were associated with fish CPUEs in bays located along the lower coast of Texas, whereas white shrimp in November was more strongly associated with fish CPUEs in bays located on the upper coast. This suggests the possible influence of latitudinal environmental gradient. The results of the PLSR, on the other hand, were not conclusive. This may reflect the high statistical error rates inherent to the analysis of short non-stationary time series. Co-integration is a robust method when analyzing non-stationary time series, and a majority of time series in this study was non-stationary. Based on our co-integration results, we conclude that the CPUE data show significant associations between shrimp abundance and the three predator fish species in the tested regions."

We examined the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori seropositivity and interleukin-1 polymorphisms between ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome patients.We recruited consecutive acute coronary syndrome patients, and 101 non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome patients and 103 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients were enrolled. Interleukin-1 polymorphism analyses were performed for single nucleotide polymorphism in interleukin-1 beta-511 and the variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism in the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist by polymerase chain reaction. Immunoglobulin G antibodies against Helicobacter pylori and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were also measured.The rates of the simultaneous presence of interleukin-1 polymorphisms and Helicobacter pylori-seropositivity between non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction groups were 25.7% and 42.7%, respectively (P = 0.012). Helicobacter pylori-seropositive subjects with interleukin-1 polymorphisms showed significantly higher levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (0.04-0.12 vs. 0.02-0.05; P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the carriage of Helicobacter pylori-seropositivity and interleukin-1 polymorphisms was significantly associated with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-4.37; P = 0.009). The C-statistic of conventional risk factors was 0.68 (P<0.001) and that including Helicobacter pylori-seropositivity and interleukin-1 polymorphisms was 0.70 (P<0.001); continuous net reclassification improvement was 34% (P = 0.0094) and integrated discrimination improvement was 3.0% (P = 0.014).The coincidence of Helicobacter pylori-seropositivity and interleukin-1 polymorphisms was significantly associated with higher levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein and the increased risk of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2555531475,"Background Gallstones (GS) associated diseases are among the most recurrent and frequent diseases delineated in India and United Arab Emirates. Several reports suggest that the association of GS with gallbladder cancer (GBC) is very high in Northern part of India; however, its occurrence in UAE and Southern part of India is notably low. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to perform compositional analysis of GS in three different geographical areas by Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Fourier Transformed Infrared spectroscopy. Methods Natural abundance 13C cross polarization magic angle spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy is employed for the analysis of human gallstone. Results Cholesterol, bilirubin and calcium carbonate were present in variant concentrations in GS obtained from three different geographical regions. Cholesterol was present predominantly in gallstones from North India. Bilirubin was found to be a main constituent in gallstones pertaining to South India. Whereas GS from UAE showed both cholesterol and bilirubin as their major constituents. Calcium carbonate was found in varying concentrations in gallstones acquired from different regions. Conclusion Variation in environmental condition and dietary habits may contribute and affect the GS formation. Alterations in bile composition influence the GB and augment the crystallization of cholesterol. Analysis of different geographical regions GS could be an important stride to understand the etiology of GS diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2552934564,"Epidemiological studies suggest that higher serum uric acid (sUA) level is significantly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) development. However, little information is available on the relationships between sUA and NAFLD remission. In the present study, 841 NAFLD males (30-75 years) were recruited from a Chinese prospective cohort study (PMMJS) and followed up for five years. The baseline sUA levels of participants were categorized into four quartiles: 191 μmol/L≤ sUA ≤ 347 μmol/L, 347 μmol/L < sUA ≤ 392 μmol/L, 392 μmol/L < sUA ≤ 441 μmol/L and 441 μmol/L<SUA≤676 μmol/L. As the results show, participants with elevated sUA levels at baseline were significantly associated with the decreased rate of NAFLD remission at the end of study (p<0.0001). After adjustment, RR (95%CI) for remitted NAFLD comparing Q1 to Q3 vs Q4 of sUA were 2.95 (1.49-5.83), 2.40 (1.22-4.73) and 1.39 (0.67-2.86), respectively. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis showed these significant associations were not affected even after exclusion of participants who had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, MetS and hyperlipidemia. Additionally, the presence of the lowest quartile of sUA levels was still significantly associated with remitted NAFLD when the study population was stratified according to the smoking, and the median values of age, ALT, AST, serum creatinine, HDL-C and LDL-C. Therefore, our present study extended the previous findings and suggested that modulation of sUA levels may attenuate the progression of NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2550861368,"Given that granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is identified as the key factor to endow auto-reactive Th cells with the potential to induce neuroinflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models, the frequency and phenotype of GM-CSF-producing (GM-CSF+) Th cells in draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and spinal cord (SC) of Albino Oxford (AO) and Dark Agouti (DA) rats immunized for EAE were examined. The generation of neuroantigen-specific GM-CSF+ Th lymphocytes was impaired in dLNs of AO rats (relatively resistant to EAE induction) compared with their DA counterparts (susceptible to EAE) reflecting impaired CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation and less supportive of GM-CSF+ Th cell differentiation dLN cytokine microenvironment. Immunophenotyping of GM-CSF+ Th cells showed their phenotypic heterogeneity in both strains and revealed lower frequency of IL-17+IFN-γ+, IL-17+IFN-γ-, and IL-17-IFN-γ+ cells accompanied by higher frequency of IL-17-IFN-γ- cells among them in AO than in DA rats. Compared with DA, in AO rats was also found (i) slightly lower surface density of CCR2 (drives accumulation of highly pathogenic GM-CSF+IFN-γ+ Th17 cells in SC) on GM-CSF+IFN-γ+ Th17 lymphocytes from dLNs, and (ii) diminished CCL2 mRNA expression in SC tissue, suggesting their impaired migration into the SC. Moreover, dLN and SC cytokine environments in AO rats were shown to be less supportive of GM-CSF+IFN-γ+ Th17 cell differentiation (judging by lower expression of mRNAs for IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-23/p19). In accordance with the (i) lower frequency of GM-CSF+ Th cells in dLNs and SC of AO rats and their lower GM-CSF production, and (ii) impaired CCL2 expression in the SC tissue, the proportion of proinflammatory monocytes among peripheral blood cells and their progeny (CD45hi cells) among the SC CD11b+ cells were reduced in AO compared with DA rats. Collectively, the results indicate that the strain specificities in efficacy of several mechanisms controlling (auto)reactive CD4+ lymphocyte expansion/differentiation into the cells with pathogenic phenotype and migration of the latter to the SC contribute to AO rat resistance to EAE."

However, the functional roles of ZHX1 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have not been determined. We investigated the expression and roles of ZHX1 during the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CCA cells. In silico analysis and immunohistochemical studies showed amplification and overexpression of ZHX1 in CCA tissues. Furthermore, ZHX1 knockdown using specific siRNAs decreased CCA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas ZHX1 overexpression promoted all three characteristics. In addition, results suggested EGR1 might partially mediate the effect of ZHX1 on the proliferation of CCA cells. Taken together, these results show ZHX1 promotes CCA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and present ZHX1 as a potential target for the treatment of CCA."
https://openalex.org/W2554691036,"We have reported a correlation between hypothalamic expression of Creb-binding protein (Cbp) and lifespan, and that inhibition of Cbp prevents protective effects of dietary restriction during aging, suggesting that hypothalamic Cbp plays a role in responses to nutritional status and energy balance. Recent GWAS and network analyses have also implicated Cbp as the most connected gene in protein-protein interactions in human Type 2 diabetes. The present studies address mechanisms mediating the role of Cbp in diabetes by inhibiting hypothalamic Cbp using a Cre-lox strategy. Inhibition of hypothalamic Cbp results in profound obesity and impaired glucose homeostasis, increased food intake, and decreased body temperature. In addition, these changes are accompanied by molecular evidence in the hypothalamus for impaired leptin and insulin signaling, a shift from glucose to lipid metabolism, and decreased Pomc mRNA, with no effect on locomotion. Further assessment of the significance of the metabolic switch demonstrated that enhanced expression of hypothalamic Cpt1a, which promotes lipid metabolism, similarly resulted in increased body weight and reduced Pomc mRNA."

Identification of cancer-specific epitopes or neoepitopes from cancer genomes is one of the major challenges in the field of immunotherapy or vaccine development. This paper describes a platform Cancertope, developed for designing genome-based immunotherapy or vaccine against a cancer cell. Broadly, the integrated resources on this platform are apportioned into three precise sections. First section explains a cancer-specific database of neoepitopes generated from genome of 905 cancer cell lines. This database harbors wide range of epitopes (e.g., B-cell, CD8+ T-cell, HLA class I, HLA class II) against 60 cancer-specific vaccine antigens. Second section describes a partially personalized module developed for predicting potential neoepitopes against a user-specific cancer genome. Finally, we describe a fully personalized module developed for identification of neoepitopes from genomes of cancerous and healthy cells of a cancer-patient. In order to assist the scientific community, wide range of tools are incorporated in this platform that includes screening of epitopes against human reference proteome (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/cancertope/)."
https://openalex.org/W2555716674,"RhoGDI proteins have been implicated in several human cancers; changes in their expression levels have shown pro- or anti-tumorigenic effects. Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a complex pathology, with poor prognosis, and most patients die shortly after diagnosis. Efforts have been focused on understanding the role of RhoGDI's in PDAC, specially, RhoGDI1 and RhoGDI2. However, the role of RhoGDI3 has not been studied in relation to cancer or to PDAC. Here, we characterized the expression and functionality of RhoGDI3 and its target GTPases, RhoG and RhoB in pancreatic cell lines from both normal pancreatic tissue and tissue in late stages of PDAC, and compared them to human biopsies. Through immunofluorescences, pulldown assays and subcellular fractionation, we found a reduction in RhoGDI3 expression in the late stages of PDAC, and this reduction correlates with tumor progression and aggressiveness. Despite the reduction in the expression of RhoGDI3 in PDAC, we found that RhoB was underexpressed while RhoG was overexpressed, suggesting that cancerous cells preserve their capacity to activate this pathway, thus these cells may be more eager to response to the stimuli needed to proliferate and become invasive unlike normal cells. Surprisingly, we found nuclear localization of RhoGDI3 in non-cancerous pancreatic cell line and normal pancreatic tissue biopsies, which could open the possibility of novel nuclear functions for this protein, impacting gene expression regulation and cellular homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2554496519,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a specific aerobic bacterium, but can survive under hypoxic conditions, such as those in lung cheese necrosis, granulomas, or macrophages. It is not clear whether the drug sensitivity and growth characteristics of MTB under hypoxic conditions are different from those under aerobic conditions. In this study, we examined the drug resistance and growth characteristics of MTB clinical isolates by a large sample of in vitro drug susceptibility tests, using an automatic growth instrument. Under hypoxic conditions, variance in drug resistance was observed in nearly one-third of the MTB strains and was defined as MTB strains with changed drug sensitivity (MTB-CDS). Among these strains, resistance in a considerable proportion of clinical strains was significantly increased, and some strains emerged as multi-drug resistant. Growth test results revealed a high growth rate and large survival number in macrophages under hypoxia in MTB-CDS. According to the results of fluorescence quantitative PCR, the expression of some genes, including RegX3 (involving RIF resistance), Rv0194 (efflux pump gene), four genes related to transcription regulation (KstR, DosR, Rv0081 and WhiB3) and gene related to translation regulation (DATIN), were upregulated significantly under hypoxic conditions compared to that under aerobic conditions (p < 0.05). Thus, we concluded that some MTB clinical isolates can survive under hypoxic conditions and their resistance could change. As for poor clinical outcomes in patients, based on routine drug susceptibility testing, drug susceptibility tests for tuberculosis under hypoxic conditions should also be recommended.

Analysis of the genome sequence of Fusarium graminearum revealed two paralogous LEU2 genes (designated as FgLEU2A and FgLEU2B) in this fungus and the deduced amino acid sequences of FgLeu2A and FgLeu2B share 45% identity. Targeted disruption of individual FgLEU2A/B gene in F. graminearum assigned a more crucial role of FgLeu2A in Leu biosynthesis as disruption of FgLEU2A resulted in mutant (ΔFgLeu2A-10) that was Leu-auxotrophic and could not grow in minimal medium limited for amino acids, whereas FgLEU2B deletion mutant ΔFgLeu2B-2 was morphologically indistinguishable from the wild type strain PH-1. The growth defects of ΔFgLeu2A-10 could be overcome by exogenous addition of Leu at 0.25 mM. Double deletion of FgLEU2A and FgLEU2B (ΔFgLeu2AB-8) caused a more severe Leu-auxotrophic phenotype as the concentration of Leu exogenously added to medium to rescue the growth defect of ΔFgLeu2AB-8 should be raised to 1.25 mM, indicating a less important but nonnegligible role of FgLeu2B in Leu biosynthesis. Disturb of Leu biosynthesis caused by FgLEU2A deletion leads to slower growth rate, reduced aerial hyphal formation and red pigmentation on PDA plates and completely blocked conidial production and germination. All of the defects above could be overcome by Leu addition or complementation of the full-length FgLEU2A gene. ΔFgLeu2A-10 also showed significantly increased sensitivity to osmotic and oxidative stresses. Pathogenicity assay results showed that virulence of mutants lacking FgLEU2A were dramatically impaired on wheat heads and non-host cherry tomatoes. Additionally, a low level of deoxynivalenol (DON) production of ΔFgLeu2A-10 and ΔFgLeu2AB-8 in wheat kernels was also detected. Taken together, results of this study indicated a crucial role of FgLeu2A and a less important role of FgLeu2B in Leu biosynthesis and fungal infection-related morphogenesis in F. graminearum and FgLeu2A may serve as a potential target for novel antifungal development."
https://openalex.org/W2553024667,"For ensemble learning, how to select and combine the candidate classifiers are two key issues which influence the performance of the ensemble system dramatically. Random vector functional link networks (RVFL) without direct input-to-output links is one of suitable base-classifiers for ensemble systems because of its fast learning speed, simple structure and good generalization performance. In this paper, to obtain a more compact ensemble system with improved convergence performance, an improved ensemble of RVFL based on attractive and repulsive particle swarm optimization (ARPSO) with double optimization strategy is proposed. In the proposed method, ARPSO is applied to select and combine the candidate RVFL. As for using ARPSO to select the optimal base RVFL, ARPSO considers both the convergence accuracy on the validation data and the diversity of the candidate ensemble system to build the RVFL ensembles. In the process of combining RVFL, the ensemble weights corresponding to the base RVFL are initialized by the minimum norm least-square method and then further optimized by ARPSO. Finally, a few redundant RVFL is pruned, and thus the more compact ensemble of RVFL is obtained. Moreover, in this paper, theoretical analysis and justification on how to prune the base classifiers on classification problem is presented, and a simple and practically feasible strategy for pruning redundant base classifiers on both classification and regression problems is proposed. Since the double optimization is performed on the basis of the single optimization, the ensemble of RVFL built by the proposed method outperforms that built by some single optimization methods. Experiment results on function approximation and classification problems verify that the proposed method could improve its convergence accuracy as well as reduce the complexity of the ensemble system."
https://openalex.org/W2549506383,"Anthropogenic habitat deterioration can promote changes in plant mating systems that subsequently may affect progeny performance, thereby conditioning plant recruitment for the next generation. However, very few studies yet tested mating system parameters other than outcrossing rates; and the direct effects of the genetic diversity of the pollen received by maternal plants (i.e. correlated paternity) has often been overlooked. In this study, we investigated the relation between correlated paternity and progeny performance in two common Mediterranean shrubs, Myrtus communis and Pistacia lentiscus. To do so, we collected open-pollinated progeny from selected maternal plants, calculated mating system parameters using microsatellite genotyping and conducted sowing experiments under greenhouse and field conditions. Our results showed that some progeny fitness components were negatively affected by the high correlated paternity of maternal plants. In Myrtus communis, high correlated paternity had a negative effect on the proportion and timing of seedling emergence in the natural field conditions and in the greenhouse sowing experiment, respectively. In Pistacia lentiscus, seedling emergence time under field conditions was also negatively influenced by high correlated paternity and a progeny survival analysis in the field experiment showed greater mortality of seedlings from maternal plants with high correlated paternity. Overall, we found effects of correlated paternity on the progeny performance of Myrtus communis, a self-compatible species. Further, we also detected effects of correlated paternity on the progeny emergence time and survival in Pistacia lentiscus, an obligate outcrossed species. This study represents one of the few existing empirical examples which highlight the influence that correlated paternity may exert on progeny performance in multiple stages during early seedling growth."

Till now, most Indian studies have looked at the individual level determinants of complementary feeding practices. We aimed to evaluate the association of frontline worker (FLW) provided nutritional counselling services, with change in community level indicators of complementary feeding practices among 9-11 month old children over time.The study data was obtained from five rounds of 'Lot Quality Assurance Sampling' survey in eight districts of Bihar, an impoverished Indian state. The surveys were conducted as evaluation exercises for the 'Integrated Family Health Initiative (IFHI)'-a multi-faceted program aimed at improving the maternal and child health outcomes in Bihar. The main outcome indicators were-current breastfeeding, age-appropriate minimum frequency of semi-solid food, age-appropriate minimum quantity of semi-solid food, initiation of complementary feeding at the right age, and dietary diversity. Repeated measures analysis was performed to determine the association of changes in the outcome indicators with coverage of FLW-provided counselling services.Visits by FLW, advices on age-appropriate frequency and handwashing were significant predictors of receiving age-appropriate frequency of feeding. The determinants of receiving age-appropriate quantity were-advices on age appropriate frequency and advices on handwashing. Receiving food support from AWC and FLW visits were significantly associated with initiating complementary feeding at the right age.The present study identified the critical elements among the different types of FLW-provided services. The study findings, from an economically and socially underdeveloped region of India, would inform the relevant programs about the nutritional counselling services that need to be emphasized upon for reducing the burden of childhood malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2554420172,"Sperm lysozyme-like proteins belonging to c-type lysozyme family evolved in multiple forms. Lysozyme-like proteins, viz., LYZL2, LYZL3 or SLLP1, LYZL4, LYZL5 and LYZL6 are expressed in the testis of mammals. Not all members of LYZL family have been uniformly and unambiguously identified in the genome and proteome of mammals. Some studies suggested a role of SLLP1 and LYZL4 in fertilization; however, the function of other LYZL proteins is unknown. We identified all known forms of LYZL proteins in buffalo sperm by LC-MS/MS. Cloning and sequence analysis of the Lyzl cDNA showed 38-50% identity at amino acid level among the buffalo LYZL paralogs, complete conservation of eight cysteines and other signature sequences of c-type lysozyme family. Catalytic residues in SLLP1, LYZL4 and LYZL5 have undergone replacement. The substrate binding residues showed significant variation in LYZL proteins. Residues at sites 62, 101, 114 in LYZL4; 101 in SLLP1; 37, 62, and 101 in LYZL6 were more variable among diverse species. Sites 63 and 108 occupied by tryptophan were least tolerant to variation. Site 37 also showed lower tolerance to substitution in SLLP1, LYZL4 and LYZL5, but more variable in non-testicular lysozymes. Models of LYZL proteins were created by homology modeling and the substrate binding pockets were analyzed in term of binding energies and contacting residues of LYZL proteins with tri-N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)3 in the A-B-C and B-C-D binding mode. Except LYZL6, LYZL proteins did not show significant difference in binding energies in comparison to hen egg white lysozyme in the A-B-C mode. (NAG)3 binding energy in the B-C-D mode was higher by 1.3-2.2 kcal/mol than in A-B-C mode. Structural analysis indicated that (NAG)3 was involved in making more extensive interactions including hydrogen bonding with LYZL proteins in B-C-D mode than in A-B-C mode. Despite large sequence divergence among themselves and with respect to c-type lysozymes, substrate binding residues as well as hydrogen bonding network between (NAG)3 and proteins were mostly conserved. LYZL5 in buffalo and other mammalian species contained additional 10-12 amino acid sequence at c-terminal that matched with ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 27. Phylogenetic analysis indicated LYZL2 to be most ancient among all the LYZL proteins and that the evolution of LYZL proteins occurred through several gene duplications preceding the speciation of mammals from other vertebrates as distant as reptiles and amphibians."

The majority of the reads (70%) in the round and elongated spermatids were mappable to known and predicted exons, but that in sperm was only 9%. The results of the distribution of reads suggested that alternative splicing was more complicated in sperm than in round and elongated spermatids. In the 19,127 genes, we detected the expression of 5,104 de novo genes and 91,112 alternative splicing events, and 12,105 were differentially expressed. Gene ontology (GO), InterPro domains, and KEGG revealed changes in gene transcription, mitochondrial protein translation, cellular components, and energy metabolism during spermiogenesis.

Here we describe their binding site using computational modeling, binding, and functional studies on WT and mutated CCR5. The metal ion Zn2+ is anchored to the chemokine receptor-conserved Glu-283VII:06/7.39. Both chelators interact with aromatic residues in the transmembrane receptor domain.

The impact of Trp-248 was further confirmed by ZnClTerp, a chloro-substituted version of ZnTerp that showed no inherent agonism but maintained positive allosteric modulation of CCL3 binding. Despite a similar overall binding mode of all three metal ion chelator complexes, the pyridine ring of ZnClTerp blocks the conformational switch of Trp-248 required for receptor activation, thereby explaining its lack of activity. Importantly, ZnClTerp becomes agonist to the same extent as ZnTerp upon Ala mutation of Ile-116III:16/3.40, a residue that constrains the Trp-248 microswitch in its inactive conformation.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The human chemokine system additionally comprises around 50 endogenous chemokine ligands, which together with their receptors organize leukocyte trafficking. A chemokine receptor can have several chemokine ligands, and a single chemokine can bind to several receptors, properties that confer redundancy to the system (1.Bachelerie F. Ben-Baruch A.

Rev. 2014; 66: 1-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). At the same time, the system's components are spatially and temporally organized and characterized by receptor, ligand, and tissue bias (2.Amarandi R.-M. Hjortø G.M. Rosenkilde M.M. Karlshøj S. Probing biased signaling in chemokine receptors.Methods Enzymol. 2016; 570: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3.Steen A. Larsen O. Thiele S. Rosenkilde M.M. Biased and G protein-independent signaling of chemokine receptors.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 277Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), implying that a chemokine interacting with a given receptor in a certain tissue in fact relays a very specific and non-redundant signal (4.Proudfoot A.E.I. Bonvin P. Power C.A. Targeting chemokines: Pathogens can, why can't we?.Cytokine. 2015; 74: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The chemokine system is investigated as a target for treating acute and chronic inflammations, allergies, and autoimmune diseases but also for cancer growth and metastasis, angiogenesis, and HIV infection (5.Viola A. Luster A.D. Chemokines and their receptors: drug targets in immunity and inflammation.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 171-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Chemokines are 8–12-kDa large peptides that are divided into four groups according to the position of conserved cysteines: CC-chemokines (25 members), CXC-chemokine (18 members), XC-chemokines (XCL1 and XCL2), and CX3CL1 (1.Bachelerie F. Ben-Baruch A. Burkhardt A.M. Combadiere C. Farber J.M. Graham G.J. Horuk R. Sparre-Ulrich A.H. Locati M. Luster A.D. Mantovani A. Matsushima K. Murphy P.M. Nibbs R.

Rev. 2014; 66: 1-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). These cysteines form disulfide bridges with cysteines in the chemokine core domain, which itself consists of an N-loop, a three-stranded β-sheet, and a C-terminal α-helix. The N-terminal residues in front of the first cysteine thereby remain unstructured and flexible (6.Allen S.J. Crown S.E. Handel T.M. Chemokine: receptor structure, interactions, and antagonism.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 787-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Recently, two crystal structures of chemokine receptors in complex with a chemokine ligand were revealed: CXCR4 in complex with the viral chemokine vMIP-II (7.Qin L. Kufareva I. Holden L.G. Wang C. Zheng Y. Zhao C. Fenalti G. Wu H. Han G.W. Cherezov V. Abagyan R. Stevens R.C. Handel T.M. Structural biology: crystal structure of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in complex with a viral chemokine.Science. 2015; 347: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and the viral chemokine receptor US28 in complex with CX3CL1 (8.Burg J.S.

Structural biology: structural basis for chemokine recognition and activation of a viral G protein-coupled receptor.Science. 2015; 347: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These structures confirmed the overall binding mode of chemokines to their receptors, whereby the chemokine core interacts with extracellular receptor domains, such as the receptor N terminus and extracellular loop (ECL) 2, whereas the flexible chemokine N terminus protrudes into the transmembrane receptor area. This agrees with the suggested “pseudo”-two-step model that roughly separates the chemokine-receptor interaction into an affinity-providing step 1 (chemokine core-extracellular receptor domains) and an activation-inducing step 2 (chemokine N terminus-transmembrane receptor domain) (9.Thiele S.

Furthermore, crystal structures of chemokine receptors with various ligands have been solved and show different binding sites for each ligand. In CXCR4, the small molecule antagonist IT1t binds to a site in the minor binding pocket (delimited by TM-1 to -3 and -7 (11.Rosenkilde M.M. Benned-Jensen T. Frimurer T.M. Schwartz T.W. The minor binding pocket: a major player in 7TM receptor activation.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2010; 31: 567-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)), whereas the peptide-based CVX15 binds in the major binding pocket (delimited by TM-3 to -7) (12.Wu B.

Structures of the CXCR4 chemokine GPCR with small-molecule and cyclic peptide antagonists.Science. 2010; 330: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Maraviroc in CCR5 spans the major and minor binding pockets (13.Tan Q. Zhu Y. Li J. Chen Z. Han G.W. Kufareva I. Li T. Ma L. Fenalti G. Li J. Zhang W. Xie X. Yang H. Jiang H. Cherezov V. et al.Structure of the CCR5 chemokine receptor-HIV entry inhibitor maraviroc complex.Science. 2013; 341: 1387-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), as suggested for many other small molecule CC-chemokine receptor antagonists (14.Rosenkilde M.M. Schwartz T.W. GluVII:06: a highly conserved and selective anchor point for non-peptide ligands in chemokine receptors.Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A comparison of the binding modes of small molecules and chemokines shows that an overlap in binding sites may arise within the transmembrane receptor domain, which is targeted by the chemokine N termini and the small molecule ligands to varying extents. Thus, although small molecules traditionally are considered to bind allosterically to the larger orthosteric chemokine ligands (15.Scholten D.J. Canals M. Maussang D. Roumen L. Smit M.J. Wijtmans M. de Graaf C. Vischer H.F. Leurs R. Pharmacological modulation of chemokine receptor function.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 165: 1617-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), they might in fact overlap with the chemokine N terminus. A chemokine-dependent allosteric behavior of small molecules has, for example, been shown in CCR1. There, the binding of CCL3 was enhanced by the small molecule agonists metal ion chelator complexes, highlighting an allosteric binding mode, whereas another chemokine, CCL5, was displaced with equimolar affinities (16.Jensen P.C. Thiele S. Ulven T. Schwartz T.W. Rosenkilde M.M. Positive versus negative modulation of different endogenous chemokines for CC-chemokine receptor 1 by small molecule agonists through allosteric versus orthosteric binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23121-23128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CCL5 and the metal ion chelator complexes were affected by the same transmembrane receptor mutations, pointing to an overlap in binding sites that results in the observed competitive binding pattern for CCL5 and the small molecules. It has furthermore been discussed whether an allosteric binding mode should be pursued in the development of chemokine receptor antagonists. In general, although allosteric binding allows for the modulation of a chemokine-mediated response, and thereby depends on the presence and level of the chemokine, it might not confer strong enough antagonism to reach clinical efficacy (15.Scholten D.J. Canals M. Maussang D. Roumen L. Smit M.J. Wijtmans M. de Graaf C. Vischer H.F. Leurs R. Pharmacological modulation of chemokine receptor function.Br. J.

More knowledge about the molecular pharmacology of chemokine receptors and their signaling outcomes under healthy and pathological conditions is therefore needed to design ligand- and receptor-specific or broad inhibitors or allosteric modulators with distinct signaling properties.

Here we investigate the binding mode of agonistic allosteric modulators to CCR5. We have previously described the metal ion chelator complex ZnBip (Zn2+ in complex with 2,2′-bipyridine) as a small molecule agonist and allosteric enhancer of CCL3 binding to CCR5 (and CCR1) but a competitor for CCL5 binding (16.Jensen P.C.

By screening 20 chelator analogs, we identified ZnTerp (Zn2+ in complex with 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine), which acts more strongly than ZnBip in both agonistic activity and allosteric modulation, and ZnClTerp (Zn2+ in complex with 4′-chloro-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine), which was a pure allosteric enhancer of CCL3 binding but did not activate CCR5 (22.Thiele S. Malmgaard-Clausen M. Engel-Andreasen J. Steen A. Rummel P.C. Nielsen M.C. Gloriam D.E. Frimurer T.M. Ulven T. Rosenkilde M.M. Modulation in selectivity and allosteric properties of small-molecule ligands for CC-chemokine receptors.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 8164-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We also investigate the structural basis for agonistic and allosteric properties in CCR5. We use computational modeling to predict the binding sites of the metal ion chelator complexes and confirm these in vitro by receptor activation and 125I-CCL3 binding assays in 23 receptor mutants. We thereby describe the molecular mechanism for small molecule-mediated activation and allosteric modulation in CCR5. As shown previously, ZnTerp is a very efficacious agonist at CCR5 with a higher potency than ZnBip when measuring inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation in transiently transfected COS-7 cells expressing CCR5 and the chimeric G protein GαΔ6qi4myr (Gqi4myr) that translates a Gαi coupling to a Gαq readout (Fig. 1, A and B, and Table 1) (22.Thiele S. Malmgaard-Clausen M. Engel-Andreasen J. Steen A. Rummel P.C. Nielsen M.C. Gloriam D.E. Frimurer T.M. Ulven T. Rosenkilde M.M. Modulation in selectivity and allosteric properties of small-molecule ligands for CC-chemokine receptors.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 8164-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As expected, the agonistic activity of both metal ion chelator complexes depends on complex formation between the chelator and Zn2+. To test the ligands' ability to induce Gαi activation more directly (in the absence of the chimeric G protein), we measured cAMP production in CHO cells stably transfected with CCR5 (Fig. 1, D–F), which were induced to produce cAMP with forskolin. The chemokines CCL3 and CCL5 inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP production (i.e. they induced Gαi activation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase) (Fig. 1D). Also, ZnBip acted as an agonist through this pathway with a potency of 4.6 μm (Fig. 1E); the level of this activity depended on complex formation between Bip and Zn2+ (Fig. 1F). Similarly, we observed a specific activity of CCL3, CCL5, and ZnBip in a Ca2+-imaging assay in the same cells (Fig. 1, G–I).TABLE 1Activation of CCR5 and mutant receptors by CCL3, CCL5, ZnBip and ZnTerpView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Like ZnBip, ZnTerp was previously shown to act as an allosteric enhancer of CCL3 binding to CCR5 with an affinity (Ki) higher than that of ZnBip (Fig. 1C) (22.Thiele S.

A third high affinity ligand exists for CCR5, namely CCL4, which is more closely related to CCL3 than to CCL5. Homologous competition binding experiments revealed a KD of 1.4 nm for CCL4 (Fig. 2, A and B), and consistent with the closer structural homology between CCL3 and CCL4, CCL3 displaced 125I-CCL4 with high affinity (Ki of 3.7 nm (i.e. very similar to the Kd of 4.5 nm; see Table 2)), whereas CCL5 was not able to displace CCL4 with high affinity (Ki of 0.13 μm) (Fig. 2C). None of the metal ion chelator complexes enhanced the binding of 125I-CCL4 (Fig. 2, D–F) to the same extent as the binding of 125I-CCL3 (Fig. 1C). In fact, they acted oppositely, with weak displacement for ZnBip (Ki value of 290 μm) and weak enhanced binding for ZnTerp, with a Ki of 1.8 μm and maximal enhancement of 160% (compared with 670% for CCL3) (Fig. 2, D and E, respectively). Thus, consistent with previous observations (16.Jensen P.C. Thiele S. Ulven T. Schwartz T.W. Rosenkilde M.M.

Due to their agonistic nature, we built an active-like CCR5 model in MODELLER using the crystal structure of the constitutively active chemokine receptor US28 (PDB entry 4XT1) (Fig. 3, A–C). In comparison with the inactive CCR5 crystal structure in complex with maraviroc (PDB entry 4MBS), our model shows conformational changes and active-like characteristics; the extracellular part of TM-1 is moved slightly toward TM-7, the extracellular part of TM-2 is slightly tilted away from TM-1, ECL-1 is tilted further outward, ECL-3 is tilted further inward, and most characteristically for the active-like conformation, the intracellular part of TM-6 is tilted away from the center of the TM-bundle (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, all binding pocket residues are slightly altered in their position, and a tighter aromatic interaction is observed between Tyr-108III:08/3.32, Phe-109III:09/3.33, and Phe-112III:12/3.36 in TM-3. Furthermore, the side chains of Tyr-244VI:09/6.44, Trp-248VI:13/6.48, and Tyr-251VI:16/6.51 in TM-6 are rotated slightly downward toward the intracellular receptor side (Fig. 3C) (the residue position according to the Baldwin-Schwartz and Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering system is given in superscript the first time a residue is mentioned (23.Schwartz T.W.

A water molecule is positioned in the minor binding pocket and bridges Tyr-37I:08/1.39, Tyr-108, Glu-283, and the Zn2+ ion. Both Bip and Terp dock to the same area and largely overlap in their binding sites. Importantly, the major binding pocket of CCR5 becomes very narrow between Tyr-108, Phe-109, and Tyr-251 before extending to a small lower cavity bordered by Phe-112 and Trp-248. The additional pyridine ring of Terp protrudes into this lower cavity of the major binding pocket (Fig. 3D). Both Bip and Terp make van der Waals contacts with Tyr-108, Phe-109, and Tyr-251 in the major binding pocket, π-π stacking with Tyr-37 and Trp-86II:20/2.60 in the minor binding pocket, and cation-π interactions with Arg-168Cys-10 in ECL-2a. Terp additionally interacts with Phe-112 and Trp-248 deep in the major binding pocket (Fig. 3, D–F). The modeling suggested two alternative poses for Terp in CCR5, one with all three nitrogen atoms coordinated to Zn2+ and another with pyridyl in the lower cavity rotated away from Zn2+. This prompted us to investigate the need for a tridentate interaction. To this end, Terp analogues were synthesized with the terminal pyridyl shifted to the meta- (mTerp) or para-position (pTerp) (25.Zhao L.-X. Sherchan J. Park J.K. Jahng Y. Jeong B.-S. Jeong T.C.

Thus, all analogues were unable to form a tridentate complex with Zn2+ but otherwise as closely as possible preserved the features of Terp. The potency of each of the Terp analogues on CCR5 in complex with Zn2+ was determined in the IP3 assay described above (Fig. 4). None of the three Terp analogues gave a significant effect alone. In complex with Zn2+, mTerp exhibited a tendency toward weak agonism at 100 μm, pTerp was inactive, and PhBip showed inverse agonism at 100 μm. Thus, the results strongly support a tridentate complex of Terp with Zn2+. To validate the predicted binding conformations of ZnBip and ZnTerp, we performed ligand-mapping experiments with a library comprising 23 receptor mutants (Fig. 5). We first assessed the cell surface expression of each mutant by an ELISA technique with antibodies against a FLAG tag inserted in the N terminus. We then assessed the ability of the endogenous chemokines CCL3 and CCL5 and the metal ion chelator complexes ZnBip and ZnTerp to activate each mutant receptor in an assay measuring IP3 in COS-7 cells transiently expressing the mutants and the chimeric G protein, Gqi4myr (Table 1). Finally, homologous competition binding experiments with 125I-CCL3 were performed (Table 2; for controls and homologous curves, see supplemental Fig. 1). Most of the mutants showed WT-like cell surface expression, except F79A, F112A, Y244A, and W248A, which showed absent (F79A and F112A) or highly reduced (Y244A and W248A) surface expression (Table 1). These mutants were also characterized by impaired signaling properties. F79A and W248A could not be activated by any ligand. Y244A could not be activated by CCL3 or CCL5 but could be activated by ZnBip (Table 1), and F112A showed highly reduced efficacy for all ligands (not shown). F112A, Y244A, and W248A, but not F79A, bound CCL3, albeit with reduced Bmax values (Table 2). Thus, F79A is a completely disintegrated receptor, Ala substitution of Trp-248 results in a non-signaling receptor, and Y244A selectively impairs chemokine-induced signaling. The remaining mutants only selectively impaired the signaling properties of single ligands, which verifies the general integrity of our mutant library and allows for validation of the proposed ZnBip and ZnTerp binding site. In addition to the above-mentioned residues important for receptor integrity and chemokine-mediated activation (Phe-79, Phe-112, Tyr-244, and Trp-248), we found the potency of CCL3 and CCL5 to be impaired by Y37A in TM-1 and by D276A and Q277A in TM-7. Interestingly, CCL5 depended to a smaller degree on Y37A (5.9-fold reduced potency) than CCL3 (>15-fold reduced potency). A potency decrease for CCL5, but not CCL3, was also observed for E283A and G286F (Table 1). Thus, through this screen, we identified receptor residues commonly used by both CCL3 and CCL5 and residues used by each chemokine distinctly. Computational modeling suggested ZnBip to interact with Tyr-108, Phe-109, and Tyr-251 in the major binding pocket and Tyr-37 and Trp-86 in the minor binding pocket (Fig. 3). Mutagenesis of aromatic residues in the major and minor binding pocket indeed supports this binding mode (Fig. 5, A–C). Thus, Y"

The molecular mechanisms of postnatal heart development remain largely unexplored despite their important clinical implications. To gain an integrated view of the dynamic changes in gene expression during postnatal heart development at the organ level, time-series transcriptome analyses of the postnatal hearts of neonatal through adult mice (P1, P7, P14, P30, and P60) were performed using a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline. We identified functional gene clusters by principal component analysis with self-organizing map clustering which revealed organized, discrete gene expression patterns corresponding to biological functions associated with the neonatal, juvenile and adult stages of postnatal heart development. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis with bootstrap inference for each of these functional gene clusters, highly robust hub genes were identified which likely play key roles in regulating expression of co-expressed, functionally linked genes. Additionally, motivated by the role of the transcription factor Sox6 in the functional maturation of skeletal muscle, the role of Sox6 in the postnatal maturation of cardiac muscle was investigated. Differentially expressed transcriptome analyses between Sox6 knockout (KO) and control hearts uncovered significant upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation at postnatal day 7 (P7) in the Sox6 KO heart. This result was validated by detecting mitotically active cells in the P7 Sox6 KO heart. The current report provides a framework for the complex molecular processes of postnatal heart development, thus enabling systematic dissection of the developmental regression observed in the stressed and failing adult heart."
https://openalex.org/W2557010050,"Dopamine as a neurotransmitter plays a critical role in the functioning of the central nervous system. The structure of D3 receptor as a member of class A G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been reported. We used MD simulation to investigate the effect of an oscillating electric field, with frequencies in the range 0.6-800 GHz applied along the z-direction, on the dopamine-D3R complex. The simulations showed that at some frequencies, the application of an external oscillating electric field along the z-direction has a considerable effect on the dopamine-D3R. However, there is no enough evidence for prediction of changes in specific frequency, implying that there is no order in changes. Computing the correlation coefficient parameter showed that increasing the field frequency can weaken the interaction between dopamine and D3R and may decrease the Arg128{3.50}-Glu324{6.30} distance. Because of high stability of α helices along the z-direction, applying an oscillating electric field in this direction with an amplitude 10-time higher did not have a considerable effect. However, applying the oscillating field at the frequency of 0.6 GHz along other directions, such as X-Y and Y-Z planes, could change the energy between the dopamine and the D3R, and the number of internal hydrogen bonds of the protein. This can be due to the effect of the direction of the electric field vis-à-vis the ligands orientation and the interaction of the oscillating electric field with the dipole moment of the protein."

Prospective study included runners of both sexes (n = 52) and age and gender matched controls (n = 57), without classical cardiovascular risk factors. Ventricular hypertrophy was quantified by echocardiography by linear method and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) by 2-D images obtained by ultrasonography. Endothelial function was evaluated by flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Steroid hormones were quantified by HPLC followed by LC-MS/MS. Higher left ventricular (LV) mass index was found in male athletes (p<0.0001 vs. other groups). When adjusted for gender, the degree of left ventricular mass index classified as mildly, moderately or severely abnormal was obtained in 26%, 35%, and 30%, respectively, of female athletes, and in 39%, 14%, and 21%, respectively, of male athletes. Higher ratio of the early (E) to late (A) ventricular filling velocities was found in athletes of both genders. Male athletes presented lower cIMT in the right (p = 0.012 vs. male controls) and left (p<0.0001 vs. male controls) common carotid arteries, without differences in cIMT between female athletes and controls. FMD results were similar among groups. Higher serum testosterone levels were found in male athletes (p<0.0001 vs. other groups) and they were correlated with LV mass (r = 0.50, p<0.0001). The chronic exposure of high-intensity training among professional runners of both genders was associated with increased ventricular mass and adaptive remodeling. Less subclinical atherosclerosis was found in male athletes. Differences in steroid hormones may account in part for these findings."

Receptor-specific desensitization provides a mechanism of effector modulation by restricting the spatiotemporal activation of signaling components downstream of Gq. We quantified signaling events downstream of GqPCR activation with FRET-based biosensors in CHO and HEK 293 cells. KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels (IKs) were measured as a functional readout of receptor-specific activation. Activation of muscarinic M1 receptors (M1-Rs) caused robust and reversible inhibition of IKs. In contrast, activation of α1B-adrenergic receptors (α1B-ARs) induced transient inhibition of IKs, which turned into delayed facilitation after agonist withdrawal. As a novel finding, we demonstrate that GqPCR-specific kinetics of IKs modulation are determined by receptor-specific desensitization, evident at the level of Gαq activation, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) depletion, and diacylglycerol production.

More recent data (reviewed in Ref. 2.Hubbard K.B. Hepler J.R. Cell signalling diversity of the Gqα family of heterotrimeric G proteins.Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) indicate that the linear pathway from GqPCR activation to Gq-induced PLC stimulation is inadequate to explain the broad range of (sometimes divergent) cellular responses. Functional diversity upon stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors might reflect differential coupling to Gαq family members, different Gq efficacies for PLCβ activation, or activation of pathways independently of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Furthermore, receptor-specific targeting of effector molecules has been shown to depend on the spatial proximity of GqPCR and effector protein (e.g. an ion channel) and on the mobility of signal molecules in the plasma membrane (3.Cho H.

Apart from spatial organization of signaling components, temporal aspects of receptor activation or G protein-effector interactions determine receptor-specific kinetics of GqPCR signaling. Diversity of GPCR-induced cellular effects might result from activation of multiple G proteins with varying efficacy and kinetics, inducing either fast cellular responses of limited extent through one type of G protein or a slow, but extended response through another (14.Masuho I.

Signal. 2015; 8: ra123Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, as reviewed in Ref. 15.Bodmann E.-L. Wolters V. Bünemann M. Dynamics of G protein effector interactions and their impact on timing and sensitivity of G protein-mediated signal transduction.Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2015; 94: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, the affinity of activated G protein subunits to their specific effectors and their interaction kinetics determine the equilibrium of active and inactive trimeric G proteins and the dynamics of the G protein cycle. Receptor-specific desensitization might provide a mechanism of effector modulation by restricting the spatiotemporal activation of downstream Gq signaling components. Receptor desensitization in the continuous presence of an agonist terminates the responsiveness of a cell by limiting second messenger formation. A recent study, investigating the role of PKC activation in regulating TRPC6 channel activity, provides evidence that desensitization of the histamine H1 receptor reduces TRPC6 channel activity by rapid termination of DAG production (16.Chen X. Egly C. Riley A.M. Li W. Tewson P. Hughes T.E. Quinn A.M. Obukhov A.G. PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the H1 histamine receptor modulates TRPC6 activity.Cells. 2014; 3: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, whether receptor species-dependent differences in desensitization determine the time course of channel modulation during stimulation of distinct GqPCRs has not been elucidated. Rapid termination of second messenger production by receptor desensitization delimits activation of downstream effector proteins. Thus, it is conceivable that receptor desensitization reduces the efficiency to activate certain effector proteins but favors activation of other branches of Gq signaling pathways with either faster activation kinetics or higher second messenger affinity. In the present study, we quantitatively analyzed signaling events downstream of distinct GqPCRs by means of FRET-based biosensors in a stable KCNQ1/KCNE1-transfected CHO cell line and in HEK 293 cells. IKs amplitude during GqPCR stimulation was measured as a functional readout of receptor species-dependent activation of Gq effectors. Our study demonstrates for the first time significant receptor-dependent differences in the time course of Gq protein activation, DAG production (as a prerequisite of PKC activation), and PIP2 hydrolysis upon stimulation of either adrenergic α1B or muscarinic M1 receptors. These fundamental differences are attributed to different time courses of receptor desensitization and, as a consequence, induce different time courses of IKs modulation. Our data provide evidence that receptor-specific desensitization controls PIP2 reduction and recruitment of different PKC isoforms, thus resulting in different modes of fine-tuning of IKs activity. Activation of GqPCRs can be measured and quantified by using a FRET-based biosensor that monitors the Gq protein cycle (17.Falkenburger B.H. Jensen J.B. Hille B. Kinetics of M1 muscarinic receptor and G protein signaling to phospholipase C in living cells.J. Gen. Physiol. 2010; 135: 81-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The expression of the Gq protein biosensor and either the α1B-AR or M1-R in HEK 293 cells allowed us to compare receptor species-dependent temporal properties of Gq protein activation. As illustrated by the representative recordings in Fig. 1, A and D, increasing concentrations of phenylephrine (Phe) or acetylcholine (ACh) (ranging from 0.1 nm to 1 μm) result in an incremental increase of Gq activation as monitored by the stepwise decrease of the FRET ratio. The decrease in the FRET ratio (ΔF) was normalized to ΔFmax (the FRET signal obtained during a single application of 1 μm Phe or ACh), yielding concentration-response curves for phenylephrine (α1B-AR)- and acetylcholine (M1-R)-induced Gq activation (Fig. 1, B and E). Based on the concentration-response curves (revealing EC50 values of 37 nm (Phe, α1B-AR) and 14 nm (ACh, M1-R)), we applied 1 μm Phe as a saturating agonist concentration for α1B-AR activation and 10 μm ACh for maximal M1-R-induced Gq activation. During sustained α1B-adrenergic receptor activation by phenylephrine, a gradual increase in the FRET ratio, i.e. a decline in Gq activation, was observed (Fig. 1C). The amount of desensitization was quantified by the ratio FRET30 s after peak/FRETpeak, indicating a reduction of the FRET ratio of 33 ± 4.5% (n = 8, Phe 1 μm) for the α1B-AR (see also supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, during stimulation of M1 receptors (n = 6, ACh 10 μm), the FRET ratio remained stable (Fig. 1F). It is conceivable that the receptor-specific differences in G protein activation reflect either different rates of desensitization of α1B and M1 receptors or less efficient coupling of α1B receptors to Gαq subunits as compared with M1 receptors. We therefore investigated whether receptor species-dependent differences occurred downstream of Gq activation, using FRET sensors for DAG formation and PIP2 depletion. To analyze receptor species-dependent aspects of signaling downstream of the Gq protein, we analyzed the time course of DAG formation in HEK cells expressing either α1B-AR or M1-R and the fluorescent biosensor DAGR. DAGR reports formation of DAG by an increase in FRET ratio, and the time course of DAG formation can be used to analyze the rate of receptor desensitization during agonist exposure (18.Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. A genetically encoded fluorescent reporter reveals oscillatory phosphorylation by protein kinase C.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The representative recordings in Fig. 2 show effects of GqPCR stimulation on DAG production during application of Phe (1 μm) and ACh (10 μm). Stimulation of both receptor species caused a comparable, rapid increase in FRET ratio, reflecting activation of PLC and formation of DAG at the plasma membrane. However, DAG production induced by α1B receptors rapidly decayed during stimulation (Fig. 2A), an effect that was not observed for the M1-R (Fig. 2B). The summarized data, expressed as the ratio FRET30 s after peak/FRETpeak in Fig. 2C, indicate a more than 50% reduction of the DAG signal during activation of α1B receptors. In contrast, during stimulation of M1 receptors, we observed only a 10% reduction in DAG. Receptor species-dependent differences in the time course of DAG reduction persisted across agonist concentrations. In the presence of nonsaturating agonist concentrations (e.g. 50 and 200 nm Phe and ACh), we observed a rapid decline of the DAG signal in α1B-AR-, but not in M1-R-expressing cells (see supplemental Fig. S2). The different time courses of DAG production in α1B- and M1-R-expressing HEK cells are likely to reflect receptor species-dependent differences in desensitization. Alternatively, differences in receptor expression levels may affect the time course of desensitization. If this would be the case, any changes of GqPCR expression levels, controlled by adjusting the amount of transfected cDNA, might either increase or decrease the rate of desensitization of M1 or α1B receptors. We therefore transfected HEK 293 cells with different amounts of receptor cDNA and subsequently monitored the time course of DAG formation during receptor stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2, D–I, neither increasing the expression level of M1 receptors nor decreasing the expression of α1B receptors significantly affected the receptor-specific desensitization properties. Temporal aspects of GqPCR signaling were further analyzed in CHO cells stably transfected with KCNQ1/KCNE1 and transiently transfected with either α1B or M1 receptors and the DAG sensor DAGR. We simultaneously measured DAG production and modulation of IKs amplitude as a functional readout of GqPCR activation. Previous studies have reported conflicting results on IKs modulation by different Gq-coupled receptor species. Both inhibition and activation of KCNQ channels have been reported (13.Matavel A. Lopes C.M. PKC activation and PIP2 depletion underlie biphasic regulation of IKs by Gq-coupled receptors.J. Mol. Cell.

Cardiol. 2015; 79: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Some of these receptor species-dependent differences in IKs modulation might be attributed to activation of different branches of downstream Gq signaling, e.g. enhanced PIP2 depletion or activation of different PKC isoforms. The representative recordings in Fig. 3 show the relation between GqPCR desensitization (assessed with the DAGR FRET signal) and IKs current amplitudes in simultaneous recordings. Application of Phe (1 μm) in α1B-AR-expressing cells resulted in IKs inhibition caused by depletion of membrane PIP2 (13.Matavel A. Lopes C.M. PKC activation and PIP2 depletion underlie biphasic regulation of IKs by Gq-coupled receptors.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2009; 46: 704-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), followed by a sustained increase in current amplitude after agonist withdrawal (Fig. 3, A and C). This delayed increase in current was lacking after M1-R stimulation. On the other hand, the initial inhibition of IKs during agonist application appeared to be more pronounced upon stimulation of M1 receptors as compared with α1B-adrenergic receptors (Fig. 3, A and C). The corresponding DAG dynamics in α1B-AR-expressing cells showed a rapid decline during agonist application and had almost returned to basal levels when the α1B-AR-induced IKs increase occurred (Fig. 3, B and D). In contrast, stimulation of M1 receptors induced a more pronounced IKs inhibition (about 30% of the initial current amplitude in the absence of agonist) as compared with stimulation of α1B receptors (about 15%, Fig. 3C). DAG production persisted in the presence of acetylcholine (Fig. 3, B and D), but failed to stimulate IKs after agonist withdrawal. (Fig. 3, A and C). These data suggest that receptor species-dependent differences in Gq effector signaling account for divergent IKs modulation, supporting the idea that desensitization of different receptor species determines temporal aspects of downstream Gq signaling pathways. Qualitatively, the temporal aspects of DAG formation during GqPCR activation are identical in CHO and HEK cells (compare representative traces in Figs. 2 and 3B; see also supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that different time courses of DAG production are receptor species-dependent, but independent of the cellular background. Moreover, if the receptor-specific time course of the DAG signal reflects intrinsic receptor properties, receptor species-dependent desensitization should be evident at other branches of the Gq signaling pathway, e.g. the level of PLC activation and depletion of membrane PIP2. We investigated the depletion of membrane PIP2 following α1B or M1 receptor stimulation in CHO and HEK cells by utilizing a biosensor that directly reports the depletion of membrane PIP2 during GqPCR/PLC activation with a decrease in FRET ratio (21.van der Wal J. Habets R. Várnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. Monitoring agonist-induced phospholipase C activation in live cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 22.Hertel F. Switalski A. Mintert-Jancke E. Karavassilidou K. Bender K. Pott L. Kienitz M.C. A genetically encoded tool kit for manipulating and monitoring membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in intact cells.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e20855Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As illustrated in a representative FRET recording in Fig. 4A, stimulation of α1B receptors in CHO cells caused a rapid decrease in FRET ratio, reflecting membrane PIP2 depletion. This α1B-AR-mediated depletion showed a biphasic time course: during application of phenylephrine (1 μm), FRET slowly decreased for about 20 s, followed by a rapid decay. Remarkably, the FRET ratio rapidly returned to baseline levels, indicating PIP2 replenishment during sustained receptor stimulation. In contrast, exposure of M1-R-transfected CHO cells to acetylcholine (10 μm) resulted in a fully reversible decrease in the FRET ratio (Fig. 4B) with a rapid onset of PIP2 depletion that was persistent in the presence of the agonist. Comparing membrane PIP2 depletion in HEK 293 cells during α1B and M1 receptor stimulation yielded analogous results, i.e. transient reduction and replenishment of PIP2 in the presence of phenylephrine and persistent PIP2 depletion during application of acetylcholine (Fig. 4, D and E). The summarized FRET30 s after peak/FRETpeak ratios in Fig. 4, C and F, indicate a reduction of 56% of the PIP2 signal in CHO cells and a reduction of 32% in HEK 293 cells during activation of α1B receptors and a minor reduction (less than 5%) during stimulation of M1 receptors in both cell types. To address whether internalization of the α1B receptor causes its fast desensitization, we analyzed the time courses of arrestin binding as well as of subsequent receptor internalization. Binding of arrestins represents the initial step to prime a GPCR for endocytosis. Of note, the recruitment of arrestins to the receptor prevents G protein binding (23.Luttrell L.M. Gesty-Palmer D. Beyond desensitization: physiological relevance of arrestin-dependent signaling.Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 305-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Thus, recruitment of arrestins could contribute to desensitization of Gq signaling. To estimate the kinetics of arrestin binding for stimulated α1B-ARs and M1-Rs, we used a FRET assay that monitors the recruitment of Turquoise-labeled β-arrestin to receptors that were labeled with YFP at their C terminus (Fig. 5A) (24.Krasel C. Bünemann M. Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. β-Arrestin binding to the β2-adrenergic receptor requires both receptor phosphorylation and receptor activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9528-9535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The biosensor revealed that recruitment of arrestin occurred fast and with similar kinetics for both receptor subtypes (Fig. 5, B and C). Therefore, arrestin binding cannot explain the differences in desensitization kinetics of both receptors. Furthermore, the internalization of α1B-AR during long-term exposure to Phe was even slower; in the absence of agonist, we observed a proper membrane localization of α1B-AR-YFP-IL3 (Fig. 5D, panel a). During exposure to 10 μm Phe, internalization of the receptor was evident by a reduction in plasma membrane fluorescence and formation of intracellular punctae, starting between 15 and 30 min of incubation time (Fig. 5D, panels d–g). This is in line with the time course for internalization of this receptor in a previous study (25.Castillo-Badillo J.A. Sánchez-Reyes O.B. Alfonzo-Méndez M.A. Romero-Ávila M.T. Reyes-Cruz G. García-Sáinz J.A. α1B-adrenergic receptors differentially associate with Rab proteins during homologous and heterologous desensitization.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0121165Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and is significantly slower (up to 15 min) than the time course of acute desensitization observed in our experiments (e.g. see Fig. 2 with complete desensitization of α1B receptors within 60 s of agonist application). These results confirm that neither recruitment of arrestins nor an internalization of the α1B-AR caused its acute desensitization. We further investigated recovery from α1B-AR desensitization by consecutive applications of phenylephrine (1 μm) with variable time intervals. The second Phe-induced DAG signal was normalized to the first DAG signal and plotted against recovery time (defined as the time interval between termination of the first DAG signal and increase of the second signal). As shown in Fig. 5E, up to 80% recovery of the DAG signal was achieved within 300 s. Although we did not determine the molecular mechanism of recovery from desensitization, its rapid time course excludes receptor endocytosis/recycling as the underlying mechanism. Thus, desensitization and recovery from desensitization are most likely related to direct modifications of the receptor protein, such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Receptor phosphorylation has been shown to be the earliest biochemical event in homologous and heterologous α1B receptor desensitization either by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) or by PKC (26.García-Sáinz J.A. Romero-Ávila M.T. Alcántara-Hernández R. Mechanisms involved in α1B-adrenoceptor desensitization.IUBMB Life. 2011; 63: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Both conventional PKC isoforms (cPKCs, Ca2+- and DAG-dependent) and novel PKC isoforms (nPKCs, DAG-dependent, but Ca2+-independent) are downstream effectors of Gq-coupled receptor signaling pathways (27.O-Uchi J. Sorenson J. Jhun B.S. Mishra J. Hurst S. Williams K. Sheu S.-S. Lopes C.M.B. Isoform-specific dynamic translocation of PKC by α1B-adrenoceptor stimulation in live cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2015; 465: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but their contribution to homologous desensitization of α1B-R is still undefined. We aimed to investigate the contribution of different PKC isoforms to homologous GqPCR desensitization either by isoform-specific pharmacological PKC inhibition or by manipulating PKC expression levels. In a first series of experiments, the contribution of PKC to homologous α1B receptor desensitization was analyzed in HEK cells cotransfected with α1B-AR and DAGR by application of the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine. In the continuous presence of staurosporine (100 nm, 2-h incubation time, with staurosporine in the recording solution), the acute phase of α1B receptor desensitization was completely abrogated (see the representative FRET recordings in Fig. 6, A and B). As indicated by the summarized data in Fig. 6G, comparing the ratio FRET30 s after peak/FRETpeak in the presence or absence of staurosporine, reduction of the DAG signal during agonist application was markedly diminished by staurosporine. Staurosporine is a nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor that does not discriminate between PKC isoforms.

The study aimed at evaluating early inflammatory effects and cellular safety of PLGA NPs, co-encapsulating ovalbumin (PLGA/OVA NPs), as a model antigen and the adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (PLGA/MPLA NPs) as an adjuvant, on primary canine macrophages. The PLGA NPs constructs were prepared following the emulsion-solvent evaporation technique and further physic-chemically characterized. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from canine whole blood by magnetic sorting and further cultured to generate macrophages. The uptake of PLGA NP constructs by macrophages was demonstrated by flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Macrophage viability and morphology were evaluated by trypan blue exclusion and light microscopy. Macrophages were immunophenotyped for the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II and gene expression of Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Interleukin-12 (IL-12p40), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were measured. The results showed that incubation of PLGA NP constructs with macrophages revealed effective early uptake of the PLGA NPs without altering the viability of macrophages. PLGA/OVA/MPLA NPs strongly induced TNF-α and IL-12p40 expression by macrophages as well as increase relative expression of MHC-I but not MHC-II molecules. Taken together, these results indicated that PLGA NPs with addition of MPLA represent a good model, when used as antigen carrier, for further, in vivo, work aiming to evaluate their potential to induce strong, specific, immune responses in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2554188938,"Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) has crucial role in the regulation of angiogenesis and ocular neovascularisation (NV). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between SDF1-3'G(801)A polymorphism and NV complications of retinal vein occlusion (RVO).130 patients with RVO (median age: 69.0, range 35-93 years; male/female- 58/72; 55 patients had central RVO, 75 patients had branch RVO) were enrolled in this study. In the RVO group, 40 (30.8%) patients were diagnosed with NV complications of RVO and 90 (69.2%) patients without NVs. The median follow up period was 40.3 months (range: 18-57 months). The SDF1-3'G(801)A polymorphism was detected by PCR-RFLP. Allelic prevalence was related to reference values obtained in the control group consisted of 125 randomly selected, age and gender matched, unrelated volunteers (median age: 68.0, range 36-95 years; male/female- 53/72). Statistical analysis of the allele and genotype differences between groups (RVO patients vs controls; RVO patients with NV vs RVO patients without NV) was determined by chi-squared test. P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Hardy-Weinberg criteria was fulfilled in all groups. The SDF1-3'G(801)A allele and genotype frequencies of RVO patients were similar to controls (SDF1-3'A allele: 22.3% vs 20.8%; SDF1-3'(801)AA: 5.4% vs 4.8%, SDF1-3'(801)GG: 60.8% vs 63.2%). The frequency of SDF1-3'(801)AA and SDF1-3'(801)GA genotypes, as well as the SDF1-3'(801)A allele frequency were higher in RVO patients with NV versus in patients without NV complication (SDF1-3'(801)AA+AG genotypes: 57.5% vs 31.1%, p = 0.008; SDF1-3'(801)A allele: 35.0% vs 16.7%, p = 0.002) or versus controls (SDF1-3'(801)AA+AG genotypes 57.5% vs 36.8%, p = 0.021; SDF1-3'(801)A allele: 35.0% vs 20.8% p = 0.01). Carrying of SDF1-3'(801)A allele increased the risk of neovascularisation complications of RVO by 2.69 (OR, 95% CI = 1.47-4.93).These findings suggest that carrying SDF1-3'(801)A allele plays a role in the development of neovascular complications in retinal vein occlusion."
https://openalex.org/W2555148163,"This study aimed to evaluate changes in tibial bone speed of sound (SOS) over time, in preterm and term infants during infancy, in addition to identifying factors influencing the development of tibial SOS during infancy. Preterm (n = 155) and term (n = 65) infants were enrolled in this study. Tibial bone SOS was measured using quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) on the left tibia of newborn infants after birth (within 7 days), at 1 month old, and then every 2 months until subjects were approximately 12–15 months old. Follow-up checks included anthropometric measurements and tibial bone SOS. Mean tibial bone SOS at birth was significantly higher in term infants (mean ± SD, 2968.5 ± 99.7 m/s) than in preterm infants (2912.2 ± 122.6 m/s). Values of follow-up tibial bone SOS declined for the first 4 months, and then increased gradually until 12–15 months old. This increasing trend was greater in preterm infants after 2 months of corrected age than in term infants. There were no significant differences by 12–15 months of age between preterm and term infants. A longitudinal mixed-effect model controlling for internal correlations and other covariates in the two groups showed that age and the SOS value at birth were important factors affecting the tibial bone SOS in both preterm and term newborn infants during infancy. There are significant differences in the pattern of change in tibial bone SOS values between preterm and term infants during the first 12–15 months of life. Age and SOS value at birth were important factors affecting the pattern of tibial bone SOS change in both preterm and term newborn infants during infancy."
https://openalex.org/W2549772721,"The historically developed practice of learning to play a music instrument from notes instead of by imitation or improvisation makes it possible to contrast two types of skilled musicians characterized not only by dissimilar performance practices, but also disparate methods of audiomotor learning. In a recent fMRI study comparing these two groups of musicians while they either imagined playing along with a recording or covertly assessed the quality of the performance, we observed activation of a right-hemisphere network of posterior superior parietal and dorsal premotor cortices in improvising musicians, indicating more efficient audiomotor transformation. In the present study, we investigated the detailed performance characteristics underlying the ability of both groups of musicians to replicate music on the basis of aural perception alone. Twenty-two classically-trained improvising and score-dependent musicians listened to short, unfamiliar two-part excerpts presented with headphones. They played along or replicated the excerpts by ear on a digital piano, either with or without aural feedback. In addition, they were asked to harmonize or transpose some of the excerpts either to a different key or to the relative minor. MIDI recordings of their performances were compared with recordings of the aural model. Concordance was expressed in an audiomotor alignment score computed with the help of music information retrieval algorithms. Significantly higher alignment scores were found when contrasting groups, voices, and tasks. The present study demonstrates the superior ability of improvising musicians to replicate both the pitch and rhythm of aurally perceived music at the keyboard, not only in the original key, but also in other tonalities. Taken together with the enhanced activation of the right dorsal frontoparietal network found in our previous fMRI study, these results underscore the conclusion that the practice of improvising music can be associated with enhanced audiomotor transformation in response to aurally perceived music."
