https://openalex.org/W2022034337,"Paraquat (PQ(2+)) is a prototypic toxin known to exert injurious effects through oxidative stress and bears a structural similarity to the Parkinson disease toxicant, 1-methyl-4-pheynlpyridinium. The cellular sources of PQ(2+)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, specifically in neuronal tissue, remain to be identified. The goal of this study was to determine the involvement of brain mitochondria in PQ(2+)-induced ROS production. Highly purified rat brain mitochondria were obtained using a Percoll density gradient method. PQ(2+)-induced hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production was measured by fluorometric and polarographic methods. The production of H(2)O(2) was evaluated in the presence of inhibitors and modulators of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The results presented here suggest that in the rat brain, (a) mitochondria are a principal cellular site of PQ(2+)-induced H(2)O(2) production, (b) PQ(2+)-induced H(2)O(2) production requires the presence of respiratory substrates, (c) complex III of the electron transport chain is centrally involved in H(2)O(2) production by PQ(2+), and (d) the mechanism by which PQ(2+) generates H(2)O(2) depends on the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential. These observations were further confirmed by measuring PQ(2+)-induced H(2)O(2) production in primary neuronal cells derived from the midbrain. These findings shed light on the mechanism through which mitochondria may contribute to ROS production by other environmental and endogenous redox cycling agents implicated in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1969371042,"Amplification and overexpression of the miR-17-92 microRNAs (miRNA) cluster at 13q31.3 has recently reported, with pointers to functional involvement in the development of B-cell lymphomas and lung cancers. In the present study, we show that inhibition of miR-17-5p and miR-20a with antisense oligonucleotides (ONs) can induce apoptosis selectively in lung cancer cells overexpressing miR-17-92, suggesting the possibility of ‘OncomiR addiction’ to expression of these miRNAs in a subset of lung cancers. In marked contrast, antisense ONs against miR-18a and miR-19a did not exhibit such inhibitory effects, whereas inhibition of miR-92-1 resulted in only modest reduction of cell growth, showing significant distinctions among miRNAs of the miR-17-92 cluster in terms of their roles in cancer cell growth. During the course of this study, we also found that enforced expression of a genomic region, termed C2, residing 3′ to miR-17-92 in the intron 3 of C13orf25 led to marked growth inhibition in association with double stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase activation. Finally, this study also revealed that the vast majority of C13orf25 transcripts are detected as Drosha-processed cleavage products on Northern blot analysis and that a novel polyadenylation site is present 3′ to the miR-17-92 cluster and 5′ to the C2 region. Taken together, the present findings contribute towards better understanding of the oncogenic roles of miR-17-92, which might ultimately lead to the future translation into clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2033400446,"Germline LKB1 mutations cause Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, a hereditary disorder that predisposes to gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis and several types of malignant tumors. Somatic LKB1 alterations are rare in sporadic cancers, however, a few reports showed the presence of somatic alterations in a considerable fraction of lung cancers. To determine the prevalence and the specificity of LKB1 alterations in lung cancers, we examined a large number of lung cancer cell lines and lung adenocarcinoma (AdC) specimens for the alterations. LKB1 genetic alterations were frequently detected in the cell lines (21/70, 30%), especially in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) (20/51, 39%), and were significantly more frequent in cell lines with KRAS mutations. Point mutations were detected only in AdCs and large cell carcinomas, whereas homozygous deletions were detected in all histological types of lung cancer. Among lung AdC specimens, LKB1 mutations were found in seven (8%) of 91 male smokers but in none of 64 females and/or nonsmokers, and were significantly more frequent in poorly differentiated tumors. The difference in the frequency of LKB1 alterations between cell lines and tumor specimens was likely to be owing to masking of deletions by the contamination of noncancerous cells in the tumor specimens. These results indicate that somatic LKB1 genetic alterations preferentially occur in a subset of poorly differentiated lung AdCs that appear to correlate with smoking males."
https://openalex.org/W2033296826,"Natural killer cells are an important component of the innate immune system. Anti-cancer therapies utilizing monoclonal antibodies also rely on the cytotoxicity of NK cells for their effectiveness. Here, we study the dynamics of NK cell cytotoxicity.We observe that IL-2 activated human NK cells can serially hit multiple targets. Using functional assays, we demonstrate that on an average, a single IL-2 activated NK cell can kill four target cells. Data using live video microscopy suggest that an individual NK cell can make serial contacts with multiple targets and majority of contacts lead to lysis of target cells. Serial killing is associated with a loss of Perforin and Granzyme B content. A large majority of NK cells survive serial killing, and IL-2 can replenish their granular stock and restore the diminished cytotoxicity of 'exhausted' NK cells. IL-2 and IL-15 are equally effective in enhancing the killing frequency of resting NK cells. Significantly, Rituximab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody increases the killing frequency of both resting and IL-2 activated NK cells.Our data suggest that NK cell-based therapies for overcoming tumors rely on their serial killing ability. Therefore, strategies augmenting the killing ability of NK cells can boost the immune system and enhance the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2042524059,"Background Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (a-CGH) is a powerful molecular cytogenetic tool to detect genomic imbalances and study disease mechanism and pathogenesis. We report our experience with the clinical implementation of this high resolution human genome analysis, referred to as Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA). Methods and Findings CMA was performed clinically on 2513 postnatal samples from patients referred with a variety of clinical phenotypes. The initial 775 samples were studied using CMA array version 4 and the remaining 1738 samples were analyzed with CMA version 5 containing expanded genomic coverage. Overall, CMA identified clinically relevant genomic imbalances in 8.5% of patients: 7.6% using V4 and 8.9% using V5. Among 117 cases referred for additional investigation of a known cytogenetically detectable rearrangement, CMA identified the majority (92.5%) of the genomic imbalances. Importantly, abnormal CMA findings were observed in 5.2% of patients (98/1872) with normal karyotypes/FISH results, and V5, with expanded genomic coverage, enabled a higher detection rate in this category than V4. For cases without cytogenetic results available, 8.0% (42/524) abnormal CMA results were detected; again, V5 demonstrated an increased ability to detect abnormality. Improved diagnostic potential of CMA is illustrated by 90 cases identified with 51 cryptic microdeletions and 39 predicted apparent reciprocal microduplications in 13 specific chromosomal regions associated with 11 known genomic disorders. In addition, CMA identified copy number variations (CNVs) of uncertain significance in 262 probands; however, parental studies usually facilitated clinical interpretation. Of these, 217 were interpreted as familial variants and 11 were determined to be de novo; the remaining 34 await parental studies to resolve the clinical significance. Conclusions This large set of clinical results demonstrates the significantly improved sensitivity of CMA for the detection of clinically relevant genomic imbalances and highlights the need for comprehensive genetic counseling to facilitate accurate clinical correlation and interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W2017130610,"The discovery of odorant receptors led to endeavors in matching them with their cognate ligands. Although it has been challenging to functionally express odorant receptors in heterologous cells, previous studies have linked efficient odorant receptor expression with N-terminal modifications and accessory proteins, including the receptor-transporting proteins (RTPs) and Ric8b. Here we have shown that a shorter form of RTP1, RTP1S, supports robust cell-surface and functional expression of representative odorant receptors. Using a combination of accessory proteins, including RTP1S, Ric8b, and Gαolf, a diverse set of untagged odorant receptors were successfully expressed heterologously due to the synergistic effects among the various accessory proteins. Furthermore, the addition of an N-terminal rhodopsin tag to the odorant receptors, along with the same set of accessory proteins, exhibits an additional level of synergism, inducing enhanced odorant receptor responses to odorants and thus defining a more efficient heterologous expression system. We then showed that the presence or absence of different N-terminal tags has little effect on the ligand specificity of odorant receptors, although the amount of receptor expressed can play a role in the ligand response profile. The accuracy of the odorant receptor heterologous expression system involving tagged odorant receptors and various accessory proteins promises success in high throughput de-orphaning of mammalian odorant receptors.

Odorant receptors (ORs), 3The abbreviations and trivial names used are: OR, odorant receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Rho, rhodopsin; HA, hemagglutinin; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; RTP, receptor-transporting protein; Ric8b, resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8 homolog B. with more than 1000 members in the mouse genome, comprise the largest family among all G protein-coupled receptors. After the initial identification of the OR genes in 1991 (1Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar), one of the foci in the field of olfaction has been the identification of the cognate ligands of ORs (2Mombaerts P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 263-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The use of recordings from adenovirally infected rat olfactory sensory neurons first successfully matched an odorant to a cloned OR (3Zhao H. Ivic L. Otaki J.M. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Firestein S. Science. 1998; 279: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Although the establishment of a heterologous expression system in cell lines is essential for conducting a large scale analysis of OR ligand specificities, exogenous ORs in cell lines pose a critical problem, namely the inability to functionally express transfected ORs on the plasma membrane, possibly due to endoplasmic reticulum retention, which in turn leads to OR degradation in the proteosome (4Lu M. Echeverri F. Moyer B.D. Traffic. 2003; 4: 416-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5McClintock T.S. Landers T.M. Gimelbrant A.A. Fuller L.Z. Jackson B.A. Jayawickreme C.K. Lerner M.R.

Cell. 1998; 95: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) have pioneered the method of fusing the first 20 amino acids of rhodopsin (Rho tag) to the N termini of ORs to promote their cell-surface expression, although it is not clear how Rho tag enhances expression of the ORs. Other modifications, such as the use of a signal sequence, were used to improve trafficking of OR to the plasma membrane (7Wetzel C.H. Oles M. Wellerdieck C. Kuczkowiak M. Gisselmann G. Hatt H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7426-7433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wellerdieck C. Oles M. Pott L. Korsching S. Gisselmann G. Hatt H. Chem.

However, these modifications increase the functional expression for only a fraction of ORs. It is unclear whether N-terminal modifications have any undesirable effects on OR ligand selectivity, because it is almost impossible to heterologously express untagged ORs to verify their ligand selectivities. Nevertheless, there is no evidence supporting the possibility of N-terminal tags significantly affecting OR ligand specificities. It is known that tagged and untagged OREG (MOR174-9) responded to its cognate ligand, eugenol, suggesting that N-terminal modifications do not affect odorant recognition (10Katada S. Tanaka M. Touhara K. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, Rho-tagged OREG, S6 (MOR42-3), and MOR23 (MOR267-13) expressed in heterologous cells showed a similar ligand response profile as when expressed in isolated olfactory sensory neurons expressing the same receptor (12Malnic B. Hirono J. Sato T. Buck L.B. Cell. 1999; 96: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar, 13Oka Y. Katada S. Omura M. Suwa M. Yoshihara Y. Touhara K.

Furthermore, it has been shown that untagged, N-terminal FLAG-tagged, and C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged rat I7 receptors expressed in olfactory sensory neurons and N-terminal Rho-tagged I7 expressed in heterologous cells all consistently responded to its ligand, octanal (3Zhao H. Ivic L. Otaki J.M. Hashimoto M. Mikoshiba K. Firestein S. Science. 1998; 279: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 6Krautwurst D. Yau K.W. Reed R.R.

It is likely that specific molecular mechanisms, which are absent in heterologous cell lines, are required for proper OR expression and function. Receptor-transporting protein (RTP) family members were among the first of such accessory proteins that were shown to improve heterologous systems by promoting cell-surface expression of various Rho-tagged ORs (15Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H. Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). RTP1 and RTP2 are specifically expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium. Co-immunoprecipitation data showed that RTP1 and an OR form a complex in the HEK293T cells (15Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H. Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In vivo, they could serve as OR chaperones for folding and/or endoplasmic reticulum export or as co-receptors. In addition, another molecular chaperone, an HSP70 (heat shock protein 70) homolog, Hsc70t, when co-expressed with C-terminal GFP-tagged human ORs, enhanced the number and level of an OR protein expression, resulting in more cells responding to odorants in HEK293T cells, possibly through assistance in folding or trafficking (21Neuhaus E.M. Mashukova A. Zhang W. Barbour J. Hatt H. Chem. Senses. 2006; 31: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In another case, co-expression with the β2-adrenergic receptor enhanced the cell-surface expression of one OR (22Hague C. Uberti M.A. Chen Z. Bush C.F. Jones S.V. Ressler K.J. Hall R.A. Minneman K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13672-13676Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Amplifying signal transduction is another route to a better heterologous system. Ric8b, an olfactory-specific putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor, has been shown to improve the Golf signaling cascade with which ORs couple (23Von Dannecker L.E. Mercadante A.F. Malnic B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9310-9314Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Von Dannecker L.E. Mercadante A.F. Malnic B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a shorter form of RTP1, RTP1S, which promotes the cell-surface expression of ORs even more so than the original RTP1. We then asked whether untagged ORs can be heterologously expressed in the presence of accessory proteins including RTP1S. We investigated possible advantages of co-expressing combinations of different accessory proteins as well as the inclusion of N-terminal tags. We also examined the effect of different epitope tags, namely the Rho, FLAG, and HA tags, on the ligand specificity of representative mouse ORs. Plasmid Construction—Rho-(N-MNGTEGPNFYVPFSNA-TGVVR-C), FLAG-(N-MDYKDDDDK-C), and HA-(N-MYP-YDVPDYA-C) tags were subcloned into pCI mammalian expression vector (Promega). The tags and pCI were digested with corresponding restriction enzymes. All tags were inserted between the NheI and EcoRI sites in pCI. OR open reading frames were amplified from genomic DNA of C57BL6 (MOR203-1) or DBA2 (Olfr62, S6, and MOR23-1) using KOD DNA polymerase (Toyobo/Novagen) and subcloned in between the MluI and NotI sites in pCI expression vectors containing different tags. RTP1S was amplified from the RTP1L plasmid DNA and subcloned into pCI or HA-pCI. Ric8b, Hsc70t, and Gαolf were amplified from cDNA and cloned into pCI. The sequences of the cloned receptors and the accessory proteins were verified by sequencing (3100 Genetic Analyzer, ABI Biosystems). Cell Culture and Immunocytochemistry—HEK293T cells and the HEK293T-derived Hana3A cells (15Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H. Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) were maintained in minimal essential medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) (M10), 500 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 6 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma). HEK293T cells do not endogenously express RTP1 mRNA (15Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H. Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, cells were seeded in a 35-mm dish (Falcon) containing a piece of cover glass coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) 24 h prior to transfection in M10. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for the transfection of plasmid DNA. For all stainings, 0.8 μg of OR DNA and 0.8 μg total of all accessory proteins (RTP1S, RTP1L, Hsc70t, Ric8b, and/or Gαolf) or pCI were transfected per dish. 0.27 μg of each accessory protein was transfected, and pCI was co-transfected to make the total amount constant. 0.3 μg of blue fluorescent protein was transfected as a control for transfection efficiency. For live cell-surface staining, 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated in M10 containing 15 mm NaN3 and 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen) and the mouse monoclonal anti-rhodopsin antibody, 4D2 (25Laird D.W. Molday R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar), at a 1:100 dilution at 4 °C for 45 min. The cells were then washed in Hanks’ balanced buffer solution (Invitrogen) containing 15 mm NaN3 and 10 mm HEPES followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunologicals) at 4 °C for 30 min and then fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C and mounting in Mowiol. For permeabilized staining, 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with methanol at 4 °C. The cells were blocked in 5% skim milk diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 5% skim milk/phosphate-buffered saline containing a 1:200 dilution of mouse anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) and a 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at room temperature for 45 min. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunologicals) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 30 min. Slides were mounted and observed under a fluorescent microscope (Axioskop 2; Carl Zeiss). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS) Analysis—HEK293T and Hana3A cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes and then transfected with the same amount of plasmid DNA as in immunocytochemistry. 2 ng of GFP expression vector were transfected per dish as a control for transfection efficiency. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were dissociated in Cellstripper (Mediatech) and transferred to a tube for incubation with the anti-rhodopsin antibody as described in immunocytochemistry and then with phycoerythrin-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunologicals). 7-Amino-actinomycin D (Calbiochem) was added before flow cytometry to eliminate dead cells from the analysis. Generation of Anti-RTP1 Antibody—The peptide RAPSPT-KPQAETGSG located near the C-terminal end of RTP1 was synthesized (AnaSpec, Inc.). Rabbits were immunized according to standard procedures (Duke University Vivarium). Western Blot—HEK293T cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected with RTP1S or RTP1L using Lipofectamine 2000. GFP expression vector was co-transfected as a control. 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed with sample loading buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 5% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.002% bromophenol blue, and 0.25 m dithiothreitol) and sonicated. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed according to Mini-Protean 2 Cell (Bio-Rad) protocol. Membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-RTP1 at a 1:1000 dilution and subsequently with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunologicals). The membrane was then incubated with stripping buffer (25 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2, 1% SDS, 25 mm glycine, and 1% SDS) for 30 min at room temperature and then with rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen) at a 1:1000 dilution and subsequently with donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase. ECL (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detecting proteins on membranes. Luciferase Assay and Data Analysis—The Dual-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System (Promega) was used for luciferase assay essentially as previously described (15Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H. Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). CRE-Luc (cAMP-responsive element firefly luciferase) (Stratagene) was used to measure receptor activation. Renilla luciferase driven by a constitutively active SV40 promoter (pRL-SV40; Promega) was used as an internal control for cell viability and transfection efficiency. HEK293T or Hana3A cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plates (BioCoat; BD Biosciences). Plasmid DNA of ORs and accessory factors was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000. For each 96-well plate, 1 μg of CRE-Luc, 1 μg of pRL-SV40, 5 μg of OR, and 1 μg total of all accessory proteins (RTP1S, RTP1L, Hsc70t, Ric8b, and/or Gαolf) or pCI were transfected. 0.25 μg of each accessory protein was transfected, and pCI was co-transfected to make the total amount constant. 24 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with CD293 chemically defined medium (Invitrogen) and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The medium was then replaced with 25 μl of odorant solution diluted in CD293 and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. We followed the manufacturer’s protocols for measuring luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities. Luminescence was measured using a Wallac Victor 1420 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Normalized luciferase activity was calculated by the formula [luc(N) - luc(lowest)]/luc(highest) - luc(lowest)], where luc(N) = luminescence of firefly luciferase divided by luminescence of Renilla luciferase of a certain well; luc(lowest) = lowest luminescence of firefly luciferase divided by luminescence of Renilla luciferase of a plate or a set of plates; and luc(highest) = highest luminescence of firefly luciferase divided by luminescence of Renilla luciferase of a plate or a set of plates. Data were analyzed with Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 4 software. The statistical significance of synergism was assessed with a binomial test. Calcium Imaging—Calcium imaging was performed similar to the protocol outlined previously (26Ishimaru Y. Inada H. Kubota M. Zhuang H. Tominaga M. Matsunami H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12569-12574Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were seeded on glass-bottom plates with poly-d-lysine-coated cover-slips (MatTek) and plasmid DNA of Olfr62 and either the accessory protein RTP1S, RTP1L, or pCI, and a G protein chimera, G15olf47, was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 and incubated for 24 h. The same amount of plasmid DNA as used in immunocytochemistry was transfected. G15olf47 is a chimeric G protein in which the last 57 amino acids of Gα15 were replaced by the last 47 amino acids of Gαolf. 0.6 μg of G15olf47 was transfected per dish. 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with 4 μm Fluo-4 (Invitrogen) and 7 μm Fura-Red (Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature. A Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) confocal microscope (excitation at 488 nm; emission at 500-560 nm for Fluo-4 and 605-700 nm for Fura-Red) was used. Cells were exposed to a constant flow of the bath solution, Hanks’ balanced buffer solution containing 10 mm HEPES. Odorant solutions containing various concentrations of 2-coumaranone or 1 μm isoproterenol were applied to the cells for 15 s by changing the bath solution with a peristaltic pump (Rabbit; Rainin Instrument, Oakland, CA). Data were collected at 3-s intervals using the live imaging mode of the Leica confocal software. Ratios of Fluo-4 and Fura-Red were plotted using cells in the entire viewing fields that contain ∼300 cells. Chemicals—All odorants were purchased from Sigma, except octanoic acid, which was purchased from Calbiochem. Characterization of a Shorter and More Potent Form of RTP1—During the course of analyzing the function of a deletion series of RTP1 in OR expression, 4H. Zhuang and H. Matsunami, manuscript in preparation. we found that one of the deletions, which started from the second methionine of the open reading frame, induced stronger expression of ORs when co-expressed in HEK293T cells. We named this shorter form, lacking the N-terminal 36 amino acids, RTP1S, whereas the RTP1 previously described in Saito et al. (15Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H.

The putative translation start site of RTP1S is in agreement with those of the other RTP members (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis using lysates from HEK293T cells expressing RTP1S or RTP1L as well as from the olfactory epithelium revealed that the RTP1 proteins expressed in the olfactory epithelium appeared to migrate to the same position as that of RTP1S, whereas no band corresponding to RTP1L was seen, suggesting that RTP1S is a major form of RTP1 produced in vivo (Fig. 1B). Expressed sequence tag mining revealed three expressed sequence tags corresponding to RTP1 in which one of them contained the first methionine of RTP1L, and the 5′-ends of the other two cDNAs start between the first methionines of RTP1L and RTP1S. To compare the function of RTP1S and RTP1L, we first examined the cell-surface expression of a set of four diverse mouse ORs, Olfr62 (MOR258-5), S6, OREG, and MOR203-1, all modified with an N-terminal Rho tag, which corresponds to the first 20 amino acids of human rhodopsin. The ORs were co-expressed with RTP1S, RTP1L, or a control vector in HEK293T cells. In all four cases, co-expression of RTP1S resulted in more robust cell-surface expression compared with co-expression of RTP1L, although the effect of RTP1L was clear when compared with negative controls (Fig. 1C). To quantify the cell-surface OR proteins, we performed FACS analysis for Olfr62 and S6. Fig. 1D demonstrates that RTP1S is more potent than RTP1L in inducing cell-surface expression of ORs, although RTP1L was sufficient to promote cell-surface expression of the ORs (15Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H. Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In the Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 1B, the intensity of the bands corresponding to RTP1S and RTP1L were comparable. A control blot of co-transfected GFP shows similar GFP expression in cells expressing RTP1S and RTP1L, indicating that similar amounts of RTP1S and RTP1L are produced in cells. This suggests that the stronger activity of RTP1S in inducing OR cell-surface expression is not attributable to a higher level of protein expression. Next, we compared the effect of RTP1S and RTP1L on the functional activation of ORs. A luciferase reporter gene assay was used to assess OR response upon ligand stimulation. Because ORs couple with stimulatory G proteins, leading to intracellular cAMP increases, luciferase gene expression mediated by a cAMP-responsive element can be used to measure activation of ORs by their ligands in HEK293T cells (15Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H. Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 27Katada S. Nakagawa T. Kataoka H. Touhara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For three ORs, Olfr62, S6, and MOR23-1, co-expression of RTP1S induced more cAMP-mediated luciferase reporter gene product, indicating that RTP1S is more potent for the induction of functional cell-surface expression (Fig. 2A). Similarly, calcium imaging analysis showed that Olfr62 responded to its cognate ligand, 2-coumaranone, more robustly and at lower concentrations when co-expressed with RTP1S than when co-expressed with RTP1L (Fig. 2B). To explore the mechanism by which RTP1S enhances OR functional expression, we examined the subcellular localization of RTP1S and Olfr62 in HEK293T by permeabilized staining (Fig. 2C). The majority of the signals for both proteins were seen in intracellular compartments. The expression of RTP1S co-localized with that of Olfr62, suggesting possible interaction between the two proteins. Synergism of Accessory Proteins in the Functional Expression of Untagged ORs—Untagged ORs typically produced little or no ligand-induced responses, presumably because of poor cell-surface expression. To address this, we used accessory proteins recently implicated in the promotion of functional expression of mammalian ORs, including RTP1S, RTP1L, Ric8b, and Hsc70t, and asked whether co-expression of the accessory proteins is sufficient to confer functional expression of untagged ORs in heterologous cells. We first co-transfected the ORs with RTP1S, RTP1L, Ric8b/Gαolf, and Hsc70t in various combinations in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3). Co-expression of RTP1S was found to be sufficient for the detection of ligand-induced OR activation for all four ORs. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2A, RTP1S was found to be more potent than RTP1L using untagged ORs. Co-expression of Ric8b was effective with one OR, OREG, consistent with a previous report (23Von Dannecker L.E. Mercadante A.F. Malnic B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9310-9314Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), although we did not observe luciferase induction for the other three ORs in this condition. Hsc70t alone did not significantly enhance OR activation in our experiments. Importantly, in all four cases and at all three concentrations, co-expression of RTP1S and Ric8b resulted in more robust OR activation compared with a simple sum of both (p = 0.00024). These results suggest that RTP1S and Ric8b synergistically enhanced the function of the ORs. We then examined the same combinations of accessory factors in Hana3A cells, which is a HEK293T-derived cell line stably expressing RTP1L, RTP2, REEP1, and Gαolf. We have previously shown that Hana3A cells can induce the functional expression of various Rho-tagged ORs and are thus an ideal foundation for building a more powerful OR heterologous expression system (15Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H. Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). We found more robust OR functions in all cases, consistent with the previous report. The synergism between RTP1S and Ric8b was, however, not as pronounced in these cells, possibly because of saturation of OR activation at higher ligand concentrations. Yet, it is clear that the addition of both RTP1S and Ric8b/Gαolf in both HEK293T and Hana3A cells constitutes the most robust conditions for untagged OR expression among the conditions tested. Synergism among Accessory Proteins and the Rho Tag in an OR Heterologous Expression System—Next, we examined the effect of the widely used Rho tag of ORs in conjunction with the combination of accessory proteins in enhancing OR functions. We used the same set of four ORs and cloned each OR with a Rho tag at the N terminus. An untagged version of each OR was included as a control. We assessed the luciferase activity of the ORs in the presence of the combination of the accessory proteins that induced robust luciferase assay response in the untagged condition, that is, RTP1S and Ric8b/Gαolf. We found that the addition of Rho tag alone was not sufficient to induce functional expression of Olfr62 and MOR203-1 when expressed in HEK293T cells. Rho tag induced weak functional expression of S6 and OREG, as previously reported (6Krautwurst D. Yau K.W. Reed R.R.

Moreover, when expressed with RTP1S and Ric8b/Gαolf, Rho-tagged ORs responded far better than untagged ORs in four cases, indicating synergistic effects of the Rho tag and the accessory proteins (p = 0.00293). This combination with the Rho tag RTP1S and Ric8b/Gαolf gave the highest response among the various conditions tested, further strengthening the idea of synergism among the accessory factors in OR functional expression. Cell-surface expression analysis using Rho-tagged ORs showed that, although RTP1S is important in the promotion of cell-surface expression, the addition of Ric8b/Gαolf has little effect in this aspect when expressed alone, consistent with the idea that Ric8b enhances the signaling through G proteins but not the cell-surface expression of OR proteins (Fig. 4, B and C). However, when RTP1S was expressed in concert with Ric8b/Gαolf, the level of OR cell-surface expression appeared to be more pronounced than that of RTP1S alone, which is discernable in the FACS analysis of two selected ORs (Fig. 4C). The addition of Hsc70t did not have a dramatic effect on the cell-surface expression of the four receptors tested in our analyses. Rel"

We used utrastructural studies to shed light on the different steps of the Mimivirus replication cycle: entry via phagocytosis, release of viral DNA into the cell cytoplasm through fusion of viral and vacuolar membranes, and finally viral morphogenesis in an extraordinary giant cytoplasmic virus factory (VF). Fluorescent staining of the AT-rich Mimivirus DNA showed that it enters the host nucleus prior to the generation of a cytoplasmic independent replication centre that forms the core of the VF. Assembly and filling of viral capsids were observed within the replication centre, before release into the cell cytoplasm where progeny virions accumulated. 3D reconstruction from fluorescent and differential contrast interference images revealed the VF emerging from the cell surface as a volcano-like structure. Its size dramatically grew during the 24 h infectious lytic cycle. Our results showed that Mimivirus replication is an extremely efficient process that results from a rapid takeover of cellular machinery, and takes place in a unique and autonomous giant assembly centre, leading to the release of a large number of complex virions through amoebal lysis."

In addition to its matrix degrading activity, MT1-MMP also contains a short cytoplasmic domain whose involvement in cell locomotion seems important but remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that MT1-MMP is phosphorylated on the unique tyrosine residue located within this cytoplasmic sequence (Tyr573) and that this phosphorylation requires the kinase Src. Using phosphospecific antibodies recognizing MT1-MMP phosphorylated on Tyr573, we observed that tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme is rapidly induced upon stimulation of tumor and endothelial cells with the platelet-derived chemoattractant sphingosine-1-phosphate, suggesting a role in migration triggered by this lysophospholipid. Accordingly, overexpression of a nonphosphorylable MT1-MMP mutant (Y573F) blocked sphingosine-1-phosphate-induced migration of Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HT-1080 (human fibrosarcoma) cells and failed to stimulate migration of cells lacking the enzyme (bovine aortic endothelial cells).

Among the various MMPs described to date, there is now considerable evidence that MMPs that are intrinsically associated with the plasma membrane because of the presence of a transmembrane domain within their sequence, the so-called membrane type MMPs, represent key components involved in pericellular proteolysis and subsequent cell locomotion and invasion (5Itoh Y.

The prototypical member of this family, MT1-MMP, actively participates in the remodeling of the pericellular ECM by acting as a cellular receptor and activator of proMMP-2 (7Sato H. Takino T.

These events are likely to be important in vivo because MT1-MMP null mice fail to thrive and have a markedly reduced lifespan (13Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A.

In addition to its role in normal physiology, MT1-MMP is also overexpressed in many types of tumors (15Nakada M. Nakamura H. Ikeda E. Fujimoto N. Yamashita J. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Am. J.

For example, MT1-MMP-mediated degradation of some ECM proteins, such as the laminin-5γ2 chain (17Koshikawa N. Minegishim T. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. Seiki M. J. Biol.

Despite its importance to normal physiology and in the development of malignancy, the mechanisms underlying MT1-MMP-mediated cell invasion remain incompletely understood. During cell migration, MT1-MMP localizes predominantly to the cell adherent edge at the migration front, an appropriate location for the degradation of the ECM barrier (20Sato T. del Carmen Ovejero M. Hou P. Heegaard A.M. Kumegawa M. Foged N.T. Delaisse J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 589-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we and others have shown that MT1-MMP is preferentially localized into caveolae, specialized domains of the plasma membrane (21Annabi B. Lachambre M-P. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Pagé M.

In addition to the importance of MT1-MMP-mediated proteolytic breakdown of ECM proteins for the induction of cell migration, recent studies suggested that the cytoplasmic domain of the enzyme may also play a role in this process. For example, MT1-MMP mutants lacking the cytoplasmic domain remain localized at the cell surface and failed to induce migration, suggesting an important role for the enzyme cytoplasmic sequence in the regulation of its activity (25Lethi K.

Although the mechanisms by which the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic sequence is implicated in these processes remain poorly understood, recent observations indicate that it could involve an important function of this domain in the cooperation of the enzyme with serum-derived chemoattractant molecules such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid secreted by activated platelets (34Langlois S.

In this study, we report that MT1-MMP is tyrosine-phosphorylated within its cytoplasmic domain, in a Src-dependent manner.

The rabbits were inoculated five times with the phosphopeptide conjugated with a immune carrier, and serum was collected and subjected to affinity depletion using the nonphosphopeptide, followed by affinity purification using a phosphopeptide affinity column. To verify the specificity of the antibodies against the phosphorylated peptide, pMT1-MMP(Y573) antibodies were preincubated for 45 min at 37 °C with a 5-fold molar excess of either the phosphopeptide or the nonphosphopeptide, and immunodetection was performed as described below. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—For the first dimension, immunoprecipitates bound to protein A-coupled Sepharose beads were solubilized in rehydration buffer (5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 2% SB3-10, 0.3% dithiothreitol, bromphenol blue) containing ampholytes (pH 4-7). Solubilized proteins were incubated with 7-cm IPG strips containing a linear pH gradient (4van Hinsbergh V.W. Engelse M.A. Quax P.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

For the second dimension, IPG strips were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS) containing 2% dithiothreitol and then for 15 min in equilibration buffer containing 5% iodoacetamide and bromphenol blue. IPG strips were loaded on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed as described below. Caveolae Isolation—Caveolae were purified using a hyperosmotic carbonate method, as described previously (33Labrecque L. Nyalendo C. Langlois S. Durocher Y. Roghi C. Murphy G. Gingras D. Béliveau R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52132-52140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent COS-7 cells cultured in 100-mm2 dishes were scraped into 3 ml of 0.5 m sodium carbonate (pH 11) and homogenized extensively using a Polytron (three pulses of 15 s, at speed 4) followed by sonication (five pulses of 15 s, at 70% of maximal power). 2.5 ml of the resulting homogenate was brought to 45% sucrose by the addition of 2.5 ml of 90% sucrose in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) and overlaid with two layers (6 ml each) of 35 and 5% sucrose in MES-buffered saline containing 0.25 m carbonate. The gradient was then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 18 h using a Beckman SW41Ti rotor. For analysis of the resulting gradient, 1-ml fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the gradient. Caveolae-enriched (5-8 fractions) or noncaveolae (12-15 fractions) fractions were pooled, diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Stimulation of HT1080 and HUVEC Cells with S1P—HT1080 and HUVEC cells grown to 90% confluence were serum-starved for 18 h in medium containing 0.5% serum. The cells were then preincubated 2 h at 37 °C with 1 μm PP2 (or an equivalent amount of vehicle), followed by incubation for 2-30 min with 1 μm S1P. The cells were then solubilized in SDS lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), followed by boiling for 5 min at 100 °C and homogenization using a 26-gauge needle. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The procedures have been described elsewhere (33Labrecque L. Nyalendo C.

Briefly, equal amounts of proteins were incubated in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate) over-night at 4 °C in the presence of 1-2 μg/ml of specific antibodies, and the immune complexes were collected by incubating the mixtures with protein A- or G-coupled Sepharose beads. Bound material was solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked overnight at 4 °C with Tris buffer saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the desired primary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were revealed following 1 h of incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, and the signals were visualized by chemiluminescence. Densitometric analysis was performed using the IPLab Gel program. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Endothelial cells (HUVEC) were plated on cover glasses coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin, serum-starved, and treated (or not) with 1 μm S1P for 15 min. After 5 min of incubation with Hoechst 20 μm for nuclei staining, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked (1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween) for 30 min, and stained with specific primary antibodies against phopho-MT1-MMP (1/50 dilution), phospho-caveolin-1, and MT1-MMP (1/100 dilution). The cells were incubated with Alexa 488- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. The slides were mounted with Immuno-Fluore mounting medium (MP Biomedicals). Immunostaining was visualized and photographed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. Cell Migration—Migration assays of BAEC, HUVEC, or HT1080 cells transfected with either pcDNA3.1, WT, or Y573F forms of MT1-MMP, were performed on transwells precoated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin. The transwells were assembled in 24-well plates, and the lower chambers were filled with serumfree media with or without 1 μm S1P or 10% FBS. Transfected cells were harvested, resuspended in 100 μl of fresh cell media at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml, and inoculated into the upper chamber of each transwell. The plates were then placed at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air for 3 h, and cells that had migrated were quantified using computer-assisted imaging (Northern Eclipse 6.0; Empix Imaging, Mississauga, Canada). The data are expressed as the average density of migrated cells/4 fields (original magnification, 50×) (34Langlois S. Gingras D. Béliveau R. Blood. 2004; 103: 3020-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed by two-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post-tests. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For the measurement of transfection efficiencies, the total membranes were isolated from HUVEC and BAEC as described (34Langlois S. Gingras D. Béliveau R. Blood. 2004; 103: 3020-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and MT1-MMP levels were monitored by immunoblotting. For HT-1080 cells, transfection efficiencies were monitored by zymographic analysis of MT1-MMP-dependent activation of proMMP-2 in as described (21Annabi B. Lachambre M-P. Bousquet-Gagnon N. Pagé M. Gingras D. Béliveau R. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP Is Phosphorylated on Cytoplasmic Tyrosine 573: Involvement of Src Kinase—We previously showed that overexpression of Src induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1 and its subsequent association with MT1-MMP (33Labrecque L. Nyalendo C. Langlois S. Durocher Y. Roghi C. Murphy G. Gingras D. Béliveau R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52132-52140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because this interaction required the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP, we hypothesized that the stimulatory effect of Src could also involve the phosphorylation of the unique tyrosine residue located in the cytoplasmic sequence of MT1-MMP. As a first step to examine this possibility, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with a Myc-tagged version of MT1-MMP along with Src or a kinase-inactive dominant-negative form of Src. MycMT1 was immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody, and the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, immunoprecipitation of MT1-MMP from cells overexpressing MT1-MMP and Src resulted in the appearance of two tyrosine-phosphorylated bands in the 63-66-kDa range, whereas co-expression of MT1-MMP with an inactive Src mutant failed to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. The upper phosphorylated band (66 kDa) shows an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of Myc-tagged MT1-MMP and was also observed upon reverse immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, strongly suggesting it represents a tyrosine-phosphorylated form of MT1-MMP. To further establish whether MT1-MMP is indeed tyrosine-phosphorylated in Src-expressing cells and whether this phosphorylation occurs at an intracellular location, we next examined the effect of various mutants of the enzyme on this event. As shown in Fig. 1B, immunoprecipitation of both Myc-tagged (MycMT1) or WT MT1-MMP resulted in the appearance of tyrosine-phosphorylated bands corresponding to the molecular masses of both forms of the enzyme, indicating that the observed phosphorylation was not restricted to the epitope-tagged version of MT1-MMP. We next examined the requirement for the catalytic activity and cytoplasmic sequence of the enzyme using various mutants. The catalytically inactive mutant (E240A) was also phosphorylated but to a lower extent than the WT enzyme. Because this mutation impairs the refolding of a recombinant MT1-MMP polypeptide (35Koo H.M. Kim J-H. Hwang I.K. Lee S.J. Kim T.-H. Rhee K.H. Lee S.-T. Mol. Cells. 2002; 13: 118-124PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the E240A mutation could have induced a global conformational change in the enzyme structure, thus partially preventing MT1-MMP tyrosine phosphorylation. However, removal of the cytoplasmic domain (CΔ20) decreased almost completely tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Because the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic sequence contains only one tyrosine residue at position 573 of the protein, we next examined the effect of mutated versions of MT1-MMP lacking this residue. Interestingly, overexpression of the Y573F and L571A/L572A/Y573A mutants abolished tyrosine phosphorylation, further suggesting that the intracellular tyrosine residue of MT1-MMP is the site of phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). To unambiguously establish that MT1-MMP is phosphorylated on tyrosine 573, we next analyzed immunoprecipitates from cells expressing WT or Y573F forms of MT1-MMP along with Src, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1C, immunoprecipitation of MT1-MMP from cells co-expressing Src resulted in the appearance of at least four well defined tyrosine-phosphorylated spots (vertical arrows). We observed that the more acidic forms migrated at a position identical to immunoreactive MT1-MMP (63 kDa) (horizontal arrow), whereas the more basic forms, with slightly lower molecular masses (60 kDa), were not associated with detectable levels of the enzyme. These 60-kDa forms are, however, likely to represent low abundant tyrosine-phosphorylated MT1-MMP because overexpression of the Y573F mutant completely abolished the tyrosine phosphorylation of all MT1-MMP isoforms (Fig. 1C); these forms were also recognized by phosphospecific MT1-MMP antibodies (see Fig. 3D). Overall, these results indicate that MT1-MMP is tyrosine-phosphorylated in Src-expressing cells and that this event involves its unique cytoplasmic tyrosine 573 residue. Caveolin-1 and Caveolae Are Not Necessary for MT1-MMP Phosphorylation—Based on our observation that tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 interacts with MT1-MMP, we next examined whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of MT1-MMP is involved in its interaction with caveolin-1 (33Labrecque L.

First, COS-7 cells were transfected with either wild-type MT1-MMP or the nonphosphorylable MT1-MMP mutant (Y573F), and the presenc"

To determine whether increased glycerolipid flux can, by itself, cause hepatic insulin resistance, we used an adenoviral construct to overexpress glycerol-sn-3-phosphate acyltransferase-1 (Ad-GPAT1), the committed step in de novo triacylglycerol synthesis. After 5–7 days, food intake, body weight, and fat pad weight did not differ between Ad-GPAT1 and Ad-enhanced green fluorescent protein control rats, but the chow-fed Ad-GPAT1 rats developed fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Liver was the predominant site of insulin resistance; Ad-GPAT1 rats had 2.5-fold higher hepatic glucose output than controls during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Hepatic diacylglycerol and lysophosphatidate were elevated in Ad-GPAT1 rats, suggesting a role for these lipid metabolites in the development of hepatic insulin resistance, and hepatic protein kinase Cɛ was activated, providing a potential mechanism for insulin resistance. Ad-GPAT1-treated rats had 50% lower hepatic NF-κB activity and no difference in expression of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-β, consistent with hepatic insulin resistance in the absence of increased hepatic inflammation. Glycogen synthesis and uptake of 2-deoxyglucose were reduced in skeletal muscle, suggesting mild peripheral insulin resistance associated with a higher content of skeletal muscle triacylglycerol. These results indicate that increased flux through the pathway of hepatic de novo triacylglycerol synthesis can cause hepatic and systemic insulin resistance in the absence of obesity or a lipogenic diet.

Most animal models of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance have been created through high-fat or high-sucrose feeding or through genetic disruption of insulin or leptin signaling pathways. Diet-induced hepatic steatosis, however, is not a good model for isolating the role of the liver in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance because high-fat diets cause weight gain and obesity, which independently contribute to the development of systemic insulin resistance. Systemic deficiencies in leptin or insulin signaling also cause obesity by increasing centrally mediated food intake. An animal model that isolates the accumulation of triacylglycerol in liver from its accumulation in other tissues may provide a better understanding of the role of hepatic lipid synthesis or accumulation in the development of hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance.

GPAT esterifies fatty acids to glycerol 3-phosphate at the sn-1 position, forming lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Fig. 1). Three different isoenzymes of GPAT have been described, one located in the endoplasmic reticulum (GPAT3), and two located in the outer mitochondrial membrane (GPAT1 and GPAT2) (13Bhat B.G. Wang P.

GPAT1 activity accounts for 30–50% of total liver GPAT activity, but is only 10% of total GPAT activity in other tissues (12Coleman R.A. Lee D.P. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 134-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Unlike GPAT2 and -3, GPAT1 is transcriptionally regulated by carbohydrate re-feeding via carbohydrate-responsive elements and by insulin via sterol response element-binding protein-1c, suggesting that glycerolipid metabolism can be regulated through changes in GPAT1 expression in response to altered nutrient availability (16Jerkins A.A.

Recent studies in primary hepatocytes demonstrated that overexpression of GPAT1 primarily directs exogenous fatty acids away from β-oxidation and toward DAG and TAG rather than phospholipid synthesis (19Lindé;n D.

Conversely, when GPAT1 is absent, mice are protected from high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance (21Hammond L.E. Gallagher P.A. Wang S. Posey-Marcos E. Hiller S. Kluckman K.

These studies suggest that GPAT1 plays an important role in the regulation of hepatic TAG accumulation, and that the synthesis of this TAG pool can affect hepatic insulin sensitivity. To determine whether an increase in hepatic TAG and the synthesis of its glycerolipid precursors leads to hepatic and systemic insulin resistance in the absence of obesity, we targeted the overexpression of GPAT1 to the liver using an adenoviral-GPAT1 construct (Ad-GPAT1). Because GPAT1 is a key enzyme in the pathway of de novo TAG synthesis, we expected to induce hepatic steatosis without the need to feed a lipogenic diet. Also, because GPAT1 specific activity is elevated in livers from mice with diet-induced obesity and from ob/ob mice with leptin deficiency, overexpression of GPAT1 is a realistic model for the hepatic steatosis observed in insulin-resistant animals (19Lindé;n D.

Rats received a single dose (1.0 × 1012 or 2.0 × 1012 particles/ml/300 g body weight) of Ad-GPAT1 or Ad-EGFP adenoviruses by tail-vein injection. Rats were given a dose (15 mg/kg body weight) of cyclosporine the day before and the day of the virus administration to minimize the immune response. Food consumption and body weight were monitored daily. Five to 7 days after virus injection, food was withdrawn 4 h before collection of blood by heart puncture of anesthetized animals. Tissues were collected by clamp freezing and stored at –80 °C. Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic Clamp Experiments—Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies were performed as described previously with the following modifications (31An J. Muoio D.M. Shiota M. Fujimoto Y. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Koves T.R. Stevens R. Millington D.S. Newgard C.B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Male Wistar rats (300 g body weight) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), and catheters were implanted in the carotid artery, external jugular vein, and ileal vein. After surgery, the rats recovered for 2 weeks, then, Ad-GPAT1 or Ad-EGFP virus was injected through the tail vein at 1.0–2.0 × 1012 particles/ml 7 days before the clamp study. At –150 min a bolus of [3-3H]glucose (15 μCi/kg) was administered followed by a constant infusion of labeled glucose (0.15 μCi/kg/min). Somatostatin was infused at 3 μg/kg/min, and glucagon and insulin were infused at 2.6 ng/kg/min and 3 milliunits/kg/min, respectively, to maintain plasma glucagon and insulin levels at ∼40 pg/ml (arterial plasma) and ∼3 ng/ml (arterial plasma), respectively. 2-Deoxy-[14C]Glucose (50 μCi/rat) was administered through the carotid arterial catheter at 120 min during the clamp. During the clamp, blood glucose was monitored every 10 min via carotid arterial catheter samples. Plasma glucose, [3H]H2O, [3-3H]glucose, and 2-deoxy-[14C]glucose were measured to determine glucose disposal rate, hepatic glucose output, and the glycolytic rate. Liver and skeletal muscle glycogen content and 3H radioactivity in glycogen was measured to analyze glycogen synthesis. Skeletal muscle 2-deoxy-[14C]glucose-6-phosphate was measured to determine glucose uptake. Measurement of Plasma Metabolic Variables—Plasma TAG concentrations were measured using an enzymatic colorimetric assay kit (Stanbio Laboratory). Plasma cholesterol levels were measured using the Cholesterol CII kit (Wako Chemicals). Plasma alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, glucose, and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were measured using kits from Stanbio Laboratory. Fatty acid concentrations were measured using a kit from Roche. Plasma insulin and leptin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (Linco). Very low density and high density plasma lipoprotein fractions were isolated from 100 μl of total plasma using fast protein liquid chromatography with a Superose 6 HR10/30 column (GE Healthcare). Triglyceride and cholesterol contents of plasma fractions were determined using the colorimetric kits described above. Membrane Isolation and Measurement of GPAT1 Activity—Liver tissue was homogenized in Medium I (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 10 up-and-down strokes in a Teflon-glass motor-driven homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the total membrane fraction. The membrane pellet was re-homogenized in Medium I and stored in 100-μl aliquots at –80 °C for the enzyme assay. GPAT1 specific activity was assayed at room temperature in a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid-free), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 8 mm NaF, 800 μm [3H]glycerol 3-phosphate, and 80 μm palmitoyl-CoA (14Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 450-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding 10–30 μg of total membrane protein to the assay mixture after incubating the membrane protein on ice for 15 min in the presence or absence of 1 mm NEM. GPAT1 activity is calculated as the activity that is uninhibited by NEM. Western Blot—GPAT1-FLAG and EGFP expression were determined in liver (and muscle) total particulate fractions by Western blot using a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Clone M2, Sigma) and a monoclonal anti-EGFP antibody (ab3277, Abcam Inc.). Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) protein expression was determined in rat liver samples using a rabbit polyclonal anti-PEPCK (Santa Cruz) antibody. Tissue Triglyceride and Glycogen Content—Liver, muscle, or heart tissue (100 mg) was homogenized in water and lipids were extracted into CHCl3 (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), dried in a SpeedVac, and resuspended in 1 ml of CHCl3. A fraction of the original lipid extract (50 μl for liver and 200 μl for heart or muscle) was dried and resuspended in 100 μl of isopropyl alcohol, 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h. The TAG content of 10–30 μl of the lipid sample was determined using an enzymatic colorimetric method (Stanbio Laboratory). Liver glycogen content was measured using an amyloglycosidase-based assay (33Newgard C.B. Moorse S.V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6958-6963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Liver Lipid Contents—The extraction procedures for acyl-CoA, LPA, and DAG species were performed as described previously (22Neschen S. Morino K. Hammond L.E. Zhang D. Liu Z.X. Romanelli A.J. Cline G.W. Pongratz R.L. Zhang X.M. Choi C.S. Coleman R.A. Shulman G.I. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To extract acyl-CoA, ∼100 mg of liver was homogenized with a 17:0-CoA internal standard. Acyl-CoAs were purified using Oligonucleotide Purification Cartridges (Applied Biosystems) and were slowly eluted with 60% acetonitrile. For LPA measurements, ∼100 mg of liver was homogenized in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) with 1 nm C17:0-lysophosphatidic acid as the internal standard. Samples were homogenized and centrifuged twice, each time with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The supernatants were combined and mixed with dH2O to obtain an aqueous phase. The aqueous phase was then mixed with dH2O and applied to conditioned Waters Oasis MAX extraction cartridges (Waters Corp.). After a washing step, LPA and phosphatidic acid species were eluted with methanol for LC/MS/MS analysis. Different LPA species were separated with an HPLC Betasil C18 Dash HTS column (Thermo Electron Corp.) using varying gradients of solutions A (95% dH2O, 5% acetonitrile, 2 mm ammonium acetate) and B (95% acetonitrile, 5% dH2O, 2 mm ammonium acetate). For DAG, ∼100 mg of liver tissue was homogenized in ice-cold CHCl3/methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene and internal standards for 1,3-dipentadecanoin and 1,2,3-triheptadecanoate. Organic and aqueous phases were separated by adding CHCl3 and H2O. After centrifugation, the organic layer was collected, dried under nitrogen flow, and reconstituted with hexane/methylene chloride/ether (89/10/1, v/v). DAG was separated from TAG with preconditioned columns (Waters SepPak Cartridge WAT020845) and eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate (85/15, v/v) under a low negative pressure. Lipid metabolite extracts were subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis. A turbo ionspray source was interfaced with an API 3000 tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in conjunction with two PerkinElmer 200 Series micropumps and a 200 Series autosampler (PerkinElmer). Total acyl-CoA, LPA, phosphatidic acid, and DAG content were expressed as the sum of individual species. Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNA was extracted from 0.02 g of frozen liver tissue using the RNeasy Mini spin column kit (Qiagen Inc.) in combination with DNase digest treatment. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR for IL-1β, PEPCK, Glc-6-Pase, and TNF-α were performed using an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System instrument and TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) with Invitrogen Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Reactions were performed in triplicate. Target gene expression was normalized to β-actin expression. All data were quantified using the relative standard curve method as described in Applied Biosystems User Bulletin No. 2. NF-κB Activity—Liver (100 mg) was homogenized in 400 μl of Dignam A buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and Sigma Protease Inhibitor mixture, 100 μl/10 ml buffer) in a glass Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were left on ice for 20 min, then 40 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and homogenates were vortexed for 15 s. Cytoplasmic extracts were collected after the homogenates were centrifuged at 4,500 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed twice in Dignam A buffer. Nuclear membranes were disrupted with 100 μl of Dignam C buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and Sigma Protease Inhibitor mixture, 100 μl/10 ml buffer) on ice for 15 min. Nuclear extracts were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min to pellet the DNA. NF-κB binding activity was determined using the TransAM™ NF-κB p65 Transcription Factor Assay ELISA kit (Active Motif). 25 μg of liver nuclear extract was used in each well. PKCɛ Activity—PKCɛ membrane translocation assays were performed according to methods previously described (40Qu X. Seale J.P. Donnelly R. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 162: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 50Donnelly R. Reed M.J. Azhar S. Reaven G.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 874-878Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of crude membrane and cytosol protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE using an 8% gel and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride. Membranes were immunoblotted with a rabbit anti-peptide antibody against PKCɛ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted 1:100 in rinsing solution. PKCɛ translocation was expressed as the ratio of arbitrary units of membrane bands over cytosol bands. Protein bands were quantified using a Bio-Rad Chemidoc SRX and Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad). Statistics—Data were analyzed by Student’s t test or Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance with Dunn multiple comparison post-test. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Liver-specific Overexpression of GPAT1—To examine the effects of GPAT1 overexpression on hepatic lipid metabolism, chow-fed Wistar rats were studied 5–7 days after treatment with 1.0–2.0 × 1012 particles/ml of Ad-GPAT1 or Ad-EGFP virus. The recombinant adenovirus employed direct expression of a FLAG-tagged version of GPAT, allowing specific detection of the overexpressed protein in virus-transduced tissues. Rats treated with Ad-GPAT1 had 2.7-fold higher liver NEM-resistant GPAT1 activity than rats treated with Ad-EGFP virus (Fig. 2A). No increase in NEM-resistant GPAT1 activity was detected in epididymal fat from Ad-GPAT1-treated rats (Ad-EGFP, 0.36 ± 0.1, and Ad-GPAT1, 0.41 ± 0.1 nmol/min/mg protein; n = 6). GPAT1-FLAG expression was detected in liver but not in skeletal muscle or heart from Ad-GPAT1-treated rats and no GPAT1-FLAG was detected in liver from Ad-EGFP-treated rats (Fig. 2B). EGFP expression was detected in liver by Western blot in all Ad-EGFP-treated rats (data not shown). Plasma alanine aminotransferase levels were within the normal range in both Ad-GPAT1- and Ad-EGFP-treated rats, and alanine aminotransferase values did not differ between groups, indicating that viral treatments did not cause significant cytotoxic effects (Table 1).TABLE 1Physiologic and plasma measurementsEGFPGPATPhysiologic parameters after 4 h fastBody weight (g)342 ± 8329 ± 6Food intake/day26.5 ± 1.724.1 ± 1.2Liver weight (g)15.8 ± .0516.5 ± 0.7Liver weight (% of body wt)4.6 ± 0.15.0 ± 0.1Liver glycogen (μg/mg protein)23 ± 217 ± 3ap < 0.01; 4-h fast (Ad-EGFP, n = 9; Ad-GPAT, n = 11).Epididymal fat weight (g)3.6 ± 0.23.3 ± 0.1Epididymal fat weight (% of body wt)1.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1Plasma parameters after 4 h fastAlanine aminotransferase (units/liter)67 ± 1947 ± 7Triacylglycerol (mg/dl)179 ± 28472 ± 97ap < 0.01; 4-h fast (Ad-EGFP, n = 9; Ad-GPAT, n = 11).Cholesterol (mg/dl)91 ± 7103 ± 7Fatty acid (μm)120 ± 0.0190 ± 30bp < 0.05.β-Hydroxybutyrate (mg/dl)2.0 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.1Blood glucose (mg/dL)cAfter an overnight fast, the glucose values were 127.4 ± 4.5 (Ad-EGFP, n = 8) and 126.2 ± 4.7 (Ad-GPAT1, n = 8), and the insulin values were 0.76 ± 0.19 (Ad-EGFP, n = 8) and 0.93 ± 0.1 (Ad-GPAT, n = 8).128 ± 4118 ± 3bp < 0.05.Insulin (ng/ml)4.5 ± 0.43.4 ± 0.5Insulin/glucose ratio0.035 ± 0.0040.029 ± 0.004Leptin (ng/ml)3.4 ± 0.62.4 ± 0.5TNF-α (pg/ml)77 ± 1450 ± 14IL-6 (pg/ml)27 ± 1138 ± 9IL-1β (pg/ml)15 ± 424 ± 4a p < 0.01; 4-h fast (Ad-EGFP, n = 9; Ad-GPAT, n = 11).b p < 0.05.c After an overnight fast, the glucose values were 127.4 ± 4.5 (Ad-EGFP, n = 8) and 126.2 ± 4.7 (Ad-GPAT1, n = 8), and the insulin values were 0.76 ± 0.19 (Ad-EGFP, n = 8) and 0.93 ± 0.1 (Ad-GPAT, n = 8). Open table in a new tab Hepatic Overexpression of GPAT1 Causes Hepatic Steatosis, Hypertriglyceridemia, and Muscle TAG Accumulation—Overexpression of GPAT1 increased hepatic TAG content 2.7-fold (Fig. 3A). Thus, GPAT1 appeared to increase hepatic glycerolipid synthesis. The hepatic steatosis observed in Ad-GPAT1-treated rats was accompanied by a 2.6-fold increase in total plasma TAG concentration (Table 1). TAG content in plasma VLDL fractions was 4-fold higher in Ad-GPAT1-treated rats (Fig. 3C). Although total plasma cholesterol content did not change with Ad-GPAT1 treatment (Table 1), VLDL cholesterol was 2.5-fold higher in Ad-GPAT1-treated rats, whereas the LDL cholesterol concentration was slightly lower (Fig. 3D). These data suggested that GPAT1 directs the synthesis of a TAG pool that is available for both cytosolic storage and secretion in VLDL. To determine whether the increase in plasma TAG in Ad-GPAT-1-treated rats was due to an increase in secretion of VLDL particles or to an increase in TAG incorporation into VLDL particles, VLDL apoB100 and apoB48 levels were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of VLDL lipoprotein fractions. No differences in apoB100 or apoB48 protein levels were observed (data not shown), suggesting that the increase in VLDL TAG was due to an increased amount of TAG incorporated into each particle rather than an increase in the number of VLDL particles secreted. These results are similar to those observed in mice treated with Ad-GPAT1, which had increased TAG secretion with no increases in plasma apoB concentration (37Lindé;n D. William-Olsson L. Ahnmark A. Ekroos K. Hallberg C. Sjogren H.P. Becker B. Svensson L. Clapham J.C. Oscarsson J. Schreyer S. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 434-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition to increased TAG content in liver and plasma, gastrocnemius muscle in Ad-GPAT1-treated rats contained more TAG (Fig. 3B), and soleus muscle (EGFP 94.6 ± 37.6; GPAT 185.7 ± 54.0 ng/μg of protein, p = 0.25) and heart muscle (EGFP 14.5 ± 1.4; GPAT 21.2 ± 2.4 ng/μg protein, p = 0.07) also had a trend toward higher TAG content in Ad-GPAT1-treated rats.

Here we show that C/EBPβ inactivation in Leprdb/db mice attenuates obesity, fatty liver, and diabetes. In addition to impaired adipogenesis, livers from C/EBPβ-/- x Leprdb/db mice had dramatically decreased triglyceride content and reduced lipogenic enzyme activity. C/EBPβ deletion in Leprdb/db mice down-regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and up-regulated PPARα independent of SREBP1c. Conversely, C/EBPβ overexpression in wild-type mice increased PPARγ2 and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 mRNA and hepatic triglyceride content. In FAO cells, overexpression of the liver inhibiting form of C/EBPβ or C/EBPβ RNA interference attenuated palmitate-induced triglyceride accumulation and reduced PPARγ2 and triglyceride levels in the liver in vivo. Leptin and the anti-diabetic drug metformin acutely down-regulated C/EBPβ expression in hepatocytes, whereas fatty acids up-regulate C/EBPβ expression. These data provide novel evidence linking C/EBPβ expression to lipogenesis and energy balance with important implications for the treatment of obesity and fatty liver disease.

Obesity is the most common nutritional disorder in Western societies. Today in the United States, more than 60% of people are either overweight (body mass index (BMI) > 25) or obese (BMI > 30) (1Mokdad A.H. Bowman B.A. Ford E.S. Vinicor F. Marks J.S. Koplan J.P. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 286: 1195-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Obesity is frequently associated with type II diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, all known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (2Burton B.T. Foster W.R. Hirsch J. Van Itallie T.B. Int. J. Obes. 1985; 9: 155-170PubMed Google Scholar). Obesity is also a major risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, one of the most common emerging liver diseases in Western countries coinciding with the worldwide obesity epidemic (3Clark J.M. J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 2006; 40: S5-S10PubMed Google Scholar, 4Marchesini G. Babini M. Minerva Cardioangiol. 2006; 54: 229-239PubMed Google Scholar). The underlying transcriptional events that contribute to obesity and its associated disorders are not well understood. Some of the genes that regulate body weight have been identified as well as additional neuropeptides, hormones, and nutritional factors that play a role in body weight regulation, particularly through the β-adrenergic system (5Collins S. Surwit R.S. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 309-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 6Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Seeley R.J. Baskin D.G.

Discovery of the hormone leptin and its receptors, which suppress appetite and reduce fat mass, has dramatically increased our understanding of the regulation of energy balance (7Chen G. Koyama K.

Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family includes five nuclear transcription factors, C/EBP α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ, encoded by separate genes located on different chromosomes (13Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 14Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Collectively, C/EBPs are expressed across a variety of cell types, and a large body of data exists on their expression patterns, the promoters they regulate, and the signals that modulate expression and/or activity (15Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 16Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The great majority of this information was obtained in vitro. Members of the C/EBP family can form homo- and heterodimers within the promoters of genes, often making it difficult to distinguish between unique and redundant functions of the transcription factors on gene expression. However, in recent years mice have been generated with null mutations for each of the C/EBP genes, allowing the identification of unique and physiologically relevant functions.Although C/EBPα shares a similar tissue distribution with C/EBPβ, they are differentially regulated during development and in response to changes in nutrition and hormonal status. C/EBPα knock-out mice are born without lipid or glycogen reserves and die of neonatal hypoglycemia several hours after birth due in part to the absence of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and glycogen synthase (17Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). There was no significant increase in either C/EBPβ or -δ mRNA in the livers of these mice, suggesting C/EBPα may be part of a developmental program aimed at preparing the fetus for metabolism during the early prenatal period (18Darlington G.J. Wang N. Hanson R.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Adult mice lacking C/EBPβ fail to increase gluconeogenesis during fasting and have reduced fat deposition, resulting in hypoglycemia and reduced non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) that act systemically to increase insulin sensitivity (19Liu S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7292-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed that C/EBPβ rescued the role of C/EBPα in liver but not in white adipose tissue (WAT), emphasizing the unique role of C/EBPα in adipogenesis and C/EBPβ in gluconeogenesis.Although C/EBPs regulate adipogenesis and gluconeogenesis, their ability to regulate hepatic lipid metabolism remains relatively unexplored. Recently, Matsusue et al. (23Matsusue K. Gavrilova O. Lambert G. Brewer Jr., H.B. Ward J.M. Inoue Y. LeRoith D. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2751-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) demonstrated that liver-specific deletion of C/EBPα prevented accelerated lipogenesis in Leprob/ob mice. However, disruption of hepatic C/EBPα in normal adult mice appears to cause an exacerbation of hyperglycemia (24Inoue Y. Inoue J. Lambert G. Yim S.H. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44740-44748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and age-dependent increase in hepatosteatosis (24Inoue Y. Inoue J. Lambert G. Yim S.H. Gonzalez F.J. J.

The reason(s) for these differences in C/EBPα-/- mice is unclear but highlight important differences between C/EBPα and C/EBPβ with regard to their regulation and the metabolic phenotype.To address the potential role of C/EBPβ in the pathogenesis of obesity and related disorders, we generated C/EBPβ-/- mice on a Leprdb/db null background. Here we show that C/EBPβ inactivation in Leprdb/db mice attenuates adipogenesis, obesity, fatty liver, and diabetes. C/EBPβ deletion affected critical genes that regulate hepatic lipogenesis and triglyceride (TG) metabolism resulting in protection from liver steatosis, independent of sterol response element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c). Moreover, forced overexpression of C/EBPβ induced TG accumulation along with PPARγ and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) in vivo, whereas liver-specific inactivation in vivo and in liver cells in vitro can block TG accumulation, coincident with a reduction in PPARγ. Together these results demonstrate that in addition to its role in regulating adipogenesis and gluconeogenesis, C/EBPβ is necessary and sufficient to regulate hepatic lipogenesis independent of SREBP1c.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Crossing and GenotypingThe generation and genotyping procedures for C/EBPβ-/- and Leprdb/db mice have been described previously (26Nizielski S.E.

Mice deficient in C/EBPβ were backcrossed for up to eight generations with C57Bl/6J mice from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and intercrosses between heterozygous mice derived from these littermates. Double heterozygous offspring were then intercrossed to produce offspring with the following genotypes: wild-type (WT) mice (+/+ at the C/EBPβ and db locus), C/EBPβ-/- x Lepr+/+, C/EBPβ+/+ x Leprdb/db, and double knock-out C/EBPβ-/- x Leprdb/db mice. All mice were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle and were fed a standard mouse chow ad libitum. Experiments and sample collection took place in the early afternoon after a 6-h daytime food withdrawal for steady state measurements. The University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures.Determination of Serum Insulin, Adiponectin, Free Fatty Acids, and TGsBlood was collected from the tail vein at the times indicated. Plasma glucose levels were measured using an automatic glucose monitor (Roche Diagnostics). Serum insulin and adiponectin levels (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO and Alpco Diagnostics, Windham, NH), free fatty acids (Waco Diagnostics, Wako, TX), and TGs (Sigma-Aldrich) were measured using commercial kits, according to the manufacturers' recommended protocols.Determination of Body Fat ContentTo assess body composition (percentage of fat), whole-body measurements of intact mice were performed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, PIXImus; GE-Lunar Corp., Madison, WI) as described previously in mice at 16 weeks of age (28Barbour L.A. Shao J. Qiao L. Pulawa L.K. Jensen D.R. Bartke A. Garrity M. Draznin B. Friedman J.E. Am. J. Obstet.

The short term precision error for whole-body measurements was <2%. Results are presented as fat content and total body weight.Indirect CalorimetryMetabolic measurements were obtained using an open circuit indirect calorimetry system as described previously (30Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The system was calibrated against a standard gas mixture to measure O2 consumed and CO2 produced (ml/kg/h). Oxygen consumption was assessed individually in mice. After a 24-h period for adaptation to the metabolic chamber, VO2 and CO2 produced were assessed at 5-min intervals for a 72-h period. Mice had free access to water and food during the 12-h night period. Total oxygen consumption represents the mean of all samples collected during the experiment. Measurements of energy intake and energy expenditure were corrected for lean body weight.TG AssaysLiver samples were homogenized in microcentrifuge tubes using Kontes disposable pestles, whereas muscle was homogenized in Kontes Duall® homogenizers (Kimble/Kontes, Vineland, NJ). All tissues were initially homogenized in 8 volumes of deionized water to facilitate cell disruption; subsequently, 1 volume of 5 m NaCl was added to enhance partitioning of lipids into the organic phase. Plasma samples were analyzed directly, whereas tissue sample homogenates were extracted using a modification of the method described by Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 200-μl aliquot of 10% homogenate prepared in 0.5 m NaCl was mixed with 500 μl of methanol, vortexed, then mixed with 250 μl of chloroform and vortexed again for 2 min. The single-phase mixture was broken into two phases by the addition of 250 μl of water followed by 250 μl of chloroform with mixing between each addition. After centrifugation, the lower, organic phase was collected in shell vials. Complete extraction of any residual lipids was ensured by reextracting with 250 μlof chloroform:methanol (9:1). The organic phase was separated by centrifugation and combined with the first extraction. Samples were dried with an N-Evap (Organomation Associates, Berlin, MA) under flowing nitrogen. The lipids were re-dissolved in a solution of 90% isopropanol, 10% Triton X-100 (2%) to disperse the TGs for assay. TGs were measured colorimetrically (TR0100, Sigma-Aldrich). For RNA interference (RNAi) experiments, TGs were extracted from FAO rat liver cells after the tert-butanol extraction method described previously (32Perdomo G. Commerford S.R. Richard A.T.

Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and photographed at ×50 magnification. For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparafinized in xylenes and rehydrated, and antigen retrieval was performed in heated citrate buffer. Sections were blocked in 1.5% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight with primary antibody diluted in the PBS, 1.5% goat serum overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies to the following targets were: C/EBPα (sc-61, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), PPARγ2 (2492, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) (PREF-12A, Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (M0879, DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), Akt1 (Upstate, Chicago, IL). Sections were then rinsed 3× in PBS and incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h in PBS. Sections were rinsed three times in PBS, and coverslips were mounted with Vectamount with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (fluorescent nuclear stain, Vector Laboratories). Images of fluorescent-labeled sections were taken with a SPOT RT camera connected to a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U microscope and captured to a PowerMac G4 computer. Phase contrast images were taken with a SPOT Insight camera attached to the same microscope. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS software. Fluorescent terminal dUTP nick-end labeling staining for apoptotic cells was performed using the ApoAlert DNA fragmentation assay kit from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Western Blot AnalysisTo measure nuclear C/EBPβ and SREBP1c protein levels, liver nuclear extracts were prepared from frozen liver samples. Liver tissue (50-70 mg) was homogenized in 300-500 μlof hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine). The supernatants (cytoplasmic extracts) were saved. The pellets were re-suspended in 40 μl of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, 400 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine) for 30 min on ice with occasional vortexing. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatants (nuclear extracts) were saved. The protein concentration was measured with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Lysates were subjected to SDS/PAGE on 10% gradient gels. Proteins were transferred and immobilized on Immobilon-P membrane. The membranes were immunoblotted with respective primary and secondary antibodies, and bands were visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified by densitometry. Primary antibodies used were SCD-1 (sc-1475, Santa Cruz), PPARα (sc-9000), PPARγ2 (sc-22020), C/EBPβ (sc-150), CD36 (ABM5526, Cascade Biosciences), phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK; Thr-172, 2531, Cell Signaling), SREBP1c (sc-366), adipophilin (ADPH; RDI-PROGP40, Fitzgerald Industries, Concord, MA), and GAPDH (sc-20358). The antibody to the LDL receptor was supplied in kind from Dr. Jay Horton (UT-Southwestern). Primary antibodies were diluted 1:300-1:500 in 5% nonfat dry milk. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Bio-Rad) and were diluted 1:10000 in 5% nonfat dry milk.Hepatic Enzyme ActivityLivers were from 16-week-old mice fasted for 6 h. Animals were anesthetized with 150 μl of avertin (2.5%) followed by rapid removal and freezing on dry ice within 1 min. The samples were stored at -80 °C until analysis. Tissue (100 mg) was homogenized for 30 s in 2.0 ml of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, using a Tissumizer (Polytron) homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 130 min at 68,000 × g. From the supernatant 0.5 ml was gel-filtered using NAP 5 columns (GE Healthcare). For citrate lyase derivation the columns were equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, whereas for fatty acid synthase assays the columns were equilibrated and eluted with 0.5 m potassium phosphate buffer, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. Activity of ATP citrate lyase was determined spectrophotometrically as described previously (33Corrigan A.P. Rider C.C. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in duplicate and were linear for at least 15 min after the addition of CoA. Fatty acid synthase (FAS) was activated before analysis (34Nepokroeff C.M. Lakshmanan M.R. Porter J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) by incubating the gel-filtered high speed supernatant at 37 °C for 15 min before assay. Activity of FAS was then determined spectrophotometrically (34Nepokroeff C.M. Lakshmanan M.R. Porter J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in duplicate and were linear for at least 5 min after the addition of malonyl CoA and acetyl CoA.Adenovirus PurificationAdenovirus was propagated in HEK293 cells. Cells were harvested when cytopathic effects were visible in more than 90% of the cells. Adenovirus was released from cells through rapid freeze/thawing. Adenovirus was purified via cesium chloride gradients and dialyzed into virion dialysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50% glycerol). Titer was measured using A260.RNAi Adenovirus ConstructionShort hairpin RNA (shRNA) designed for C/EBPβ targeted the 3′-untranslated region (5′-CCGGGCCCTGAGTAATCAC-3′). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were designed and cloned into pSUPER (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) as described previously (35Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar). Cloning into the adenoviral shuttle vector EH006, and virus propagation was described previously (36Bain J.R. Schisler J.C. Takeuchi K. Newgard C.B. Becker T.C. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Adenovirus TransductionAnimals—Adenovirus (1 × 1010-1 × 1011 pfu/ml adenovirus in 150 μl of PBS) expressing the C/EBPβ isoforms, LAP (Adv-LAP) or LIP (Adv-LIP), or GFP (Adv-GFP) alone (control) were injected via tail vein into mice. Animals were sacrificed 4 days post-injection. Liver was removed, and nuclear homogenates were prepared for Western blotting or preserved in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).Cells—FAO cells were transduced 24 h after plating with Adv-GFP, Adv-LAP, or Adv-LIP and treated with or without 200 μm palmitate (molar ratio of 1 palmitate:3 albumin) for 24 h before harvesting. For RNAi experiments, FAO cells were transduced with or without adenovirus-delivered shRNA targeting C/EBPβ (Adv-C/EBPβ-shRNA) 24 h and treated with or without 200 μm palmitate for 48 h before harvesting.Treatment of FAO Cells with MetforminFAO cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin 100 IU/ml, streptomycin 100 μg/ml) in 5% CO2. Cells were subsequently serum-starved overnight then treated for 4 h with metformin (20, 50, 200, 500 μm). Separate cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (21Arizmendi C. Liu S. Croniger C. Poli V. Friedman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13033-13040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein (50 μg) was electrophoresed, blotted, and probed with specific antibodies.Liver Perfusion StudiesIsolated perfused rat liver preparation has been described previously (37Huang W. Dedousis N. Bhatt B.A. O'Doherty R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Livers were perfused with 400 ml of re-circulating oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer with or without leptin (9-fold above basal) for 90 min in the presence or absence of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (10 μm). Livers were removed and kept frozen at -80 °C until analysis of C/EBPβ protein by Western blot analysis.Quantitative Real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted from homogenized mouse liver or FAO cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 250-1000 ng of total RNA using the Superscript III enzyme and random hexamers (Invitrogen). cDNAs were amplified using Platinum quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen) and TaqMan Gene Expression assays (ABI, Foster City, CA), or custom assays were designed using Primer Express (ABI) software on an Opticon 2 (Bio-Rad) or ABI 7700 real-time PCR system. RNA expression data were normalized to levels of 18 S RNA, which was unaffected by adenoviral transduction or animal genotype. The TaqMan ID number for genes analyzed are as follows: acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1, Mm00443579_m1; FAS, Mm00662319_m1; PPARα, Mm00440939_m1; PPARγ, Mm00440945_m1; SCD-1, Mm00772290_m1; GAPDH, 4308313; 18 S RNA, 4308329. For C/EBPβ, a custom designed assay from ABI was used (forward primer, 5′-AAGAGCCGCGACAAGGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTCAGCTCCAGCACCTTGTG-3′, probe 5′-AAGATGCGCAACCTGGAGACGCA-3′).Statistical AnalysisStatistical comparisons between groups were made using Student's t test or analysis of variance where appropriate. All values are reported as the mean plus or minus S.E., and differences were considered to be statistically significant at p values less than 0.05.RESULTSC/EBPβ Deletion Decreases Weight Gain and Fat Mass in Leprdb/db Mice—To determine whether C/EBPβ deficiency can protect against a genetic form of obesity and its related syndromes, we intercrossed C/EBPβ+/- and Leprdb/+ mice and obtained mice deficient in both C/EBPβ and leptin receptors (C/EBPβ-/- x Leprdb/db). The frequency for obtaining C/EBPβ-/- x Leprdb/db progeny was lower than expected due to partial embryonic lethality of C/EBPβ-/- mice (38Croniger C. Trus M. Lysek-Stupp K. Cohen H. Liu Y. Darlington G.J. Poli V. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26306-26312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). At weaning (4 weeks of age) the body weight differences between Leprdb/db and C/EBPβ-/- x Leprdb/db mice were indistinguishable (Fig. 1A). However, by 12 weeks of age Leprdb/db mice were overtly obese, whereas C/EBPβ-/- x Leprdb/db mice weighed significantly less (p < 0.05). By 16 weeks of age C/EBPβ-/- x Leprdb/db mice weighed 13.21 ± 0.76 g less, a difference of 25% (p < 0.01). The lower body weight in C/EBPβ-/- x Leprdb/db mice was accompanied by a reduction in total fat mass of 10.7 ± 0.56 g as determined by whole-body DEXA scanning (Fig. 1B). However, C/EBPβ-/- x Leprdb/db mice also had significantly less lean body mass by 3.1 ± 0.15 g, suggesting the decrease in body weight could be associated with increased energy expenditure or perhaps reduced energy intake.

https://openalex.org/W2077850223,"More than 60% of low-grade non-invasive papillary urothelial cell carcinomas contain activating point mutations of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). The phenotypic consequences of constitutive activation of FGFR3 in bladder cancer have not been elucidated and further studies are required to confirm the consequences of inhibiting receptor activity in urothelial cells. We measured FGFR3 transcript levels and demonstrated that transcript levels were significantly more abundant in low-stage and grade tumours. We identified a tumour cell line, 97-7, expressing the most common FGFR3 mutation (S249C) at similar FGFR3 transcript levels to low-stage and grade tumours. In these cells, S249C FGFR3 protein formed stable homodimers and was constitutively phosphorylated. We used retrovirus-mediated delivery of shRNA to knockdown S249C FGFR3. This induced cell flattening, decreased cell proliferation and reduced clonogenicity on plastic and in soft agar. However, no effects of knockdown of wild-type FGFR3 were observed in telomerase immortalized normal human urothelial cells, indicating possible dependence of the tumour cell line on mutant FGFR3. Re-expression of S249C FGFR3 in shRNA-expressing 97-7 cells resulted in a reversal of phenotypic changes, confirming the specificity of the shRNA. These results indicate that targeted inhibition of S249C FGFR3 may represent a useful therapeutic approach in superficial bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2005315872,"Dysregulation of copper and zinc homeostasis in the brain plays a critical role in Alzheimer disease (AD). Copper binding to amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is linked with the neurotoxicity of Abeta and free radical damage. Metallothionein-3 (MT-3) is a small cysteine- and metal-rich protein expressed in the brain and found down-regulated in AD. This protein occurs intra- and extracellularly, and it plays an important role in the metabolism of zinc and copper. In cell cultures Zn7MT-3, by an unknown mechanism, protects neurons from the toxicity of Abeta. We have, therefore, used a range of complementary spectroscopic and biochemical methods to characterize the interaction of Zn7MT-3 with free Cu2+ ions. We show that Zn7MT-3 scavenges free Cu2+ ions through their reduction to Cu+ and binding to the protein. In this reaction thiolate ligands are oxidized to disulfides concomitant with Zn2+ release. The binding of the first four Cu2+ is cooperative forming a Cu(I)4-thiolate cluster in the N-terminal domain of Cu4,Zn4MT-3 together with two disulfides bonds. The Cu4-thiolate cluster exhibits an unusual stability toward air oxygen. The results of UV-visible, CD, and Cu(I) phosphorescence at 77 K suggest the existence of metal-metal interactions in this cluster. We have demonstrated that Zn7MT-3 in the presence of ascorbate completely quenches the copper-catalyzed hydroxyl radical (OH.) production. Thus, zinc-thiolate clusters in Zn7MT-3 can efficiently silence the redox-active free Cu2+ ions. The biological implication of our studies as to the protective role of Zn7MT-3 from the Cu2+ toxicity in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders is discussed."

Herein, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel arabinofuranosyltransferase, now termed AftB (Rv3805c), which is essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Deletion of its orthologue NCgl2780 in the closely related species Corynebacterium glutamicum resulted in a viable mutant. Analysis of the cell wall-associated lipids from the deletion mutant revealed a decreased abundance of cell wall-bound mycolic acids, consistent with a partial loss of mycolylation sites. Subsequent glycosyl linkage analysis of arabinogalactan also revealed the complete absence of terminal β(1 → 2)-linked arabinofuranosyl residues. The deletion mutant biochemical phenotype was fully complemented by either Mt-AftB or Cg-AftB, but not with muteins of Mt-AftB, where the two adjacent aspartic acid residues, which have been suggested to be involved in glycosyltransferase activity, were replaced by alanine.

The biosynthesis of AG involves the formation of a linear galactan chain with alternating β(1 → 5) and β(1 → 6)-d-galactofuranosyl (Galf) residues of ∼30 residues in length from the specialized “linker unit,” l-Rhap-(1 → 4)-α-d-GlcNAc (20Mikusova K.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) analyzes of per-O-methylated AG of C. glutamicum deleted of its single arabinofuranosyltransferase, Cg-emb, revealed that the 8th, 10th, and 12th Galf residue possessed singular Araf residues (9Alderwick L.J.

It is interesting to note that the arabinan domain of AG utilizes several different Araf linkages, which suggests that additional arabinofuranosyltransferases must be required to form a fully matured AG. Moreover, initial Araf residues at branching sites could require specialized arabinofuranosyltransferases as already observed for AftA (19Alderwick L.J. Seidel M. Sahm H. Besra G.S. Eggeling L. J.

Clearly additional arabinofuranosyltransferases still remain to be identified in Corynebacterianeae. Indeed, Liu and Mushegian (29Liu J. Mushegian A.

Herein we present Rv3805c as a new arabinofuranosyltransferase of the GT-C superfamily that is responsible for the transfer of Araf residues from DPA to the arabinan domain to form terminal β(1 → 2)-linked Araf residues, which marks the “end point” for AG arabinan biosynthesis before decoration with mycolic acids. Strains and Culture Conditions—M. tuberculosis H37Rv DNA was obtained from the Tuberculosis Research Material Contract (National Institutes of Health) at Colorado State University. C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (the wild type strain, and referred for the remainder of the text as C. glutamicum) and Escherichia coli DH5α were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB, Difco) at 30 and 37 °C, respectively. The mutants generated in this study were grown on complex brain heart infusion medium (32Eggeling L. Reyes O. Eggeling L. Bott M. Handbook of Corynebacterium glutamicum. 2005; (pp. , CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL): 535-566Crossref Google Scholar). Kanamycin and ampicillin were used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Samples for lipid analyzes were prepared by harvesting cells at an optical density of 10–15 followed by a saline wash and freeze drying. Construction of Plasmids and Strains—The vectors made were pMSX-Cg-aftB (NCgl2780), pMSX-Mt-aftB (Rv3805c), and pK19mobsacBΔaftB, with the gene number of the M. tuberculosis and C. glutamicum aftB orthologue added in parentheses. To express M. tuberculosis aftB in C. glutamicum, the primer pair GTATGAGCATATGGTCCGGGTCAGCTTGTGG (all primers in 5′-3′direction) and ATTGCCCCTCACTCGAGCTCCCGCGGTGGCGGG was used, with the restriction sites NdeI and XhoI underlined, using M. tuberculosis H37Rv chromosomal DNA as a template. The purified PCR fragment was ligated with accordingly digested pMSX to give pMSX-Mt-aftB. pMSX was prepared from pEKEx2 (33Eikmanns B.J. Kleinertz E. Liebl W. Sahm H. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) to generate a derivative providing an appropriate ribosome binding site together with a C-terminal His tag. It was created by the individual cleavage of pEKEx2 with NdeI and XhoI, each followed by Klenow treatment and religation. The intermediate construct was SalI/DraI-cleaved, treated with mung bean nuclease, and ligated with the XbaI/MroI fragment from pET22b (Novagen), which before use was treated with the Klenow fragment to eventually yield pMSX. To overexpress Cg-aftB, the primer pair ATGTGGCCATATGACGTTTAGCCCCCAGCGTC and TGTTTACTCGAGCTGAGAGCTATATAAAGGTTCTCCGC was used to amplify C. glutamicum aftB, which was ligated with NdeI- and XhoI-cleaved pMSX to generate pMSX-Cg-aftB. To construct the deletion vector pK19mobsacBΔaftB crossover PCR was applied with primer pairs AB (A, ACGCCAAGCTTTGCTAGTCGCTGCGTTTGGTTC; B, CCCATCCACTAAACACTGGGGGCTAAACGTCATGAG) and CD (C, TGTTTAAGTTTAGTGGATGGGGAACCTCGCGGAGAACCTTTATATA; D, GCCAGTGAATTCGGCGCGCAGCGTTGGTATC) and C. glutamicum genomic DNA as template. Both amplified products were used in a second PCR with primer pairs AD to generate a fragment consisting of sequences adjacent to Cg-aftB, which was blunt end-ligated with SmaI-cleaved pK19mobsacB. All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. The chromosomal deletion of Cg-aftB was performed as described previously using two rounds of positive selection (34Schafer A. Tauch A. Jager W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Puhler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar), and its successful deletion was verified by use of different primer pairs. Plasmid pMSX-Mt-aftB and pMSX-Cg-aftB were introduced into C. glutamicumΔaftB by electroporation with selection to kanamycin resistance (25 μg/ml). Site-specific mutations were introduced in Mt-aftB using appropriate mutagenic primers and pMSX-Mt-aftB as the double-stranded template (QuikChange kit, Stratagene). After linear amplification of the newly synthesized strands and DpnI digestion of parental strands, plasmids pMSX-Mt-aftB-D29A and pMSX-Mt-aftB-D30A were generated carrying the mutations as indicated. All plasmids were verified by sequencing. Protein Analysis—Recombinant C. glutamicum strains deleted of the chromosomal Cg-aftB copy but carrying either pMSX, pMSX-Mt-aftB, pMSX-Mt-aftB-D29A, or pMSX-Mt-aftB-D30A were each grown in LB up to an optical density of 4. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 30 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer, containing 200 mm NaCl and 50 mm imidazole and disrupted by probe sonication. Centrifugation at 27,000 × g resulted in a clear supernatant, which was applied to a 1-ml HiTrap™ chelating high performance column (GE Healthcare) using an AåTKA chromatography system. The column was initially washed with 10 ml of the aforementioned buffer, and bound proteins were subsequently eluted with 2 ml of the same buffer but containing 500 mm imidazole. Eluted proteins were precipitated, dried, and resuspended in 10 μl of loading buffer, and SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, which was subsequently stained using 0.05% Coomassie G250 in 10% acetic acid and 25% isopropanol. Bands of interest were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin before peptide mass fingerprinting. Peptides were extracted by the sequential addition of water (12 μl) and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 30% (v/v) acetonitrile (10 μl) and analyzed manually using an Applied Biosystems Voyager STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Weiterstadt, Germany). Extraction and Analysis of Cell Wall-associated and Cell Wall-bound Lipids—Cells (100 mg) were extracted by two consecutive extractions using 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10: 10:3, v/v/v) for 3 h at 50°C, and the resulting delipidated cells were stored for further use (as described below). Organic extracts were combined with 1.75 ml of CHCl3 and 0.75 ml H2O, mixed, and centrifuged. The lower organic phase was recovered, washed twice with 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:47:48, v/v/v), dried, and resuspended in 200 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v/v). An aliquot (20 μl) was analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel plates (5735 silica gel 60F254, Merck) developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (60:16:2, v/v/v). TLCs were visualized by charring with 5% molybdophosphoric acid in ethanol at 100 °C to reveal cell wall-associated lipids. The bound corynomycolic acids from delipidated extracts or purified cell walls (see below) were released by the addition of a 5% aqueous solution of tetra-butyl ammonium hydroxide followed by overnight incubation at 100 °C and methylated as described previously (9Alderwick L.J. Radmacher E. Seidel M. Gande R. Hitchen P.G. Morris H.R. Dell A. Sahm H. Eggeling L. Besra G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32362-32371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Corynomycolic acid methyl esters (CMAMEs) were analyzed by TLC using silica gel plates (5735 silica gel 60F254, Merck) developed in petroleum ether/acetone (95:5, v/v). TLCs were visualized by charring with 5% molybdophosphoric acid in ethanol at 100 °C to reveal CMAMEs. Alternatively, 14C labeling of cell wall-associated lipids and cell wall-bound corynomycolic acids was performed by growing cultures initially at 30 °C in 5 ml of brain heart infusion media supplemented with antibiotic where appropriate. Once the optical density reached ∼0.5, cultures were labeled with 5 μCi of [14C]acetic acid (50–62 μCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and further incubated for 8 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell wall-associated lipids were extracted as described above. The cell wall-associated 14C-labeled lipids were resuspended in 200 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v/v), and an aliquot (5 μl) was dried in a scintillation vial and then mixed with 10 ml of EcoScintA scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and counted. Equal counts (25,000 cpm) of each sample were analyzed by TLC using silica gel plates (5735 silica gel 60F254, Merck) developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (60:16:2, v/v/v) and quantified using phosphorimaging after exposure to Kodak X-Omat film for 24 h. The bound [14C]corynomycolic acids from the delipidated extracts were released by base treatment and methylated as described above to afford [14C]CMAMEs. The [14C]CMAMEs were resuspended in 100 μl of CH2Cl2, and an aliquot (5 μl) was dried in a scintillation vial and then mixed with 10 ml of EcoScintA scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics) and counted to quantify cell wall-bound [14C]corynomycolic acids. A 5-μl aliquot of [14C]CMAMEs was also analyzed by TLC using silica gel plates (5735 silica gel 60F254, Merck) developed in petroleum ether/acetone (95:5, v/v). TLC autoradiograms were obtained by exposing TLCs to Kodak X-Omat film for 24 h.

https://openalex.org/W2002852234,"Ten years have passed since the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae–more precisely, the S288c strain–was completely sequenced. However, experimental work in yeast is commonly performed using strains that are of unknown genetic relationship to S288c. Here, we characterized the nucleotide-level similarity between S288c and seven commonly used lab strains (A364A, W303, FL100, CEN.PK, ∑1278b, SK1 and BY4716) using 25mer oligonucleotide microarrays that provide complete and redundant coverage of the ∼12 Mb Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Using these data, we assessed the frequency and distribution of nucleotide variation in comparison to the sequenced reference genome. These data allow us to infer the relationships between experimentally important strains of yeast and provide insight for experimental designs that are sensitive to sequence variation. We propose a rational approach for near complete sequencing of strains related to the reference using these data and directed re-sequencing. These data and new visualization tools are accessible online in a new resource: the Yeast SNPs Browser (YSB; http://gbrowse.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/yeast_strains_snps) that is available to all researchers."
https://openalex.org/W1986500842,"Accumulation of frameshift mutations at genes containing coding mononucleotide repeats is thought to be the major molecular mechanism by which mismatch repair-deficient cells accumulate functional alterations. These mutations resulting from microsatellite instability (MSI) can affect genes involved in pathways with a putative oncogenic role, but may also arise in genes without any expected role in MSI carcinogenesis because of the high mutation background of these tumours. We here screened 39 MSI colorectal tumours for the presence of mutations in 25 genes involved in DNA damage signalling and repair pathways. Using a maximum likelihood statistical method, these genes were divided into two different groups that differed significantly in their mutation frequencies, and likely represent mutations that do or do not provide selective pressure during MSI tumour progression. Interestingly, the so-called real-target mutational events were found to be distributed among genes involved in different functional pathways of the DNA metabolism, for example, DNA damage signalling (DNA-PKcs, ATR), double-strand break (DSB) repair (DNA-PKcs, RAD50), mismatch repair (MSH3, MSH6, MBD4) and replication (POLD3). In particular, mutations in MRE11 and/or RAD50 were observed in the vast majority of the tumours and resulted in the concomitant loss of immunohistochemical expression of both proteins. These data might explain why MSI colorectal cancers (CRC) behave differently in response to a wide variety of chemotherapeutic agents, notably those targeting DNA. More generally, they give further insights into how MSI leads to functional changes with synergistic effects in oncogenic pathways."

The benzylisoquinoline alkaloids are a large and diverse group of plant secondary metabolites, many of which possess potent pharmacological and other bioactive properties. Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is an extensively cultivated medicinal plant that produces more than 80 benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, including the narcotic analgesics morphine and codeine and the antimicrobial sanguinarine. The effectiveness of sanguinarine as an inhibitor of fungal and bacterial growth suggests that it protects the plant against pathogens (1Schmeller T. Latz-Bruning B. Wink M.

(S)-Reticuline represents the last common intermediate in the biosynthesis of both sanguinarine and morphine (13Facchini P.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

BBE converts (S)-reticuline to (S)-scoulerine as the first committed step in the branch pathway leading to protopine and benzophenanthridine alkaloids, such as sanguinarine (Fig. 1). Alternatively, (S)-reticuline is epimerized to (R)-reticuline in the first steps of the morphinan alkaloid pathway in opium poppy. (S)-Scoulerine is converted to (S)-stylopine by the formation of two methylenedioxy bridges by the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases cheilanthifoline synthase and stylopine synthase (14Bauer W.

(S)-Tetrahydroprotoberberine cis-N-methyltransferase (TNMT) converts (S)-stylopine to (S)-cis-N-methylstylopine, which is subsequently hydroxylated by the cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase, N-methylstylopine 14-hydroxylase (16Rueffer M. Zenk M.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1987; 28: 5307-5310Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The initial reaction product tautomerizes to protopine, which is hydroxylated to yield dihydrosanguinarine by another cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase, protopine 6-hydroxylase (17Tanahashi T. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 1113-1122Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Subsequent oxidation by dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase yields sanguinarine (18Schumacher H-M. Zenk M.H.

TNMT protein has been isolated from Eschscholzia californica and Corydalis vaginans cell cultures (30Rueffer M. Zumstein G. Zenk M.H.

Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, a cDNA encoding TNMT has not been reported. TNMT catalyzes the AdoMet-dependent methylation of the tertiary nitrogen of (S)-stylopine to produce the quaternary ammonium compound (S)-cis-N-methylstylopine, which is the ultimate precursor to protopine and the benzophenanthridine alkaloids (32Facchini P.J.

The transfer of a methyl group to a tertiary nitrogen atom is a relatively rare reaction in plant metabolism. Only two cDNAs encoding plant N-methyltransferases that catalyze the formation of low molecular weight quaternary ammonium compounds have been reported (33Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A.

We report the identification and functional characterization of a cDNA encoding TNMT from opium poppy. TNMT is the only AdoMet-dependent N-methyltransferase in plant alkaloid metabolism known to produce a quaternary ammonium compound, and the first enzyme specific to protopine and benzophenanthridine alkaloid biosynthesis to be characterized at the molecular biochemical level.

The sense primer contained a BamHI site and was specific for the 5′-end of the ORF (AtNMT-F; 5′-ATGCGGATCCAATGGAGAAGATTATTGACG-3′), whereas the antisense primer contained an EcoRI site and was complimentary to the 3′-end (AtNMT-R; 5′-TACAGAATTCTCATTTCTTCTTGAAGAGG-3′). Amplicons were ligated into pRSETB (Invitrogen) using the engineered restriction sites to produce pTNMT and pDLAt120, respectively. Escherichia coli strain ER2566 pLysS (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was transformed with pTNMT or pDLAt120. Cultures were shaken at 30 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg–1 ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg–1 ml) to an A600 of 0.6 and subsequently induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4.5 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min. E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI) was transformed with pTNMT, and cultures were shaken at 30 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg–1 ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg–1 ml) to an A600 of 0.6. Cultures were induced with 0.2 mm IPTG for 17 h at 22 °C and harvested at 5000 × g for 5 min. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing pepstatin A(5 μm) and leupeptin (5 μm) and lysed using a French press at 15,000 p.s.i. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and desalted on PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of Recombinant TNMT—E. coli ER2566 pLysS cells harboring the pTNMT plasmid were used to produce recombinant TNMT, which was precipitated from the crude bacterial lysate using 20–40% (w/v) ammonium sulfate and resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4; 500 mm NaCl). After desalting, recombinant polyhistidine-tagged TNMT was purified by nickel affinity chromatography using a HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Immunoblot Analysis—Soluble proteins (25 μg) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to BioTrace NT nitrocellulose membranes (Pall Life Sciences, Pensacola, FL). Protein blots were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-polyhistidine clone HIS-1 (Sigma) diluted 1:3000 in Blotto (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% (w/v) milk protein) for 12 h, washed in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20), and incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). The membranes were washed in TBST and developed in alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5; 100 mm NaCl; 5 mm MgCl2) containing 20 μm nitro blue tetrazolium and 20 μm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates (44Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 1989; (Second Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays and Characterization Using Plant or Recombinant Proteins—Plant tissues were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Powdered tissues were extracted in buffer A. Debris were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS harboring the pTNMT plasmid was used to produce recombinant TNMT. A 20–40% (w/v) ammonium sulfate-precipitated protein fraction containing most of the soluble recombinant TNMT protein was used for enzyme characterization. TNMT activity was determined by incubating 10–15 μg of extracted soluble protein in buffer A containing 100 pmol (185 kBq) of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine, 25 or 50 nmol of (R,S)-stylopine, and 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol in a total volume of 50 μl. The buffers used to determine optimum pH were 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5–7) and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7–9), both of which contained 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After an incubation period of 30 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped with the addition of 1 n NaOH (5 μl), and the entire volume of each reaction was applied to a silica gel 60 F254 TLC plate (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ). TLC plates were developed in CHCl3/MeOH/NH3 (300:150:3 (v/v/v)) (30Rueffer M. Zumstein G. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1990; 12: 3727-3733Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and analyzed using a bio-imaging analyzer (FUJIX BAS 1000, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Radiolabeled spots were quantified using MacBAS software (Fujifilm). Controls were performed using an aliquot of each protein extract that had been denatured by incubation in boiling water for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (45Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were analyzed using Kaleidagraph 3.6 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Product Identification—Due to substrate availability, (R,S)-tetrahydropalmatine was used for product identification. Approximately 1 mg of crude bacterial lysate from E. coli producing recombinant TNMT was combined in buffer A with 2.5 μmol of (R,S)-tetrahydropalmatine and 2.5 μmol of S-adenosyl-l-methionine in a total volume of 2 ml and was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The assay mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate, and the organic fraction was subsequently concentrated under reduced pressure and extracted twice with 1 m HCl. The aqueous phase was evaporated to dryness and analyzed by low resolution EI-MS. The resulting mass spectrum (m/z: 369 (3), 355 (71), 192 (9), 190 (26), 164 (100), 149 (69)) was in agreement with that of N-methyltetrahydropalmatine (39Chen C-Y. MacLean D.B. Can. J.

We previously used this approach to identify cDNAs encoding opium poppy NCS isoforms with T. flavum NCS as the query sequence (4Liscombe D.K. Macleod B.P. Loukanina N. Nandi O.I. Facchini P.J. Phytochemistry. 2005; 66: 1374-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TNMT cDNA contained a 1,074-bp ORF flanked by an 86-bp 5′-untranslated region and a 266-bp 3′-untranslated region followed by a polyadenylate tract (supplemental Fig S1). The TNMT ORF encoded a predicted translation product of 358 amino acids with a molecular mass of 40.8 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.3. Analysis of the TNMT amino acid sequence using the TargetP server did not reveal the presence of any subcellular targeting sequences, suggesting that TNMT is located in the cytosol (50Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar). Several plant-derived and AdoMet-dependent O- and N-methyltransferases were subjected to phylogenetic analysis to examine the possible evolutionary relationships among these enzymes (Fig. 2). High bootstrap support was indicated for a monophyletic clade that included PsTNMT, coclaurine N-methyltransferases (PsCNMT, CjCNMT, TfCNMT), bacterial AdoMet-dependent cyclopropane fatty acid synthases (MtPcaA, MlCFAPS, BhCPFAS), and the predicated translation products of the A. thaliana genes At4g33110 and At4g33120. The At4g33120 gene product was the less divergent of the two A. thaliana proteins. Strong support was also observed for a separate monophyletic clade including purine N-methyltransferases from C. arabica and C. sinensis (CaDMXNMT, CaMXNMT, CaXNMT, CsDMXNMT) and salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase from C. breweri (CbSAMT). Putrescine N-methyltransferases from D. stramonium and A. belladonna (DsPNMT, AbPNMT) formed a distinct monophyletic clade with strong support.

https://openalex.org/W2049024332,"CD8+ T cells impact control of viral infections by direct elimination of infected cells and secretion of a number of soluble factors. In HIV-1 infection, persistent HIV-1 specific IFN-gamma+ CD8+ T cell responses are detected in the setting of disease progression, consistent with functional impairment in vivo. Recent data suggest that impaired maturation, as defined by the lineage markers CD45RA and CCR7, may contribute to a lack of immune control by these responses.We investigated the maturation phenotype of epitope-specific CD8+ T cell responses directed against HIV-1 in 42 chronically infected, untreated individuals, 22 of whom were ""Controllers"" (median 1140 RNA copies/ml plasma, range<50 to 2520), and 20 ""progressors"" of whom had advanced disease and high viral loads (median 135,500 RNA copies/ml plasma, range 12100 to >750000). Evaluation of a mean of 5 epitopes per person revealed that terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells directed against HIV-1 are more often seen in HIV-1 Controllers (16/22; 73%) compared to HIV-1 progressors (7/20; 35%)(p = 0.015), but the maturation state of epitope-specific responses within a given individual was quite variable. Maturation phenotype was independent of the HLA restriction or the specificity of a given CD8+ T cell response and individual epitopes associated with slow disease progression were not more likely to be terminally differentiated.These data indicate that although full maturation of epitope-specific CD8+ T cell responses is associated with viral control, the maturation status of HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cell responses within a given individual are quite heterogeneous, suggesting epitope-specific influences on CD8+ T cell function."

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and mammary-specific genes as models, we show here that extracellular matrix molecules and prolactin cooperate to induce histone acetylation and binding of transcription factors and the SWI/SNF complex to the β- and γ-casein promoters. Introduction of a dominant negative Brg1, an ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF complex, significantly reduced both β- and γ-casein expression, suggesting that SWI/SNF-dependent chromatin remodeling is required for transcription of mammary-specific genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that the ATPase activity of SWI/SNF is necessary for recruitment of RNA transcriptional machinery, but not for binding of transcription factors or for histone acetylation. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed that the SWI/SNF complex is associated with STAT5, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β, and glucocorticoid receptor. Thus, extracellular matrix- and prolactin-regulated transcription of the mammary-specific casein genes requires the concerted action of chromatin remodeling enzymes and transcription factors.

Modulation of chromatin structure by histone modifications and ATP-dependent remodeling has been implicated in cell differentiation and transcriptional control of tissue-specific and inducible genes (11Hsiao P.W.

Histone-modifying enzymes are believed to be recruited to promoter regions through their association with transcription factors and are critical for tissue-specific gene expression and functional differentiation of specific cell types (14de la Serna I.L.

Histone acetylation is a dynamic process and is regulated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (16Sun J.M. Spencer V.A. Chen H.Y. Li L. Davie J.R. Methods. 2003; 31: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mapping of global histone acetylation patterns has demonstrated that chromatin accessibility and gene expression are correlated with histone hyperacetylation of promoters and other cis-elements (17Roh T.Y.

The p300 histone acetyltransferase cooperates with STAT5 to enhance exogenous β-casein promoter activity in COS cells, indicating that histone acetylation may play a role in β-casein transcription (19Pfitzner E.

Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, was shown to activate the bovine casein ECM response element (BCE-1) in an ECM-independent fashion in a mouse epithelial cell line in tissue culture plastic, but surprisingly the same treatment inhibited the endogenous β-casein transcription (20Myers C.A.

ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complexes are involved in cellular differentiation and tissue-specific transcription (14de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat.

Mammalian cells contain at least two SWI/SNF-like complexes that share a number of subunits but are distinguished from one another by their ATPase subunits, Brg1 and Brm1 (24Fry C.J. Peterson C.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R185-R197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Introducing a dominant negative Brg1 (DN-Brg1) or Brm1 into mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts completely abrogated MyoD-mediated muscle differentiation, and failure to induce transcription of the muscle-specific myogenin gene was correlated with inhibition of chromatin remodeling in the promoter region (14de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To date, two different mechanisms have been described for recruiting SWI/SNF complexes to tissue-specific genes. Transcription factors, such as GR and C/EBPβ, have been shown in mammalian cells to recruit the SWI/SNF complex to cis-elements to activate specific gene transcription (23Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 25Muller W.G. Walker D. Hager G.L. McNally J.G. J.

Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the ATPase subunits of SWI/SNF contain bromodomains, which can bind directly to acetylated histone tails in vitro (28Martens J.A. Winston F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 29Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Thus, acetylated histones in a particular chromatin region may contribute to the recruitment of SWI/SNF complexes to specific genes. Using the β- and γ-casein genes as models, here we investigate how ECM and prolactin regulate the activity of STAT5 and C/EBPβ, and we elucidate the roles of histone acetylation and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling in expression of these mammary-specific genes. The findings from this study indicate that the precise regulation of mammary-specific gene transcription depends not only on transcription factor activation and histone modifications but also on ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling.

EpH4 cells were seeded onto 35-mm dishes and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with the following plasmids: 3 μg of DN-Brg1 plasmid (14de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) (a kind gift from Dr. Anthony N. Imbalzano, University of Massachusetts Medical School), 1 μg of pTet-tak, which encodes the tet-VP16 regulator, and 0.4 μg of pNeo plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 400 μg/ml geneticin (Sigma) was added to the media, which were changed every 48 h for 10 days. The resulting stably transfected clones were washed twice with growth medium and incubated in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline for 4 days. Positive clones expressing a 200-kDa FLAG tag protein in the absence, but not presence of, tetracycline were identified by Western blot analysis. Promoter Reporter Plasmid Construction and Luciferase Assays—A 340-bp DNA fragment containing the β-casein promoter region was amplified from mouse genomic DNA using the following primer sequences: forward primer, 5′-CGA GGT ACC TTC ATA ACT GAG GTT AAA GCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAG AAG CTT GTC CTA TCA GAC TCT GTG AC-3′. PCR product was digested with HindIII and KpnI and subsequently cloned into a reporter vector pGL3 (Promega). EpH4 cells were co-transfected with pGL-casein and pNeo plasmid (1:10). Stably transfected cells were isolated by G418 selection and cultured in GIH medium for 2 days in the presence of different inducers. Following induction, equal amounts of cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity. Western Blot and Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)—Western blot experiments were performed as previously described (30Muschler J. Lochter A. Roskelley C.D. Yurchenco P. Bissell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2817-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Total and nuclear protein were extracted from EpH4 cells or nuclei using radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture). After sonication, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Proteins (20 μg) from each sample were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was subsequently blocked in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% Carnation nonfat dried milk and incubated in blocking buffer containing primary antibody. All of the blots were further incubated in blocking buffer containing horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and subjected to ECL using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Cells transfected with DN-Brg1 were cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 2 days in GIH medium containing prolactin and lrECM, and the nuclei were isolated using a nucleus isolation kit (Sigma). The nuclei were resuspended and sonicated in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. After centrifugation, 40 μl of agarose beads conjugated to an anti-FLAG M2 antibody were added to the supernatant of each sample and incubated with shaking at 4 °C for 4 h The agarose beads were washed with rinsing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100). Agarose-associated protein complexes were eluted using SDS loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot. RT-PCR and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using Superscript first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) from 1-μg RNA samples. One microliter of cDNA was used as a template for PCR and real time PCR. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was amplified and used as a loading control. The following primers were used to amplify β-casein, γ-casein, lactoferrin, and GAPDH cDNA sequences: forward primer of the β-casein gene 5′-GCT CAG GCT CAA ACC ATC TC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGT GGA AGG AAG GGT GCT AC-3′; forward primer of the γ-casein gene: 5′-CCC AGG AGT CTT CCT TTT CC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGA AAC CAC GAA GAA ACC AA-3′; forward primer of the lactoferrin gene: 5′-AGT GAG GAG AAG CGC AAG TGT G-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGC CCC AGT GTA GCC TTG GTA T-3′; and forward primer for GAPDH gene 5′CCC CTG GCC AAG GTC ATC CAT GAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′CAT ACC AGG AAA TGA GCT TGA CAA AG-3′. Quantitative real time PCR analysis was performed with the Lightcycler System (Roche Applied Science) using the Lightcycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) (31Novaro V. Roskelley C.D. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2975-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The following Lightcycler PCR amplification protocol was used: 95 °C for 10 min (initial denaturation) and 45 amplification cycles (95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 5 s). Amplification was followed by melting curve analysis to verify the presence of a single PCR product. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP assay was performed based on the Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. ChIP protocol (32Nelson E.A. Walker S.R. Alvarez J.V. Frank D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54724-54730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Cellular components were cross-linked by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. The nuclei were isolated with a nucleus isolation kit and resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitor mixture. The nuclei were then sonicated to shear DNA to lengths between 200 and 1000 bp. The sonicated lysates were diluted to an A260 of 2 units/ml with ChIP dilution buffer and incubated with 60 μl of protein A-conjugated agarose beads to reduce nonspecific binding. Primary antibodies were added to the precleared supernatant fraction and incubated from 5 h to overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Protein A-conjugated agarose beads (50 μl) were then added to the samples for 1 h, and the protein-DNA complexes were eluted from the protein A-agarose by incubation in 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Protein-DNA cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 5 h. The immunoprecipitated DNA was phenol/chloroform extracted and ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 15 μg of linear polyacrylamide, an inert carrier. The isolated DNA was then analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR using the following primers: β-casein promoter forward primer 5′-GTC CTC TCA CTT GGC TGG AG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTG GAG GAC AAG AGA GGA GGT-3′; amylase promoter forward primer 5′-TCA GTT GTA ATT CTC CTT GTA CGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCT CCC ATC TGA AGT ATG TGG GTC-3′; and γ-casein promoter forward primer 5′-AAA CAG GTG AGT CTG CCT TCA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCA AAT GGA AGA CGA GAG GA-3′. Statistics—All of the data analysis was performed using Sigma Plot. The bar graphs represent the means ± S.E. Expression of mammary-specific genes depends on signals from both lactogenic hormones and ECM molecules; for β-casein, the relevant ECM molecule is laminin-111 (2Streuli C.H. Bailey N. Bissell M.J.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we observed that both β- and γ-casein mRNA levels were highly up-regulated in response to prolactin and lrECM treatment (Fig. 1A); expression correlated with significant changes in cellular morphology as shown previously for β-casein (3Roskelley C.D. Desprez P.Y. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12378-12382Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Furthermore, consistent with previous studies (1Streuli C.H. Schmidhauser C. Bailey N. Yurchenco P. Skubitz A.P. Roskelley C. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 30Muschler J. Lochter A. Roskelley C.D. Yurchenco P. Bissell M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2817-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we established that laminin-111 was indeed the lrECM constituent that induced β-casein expression in EpH4 cells (data not shown). The mouse β-casein promoter contains binding sites for STAT5 and C/EBPβ, and half-sites of the palindromic glucocorticoid response element (33Wyszomierski S.L. Rosen J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 228-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 34Lechner J. Welte T. Tomasi J.K. Bruno P. Cairns C. Gustafsson J. Doppler W. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 11: 3745-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether ECM and prolactin directly induce transcriptional activation of the β-casein promoter, we amplified and cloned the promoter region from -340 to -1 into a luciferase reporter vector and stably transfected the reporter plasmid into EpH4 cells. Luciferase activity was dramatically induced in the transfected cells after treatment with lrECM and prolactin (Fig. 1B), indicating that the β-casein promoter is transcriptionally activated in these cells. Consistent with the PCR results, neither prolactin nor lrECM alone could appreciably enhance promoter activity. STAT5- and C/EBPβ-binding sites were also identified in the bovine β-casein ECM response element, BCE-1 (20Myers C.A. Schmidhauser C. Mellentin-Michelotti J. Fragoso G. Roskelley C.D. Casperson G. Mossi R. Pujuguet P. Hager G. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2184-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To determine whether these two factors regulate ECM- and prolactin-induced expression of the endogenous β-casein gene, total and nuclear lysates of EpH4 cells were analyzed by Western blotting. Although the total level of STAT5 did not change, the levels of phosphorylated STAT5 and its nuclear translocation increased after combined treatment with lrECM and prolactin. However, neither treatment alone could induce these changes (Fig. 1, C and D). Total cell and nuclear levels of C/EBPβ remained unchanged after the treatments (Fig. 1, C and D). To determine whether STAT5 and C/EBPβ become associated with the β-casein promoter after ECM and prolactin treatment, we performed ChIP assays. Addition of these two ligands significantly increased the association of STAT5 and C/EBPβ with the β-casein promoter, whereas the interaction between the promoter and GR remained at the control level (Fig. 2A). The promoter of the β-amylase gene, which is not expressed in mammary epithelial cells, was included as a negative control and was not detected in any of the ChIP samples (data not shown). Thus, exposure of EpH4 cells to lrECM and prolactin increases both STAT5 levels in the nucleus and the binding of this factor and C/EBPβ to the β-casein promoter. We also found that treatment with prolactin and lrECM moderately enhanced the binding of Brg1, the ATPase subunit of SWI/SNF complex, to the β-casein promoter in EpH4 and primary mammary epithelial cells (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig S1). Analysis of the DNA immunoprecipitated with a RNA polymerase II antibody showed an increased association of this protein with the β-casein promoter in response to treatment with lrECM and prolactin (Fig. 2A). Binding sites of STAT5 and C/EBPβ were identified in promoters of other milk protein genes, such as γ-casein (36Kolb A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1579: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We asked whether γ-casein was regulated similarly to β-casein. The association of these factors with the γ-casein promoter was determined by ChIP assays. We found that treatment with prolactin and lrECM enhanced binding of STAT5 and C/EBPβ and increased Brg1 and RNA polymerase II levels in the promoter region of γ-casein gene (Fig. 2B). The mouse casein genes cluster at a single gene locus on chromosome 5 in this order: α, β, γ, δ, and κ (37Rijnkels M. Wheeler D.A. de Boer H.A. Pieper F.R. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the expression of casein genes is coordinately regulated during pregnancy and lactation (38Hobbs A.A. Richards D.A. Kessler D.J. Rosen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3598-3605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of these transcription factors and the chromatin remodeling complex together appears to activate the entire gene locus. We showed above that treatment with lrECM and prolactin induced the recruitment of transcription factors and the SWI/SNF complex to the β-casein promoter. To determine whether ECM and prolactin control these events separately or cooperatively, we performed ChIP analysis after cells were treated either singly or with both agents. We found that STAT5 bound to the β-casein promoter in cells treated with both lrECM and prolactin, but treatment with either component alone failed to induce appreciable binding (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with the Western data showing that nuclear translocation of STAT5 depends on both the ECM and hormonal signals (Fig. 1D). Combined lrECM and prolactin treatment also induced binding of C/EBPβ to the β-casein promoter (Fig. 2C). Recruitment of Brg1 and RNA polymerase II in the β-casein promoter required also both lrECM and prolactin (Fig. 2C). These results establish that ECM cooperates with prolactin to induce the binding of transcription factors as well as the transcriptional machinery to the β-casein promoter. Previously, we showed that treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors could partially substitute for lrECM in activating a stably integrated bovine ECM response element (BCE-1) in a mammary epithelial cell line (CID-9), suggesting that histone acetylation may play a role in transcriptional regulation of this enhancer (20Myers C.A. Schmidhauser C. Mellentin-Michelotti J. Fragoso G. Roskelley C.D. Casperson G. Mossi R. Pujuguet P. Hager G. Bissell M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2184-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the same treatment was later shown to inhibit transcriptional activation of the endogenous β-casein gene (21Pujuguet P. Radisky D. Levy D. Lacza C. Bissell M.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 660-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here we sought to determine whether histone acetylation is involved in transcriptional regulation of the endogenous β-casein gene. ChIP assays using antibodies against acetylated histone H3 and H4 demonstrated enhanced histone acetylation in the β-casein promoter, but not the β-amylase promoter, in response to treatment with lrECM and prolactin (Fig. 3A). In addition, neither lrECM nor prolactin alone induced histone acetylation in the β-casein promoter (data not shown), confirming that the cooperation between the two signals is important. To determine whether the increase of acetylated histone in the β-casein promoter was sufficient to induce transcription of the endogenous gene, EpH4 cells were treated with TSA in the presence or absence of ECM and prolactin. ChIP data showed that the levels of acetylated histone H4 (AcH4) appreciably increased in the β-casein promoter (Fig. 3B). Quantitative PCR showed, however, that the level of β-casein mRNA was increased by only 1.6-fold in undifferentiated cells after TSA treatment; the levels of both total and phosphorylated STAT5, C/EBPβ, and GR did not change (Fig. 3, C and D). In the functionally differentiated cells that were cultured with prolactin and lrECM, TSA treatment significantly suppressed the induction of β-casein expression. Western blot analysis showed that phosphorylated STAT5 levels decreased in TSA-treated cells, suggesting that this inhibition may be due to an indirect effect of TSA on STAT5 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, C and D). These results now clarify previous contradictions and indicate that histone acetylation alone is not sufficient to induce transcription of the endogenous β-casein gene above the basal level.

PUF proteins provide a paradigm for these regulatory molecules: like other repressors, they inhibit translation, enhance mRNA decay, and promote poly(A) removal. Here we show that a single mRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoding the HO endonuclease, is regulated by two distinct PUF proteins, Puf4p and Mpt5p. These proteins bind to adjacent sites and can co-occupy the mRNA. Both proteins are required for full repression and deadenylation in vivo; their removal dramatically stabilizes the mRNA. The two proteins act through overlapping but non-identical mechanisms: repression by Puf4p is dependent on deadenylation, whereas repression by Mpt5p can occur through additional mechanisms. Combinatorial action of the two regulatory proteins may allow responses to specific environmental cues and be common in 3′-untranslated region-mediated control. mRNA stability and translation are regulated by protein repressors that bind 3′-untranslated regions.

Regulation of replication, transcription, translation, and mRNA stability hinge on the assembly of multiprotein complexes. These complexes include the basal machinery for that process, such as DNA and RNA polymerases, ribosomes, or mRNA decay complexes. Commonly these large machines are recruited to specific nucleic acid sequences by interacting with regulatory proteins bound to specific sites. In this fashion, sequence specificity is provided to intrinsically non-sequence-specific enzymatic activities. The assembly of the regulatory complexes relies on combinatorial associations among protein partners and antagonists and their interactions with RNA or DNA. Regulation of mRNA translation and stability commonly is controlled by elements in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) 2The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; BS, binding site; TAP, tandem affinity purification tag; RBD, RNA-binding domain. of the mRNA, to which specific regulatory proteins bind (1Colegrove-Otero L.J.

Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 18Goldstrohm A.C. Seay D.J. Hook B.A. Wickens M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 109-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Instead, the Ccr4p enzyme catalyzes PUF-enhanced deadenylation; mutations in the Ccr4p active site eliminate regulated deadenylation (18Goldstrohm A.C. Seay D.J. Hook B.A. Wickens M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 109-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Pop2p is a bridge that links the PUF-RNA complex to the Ccr4p deadenylase. The same PUF-Pop2p connection simultaneously recruits other proteins involved in turnover and translational repression, including the decapping factor Dcp1p and the RNA helicase Dhh1p, which can repress translation (7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In this report, we sought to determine whether Puf4p directly regulates HO expression. We combined in vivo and in vitro analyses to show that Puf4p and Mpt5p bind the HO 3′-UTR through distinct but adjacent binding sites and can do so simultaneously. Puf4p represses mRNA expression and enhances mRNA deadenylation and decay. The mechanisms of these effects overlap with, but are distinct from, those of Mpt5p. In particular, Puf4p repression activity is entirely dependent on the deadenylation activity of Ccr4p (which it recruits via Pop2p); in contrast, Mpt5p can repress by additional mechanisms. In the presence of either PUF protein, the Pop2p-Ccr4p complex is recruited to enhance deadenylation. The effects of the two proteins bound simultaneously to their cognate sites are additive and greatly enhance the efficiency and rate of deadenylation and decay. Together, they provide flexible opportunities for control. Strains—The yeast three-hybrid strain YBZ1 was described previously (22Hook B. Bernstein D. Zhang B. Wickens M. RNA. 2005; 11: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The wild-type BY4742 yeast strain and isogenic strains with gene-specific deletions of CCR4 and POP2 were obtained from Open Biosystems. These deletion strains were created by PCR-mediated gene modification using the kanamycin/G418 resistance marker. The MPT5-TAP, PUF4-TAP, and POP2-TAP strains (Open Biosystems) were created in the S288C strain background by integrating a C-terminal tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag onto the coding sequence using PCR-mediated gene modification with a HIS3 marker. Yeast Three-hybrid Assay—Three-hybrid assays were performed as described (23Bernstein D.S. Buter N. Stumpf C. Wickens M. Methods. 2002; 26: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). PUF proteins fused with the Gal4 activation domain were expressed from pACT2 or pGADT7 plasmids. Full-length open reading frames were used for PUF1, PUF2, PUF3, PUF4, and PUF6. The Mpt5p open reading frame starts with methionine 26. DNA oligonucleotides were designed to express either the Puf4 BS or Mpt5 BS (sequence found in Fig. 1B) and cloned into the XmaI and SphI sites of pIIIA/MS2-2. Assays were performed in strain YBZ1. β-galactosidase activity was measured using the Beta-Glo (Promega) substrate as described (22Hook B. Bernstein D. Zhang B. Wickens M. RNA. 2005; 11: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Protein Expression Constructs and Purification—Mpt5p (amino acids 126–626), Puf4p (amino acids 536–887), and Ccr4p (amino acids 319–837) were cloned into pGex6P1 (GE Healthcare) with an N-terminal TEV protease cleavage site. The resulting GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion proteins were expressed in BL-21 gold Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) and purified/eluted as described (24Bernstein D. Hook B. Hajarnavis A. Opperman L. Wickens M. RNA. 2005; 11: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The recombinant Puf4p used in Fig. 2B was cleaved with TEV protease (Invitrogen). Pop2p was cloned into a derivative of the pMAL vector (New England Biolabs) that contained a TEV protease cleavage site and an N-terminal hexahistidine epitope tag. The resulting maltose-binding protein (MBP)-Pop2p was purified from E. coli according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—RNA binding assays were performed as described (24Bernstein D. Hook B. Hajarnavis A. Opperman L. Wickens M. RNA. 2005; 11: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using chemically synthesized RNAs (Dharmacon). The apparent Kd, the concentration of protein at which half-maximal binding occurs, was calculated using Grafit 5 (Sigma). The modest difference in Mpt5p binding affinities between Fig. 1C and that reported in Fig. 2A are likely due to different protein preparations. The data and apparent dissociation constants reported in Fig. 2A are the statistically determined results of three independent binding experiments. The following synthetic RNAs were used in the assays (ones not given in figures): Mpt5p BS, ′-AGUUUAAAAAGUUGUAUGUAAUAAAAGU-3′; Mpt5p BS mt, 5′-AGUUUAAAAAGUACAAUGUAAUAAAAGU-3′; Puf4p BS, 5′-UAAAAUGUGUAUAUUAGUUUAAAAGU-3′; and Puf4p BS mt, 5′-UAAAAUGACAAUAUUAGUUUAAAAGU-3′. mRNA Decay Analysis—Transcriptional inhibition experiments were done using 20 μgml–1 of thiolutin (Pfizer) as described (7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). RNA was purified by an acid-phenol-chloroform protocol at pH 4.6 and separated by 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde, 1.0% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis. Transfer to nylon membrane (Ambion) was achieved by capillary action using 10× SSC. Blots were probed with radiolabeled antisense riboprobes specific to genes listed. Repression Assays—The HIS3-HO 3′-UTR reporter gene contains the HIS3 coding sequence with 2 kbp of the HO promoter upstream and 1 kbp of the HO 3′-UTR downstream in plasmid YCp33. The “HO mt” reporter (Fig. 4) has the UGU trinucleotides in the Puf4 and Mpt5 binding sites changed to ACA by site-directed mutagenesis of an otherwise wild-type HO 3′-UTR (sequence in Fig. 1). Wild-type yeast strain BY4742 or gene-specific deletion strains (ccr4 or pop2) were transformed with the reporter gene plasmid and either YEp181, YEp181 MPT5, p415-GPD, or p415-GPD-PUF4. Plasmid YEp181 MPT5 mutant was created by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) of amino acids S454A and N455A in PUF repeat 7. Plasmid p415-GPD-PUF4 mutant was derived from p415-GPD-PUF4 by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) of amino acids S799A and N800A in PUF repeat 7. CCR4 expression plasmid was created in the high copy vector pACG1-NT as described (18Goldstrohm A.C. Seay D.J. Hook B.A. Wickens M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 109-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The active site mutant CCR4 contains missense mutation E556A described by Chen et al. (19Chen J. Chiang Y.C. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1414-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For growth assay, colonies were isolated and grown to mid-log phase at 30 °C and plated on minimal medium with or without histidine. The HIS3 competitive inhibitor 3-aminotriazole was added to increase stringency where indicated. Immunoprecipitations—Reactions were performed with TAP-tagged MPT5 and PUF4 strains carrying T7-tagged versions of Pop2p, Ccr4p, or green fluorescent protein expressed from vector pACG1 NTB as described (7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Lysates and pellets were treated with 5 units of RNase A and 200 units of RNase T1 (Ambion). GST Pulldown Experiments—GST-Mpt5p (amino acids 126–626), GST-Puf4p (amino acids 536–887), and GST-Ccr4p (amino acids 319–837) were bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at a concentration of 1 μg/10 μl bed volume. MBP-Pop2p was mixed to the beads at a final concentration of 500 nm in TNEMN150 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl), washed, and analyzed with monoclonal antibody to MBP (New England Biolabs). RNase one (20 units; Promega) was added to each reaction. Deadenylation in Vitro—Deadenylation reactions were carried out with Pop2p-TAP complexes purified from yeast and recombinant PUF protein purified from E. coli as previously described (7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The reactions contained 10 ng of Pop2p-TAP complex and 200 fmol (10 nm) substrate RNA, unless otherwise indicated. GST-Mpt5 RNA-binding domain (RBD) (250 nm) and/or Puf4 RBD (100 nm) were added to reactions as indicated. Two Different PUF Proteins Bind the HO 3′-UTR—The yeast PUF protein Mpt5p regulates HO mRNA by binding a specific sequence in its 3′-UTR, called the Mpt5 BS (Fig. 1A, and Refs. 7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar and 15Tadauchi T. Matsumoto K. Herskowitz I. Irie K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A second potential PUF binding site lies 20 nucleotides upstream and conforms to a sequence found in 66% of mRNAs that co-immunoprecipitated with Puf4p (14Gerber A.P. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 0342-0354Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar). These data suggested that both Mpt5p and Puf4p might regulate HO mRNA. We first examined the binding of Mpt5p and Puf4p to their respective sites using the yeast three-hybrid system (22Hook B. Bernstein D. Zhang B. Wickens M. RNA. 2005; 11: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Bernstein D.S. Buter N. Stumpf C. Wickens M. Methods. 2002; 26: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Each of the six yeast PUF proteins was individually fused to the Gal4p transcriptional activation domain and co-expressed with RNA “baits” containing either the predicted Puf4p binding site (Puf4 BS) or the Mpt5p binding site (Mpt5 BS). Protein-RNA interactions were detected by the production of β-galactosidase and assayed in yeast lysates (22Hook B. Bernstein D. Zhang B. Wickens M. RNA. 2005; 11: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Only Puf4p bound the Puf4 BS (Fig. 1B), whereas only Mpt5p bound the Mpt5 BS (Fig. 1B). Mutations that changed UGU to ACA in each binding site eliminated binding (data not shown; see Fig. 1C). To determine whether Puf4p and Mpt5p bind directly to the two sites, we used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Purified, recombinant GST-tagged Puf4p or Mpt5p was incubated with labeled RNAs comprising either the Mpt5 BS or Puf4 BS, and the resulting complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis (Fig. 1C). Mpt5p bound the Mpt5 BS with an apparent Kd of 100 nm, consistent with our previous findings (7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), whereas Puf4p bound the Puf4 BS with an apparent Kd of 10 nm. Neither Mpt5p nor Puf4p bound its respective binding site when the critical UGU trinucleotides were mutated to ACA (Fig. 1C). We conclude that Puf4p specifically binds the newly defined Puf4 BS in the HO 3′-UTR. Both PUF Proteins Can Bind Simultaneously—To quantify binding specificity, we compared the binding of Puf4p and Mpt5p to the two sites in vitro. Puf4p exhibited a 25-fold preference for its cognate site over its non-cognate site; Mpt5p displayed a 3.5-fold preference for its own site (Fig. 2A). To test whether Puf4p and Mpt5p can bind simultaneously to a single RNA molecule, we prepared a 5′-end-labeled RNA containing both the Puf4 and the Mpt5 binding sites (Fig. 2B). To test for co-occupancy, we performed gel shift assays using a saturating concentration of one recombinant PUF protein mixed with increasing concentrations of the other. To resolve the different complexes, the GST affinity tag was removed from Puf4p but left on Mpt5p; as a result, their complexes differed in mobility. At high concentrations of Puf4p alone (200 nm, 20-fold above its Kd for the Puf4 BS), Puf4p bound the Puf4 site to form Complex 2 and both sites to form Complex 3 (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Addition of Mpt5p to Puf4p progressively resulted in a new complex (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–8, Complex 5). This new complex (Complex 5) represented Puf4p and Mpt5p bound to the same RNA (see below). We next performed the reciprocal experiment, holding Mpt5p constant and titrating Puf4p. Mpt5p was added at saturating concentrations (500 nm, 5-fold above its Kd for the Mpt5 BS); as expected, it bound the Mpt5 site to form Complex 4 and both sites to form Complex 6 (Fig. 2B, lane 9). Addition of Puf4p yielded Complex 5, containing Mpt5p, Puf4p, and the RNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 10–15). At high Puf4p concentrations, Puf4p competed with Mpt5p, ultimately displacing it from the Puf4p BS; as a result, Complexes 2 and 3 increase in abundance at the expense of Complexes 4, 5, and 6 (Fig. 2B, lanes 14 and 15). Mutation of the Puf4 BS from UGU to ACA abolishes all complexes except that of Mpt5p to the Mpt5p site (Complex 4). These data demonstrate that Mpt5p and Puf4p preferentially bind their respective sites, that they can co-occupy the HO 3′-UTR in vitro, and that they can compete for one another's binding sites. Puf4p and Mpt5p Stimulate Degradation of HO mRNA—We analyzed the effect of Puf4p and Mpt5p on endogenous HO mRNA by comparing its half-life in wild-type versus puf4, mpt5, and puf4 mpt5 deletion strains (Fig. 3). Total RNA was prepared at various times after addition of thiolutin, which inhibits RNA polymerase II (25Duttagupta R. Vasudevan S. Wilusz C.J. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2623-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). HO mRNA half-life increased from 9 min in the wild-type strain, to 19 min in the puf4 mutant, and to 35 min in the mpt5 mutant. Most dramatically, the half-life of HO mRNA increased to more than 90 min in the puf4 mpt5 mutant strain (Fig. 3, A and B). Steady state levels of HO mRNA increased dramatically in the mpt5 (3-fold) and puf4 mpt5 mutants (4-fold). As a control, we analyzed an mRNA that does not interact with Mpt5p. The half-lives of neither ACT1 mRNA (Fig. 3C) nor SCR1 RNA (Fig. 3D) were unaffected by removal of PUF4, MPT5, or both. These results demonstrate that Puf4p and Mpt5p specifically destabilize HO mRNA and that the two proteins combine to enhance destabilization. Puf4p Represses HO in Vivo and Requires Pop2p and Ccr4p—To test whether Puf4p represses expression in vivo, we used a reporter gene consisting of the HO promoter, HIS3 coding sequence, and the HO 3′-UTR (Fig. 4A) (7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, Puf4p repressed this reporter mRNA (Fig. 4B), largely preventing growth on selective media lacking histidine; Mpt5p behaves similarly (supplemental Fig. S1A) (7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Repression by Puf4p required the PUF binding sites in the RNA (Fig. 4B) and a functional RNA-binding domain in the protein (Fig. 4B). We conclude that Puf4p and Mpt5p repress the reporter mRNA in vivo by binding the HO 3′-UTR. To determine whether repression by Puf4p requires Pop2p, we examined Puf4p-dependent repression in a pop2 deletion mutant. Puf4p-mediated repression was dramatically reduced in the pop2 strain (Fig. 4C). In this respect, Puf4p mirrors Mpt5p (supplemental Fig. S1B) (7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Puf4p-mediated repression also required Ccr4p, the enzyme responsible for deadenylation of HO mRNA in vivo (18Goldstrohm A.C. Seay D.J. Hook B.A. Wickens M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 109-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); repression was virtually abolished in a ccr4 mutant (Fig. 4C). In contrast, Mpt5p-mediated repression largely persists in the ccr4 mutant (supplemental Fig. S1B) (7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We conclude that Puf4p repression via the HO 3′-UTR requires both the Pop2p and Ccr4p subunits of the major cytoplasmic deadenylase complex. To determine whether repression by Puf4p requires the catalytic activity of Ccr4p, we tested Puf4p-dependent repression in wild-type and ccr4 deletion strains expressing either wild-type Ccr4p or a point mutant that disrupts its active site (Fig. 4, D and E, CCR4 mt). In the wild-type strain, Puf4p represses with and without overexpressed Ccr4p, as expected (Fig. 4D). Overexpression of the Ccr4p mutant partially inhibited repression, indicating a dominant negative effect (Fig. 4D). In the ccr4 mutant strain, Puf4p repression was restored by expression of active Ccr4p, but not by the Ccr4p active site mutant (Fig. 4E). We conclude that Puf4p repression requires both Pop2p and an active form of Ccr4p. Puf4p Associates with Deadenylation Factors—To determine whether Puf4p physically associates with deadenylase proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with yeast extracts (Fig. 5A). We used yeast strains expressing either TAP-tagged Puf4p or TAP-tagged Mpt5p and a T7 epitope-tagged derivative of either the deadenylase subunits Ccr4p or Pop2p or, as a control, green fluorescent protein. Mock purifications from a wild-type, untagged strain carrying each T7-tagged test protein served as negative controls. TAP-Puf4p and TAP-Mpt5p were affinity-purified and eluted from the beads, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. Pop2p and Ccr4p were physically associated with Puf4p and Mpt5p (Fig. 5A, lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9); green fluorescent protein was not (lanes 2 and 3). The co-immunoprecipitations of Pop2p and Ccr4p with Puf4p and Mpt5p were due to protein-protein interactions rather than co-occupancy of RNA, because they were unaffected by RNase A and T1 treatment. Puf4p Directly Binds Pop2p—To determine whether Puf4p bound directly to Pop2p, we used purified recombinant Pop2p fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP-Pop2p). MBP-Pop2p was incubated with purified recombinant Puf4p, Mpt5p, and Ccr4p, each fused to GST and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. After extensive washing, the presence of MBP-Pop2p was determined using Western blotting. Immobilized Puf4p and Mpt5p bound MBP-Pop2p (Fig. 5B). As controls, Ccr4p bound Pop2p as expected, whereas GST alone did not. We conclude that Puf4p, like Mpt5p, binds directly to Pop2p. Because these experiments used only the RNA-binding domains of the PUF proteins, those regions are sufficient to bind Pop2p. Puf4p Stimulates Deadenylation in Vitro—Puf4p repression requires both CCR4 and POP2, implying that Puf4p repression stimulates deadenylation. Consistent with this, deadenylation of HO mRNA is dramatically impaired in puf4 mpt5 double mutants compared with mpt5 alone (7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). To study Puf4p effect on poly(A) shortening in detail, we examined Puf4p-stimulated deadenylation in vitro. Recombinant GST-Puf4p was purified from E. coli. As a substrate, we created a 5′-end-labeled HO 3′-UTR RNA containing the Puf4 BS with fourteen adenosine residues at its 3′-end (sequences in Fig. 6A). As expected, Puf4p bound to the HO 3′-UTR substrate with high affinity (apparent Kd of 15 nm), and mutation of the UGU trinucleotide completely abrogated the interaction (Fig. 6A). Pop2p complexes were purified from yeast using TAP tag affinity purification; both Pop2p and Ccr4p were enriched in this partially purified fraction as judged by Western blotting (7Goldstrohm A.C. Hook B.A. Seay D.J. Wickens M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The Pop2p complex alone removed the poly(A) tail in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and was capable of completely deadenylating the RNA at high concentrations (supplemental Fig. S2). Puf4p alone neither deadenylated nor destroyed the RNA (Fig. 6B, lanes 3–5). The Pop2p complex, added at low concentrations, showed modest deadenylation activity; 5% of the RNA was fully deadenylated after 120 min (lanes 6–9)."
https://openalex.org/W2055085803,"Cancers of the pancreas originate from both the endocrine and exocrine elements of the organ, and represent a major cause of cancer-related death. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of gene expression for pancreatic tumors, the normal pancreas, and nonneoplastic pancreatic disease.DNA microarrays were used to assess the gene expression for surgically derived pancreatic adenocarcinomas, islet cell tumors, and mesenchymal tumors. The addition of normal pancreata, isolated islets, isolated pancreatic ducts, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines enhanced subsequent analysis by increasing the diversity in gene expression profiles obtained. Exocrine, endocrine, and mesenchymal tumors displayed unique gene expression profiles. Similarities in gene expression support the pancreatic duct as the origin of adenocarcinomas. In addition, genes highly expressed in other cancers and associated with specific signal transduction pathways were also found in pancreatic tumors.The scope of the present work was enhanced by the inclusion of publicly available datasets that encompass a wide spectrum of human tissues and enabled the identification of candidate genes that may serve diagnostic and therapeutic goals."
https://openalex.org/W2166611044,"The low affinity IgE receptor, FcɛRII (CD23), is both a positive and negative regulator of IgE synthesis. The proteinase activity that converts the membrane-bound form of CD23 into a soluble species (sCD23) is an important regulator of the function of CD23 and may be an important therapeutic target for the control of allergy and inflammation. We have characterized the catalytic activity of ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) 10 toward human CD23. We found that ADAM10 efficiently catalyzes the cleavage of peptides derived from two distinct cleavage sites in the CD23 backbone. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases and a specific prodomain-based inhibitor of ADAM10 perturb the release of endogenously produced CD23 from human leukemia cell lines as well as primary cultures of human B-cells. Expression of a mutant metalloproteinase-deficient construct of ADAM10 partially inhibited the production of sCD23. Similarly, small inhibitory RNA knockdown of ADAM10 partially inhibited CD23 release and resulted in the accumulation of the membrane-bound form of CD23 on the cells. ADAM10 contributes to CD23 shedding and thus could be considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of allergic disease.

The C-terminal extracellular domain consists of a globular fold that has homology to the C-type lectin family (9Bonnefoy J.Y. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Gauchat J.F. Graber P. Aubry J.P. Jeannin P. Plater-Zyberk C. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 16: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This globular domain has been shown to contain two distinct binding sites, one for IgE and a second that recognizes CD21 (complement receptor 2) (10Hibbert R.G. Teriete P. Grundy G.J. Beavil R.L.

At the cell surface CD23 self-assembles to form homotrimers that have a higher affinity for IgE than the CD23 monomer (12Dierks S.E. Bartlett W.C. Edmeades R.L. Gould H.J. Rao M. Conrad D.H. J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that connects the N-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains to the C-terminal globular domain. Homotrimeric CD23 molecules exhibit a 15-nm α-helical coiled coil stalk that extends the globular C-terminal domains from the plasma membrane (15Beavil R.L. Graber P. Aubonney N. Bonnefoy J.Y. Gould H.J. Immunology. 1995; 84: 202-206PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage in the stalk region by a membrane-associated endoproteolytic activity generates soluble fragments of CD23 (sCD23) that possess apparent molecular masses of 37, 33, and 29 kDa (16Letellier M. Sarfati M. Delespesse G. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All three of these sCD23 fragments exist as homotrimers (15Beavil R.L. Graber P. Aubonney N. Bonnefoy J.Y. Gould H.J. Immunology. 1995; 84: 202-206PubMed Google Scholar). Smaller fragments of CD23 (25 and 16 kDa) are known. However, these are thought to be formed from cleavage of the larger soluble fragments by a cysteine proteinase (16Letellier M. Sarfati M. Delespesse G. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In vitro sCD23 promotes the differentiation of germinal center B-cells into plasma cells (17Liu Y.J. Cairns J.A. Holder M.J.

In vivo, inhibition of proteolytic shedding of CD23 using small molecule metalloproteinase inhibitors has been shown to suppress IgE synthesis in Scid mice that have transplanted human peripheral blood lymphocytes (21Christie G.

The identities of the proteinase activities responsible for generating the 33- and 37-kDa forms of CD23 remain elusive. Release of the 33-kDa fragment from the human B-cell line RPMI 8866 has been shown to be mediated by a membrane-associated metalloproteinase activity (23Marolewski A.E. Buckle D.R. Christie G.

It has been demonstrated that members of the disintegrin/metalloproteinase family (ADAM8, -15, and -28) are capable of cleaving CD23 (24Fourie A.M. Coles F. Moreno V. Karlsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30469-30477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the peptide sequence used to test proteolytic activity was not derived from the known 33- and 37-kDa cleavage sites of CD23 (16Letellier M. Sarfati M. Delespesse G. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this paper, we provide evidence that ADAM10 is catalytically competent in cleaving human CD23 at the known physiologic sites and that it sheds CD23 from human cell lines and primary cultures of human B-cells. Reagents—Commercial reagents were obtained from the following sources: Recombinant human IL-4 and recombinant human catalytic/disintegrin domains of ADAMs 8, 10, and 17 were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs) were from R&D Systems. TAPI-2 was obtained from Calbiochem. Complete proteinase inhibitor mixture was from Roche Applied Science. All other chemicals unless specified otherwise were obtained from Sigma. 2,4-Dinitrophenyl-labeled (DNP) peptides (Table 1) were purchased either from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Peptide Chemistry Department or from SynPep (Dublin, CA). Recombinant prodomain constructs of ADAM10 (A10-(23–213) and A10-(23–181)) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-histidine affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. 4M.

Open table in a new tab Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against ADAM8, -10, and -17 were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) and anti-FLAG tags were from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and anti-HA (HA.11) from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Rabbit polyclonal ant-CD23 was from Anaspec (San Jose, CA). Human CD23 ELISA kits were from BD Biosciences and Invitrogen. PCR and Cloning—A clone of full-length mouse ADAM8 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and used as a PCR template. The primers 5′-ATGCTTGGCCTCTGGCTGCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTCTTCTGGATGGGGACCTTC-3′ (reverse) were used to generate a PCR product that was cloned into a gateway recombinational cloning entry vector (pCR8/GW/TOPO, Invitrogen). Digestion of the full-length mADAM8 clone with AclI and PmlI yielded a 1-kb fragment that was cloned into a 3.8-kb fragment of ADAM8-pCR8 produced by digestion with AclI and HincII. The resulting metalloproteinase domain-deleted (amino acids 228–397) ADAM8 (ADAM8ΔMP) construct was directionally recombined into a modified pQCXIP (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) that contained a Gateway acceptor cassette (Invitrogen) followed by a 3′ FLAG epitope tag. Full-length mouse ADAM10 and mADAM10ΔMP (amino acids 56–457 deleted) were amplified from plasmid templates using the primers 5′-ATGGTGTTGCCGACAGTGTTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCGTCGCATGTGTCCCATT-3′ (reverse). Mouse ADAM17 and ADAM17ΔMP (amino acids 189–378 deleted) were amplified using the primers 5′-ATGAGGCGGCGTCTCCTCATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCACTCTGTCTCTTTGCTGTCAACTCG-3′. All PCR products were cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO, and the sequences were verified and directionally recombined into the gateway-modified pQCXIP vector. The catalytically inactive point mutant of ADAM10(E385A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of ADAM10 in pCR8/GW/TOPO using the mutagenic primers 5′-TCTCATATTACGTTTGCTCATGCAGTTGGACATAACTTTGGATCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGATCCAAAGTTATGTCCAACTGCATGAGCAAACGTAATATGAGA-3′ (reverse) and the polymerase Pfu-turbo (Stratagene). Full-length human CD23b was amplified from IL-4-stimulated U937 cell cDNA using the primers 5′-TCAGACTCGAGCAGGAACTTGGAACAA-GCAGAATTTAGC-3′ (forward; contains a 5′ XhoI site) and 5′-TAGCAGGATCCCTATG-CGTAGTCTGGCACATCATATGGGTAAGAGTGGAGAGGGGCAGAG-3′ (reverse; encodes a C-terminal HA epitope tag followed by a BamHI site). The PCR product was digested with XhoI/BamHI and cloned into pIRES2eGFP (Clontech). The human ADAM10 siRNA construct is based on a previously described sequence (29Maretzky T. Reiss K. Ludwig A. Buchholz J. Scholz F. Proksch E. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9182-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The construct targets the sequence 5′-GACAUUUCAACCUACGAAU-3′. Complementary oligonucleotides encoding the above sequence followed by a hairpin sequence (5′-TTCAAGAGA-3′) and then the reverse complement of the target sequence were annealed and cloned into the retroviral siRNA expression vector pSI-REN-retro-Q (Clontech) The negative control construct pSI-REN-retro-Qneg is available commercially from Clontech. Determination of Enzyme Concentration—The substrate dabcyl-LAQA(homoPhe)RSC(fluorescein)-NH2, 5–10 μm, was added from a 5 mm Me2SO stock into buffer, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.0075% Brij 35. Enzyme (10 μl of a 1/30 diluted stock solution; 200 μg/ml) was added to a 96-well black-coated Costar plate. TIMP1, from a 7.6 μm stock solution, was diluted to 1 μm in the above buffer. It was then serially diluted in 3-fold increments from 1 μm to 3 nm. The diluted TIMP1, 10 μl, was added to the enzyme and allowed to preincubate for 10–15 min after which substrate in buffer (80 μl) was added to initiate the reaction. Reaction progress was monitored continuously in a Cytofluor plate reader by following the change in fluorescence using an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 530 nm. Data were fit to the Morrison equation to calculate the enzyme concentration (44Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). kcat/Km Determination for DNP-Peptide Substrates—The specificity constant kcat/Km (s–1m–1) is calculated as kcat/Km = M/(3600·Ae·Ce), where M (counts/h) is the slope of the net absorbance versus time curve in the early linear range, Ae (counts) is the net increase in absorbance reading at reaction end, Ce (m) is the concentration of enzyme in reaction, and 3600 is a conversion factor (s/h). Cleavage of DNP-Peptide Substrates—Recombinant ADAM proteinase (ADAM8, -10, or -17), 5 μm, was diluted into 50 μlof buffer containing 20–100 μm DNP-substrate. The final concentration of enzyme varied from 50 to 500 nm. The reaction progressed at 37 °C for 40–120 min. The reactions were quenched with an equal volume of 1% heptafluorobutyric acid and spun to remove precipitated protein. Reaction products were run on a C18 Vyadac column using solvents containing 0.1% HFBA with an acetonitrile/water gradient. Peaks were detected with a wavelength of 350 nm. Cleavage sites were determined either by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS; Synpep and Duke University) or by co-chromatography with standard products using two HPLC systems. Cell Culture—U937 (University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) cell culture core) and Ramos (provided by A. DeFranco, UCSF) cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with glutamax (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293T (ATCC) and GP2–293T (Clontech) were cultured in DME-H21 (UCSF cell culture core) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% FBS. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from healthy adult normal volunteers by centrifugation of leukapheresis fractions over diatrizoate/Ficoll gradients (Sigma) and lysing of red blood cells with ACK buffer (ammonium chloride-potassium chloride; Quality Biological, Gaithersburg, MD). B-cells, purified by negative selection using the Rosette-sep technique following the manufacturer’s instructions (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), were cultured (1 × 105 cells/well, 0.5 × 106 cells/ml) in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar, Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA) in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin G (200 units/ml), gentamicin (10 μg/ml), and 5% FBS (200 μl final volume) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Retroviral Transduction—Stable cell lines expressing dominant negative ADAM constructs and siRNAs were produced by retroviral transduction using vesicular stomatitis virus type G (VSV-G) enveloped viruses. The viruses were produced using a pantropic packaging system (Clontech). Retroviral expression vectors (pQCXIP or pSIREN-retro-Q) were co-transfected (FuGENE 6, Roche Applied Science) with a vector encoding the VSV-G envelope protein into GP2-293T packaging cells. 48 h later, U937 cells were suspended in the conditioned medium from the packaging cells that was supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene; 24 h after transduction, stable cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 5 days. CD23 Release from HEK293T Cells—HEK293T cells (250,000/well) were seeded into a 24-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. Using Transfectin (Bio-Rad) cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding C-terminal HA-tagged CD23b (CD23-HA) and full-length ADAM10, ADAM10(E385A), ADAM8, ADAM17, or empty vector (pQCXIP). The medium was replaced with culture medium containing reduced FBS (1%) 24 h after transfection. The reduced serum supernatant was harvested 24 h later. The conditioned medium was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) and supplemented with proteinase inhibitor mixture (Complete). The supernatants were then concentrated 10-fold by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Microcon YM-3, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Cells were washed with cold PBS and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Complete proteinase inhibitor mixture). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation (16,500 × g for 10 min). Radioimmune precipitation assay buffer lysates and concentrated conditioned media were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide gels) and transferred onto PVDF membrane for Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA.11, Covance); this was followed by secondary detection using a goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and chemiluminescence detection using the ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences). CD23 Release from U937 and Ramos Cells—Cells (100,000/well) were seeded in round-bottomed 96-well plates (Sarstedt, Newton, NC) in 0.2 ml of medium supplemented with IL-4 and either inhibitors (A10-(23–213) 150–600 nm, GM6001 10–50 μm, TAPI-2 10–50 μm, TIMPs 250 nm) or vehicle controls (A10-(23–213) buffer: 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 125 mm KCl, 75 mm NaCl 20% glycerol, PBS, or dimethyl sulfoxide). Cells were cultured for 24 h. The conditioned medium was harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g, 15 min) and assayed by ELISA for soluble CD23 according to the manufacturers’ instructions (BD Biosciences or Invitrogen). Flow Cytometric Analysis of Primary B-cell Cultures Treated with wtA10-(23–213)—Purified B-cells were cultured for 12 h in the presence or absence of IL-4 (100 ng/ml), wtA10-(23–213) (1–5 μm), or matched diluent control (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). Cells were stained for expression of surface antigens following washing with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies APC-CD19 (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) or CD23-PE or an isotype-matched control IgG1-PE (BD Biosciences) before washing to remove unbound antibodies. Cells were resuspended in PBS and immediately analyzed using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). The software program Flowjo (TreeStar, Ashland, OR) was used to analyze the data generated by flow cytometry. Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK293T cells were seeded into 10-cm plates and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were then co-transfected (Transfectin, Bio-Rad) with expression vectors encoding ADAM10ΔMP-FLAG and CD23-HA or vector controls (pQCXIP or pIRES2eGFP). Forty-eight hours post-transfection the cells were washed twice with PBS (all procedures at 4 °C) and then lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm CHAPS, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete proteinase inhibitor mixture). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,500 × g, 20 min). The total protein concentration of the supernatants was adjusted to 1 mg/ml with lysis buffer. Polyclonal sera (5 μg, Sigma) against either the HA or FLAG epitopes were added to 1 ml of lysate, incubated for 2 h, and then precipitated using protein A-agarose (Invitrogen). The agarose beads were washed with co-immunoprecipitation buffer and then treated with loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG epitope (M2, Stratagene) or against the HA epitope (HA.11, Covance). Stimulated CD23 Release—U937 cells that were cultured for 24 h with IL-4 (20 ng/ml) were washed and resuspended in PBS (5 × 106/ml), and A10-(23–213), A10-(23–181), TAPI-2, or vehicle control (A10-(23–213) buffer) was then added. Following the addition of stimulus (ionomycin 1 μm; lysophosphatidic acid 10 μm; sphingosine 1-phosphate, phorbol myristate acetate 100 nm; adenosine triphosphate 0.25 mm; or vehicle controls (Me2SO, PBS)) cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The supernatants harvested following centrifugation (10 min at 1,000 × g) were then assayed for CD23 content by ELISA. Time Course for CD23 Shedding—U937 cells (both vector control and ADAM10 siRNA transduced cells) were cultured with IL-4 overnight. Cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended at a density of 500,000/ml in fresh growth medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for time periods of 1, 3, 5, and 7 h. After each time point, clarified supernatants were obtained by centrifugation (10 min at 1,000 × g) and stored at –80 °C until CD23 levels could be determined by ELISA. In human serum, there are five observed molecular weights of sCD23: 37, 33, 29, 25 and 16 kDa. The cleavage sites that give rise to the 37- and 33-kDa forms of the receptor are known and were used to design N-terminal DNP-labeled peptide substrates. Cleavage of the peptides by recombinant human ADAM10 (rhADAM10) was monitored by HPLC separation of the cleavage reactions followed by colorimetric detection of the DNP-chromophore. The peptides used and the resulting specificity constants (kcat/Km) that were determined for each cleavage reaction are reported in Table 1. The specificity constant for a DNP-labeled peptide spanning the TNF-α cleavage site was determined to be 1200 m–1 s–1 and is comparable with the literature value of 2000 m–1 s–1 reported for the N-terminal-acetylated peptide (25Amour A. Knight C.G. Webster A. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The substrate DNP-HGDQ-MAQKSQST-NH2 is based on the cleavage site that gives rise to the 37-kDa form of sCD23. This substrate was cleaved by rhADAM10 with a specificity constant of 250 m–1 s–1. The specificity constant of 250 m–1 s–1 indicated that the efficiency of the cleavage reaction was comparable to that of DNP-EVH-HGKLVTFFAE (350 m–1 s–1), a peptide derived from the α-secretase cleavage site of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is a known ADAM10 substrate (25Amour A. Knight C.G. Webster A. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The peptide corresponding to the 33-kDa cleavage site sequence of CD23, DNP-RAEQQRLKSQDL, was cleaved in two places by rhADAM10 having specificity constants of 190 and 90 m–1 s–1. The proteolysis by rhADAM10 appeared to be selective, as other DNP-labeled peptides derived from the known cleavage sites of TNF receptor I (Table 1) and epidermal growth factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, IL-6 receptor, TNF receptor II, and L-selectin (data not shown) were not processed by this enzyme. We also determined the cleavage site specificity that rhADAM10 exhibited toward the 37- and 33-kDa CD23 peptides and compared it with that of rhADAM8 and rhADAM17 (Table 2). The 37-kDa peptide was cleaved by both rhADAM10 and rhADAM8 at the physiological Ala-Gln site. The 33-kDa peptide was cleaved by rhADAM10 at both the physiological Arg-Leu site and a nonphysiological Gln-Gln site. In contrast, rhADAM8 cleaved the 33-kDa peptide only at the nonphysiological Gln-Gln and Glu-Gln sites. Recombinant human ADAM17, the closest family member of ADAM10, did not possess activity toward either the 37- or 33-kDa peptide but was able to cleave a peptide derived from the cleavage site of TNF-α (data not shown).TABLE 2Recombinant ADAM processing of peptides corresponding to the 33- and 37-kDa cleavage sites in CD23ADAM33 kDaPhys?37 kDaPhys?8AEQ ↓ QRLNoQMA ↓ QKSYesAE ↓ QQRLNo10QQR ↓ LKSYesQMA ↓ QKSYesEQ ↓ QRLKNo17Not cleavedNot cleaved Open table in a new tab To examine the ability of ADAM10 to cleave CD23 in a cell-based assay, we transiently co-transfected ADAM10 and CD23 into HEK293T cells. Wild-type ADAM10 (A10), ADAM10 containing a point mutation (E385A) that renders the proteinase inactive (A10EA), or vector alone was co-transfected with C-terminal HA-tagged CD23 (CD23-HA). After 48 h, the conditioned medium was harvested, and cells were washed and solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Samples from each transfection were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and analyzed by Western blotting for soluble and membrane-bound CD23-HA. The top and bottom panels in Fig. 1A show the conditioned medium and cell lysates, respectively, probed with an anti-HA antibody for the presence of CD23-HA. Transfection of A10 enhanced the accumulation of CD23-HA in the supernatant. Both the A10EA and the vector control transfectants exhibited a background level of CD23 shedding that was partially inhibited using the broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI-2. Quantification of the band intensity in each lane from multiple experiments indicated that transfection with A10 increased shedding by about 50% over vector control transfection (Fig. 1B). In contrast, transfection with the catalytically inactive A10EA did not increase sCD23 production relative to the vector control. Co-transfection of HEK293T cells with ADAM8 (A8) and CD23-HA resulted in a marked increase in sCD23 in the medium (Fig. 1C) as reported previously (24Fourie A.M. Coles F. Moreno V. Karlsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30469-30477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In contrast, co-transfection of ADAM17 (A17) marginally affected shedding of CD23-HA from these cells. The expression of endogenous CD23 is positively regulated by IL-4 in many types of leukocytes. However, the effect of IL-4 on ADAM10 expression is unknown. We cultured U937 promonocytic leukemia cells in the presence of IL-4 for 24 h and analyzed the expression of ADAM10 in cell lysates by Western blotting (Fig. 2, top panel). IL-4 slightly increased the amount of ADAM10 present in the lysates. However, it was a much stronger positive regulator of CD23 (Fig. 2, middle panel). Increases in sCD23 upon exposure to IL-4 are more likely due to the elevated expression of CD23 than to changes in the levels of ADAM10. The effect of inhibitors of metalloproteinases on CD23 shedding was assessed in U937 promonocytic leukemia cells,"
https://openalex.org/W1983731153,"Presenilin 1, a causative gene product of familial Alzheimer disease, has been reported to be localized mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes. However, endogenous Presenilin 1 also localizes at the plasma membrane as a biologically active molecule. Presenilin 1 interacts with N-cadherin/β-catenin to form a trimeric complex at the synaptic site through its loop domain, whose serine residues (serine 353 and 357) can be phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β. Here, we demonstrate that cell-surface expression of Presenilin 1/γ-secretase is enhanced by N-cadherin-based cell-cell contact. Physical interaction between Presenilin 1 and N-cadherin/β-catenin plays an important role in this process. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β-mediated phosphorylation of Presenilin 1 reduces its binding to N-cadherin, thereby down-regulating its cell-surface expression. Moreover, reduction of the Presenilin 1·N-cadherin·β-catenin complex formation leads to an impaired activation of contact-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt cell survival signaling. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Presenilin 1 hinders ϵ-cleavage of N-cadherin, whereas ϵ-cleavage of APP remained unchanged. This is the first report that clarifies the regulatory mechanism of Presenilin 1/γ-secretase with respect to its subcellular distribution and its differential substrate cleavage. Because the cleavage of various membrane proteins by Presenilin 1/γ-cleavage is involved in cellular signaling, glycogen synthase kinase 3β-mediated phosphorylation of Presenilin 1 should be deeply associated with signaling functions. Our findings indicate that the abnormal activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β can reduce neuronal viability and synaptic plasticity via modulating Presenilin 1/N-cadherin/β-catenin interaction and thus have important implications in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease.

Amyloid plaques are composed of amyloid β peptide (Aβ), which is derived from the sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP), whereas neurofibrillary tangles are characterized by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau. Aβ peptides are yielded by the intramembranous cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragment by Presenilin 1 (PS1)/γ-secretase (1De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G.

Interestingly, PS1·γ-secretase complex is also involved in the ϵ-cleavage of various other membrane proteins (2Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R.

Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) plays an important role in Tau phosphorylation (6Hanger D.P. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Brion J.P. Anderton B.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 147: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). GSK3β is expressed in a variety of tissues with the highest level in the brain, where it localizes especially in neurons (7Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Recent study showed that PS1 is an unprimed substrate of GSK3β (8Twomey C. McCarthy J.V. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4015-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and serine residues in the PS1 loop domain can be phosphorylated (9Kirschenbaum F. Hsu S.C. Cordell B. McCarthy J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7366-7375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Abnormal increases in GSK3β level and activity have been associated with AD pathology (6Hanger D.P. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Brion J.P. Anderton B.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 147: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 10Bhat R.V. Budd Haeberlein S.L. Avila J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1313-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), suggesting that GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of PS1 might also be involved in AD pathophysiology.Classically, PS1 has been reported to be localized mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes (11Annaert W.G. Levesque L. Craessaerts K. Dierinck I. Snellings G. Westaway D. George-Hyslop P.S. Cordell B. Fraser P. De Strooper B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Recently, it is also demonstrated that endogenous PS1 localizes at the plasma membrane as an active molecule (12Chyung J.H. Raper D.M. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4383-4392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Actually, in neurons, PS1 binds to β-catenin and N-(and E-) cadherin through a large hydrophilic loop region (13Georgakopoulos A. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shioi J. Cui W. Li H.C. Schutte M.

Moreover, N-cadherin is cleaved by PS1/γ-secretase in response to N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-type receptor stimulation (14Marambaud P. Wen P.H. Dutt A. Shioi J. Takashima A. Siman R. Robakis N.K.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and regulates synaptogenesis and dendritic spine morphology (17Togashi H. Abe K. Mizoguchi A. Takaoka K.

Neuron. 2002; 35: 91-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In addition, N-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion activates PI3K/Akt cell survival signaling by recruiting PI3K to the N-cadherin adhesion complex (19Tran N.L. Adams D.G. Vaillancourt R.R. Heimark R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32905-32914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Actually, PS1 facilitates this process by promoting cadherin/PI3K association in γ-secretase activity-independent manner (20Baki L. Shioi J. Wen P. Shao Z. Schwarzman A. Gama-Sosa M. Neve R. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Collectively, PS1/N-cadherin interaction at the synapse seems to be neuroprotective by facilitating PI3K/Akt survival signaling. However, the cellular mechanism that determines PS1/N-cadherin binding has never been elucidated so far.Here, we demonstrate that cell-surface distribution of PS1 is enhanced in the presence of N-cadherin-based cell-cell contact. The physical interaction between PS1 and N-cadherin/β-catenin plays an important role in cell-surface expression of PS1/γ-secretase. Moreover, GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of PS1 reduces its binding to N-cadherin, thereby down-regulating its cell-surface expression. Reduced PS1/N-cadherin/β-catenin interaction leads to the inhibition of contact-mediated PI3K/Akt cell survival signal activation as well as the differential regulation of substrate cleavage by PS1/γ-secretase. These results demonstrated that the redistribution of PS1 to the plasma membrane is regulated by its phosphorylation and that the distributional change modifies the PI3K/Akt signal as well as substrate cleavage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—A cDNA copy of human N-cadherin (GenBank™ accession number M34064) gene was amplified from first strand cDNA human fetal brain (Stratagene) by a forward primer, 5′-TTTTTTGCTAGCACCATGGATAAAGAACGCCAGGCC-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-TTTTTGGGCCCTCAGGCGTAATCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAGTCATCACCTCCACCATACATGTCAGCA-3′, for C-terminal hemagglutinin tagging.

For the expression of human APP, the entire coding sequence of human APP695 was subcloned in a mammalian expression vector pME/sf. The construction of plasmid, expressing wtPS1 was described elsewhere (21Uemura K. Kitagawa N. Kohno R. Kuzuya A. Kageyama T. Shibasaki H. Shimohama S. J. Neurosci.

For PS1Δ350-340, different primer sets (5′-TTTTTGACGTCCCAGATTACGCCCATCGCTCTACACCTGAGTCACGAGCT-3′ and 5′-TTTTTTGGGCCCCTAGATATAAAATTGATGGAA-3′) were used.For tetracycline-inducible expression of constitutively active (S9A) GSK3β, a cDNA copy of human GSK3β (GenBank number M34064) was amplified by PCR, using a forward primer, 5′-TTTTTTGGTACCGCCATGTCAGGGCGGCCCAGAA-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-TTTTTTGGGCCCTCAGGTGGAGTTGGAAGCTGAT-3′. PCR product was subcloned into KpnI-ApaI sites of pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen). Constitutively active (S9A) GSK3β (22Li B. Ryder J. Su Y. Moore Jr., S.A. Liu F. Solenberg P. Brune K. Fox N. Ni B. Liu R.

HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For the establishment of cell lines in which S9A GSK3β (S9A-tet cells) expression can be induced by tetracycline (tet-on), SH-SY5Y cells were first transfected with pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After selection of cells by 5 μg/ml blasticidin, stably transfected clones were then transfected with GSK3β (or S9A GSK3β)/pcDNA4/TO, and selected by 100 μg/ml zeocin.Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. PS1/PS2 double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (MEF PS-/- cells) (23Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. De Strooper and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Transient transfection of wtPS1, PS1 mutants, N-cadherin, and S9AGSK3β into cells were achieved by using the lipofection method, with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).CHO cells, stably expressing Swedish (K670N/M671L) mutant human APP695 (APPSw-CHO cells) were obtained as follows: the entire coding sequence of human APP695 was subcloned in a mammalian expression vector pME/sf. Swedish mutations (K670M/N770L) (24Mullan M. Crawford F. Axelman K. Houlden H. Lilius L. Winblad B. Lannfelt L. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. CHO cells were transfected with the APP cDNA together with pSVbsr plasmid and the cells were selected for resistance against blasticidin (10 μg/ml). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO cells stably expressing both Swedish mutant APP and human N-cadherin (APPsw/Ncad-CHO cells) were obtained as follows: APPsw-CHO cells were transfected with N-cadherin/pcDNA3.1(+). Cells were selected by 800 μg/ml G418 and the establishment of stably transfected clones was verified by Western blot.Antibodies and Chemical Reagents—Anti-N-cadherin C terminus, anti-GSK3β, and anti-total β-catenin antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-β-actin, anti-nicastrin, anti-APP C terminus, and anti-phosphoserine antibodies were from Sigma.

Ionomycin was obtained from Calbiochem.Cell Treatment by Reagents—For the induction of S9AGSK3β, S9A-tet cells were treated with 1 μg/ml tetracycline containing medium. siRNA constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were analyzed 24 h after siRNA transfection. For calcium switch experiments, confluent MEF PS-/- cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 4 h, treated with 4 mm EGTA for 40 min and then switched to serum-free, calcium-containing medium for the times shown (20Baki L. Shioi J. Wen P. Shao Z. Schwarzman A. Gama-Sosa M. Neve R. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2586-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). For stimulation of N-cadherin cleavage, MEF PS-/- cells were treated by 10 μm ionomycin dissolved in Opti-MEM for 30 min.Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—Preparation of protein samples, the Western blot, and immunoprecipitation analysis were carried out as described elsewhere (25Uemura K. Kitagawa N. Kohno R. Kuzuya A. Kageyama T. Chonabayashi K. Shibasaki H. Shimohama S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For some experiments, cells were fractionated as previously described (25Uemura K. Kitagawa N. Kohno R. Kuzuya A. Kageyama T. Chonabayashi K. Shibasaki H. Shimohama S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Biotinylation of Cell-surface Proteins—Confluent cells grown in φ10-cm dish were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in the solution containing 0.5 mg of Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce)/ml of phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and biotinylated proteins were precipitated by 30 μl of streptoavidin-agarose (Invitrogen) from equal amounts of cell lysates. Precipitated biotinylated proteins were then subjected to Western blot analysis.Immunostaining—The samples for immunostaining were prepared as described elsewhere (25Uemura K. Kitagawa N. Kohno R. Kuzuya A. Kageyama T. Chonabayashi K. Shibasaki H. Shimohama S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Samples were examined using a laser scanning confocal microscopy, LSM 510 META (Zeiss), or a fluorescence microscopy, Axiovert 200 (Zeiss).RESULTSCell-surface Expression of PS1 Is Enhanced by the Cadherin-mediated Cell-Cell Contact—To examine the relationship between the cadherin-based cell-cell contact and subcellular distribution of PS1, we established CHO cell lines stably expressing both Swedish mutations of human APP695 and human N-cadherin (APPsw/Ncad-CHO cells). CHO cells are suitable for the analysis of exogenously introduced N-cadherin, because it barely expresses endogenous cadherin species. APPsw/Ncad-CHO cells were compared with CHO cells stably expressing Swedish mutation of APP695 only (APPSw-CHO cells) by immunostaining (Fig. 1). In APPsw/Ncad-CHO cells, N-cadherin immunoreactivity was prominent at the sites of cell contact (Fig. 1A). PS1 was also seen at the cell-cell contact sites (Fig. 1B), where it co-localized with N-cadherin (Fig. 1C). The outline of APPsw/Ncad-CHO cells was clearly visualized by PS1 staining (Fig. 1, B and C, compared with the perinuclear PS1 staining in Fig. 1E), indicating that N-cadherin expression redistributed the PS1 subcellular localization to the plasma membranes. Next, we compared PS1 and β-catenin distribution in the presence or absence of N-cadherin. In APPSw-CHO cells, β-catenin and PS1 immunoreactivity were mainly seen at the perinuclear area (Fig. 1, D-F). Stable expression of N-cadherin recruited both β-catenin (Fig. 1G) and PS1 (Fig. 1H) to cell-cell contact sites (compare with the perinuclear PS1 staining in Fig. 1E), showing co-localization of both proteins (Fig. 1I). Thus, stable expression of N-cadherin led to the redistribution of PS1 to the plasma membrane, especially to cell-cell contact sites, where N-cadherin, PS1, and β-catenin all colocalized.To confirm that the cadherin-based adhesion promotes cell-surface expression of PS1/γ-secretase, we transiently expressed human N-cadherin into CHO cells and examined the level of cell-surface PS1/γ-secretase by the biotinylation assay (Fig. 1J). Transient expression of N-cadherin enhanced both cell-surface expression levels of nicastrin and PS1, whereas the total levels of these proteins were comparable, demonstrating that cadherin-based adhesion enhances the cell-surface expression level of PS1/γ-secretase (Fig. 1J). We further verified this finding by RNA interference (Fig. 1K) using HEK293 cells, which endogenously express human N-cadherin, β-catenin, and PS1. 24 h after N-cadherin knockdown, cell-surface expression levels of both PS1 and nicastrin were reduced, whereas the total levels of these proteins remained unchanged (Fig. 1K, fourth lane), compared with control (Fig. 1K, second lane). The protein level of β-catenin was reduced in the background of N-cadherin knockdown, indicating that β-catenin lost its stability in the absence of N-cadherin (Fig. 1K, fourth lane). We also tested the effect of β-catenin knockdown on cell-surface expression of γ-secretase components. Interestingly, 24 h after β-catenin knockdown, cell-surface nicastrin was reduced, without changing the cellular level of N-cadherin (Fig. 1K, third lane), although β-catenin knockdown had less impact on cell-surface PS1 distribution compared with N-cadherin knockdown (compare Fig. 1K, third and fourth lanes). Collectively, these experiments indicate that cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion promotes the expression of PS1/γ-secretase at the cell surface.GSK3β Activity Modulates the Binding of PS1 to N-cadherin/β-Catenin—To analyze the effect of the mutual interaction among PS1/N-cadherin/β-catenin on cell-surface distribution of PS1/γ-secretase, we constructed deletion mutants of PS1, which lack part of the loop domain (PS1Δ340-375 and Δ340-350, Fig. 2A) necessary for the interaction with N-cadherin/β-catenin (26Baki L. Marambaud P. Efthimiopoulos S. Georgakopoulos A. Wen P. Cui W. Shioi J. Koo E. Ozawa M. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Robakis N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2381-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Transfection into HEK293 cells revealed that wtPS1 binds both N-cadherin and β-catenin (Fig. 2B, third lane). The deletion mutants (PS1Δ340-375 and Δ340-350) formed complexes with neither N-cadherin nor β-catenin (Fig. 2B, fourth and fifth lanes). Therefore, amino acids around 340-350 in the PS1 loop domain are crucially important for PS1·N-cadherin·β-catenin complex formation.FIGURE 2GSK3β activity modulates the binding of PS1 to N-cadherin/β-catenin. A, schematic representation of PS1 mutants lacking the domain required for PS1/N-cadherin/β-catenin interaction (PS1Δ340-375 and Δ340-350). The phosphorylation sites of wtPS1 by GSK3β are indicated at the bottom (9Kirschenbaum F. Hsu S.C. Cordell B. McCarthy J.V. J. Biol.

B, wtPS1, deletion mutants (PS1Δ340-375 or Δ340-350) or pseudo-phosphorylation mutants (S353D or S357D PS1) were transfected into HEK293 cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed and lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-PS1 NTF antibody, followed by the Western blot analysis. Control precipitation was done with normal rabbit IgG (first lane). wtPS1 robustly associated with both N-cadherin and β-catenin (third lane). None of the deletion mutants significantly associated with N-cadherin or β-catenin (fourth and fifth lanes). The association between pseudo-phosphorylation mutants (S353D PS1, sixth lane and S357D PS1, seventh lane) and N-cadherin/β-catenin was reduced, compared with wtPS1 (third lane), whereas the expression level of each PS1·N-cadherin·β-catenin complex component was similar in the total cell lysate (Lys). The bottom is the loading control, represented by the β-actin bands. C, either wtPS1 or one of thepseudo-phosphorylation mutants (S353D or S357D PS1) was transfected into MEF PS-/- cells, followed by immunoprecipitation, using anti-PS1 NTF antibody and Western blot analysis. Control precipitation was done with normal rabbit IgG (first lane). wtPS1 bound both N-cadherin and β-catenin (second lane). The association between pseudo-phosphorylation mutants (S353D PS1, third lane, and S357D PS1, fourth lane) and N-cadherin/β-catenin was reduced, compared with wtPS1. The expression level of each PS1/N-cadherin·β-catenin complex component was similar in the total cell lysate (Lys). The bottom is the loading control, represented by the β-actin bands. D, either control GFP (second lane) or constitutively active (S9A) GSK3β (third lane) was transfected into HEK293 cells, followed by immunoprecipitation, using anti-PS1 NTF antibody. Control precipitation was done with normal rabbit IgG (first lane). Note that PS1-bound N-cadherin is reduced under the expression of S9AGSK3β (third lane), whereas the total level of N-cadherin did not change significantly (Lys). The bottom is the loading control, represented by the β-actin bands. E, left, S9A-tet cells were treated with 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 24 h. Cells were lysed after treatment and analyzed by anti-phospho-β-catenin (Ser33/Ser37/Thr41) and anti-total β-catenin antibodies. The magnitude of GSK3β expression was demonstrated by anti-GSK3β antibody. The induction of GSK3β expression was evident (GSK3β). Phosphorylation of β-catenin was enhanced (phospho-β-catenin), whereas total β-catenin levels were reduced (Total β-catenin) 24 h after treatment. The bottom is the loading control, represented by the β-actin bands. Right, S9A-tet cells were treated by 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 24 h. Cells were lysed after treatment and immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphoserine antibody, followed by the Western blot, using anti-PS1 CTF. The PS1 CTF immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphoserine was increased after tetracycline treatment (Top, PS1 CTF), whereas the total levels of PS1 CTF were comparable between before and after treatment (Lys, PS1 CTF). The bottom is the loading control, represented by the β-actin bands. F, S9A-tet cells were treated by 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 24 h. Cells were lysed after treatment and the lysates were immunoprecipitated by anti-PS1 NTF antibody. Control precipitation was done with normal rabbit IgG (first lane). PS1/N-cadherin interaction was reduced after tet-on (third lane), compared with before tet-on (second lane). The expression levels of N-cadherin were demonstrated in the total cell lysates (Lys).

Because the PS1 loop domain around amino acids 340-350 was essential for PS1/N-cadherin/β-catenin interaction (Fig. 2B, fifth lane), we assumed that GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of PS1 would change its binding to N-cadherin/β-catenin. To test this, pseudo-phosphorylation mutants of PS1 (S353D and S357D) were produced by site-directed mutagenesis. Either wtPS1 or pseudo-phosphorylation mutants were transfected into HEK293 cells to investigate the effect of PS1 phosphorylation on PS1/N-cadherin/β-catenin interaction. Immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the association of pseudo-phosphorylation mutants (S353D and S357D PS1) with N-cadherin, as well as β-catenin, was dramatically reduced (Fig. 2B, sixth and seventh lanes), compared with wtPS1 (Fig. 2B, third lane), suggesting that GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation negatively affects the binding of PS1 to N-cadherin/β-catenin. To examine the above findings under PS1-null background, we transiently transfected wild-type, S353D or S357D PS1 into PS1/PS2 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEF PS-/- cells) and examined the PS1·N-cadherin·β-catenin complex formation (Fig. 2C). As expected, both S353D (Fig. 2C, third lane) and S357D (Fig. 2C, fourth lane) PS1 had reduced ability to interact with N-cadherin as well as β-catenin, compared with wild-type PS1 (Fig. 2C, second lane).The above experiments suggested that activation of GSK3β would reduce the PS1/N-cadherin interaction via PS1 phosphorylation in the loop domain. Accordingly, the immunoprecipitation assay revealed that transient transfection of constitutively active GSK3β (S9A mutant) (22Li B. Ryder J. Su Y. Moore Jr., S.A. Liu F. Solenberg P. Brune K. Fox N.

https://openalex.org/W2029072905,"In cardiac muscle the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays a key role in the control of contraction, releasing Ca(2+) in response to Ca(2+) influx across the sarcolemma via voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. Here we report evidence for an additional distinct Ca(2+) store and for actions of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) to mobilize Ca(2+) from this store, leading in turn to enhanced Ca(2+) loading of the SR. Photoreleased NAADP increased Ca(2+) transients accompanying stimulated action potentials in ventricular myocytes. The effects were prevented by bafilomycin A (an H(+)-ATPase inhibitor acting on acidic Ca(2+) stores), by desensitizing concentrations of NAADP, and by ryanodine and thapsigargin to suppress SR function. Bafilomycin A also suppressed staining of acidic stores with Lysotracker Red without affecting SR integrity. Cytosolic application of NAADP by means of its membrane permeant acetoxymethyl ester increased myocyte contraction and the frequency and amplitude of Ca(2+) sparks, and these effects were inhibited by bafilomycin A. Effects of NAADP were associated with an increase in SR Ca(2+) load and appeared to be regulated by beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation. The observations are consistent with a novel role for NAADP in cardiac muscle mediated by Ca(2+) release from bafilomycin-sensitive acidic stores, which in turn enhances SR Ca(2+) release by increasing SR Ca(2+) load."
https://openalex.org/W2030608964,"The repulsive guidance molecule RGMa has been shown to induce outgrowth inhibition of neurites by interacting with the transmembrane receptor neogenin. Here we show that RGMa-induced growth cone collapse is mediated by activation of the small GTPase RhoA, its downstream effector Rho kinase and PKC. In contrast to DRG cultures from neogenin-/- mice, in which no RGMa-mediated growth cone collapse and activation of RhoA occurred, treatment of wild type DRG neurites with soluble RGMa led to a marked activation of RhoA within 3 min followed by collapse, but left Rac1 and Cdc42 unaffected. Furthermore, preincubation of DRG axons with the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist noggin had no effect on RGMa-mediated growth cone collapse, implying that the role of RGM in axonal guidance is neogenin- and not BMP receptor-dependent. Pretreatment with 1) C3-transferase, a specific inhibitor of the Rho GTPase; 2) Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of Rho kinase; and 3) Gö6976, the general PKC inhibitor, strongly inhibited the collapse rate of PC12 neurites. Growth cone collapse induced by RGMa was abolished by the expression of dominant negative RhoA, but not by dominant negative Rac1. In contrast to RGMa, netrin-1 induced no growth cone retraction but instead reduced RGMa-mediated growth cone collapse. These results suggest that activation of RhoA, Rho kinase, and PKC are physiologically relevant and important elements of the RGMa-mediated neogenin signal transduction pathway involved in axonal guidance.

Furthermore, increased amounts of GTP-RhoA were observed in these primary neurons after the addition of soluble RGMa. Neogenin, which is expressed by growing nerve cells in the developing vertebrate brain, consists of four immunoglobulin-like domains followed by six fibronectin type III domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain (4.Rajagopalan S.

Neogenin is closely related to the netrin-1 receptor deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC); it binds RGMa and, to a lesser extent, netrin-1 directly (4.Rajagopalan S. Deitinghoff L. Davis D.

Development. 2006; 133: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) reported finding no effect of netrin-1 on either axon attraction or repulsion of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurites, but did see a general suppression of axon outgrowth from DRG by netrin-1 after 24–48 h in co-culture experiments. In addition to the ligand-receptor interaction of RGMa and neogenin it has been shown that RGMa, RGMb (dragon), and RGMc (hemojevelin) act as BMP co-receptors (16.Samad T.A. Srinivasan A.

Although no functional data were provided it was hypothesized that RGM family members might increase the sensitivity of cells in which they are expressed to BMP stimulation, thereby allowing these cells to respond earlier or more robustly to low levels of BMP ligand (18.Babitt J.L. Huang F.W. Wrighting D.M. Xia Y. Sidis Y. Samad T.A. Campagna J.A. Chung R.T. Schneyer A.L. Woolf C.J. Andrews N.C. Lin H.Y. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). It remains open whether BMPs could be involved in mediating the RGMa role in axonal guidance and growth cone collapse. Each guidance molecule has to activate a cascade of intracellular effectors that eventually results in a cytoskeletal rearrangement underlying the guidance of axon extension or repulsion (19.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 20.Huber A.B. Kolodkin A.L. Ginty D.D. Cloutier J.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 509-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). There is a great deal of evidence indicating that axon guidance cue signaling involves the action of proteins belonging to the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, key regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Rho family GTPases orchestrate actin filament assembly and disassembly by controlling actin polymerization, branching, and depolymerization. These GTPases are thus likely to function as key mediators linking the guidance signal to cytoskeletal dynamics and controlling the organization of actin filaments. Indeed, marked changes in the morphology, motility, and pathfinding of axons have been observed after perturbation of the Rho family GTPases in vitro and in vivo (21.Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 22.Mueller B.K. Mack H. Teusch N. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In general, these studies suggest that Rac and Cdc42 are positive regulators that promote neurite extension, whereas Rho is a negative regulator that causes the inhibition or collapse of growth cones. Several known guidance factors, including netrins, slits, semaphorins, ephrins, receptor tyrosine phosphatases, neurotrophins, cell adhesion receptors, myelin-associated receptors, and also neogenin have been shown to regulate intracellular Rho GTPase activity (4.Rajagopalan S. Deitinghoff L. Davis D. Conrad S. Skutella T. Chedotal A. Mueller B.K. Strittmatter S.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 7.Hata K. Fujitani M. Yasuda Y.

Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). We therefore theorized that different Rho GTPases might have distinct roles in the RGMa guidance signal's mediation of growth cone collapse. To analyze the signal transduction machinery in primary sensory neurons and PC12 cells underlying RGMa-neogenin-induced collapse, we focused on PKC, the small GTPase Rho and its downstream effectors, and serine/threonine Rho kinase. In several cell systems, such as fibroblasts, neuroblastoma cells, neuron-like PC12 cells, and primary neurons, activation of Rho leads to rapid growth cone collapse, neurite retraction, or neurite growth inhibition. These responses are prevented by a specific inhibitor of Rho and the bacterial exoenzyme C3-transferase; C3-transferase ADP ribosylates RhoA, -B, and -C (but not Cdc42 and Rac) at Asn-41, thereby inhibiting these GTPases (23.Aktories K. Just I. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 291: 113-145PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the downstream targets of active GTP-bound Rho is the Rho-associated kinase ROCK (25.Redowicz M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which is specifically inhibited by the pyridine derivative Y-27632 (26.Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the signal transduction of RGMa-mediated growth cone collapse. Using neogenin knock-out mice we found strong evidence that the interaction of RGMa and neogenin is specific and important in axon repulsion. We could exclude BMP signaling in this context. We used primary sensory neurons and differentiated PC12 cells to examine the effects of expressing mutant forms of Rho and Rac1 in growth cone collapse induced by RGMa. Pull-down assays showed that RhoA mediates chemorepulsion, but not Rac1 or Cdc42. We found that PKC is involved in addition to the RhoA pathway and that regulation of each of these can trigger repulsive behavior mediated by the neogenin receptor. Experiments with netrin-1 indicated that the repulsive effect of RGMa could be silenced by preincubation with netrin-1. Neogenin Mutants−Mice homozygous for neogenin were kindly provided by Dr. M. Tessier-Lavigne (Genentech). In Situ Hybridization−For in situ hybridization experiments, E14.5 BL6 mice embryos were frozen over liquid nitrogen and embedded in OCT. Hybridization was performed with digoxygenin-labeled antisense riboprobes, corresponding to coding frames of mouse RGMa and neogenin cDNA (27.Oldekamp J. Kramer N. Varez-Bolado G. Skutella T. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28.Schmidtmer J. Engelkamp D. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), on sagittal cryostat sections (20 μm). Dorsal Root Ganglia and PC12 Cell Culture−For differentiation and neurite outgrowth a single cell culture of dorsal root cells was prepared from E12 wild type or neogenin-/- mutant embryos and cultured for 48 h on laminin-coated 12-well plates in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, B27, glutamine, mitose inhibitors, and 50 ng/ml NGF. To analyze RGMa-induced growth cone collapse in more detail, we also used PC12 cells seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates coated with laminin (20 μg/ml) and cultivated in 500 μl of RMPI 1640 media supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 12 h at 37 °C in aCO2 incubator. 50 ng/ml of NGF was then added to the culture medium and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. PCR of DRG, PC12 Cell cDNA, and Embryonic Mouse Brain cDNA−The following primer combinations were used to amplify RGMa, RGMb, BMP-2, and BMP-4: RGMa, 5′-tgcaaaatcctcaagtg, 5′-cggcggcggcggcggccacggctc; RGMb, 5′-ggtgattgccaacagcc, 5′-catccctacatcccccacagctgc; BMP-2, 5′-aagaagccgtggaggaactt, 5′-tgacgcttttctcgtttgtg; BMP-4, 5′-tcttcaacctcagcagcatcc, 5′-ccaatcattccagcccacg. Coimmunoprecipitation of Clustered RGMa and the Extracellular Domain of Neogenin−HEK293 cell supernatant containing neogenin-AP (neogenin in AP-tag vector) or supernatant containing RGMa-Fc (RGMa in pigtail plus vector) was concentrated with Nanosep 10K columns. Samples containing equal amounts of control supernatants (AP-tag alone) or supernatants containing neogenin-AP were mixed with samples containing clustered RGMa-Fc. These mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Then an equal volume of an immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2% Nonidet P-40) was added to each mixture, and the samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were recovered and mixed with monoclonal AP-Sepharose beads (GenHunter), and the samples were incubated under stirring at 4 °C for 2 h. The samples were centrifuged again at 5,000 × g for 1 min, and the immune complexes were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline. Then the beads were mixed with SDS sample buffer and boiled for 2 min at 100 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to AP-TAG and RGM protein. Immunohistochemistry−After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the PC12 cells were stained with monoclonal antibody specific for RhoA and a polyclonal antibody for neogenin (both from Santa Cruz, Biotechnology). As negative control we used a specific blocking peptide for the neogenin antibody (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology); for RhoA the primary antibody was omitted in the control. An alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Dianova) was used as a secondary antibody, and nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrate. PC12 cells were also stained with Alexa 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche) and caspase-3 immunostaining (Cell Signaling Technology, Roche) were used for the analysis of cell death. Collapse Assay−RGMa-Fc was generated in a pigtail plus vector (Novagen) by inserting the mouse RGMa coding sequence (27.Oldekamp J. Kramer N. Varez-Bolado G. Skutella T. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28.Schmidtmer J. Engelkamp D. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2004; 4: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) without the signal peptide or glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and amplifying by PCR with the HindIII and XbaI sites. RGMa-Fc was stably transfected into HEK293 cells, and the supernatants with the fusion protein were further processed for collapse experiments. The proteins were clustered with an anti-human IgG1-Fc antibody (Calbiochem) to induce a stronger collapsing activity of the RGMa fusion protein. 500 μl of medium containing 60 μl of RGMa-pigtail protein clustered (RGMa-pI + IgG) were used for the collapse experiments; pigtail protein alone (pI + IgG) served as the control. In all experiments, a baseline was set to check the vitality of the differentiated DRGs or PC12 cells. RGMa-pI + IgG or pI + IgG was added 5 min after the beginning of the collapse assay, and every experiment was observed and recorded for 30 min with a Live Cell Imaging System (Zeiss) at a magnification of ×20. The collapsed and non-collapsed growth cones (n = 100) were counted in each culture, and the data were analyzed with Microsoft Excel. Data are expressed here as mean ± S.E. For toxin A experiments, the cells were treated with 5–10 nm toxin A and incubated for 2 h before start of the collapse experiments after addition of RGMa-pI + IgG. For C3-transferase experiments, 500 μl of medium containing 15 μl of C2–C3 (300 ng/ml) was added to the PC12 cell cultures 5 h before collapse induction by RGMa-pI + IgG. Rho kinase was inhibited by adding 100 nm Y-27632 Rho kinase inhibitor (Calbiochem) to the cultures 30 min before the RGMa-pI + IgG collapse experiments. For inhibition of protein kinase C, the cells were pretreated for 24 h with 20 μl of 10 nm to 10 μm PKC inhibitor (Calbiochem). Direct BMP-receptor activation was blocked by preincubating the BMP antagonist noggin at 100 ng/ml for 1 h. Netrin-1 Experiments−300 ng/ml netrin-1 (R&D Systems) was preincubated for 30 min or incubated in parallel with RGMa-Fc for collapse experiments with PC12 cells. For transfection with AMAXA, the genes for wild-type normal active (RhoA WT; Rac1 WT), dominant negative (RhoA N19, Rac1 T17N), or constitutive active (RhoA V14; Rac1 G12V) RhoA or Rac1 were cloned into pEGFP-C1 eukaryotic expression vector. After transfection the cells were plated on laminin-coated wells as described above, followed by the collapse assay. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Protein Pull-down Assay−This assay is based on the capability of GST-Rhotekin and GST-PAK1 to bind to GTP-bound Rho, Cdc42, and Rac1, respectively. The fusion proteins were prepared after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads 4B (GE Healthcare). PC12 cells were plated on laminin-coated 12-well dishes. After 24 h, RGMa-pI + IgG (40 μg/ml) or pI + IgG (40 μg/ml) was added to the cultures, and the cells were lysed with GST-FISH buffer after 3, 6, 9, and 12 min of incubation. The lysates were bound to the prepared beads, and aliquots were taken to determine total amounts of Rho, Cdc42, and Rac1 by immunodetection on Western blots using monoclonal RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Total RhoA was used for quantification of the protein contents. For the quantification of Rho and PKC kinase activities, we used non-radioactive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for Rho (Cyclex Co., Ltd.) and PKC (Stressgene). Kinase activities were inhibited with 100 nm of the specific inhibitor for Rho and 2 μm of the specific inhibitor for PKC. The kinase activities were measured at a wavelength of 450 nm. Statistical Analysis of the Different Groups−Statistics were derived by one-way analysis of variance with at least 3 independent experiments performed in each experimental setting. In all analyses, differences were considered statistically significant at p = 0.01. The criteria for collapsed DRG and PC12 neurites were a total loss of growth cones and retraction of the neurites. Images were collected with the Zeiss Live Cell Imaging System and AxioVision analysis software. RGMa Induces Growth Cone Collapse in Neogenin-expressing Primary Dorsal Root Ganglion Cells−Nonradioactive in situ hybridization showed that neogenin is expressed by dorsal root ganglia at E14.5, but RGMa is not (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed that neogenin and RGMa interact directly (Fig. 1, B and C). In a first step, we analyzed the growth cone collapse activity of RGMa with primary dorsal root ganglion cells from wild-type and neogenin knock-out mutants (Fig. 2, A–D). In the in vitro assay, the growth cones of NGF-stimulated dorsal root ganglion cells started to collapse 3–9 min after the addition of RGMa-Fc to the culture medium (Fig. 2, A and D). No effect was observed after the application of Fc-control protein (Fig. 2, B and D). Furthermore, no RGMa-induced growth cone collapse was observed in DRG cells prepared from neogenin-/- mutants (Fig. 2C,D). The RGMa protein was clustered with a specific antibody against the anti-human IgG1-Fc domain. In comparison to unclustered RGMa, which also induced growth cone retraction in PC12 cells (data not shown), the clustered form induced a faster and stronger effect. To determine whether neogenin directly regulates Rho GTPase activity, we carried out biochemical assays with the DRG cultures and observed a marked activation of RhoA in wild-type but not in neogenin-/- mutants within 3 min after the application of clustered RGMa (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, no activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 was observed in wild-type DRGs (data not shown). BMPs Are Not Involved in RGMa-mediated Growth Cone Collapse of DRGs−The next experimental question concerned the involvement of the BMP pathway in the RGMa-induced collapse response. Because it has been shown that RGMa, RGMb (dragon), and RGMc (hemojevelin) act as BMP-2 and BMP-4 co-receptors under certain conditions (16.Samad T.A. Srinivasan A. Karchewski L.A. Jeong S.J.

Genet. 2006; 38: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), we tested whether BMPs could be involved in mediating RGMa-mediated growth cone collapse. PCR analysis revealed that DRG and PC12 cells express BMP-2, but not BMP-4 (Fig. 3A). Next, we tested whether the BMP antagonist noggin influences RGMa-induced growth cone collapse. We found no case in which the RGMa-induced collapse response could be influenced by noggin in primary DRG neurites (Fig. 3B) or PC12 cells (data not shown). This is consistent with the results of neogenin mutant experiments and implies that neogenin rather than a BMP receptor is necessary to mediate the RGMa signal to the cellular pathway to initiate the collapse response in the primary neurons. We believe that the results are strong evidence that neogenin plays a role in RGMa-induced signaling events. Expression of Neogenin and Rho GTPases but Not RGMs in PC12 Neurons−We selected PC12 cells to study growth cone collapse induced by RGMa because, as confirmed by PCR analysis, these cells constitutively express neogenin but not RGMa or RGMb (Fig. 4A). To analyze the role of the Rho GTPase in RGMa-induced collapse of PC12 cells, we next used immunohistochemistry to determine whether RhoA and neogenin proteins are expressed by these cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Differentiated PC12 cells growing on a laminin substrate were fixed after 48 h of NGF treatment and stained with neogenin- and RhoA-specific antibodies. Neogenin and RhoA were strongly detected in the cell bodies, the growth cones, and to a lesser extent in the neurites of PC12 cells as well (Fig. 4, B, B/1, C, and C/1). The growth cones of the PC12 cells also stained positive with Alexa 488-phalloidin (Fig. 4D). RGMa Induces Growth Cone Collapse in PC12 Cells−We used differentiated PC12 cells as a cell culture model to analyze RGMa-induced growth cone collapse in more detail. During live-cell imaging, clustered RGMa induced a 85–95% collapse of PC12 cells (Fig. 5, B and C), and retraction of the growth cones occurred ∼3–6 min after the addition of 4.8 μg/ml of RGMa to the culture medium. We observed no unspecific, spontaneously collapsed PC12 cells in time-lapse experiments after the addition of the RGMa-Fc protein, and the onset of growth cone retraction was stable in the same time frame. In contrast, the addition of the clustered control protein did not induce collapse (Fig. 5, A and C). Toxin A, C2–C3, Rho Inhibitor, and Neogenin Antibody Block RGMa-induced Growth Cone Collapse−To test whether Rho GTPases are involved in RGMa-induced growth cone collapse via the neogenin receptor, we first examined the effect of toxin A, an inhibitor of Rho GTPases (Fig. 5C; supplementary Fig. S1A). Toxin A completely abolished the repulsive effect of clustered RGMa on PC12 growth cones. The neurites did not show retraction, leaving growth cones with long, hair-like protrusions. The collapse-inducing activity of clustered RGMa was also abolished after PC12 cells were incubated with C2–C3 (Fig. 5C; supplementary Fig. 1B), whereas individual components of the fusion toxin (C2II or C3) did not block the RGMa-induced collapse of PC12 cells (data not shown). The fraction of collapse-resistant PC12 cells increased from 5 to 10% in control cultures to 80% in C2–C3-treated cultures, and PC12 cells advanced despite the presence of RGMa. Similar results were obtained after inhibition of ROCK by the Rho inhibitor Y-27632. Two hours before the addition of RGMa, PC12 cells were treated with 10 mm Y-27632 (Fig. 5C; supplementary Fig. 1C). Inhibition of ROCK reduced the collapse-inducing activity of RGMa significantly, and the number of non-collapsed PC12 cells increased from 5–10 to 85–90%. To investigate the functional interaction between RGMa and neogenin, we further treated the PC12 culture with an antibody directed against the ectodomain of neogenin. This pre-treatment with the functional antibody blocked the collapse of growth cones by 75–80% (Fig. 5C; supplementary Fig. 1D). PKC Is Involved in Neogenin Signal Transduction−In a parallel approach, we also tested whether PKC is involved in the neogenin-mediated signal transduction pathway. PKC comprises a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are widely distributed in a variety of tissues with high concentrations in neuronal tissues. We tested Gö6976, a general PKC inhibitor that influences all isoforms in their ability to inhibit RGMa-induced growth cone collapse of PC12 cells. Dose-response studies (10 nm to 10 μm) were carried out with Gö6976 (data not shown), and the strongest effects were seen with 100 nm. Treatment with Gö6976 significantly reduced neurite growth cone collapse after the addition of clustered RGMa (Fig. 5C; supplementary Fig. 1E). Quantification of neurite retraction outgrowth suggested that the effect of this PKC inhibitor was comparable with that of Y27632, a ROCK inhibitor that also blocks RGMa-induced neurite retraction. Expression of Dominant Negative RhoA, but Not Rac1 Inhibits RGMa-induced Growth Cone Collapse−To further examine the role of Rho family GTPases in mediating the growth cone collapse induced by RGMa, we expressed fusion proteins of normal"

Active translocation of Listeria monocytogenes across the gut epithelial barrier is mediated by interaction of bacterial internalin (InlA) and its species-specific host receptor, E-cadherin, whereas translocation across Peyer’s patches through M-cells is InlA-independent. To define microbial determinants and molecular correlates of the host response to translocation via these two routes, we colonized germ-free transgenic mice expressing the human enterocyte-associated E-cadherin receptor with wild-type (WT) or mutant L. monocytogenes strains, or its nonpathogenic noninvasive relative Listeria innocua, or with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent gut symbiont. Mouse Gene-Chips, combined with Ingenuity Pathway software, were used to identify canonical signaling pathways that comprise the response to WT L. monocytogenes versus the other species. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments with L. innocua and L. monocytogenes, respectively, demonstrated that the 773-member transcriptional signature of the response to WT L. monocytogenes is largely conserved in the ΔinlA mutant. Internalin-dependent responses include down-regulation of gene networks involved in various aspects of lipid, amino acid, and energy metabolism and up-regulation of immunoinflammatory responses. The host response is markedly attenuated in a listeriolysin-deficient (Δhly) mutant despite its ability to be translocated to the lamina propria. Together, these studies establish that hly, rather than bacterial invasion of the lamina propria mediated by InlA, is a dominant determinant of the intensity of the host response to L. monocytogenes infection via the oral route.

Although most of the estimated 500-1000 bacterial species in the gut microbiota appear to enjoy a mutually beneficial relationship with their host, potential pathogens are also present or may be introduced through the consumption of food or water.Members of the genus Listeria provide a model for comparing host responses to invasive versus noninvasive food-borne bacteria. Fully sequenced genomes are available from two species: Listeria monocytogenes, an enteroinvasive human pathogen that can cross the intestinal as well as blood-brain and placental barriers; and Listeria innocua, a nonpathogenic and noninvasive relative that shares 84% of its genes with L. monocytogenes (4Glaser P.

A single amino acid difference (Pro16 in human versus Glu16 in mouse) enables human but not mouse E-cadherin to function as a receptor for InlA (10Lecuit M. Dramsi S. Gottardi C. Fedor-Chaiken M.

In conventionally raised, adult transgenic mice expressing hEcad under the control of an enterocyte-specific promoter (Fabpi-hEcad), L. monocytogenes is able to invade enterocytes that cover small intestinal villi and enter the underlying lamina propria. This receptor-mediated invasion results in a rate of translocation across the intestinal barrier that far exceeds that of InlA-independent translocation across the FAE (6Pron B. Boumaila C. Jaubert F. Sarnacki S. Monnet J.P. Berche P. Gaillard J.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 747-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lecuit M. Vandormael-Pournin S. Lefort J. Huerre M. Gounon P. Dupuy C. Babinet C. Cossart P. Science. 2001; 292: 1722-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar).Once internalized, L. monocytogenes is able to infect macrophages and other cells that neighbor the epithelium, and ultimately, the bacteria disseminate to organs such as the spleen and liver. The ability of L. monocytogenes to survive and multiply in professional phagocytes situated in the lamina propria, or beneath the FAE, is dependent upon another virulence factor that is not present in the genome of L. innocua: listeriolysin (LLO). LLO, encoded by the hly gene, is a pore-forming, cholesterol-dependent cytolysin that mediates bacterial escape from phagosomes to the cytosol, where the bacterium is able to replicate and spread to neighboring cells (11Pizarro-Cerda J. Cossart P. J Pathol. 2006; 208: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).A confounding problem with studies of oral listeriosis in conventionally raised, humanized Fabpi-hEcad mice is the extent to which other members of the microbiota contribute to observed host responses. Therefore, in this report, we have generated germ-free (GF) Fabpi-hEcad mice to directly assess the host response (i) as a function of the route of translocation of L. monocytogenes across the epithelial barrier (enterocyte versus nonenterocyte) and (ii) as a function of residency in the underlying lamina propria in the presence or absence of listeriolysin. To do so, we colonized the animals with (i) WT L. monocytogenes and isogenic mutant strains with inlA, inlB, or hly deletions; (ii) WT L. innocua and isogenic strains engineered to express InlA or LLO; or (iii) Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a sequenced, well characterized, human gut symbiont that is an adept, adaptive forager of dietary polysaccharides (12Xu J.

Animals were sacrificed at 72 h after inoculation; the small intestine was removed and cut into 16 equal-sized segments (numbered 1-16; proximal-to-distal). Spleens were homogenized in PBS (2 ml/spleen), and CFU counts in this material and in luminal contents harvested from intestinal segment 15 were determined by streaking 10-fold serial dilutions onto brain-heart-infusion agar plates and incubating the plates for 2 days at 37 °C under aerobic or anaerobic conditions.Immunohistochemical Studies—Optimal Cutting Temperature TissueTek compound (VWR Scientific)-embedded blocks of small intestinal segment 14 (15Stappenbeck T.S.

Nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (40 ng/ml), and sections were visualized on an Axiovert 200M (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) fitted with an Axiocam MRm (Zeiss).Five-μm-thick sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks prepared from intestinal segment 13 of mono-associated mice were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Adjacent sections were stained with L. monocytogenes R11 or L. innocua R6 primary antibodies (16Dramsi S. Levi S. Triller A. Cossart P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) [final dilution was 1:500 in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS)] followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monkey anti-rabbit Ig (1:400). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Ileal sections were also stained with rat anti-mouse CD45 and CD3 and F4/80 rat monoclonal antibodies (all from Pharmingen) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat Ig (1:400; Invitrogen). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by using reagents supplied in the Envision kit (Dakocytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Samples were viewed with an Axioskop 2 (Zeiss) microscope and images captured with an Evolution PM color camera (Mediacybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).GeneChip Analysis—RNA was purified from small intestinal segment 12 of each mouse (Midi RNeasy kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase digestion). Equivalent amounts of RNA from mice in each treatment group (n = 4/experiment) were pooled, and two biotinylated cRNA targets (40 μg/replicate) were independently prepared from each sample (17Hooper L.V. Wong M.H. Thelin A. Hansson L. Falk P.G. Gordon J.I.

CEL files 6Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession number GSE7013. were read into dChip, and Present/Absent calls were read in from the accompanying GeneChip operating software (Affymetrix) TXT files. The GeneChip with the median overall intensity served as the base line to which all other GeneChips within that treatment group were normalized. Signals were assigned to each probe set by using model-based expression (perfect match-mismatch model). Unsupervised filtering was performed using the following criteria: (i) variation across samples (standard deviation/mean) >0.40 and <10.00; (ii) called Present in ≥20% of arrays; and (iii) variation between replicates <0.2, as assessed by median value of standard deviation/mean. For two-class SAM analysis, expression values were exported from dChip only for probe sets called Present in at least one GeneChip within the group being analyzed. Significance was defined by maintaining a false discovery rate (q-value) below 1%. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) focus genes were identified as having significantly increased expression in the specified group; 6,351 probe sets were called “Present” in at least one of the GeneChips by GeneChip operating software (Affymetrix).RESULTSGeneration of Germ-free Fabpi-hEcad Transgenic Mice—Fabpi-hEcad C57BL/6J × SJL/J transgenic mice that express hEcad in small intestinal enterocytes under the control of nucleotides -1178 to +28 of the rat Fabpi gene (9Lecuit M.

The growth rate, adult weight, and fertility of Fabpi-hEcad transgenic mice were indistinguishable from that of their GF nontransgenic littermates (n = 8 mice/group). Histologic assessment of serial sections, prepared along the cephalocaudal axis of their small intestines, revealed no discernible differences between transgenic and normal littermates. Immunohistochemical studies of 12-15-week-old animals confirmed that the GF transgenic mice expressed hEcad in villus enterocytes (Fig. 1A). The FAE in the distal small intestine, but not the colonic epithelium, contained detectable levels of immunoreactive protein (data not shown).L. monocytogenes but Not L. innocua Behaves as an Enteroinvasive Microbe in Gnotobiotic Fabpi-hEcad Mice—Twelve-to-fifteen-week-old GF C57BL/6J Fabpi-hEcad mice were inoculated with 109 CFU of WT L. monocytogenes, WT L. innocua, or B. thetaiotaomicron. Animals were sacrificed 72 h after inoculation, a time that corresponds to peak levels of L. monocytogenes in intestinal tissue and mesenteric lymph nodes of conventionally raised animals (9Lecuit M.

No mortality occurred after 3 days in any group (n = 8 animals/group), although L. monocytogenes-infected mice exhibited clinical signs of infection (diarrhea, roughcast fur, 5-15% weight loss, and tremor). After 72 h, levels of bacterial colonization in the jejunum (middle third of the small intestine) and ileum (distal third) were not significantly different among mice in each treatment groups (108-109 CFU/ml luminal contents; see supplemental Fig S1). Examination of ileal sections stained with anti-L. monocytogenes polyclonal antibodies (16Dramsi S. Levi S. Triller A. Cossart P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed bacteria invading the tips of intestinal villi and in the lamina propria (Fig. 1B), similar to our previously reported observations in infected conventionally raised C57BL/6J × SJL/J Fabpi-hEcad animals (9Lecuit M.

In contrast, invasion was not detected in the intestines of L. innocua-colonized transgenic mice (Fig. 1B). Consistent with systemic dissemination, quantitative CFU assays of splenic homogenates disclosed viable bacteria in L. monocytogenes-infected animals at levels equivalent to those observed in conventionally raised Fabpi-hEcad hosts. In contrast, spleens did not harbor appreciable numbers of viable organisms in L. innocua- or B. thetaiotaomicron-colonized controls (Fig. 1C).Intestinal Response to an Enteropathogenic Invasive Bacterial Species—Histologic studies revealed prominent mononuclear cell infiltrates in the lamina propria of the intestines of L. monocytogenes-infected mice (Fig. 2A). These mononuclear cells reacted with a pan-leukocyte antibody (anti-CD45) and were predominantly macrophages (F4/80 positive) and T-lymphocytes (CD3 positive) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, no lamina propria infiltrates were observed in any of our L. innocua-or B. thetaiotaomicron-colonized mice (Fig. 2, A and B, and data not shown).FIGURE 2Intestinal response to L. monocytogenes infection.

Intestinal sections were stained with monoclonal antibodies to markers for leukocytes (CD45), T-lymphocytes (CD3), or macrophages (F4/80). Red, positive staining; blue, cell nuclei.

GF controls are shown. Using the stringent selection criteria described under “Experimental Procedures,” 304 genes were identified as displaying significantly changed expression across the four sample groups. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering, based on this list of 304 genes, established that the host response to L. monocytogenes infection was highly distinct from the responses to noninvasive L. innocua, or B. thetaiotaomicron, both of which cluster with GF controls.

Using the stringent filtering criteria described under “Experimental Procedures,” we identified 304 genes with significantly different levels of expression between these four colonization states (Fig. 2C). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these 304 genes established that WT L. monocytogenes elicits a highly reproducible host response, as evidenced by the high degree of similarity in profiles from two independently colonized groups of infected animals (n = 4 mice/group) (Fig. 2C). The response to L. monocytogenes is strikingly different from that elicited by L. innocua, despite the high degree of relatedness between these two Listeria species (2523 of 2853 L. monocytogenes genes have orthologs in L. innocua; the 270 genes specific to L. monocytogenes include all of its known virulence factors, such as inlA, inlB, hly, and actA) (4Glaser P.

The clustering also disclosed that the ileal transcriptome of L. innocua-colonized animals was more similar to GF controls than the transcriptome expressed in B. thetaiotaomicron-colonized mice.Based on the results obtained with this unsupervised clustering, we used a two-class SAM analysis to compare GeneChip data sets from the ileums of WT L. monocytogenes-colonized mice with ileal GeneChip data sets generated from GF, L. innocua- and B. thetaiotaomicron-mono-associated animals; our goal was to define a set of genes that distinguishes the intestinal response to WT L. monocytogenes infection. The comparison yielded 614 genes that exhibited significantly higher expression in L. monocytogenes-infected mice and 159 genes with significantly lower expression (q-value <1%; total of 773 genes; Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Intestinal response of Fabpi-hEcad mice to L. monocytogenes depends upon listeriolysin-O. A, results obtained from two-class SAM that identified (q-value <1%) a response distinctive for L. monocytogenes (Lm) compared with that elicited by B. thetaiotaomicron (Bt)-colonized and L. innocua-colonized mice and GF controls. 614 genes show higher expression in the group infected with L. monocytogenes, whereas 159 genes exhibit lower expression. The expression pattern for these 773 genes is also shown in gnotobiotic mice colonized with isogenic Lm(Δhly) or Lm(ΔinlA) strains or with mice mono-associated with L. innocua expressing InlA (Li(inlA)) or LLO (Li(hly)).

This software utilizes a knowledge base of more than 1,000,000 functional and physical interactions for >23,900 mammalian genes (including 8,200 for the mouse). 255 of the 614 genes are functionally annotated in the IPA knowledge base; 83 of these lie within the IPA “immune response” category (p < 10-6 by Fisher’s exact test; see supplemental Fig S2). We then utilized 134 genes from immune response and nine other high level IPA functional categories that are over-represented (p < 10-4; supplemental Fig S2) to construct an unsupervised master gene interaction network. Elimination of 51 orphan genes, which lack established interactions with other induced genes, yielded an 83-member “master” network with 237 edges (Fig. 3D) that characterizes the response to enteroinvasive WT L. monocytogenes.This analysis shows that many effectors of both the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system are stimulated upon L. monocytogenes invasion, including Stat-1 (4-fold difference relative to L. innocua-associated, B. thetaiotaomicon-associated, and GF controls; q-value <1%), i-Nos (Nos2A, 4.8-fold; q-value <1%), and lipocalin-2 (Lcn2, 11.2-fold, q-value <1%; a component of the innate immune system induced upon Toll-like receptor activation, which limits bacterial growth by binding and sequestering bacterial iron-siderophore complexes) (19Flo T.H.

https://openalex.org/W2000037457,"Previously, we have shown that ASK1-interacting protein 1 (AIP1, also known as DAB2IP), a novel member of the Ras-GAP (Ras-GTPase-activating protein) protein family, opens its conformation in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF), allowing it to form a complex with TRAF2-ASK1 that leads to activation of ASK1-JNK/p38 signaling in endothelial cells (EC). In the present study, we show that a TNF-inducible 14-3-3-binding site on AIP1 is critical for the opening of its conformation and for the AIP1-mediated TNF signaling. Ser-604, located in the C-terminal domain of AIP1, was identified as a 14-3-3-binding site. TNF treatment of EC induces phosphorylation of AIP1 at Ser-604 as detected by a phospho-specific antibody, with a similar kinetics to ASK1-JNK/p38 activation. 14-3-3 associates with an open, active state of AIP1 assessed by an in vitro pulldown assay. Mutation of AIP1 at Ser-604 (AIP1-S604A) blocks TNF-induced complex formation of AIP1 with 14-3-3. TNF treatment normally induces association of AIP1 with TRAF2-ASK1. The interactions with TRAF2 and ASK1 do not occur with AIP1-S604A, suggesting that phosphorylation at this site not only creates a 14-3-3-binding site but also opens up AIP1, allowing binding to TRAF2 and ASK1. Overexpression of AIP1-S604A blocks TNF-induced ASK1-JNK activation. We further show that RIP1 (the Ser/Thr protein kinase receptor-interacting protein) associates with the GAP domain of AIP1 and mediates TNF-induced AIP1 phosphorylation at Ser-604 and JNK/p38 activation as demonstrated by both overexpression and small interfering RNA knockdown of RIP1 in EC. Furthermore, RIP1 synergizes with AIP1 (but not AIP1-S604A) in inducing both JNK/p38 activation and EC apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that RIP1-mediated AIP1 phosphorylation at the 14-3-3-binding site Ser-604 is essential for TNF-induced TRAF2-RIP1-AIP1-ASK1 complex formation and for the activation of ASK1-JNK/p38 apoptotic signaling.

Pober J.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 70: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In EC, as in other cell types, TNF elicits a broad spectrum of biological effects including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TNF signals are initiated by binding to either of two different cell surface receptors, known as TNFR1 (CD122a) and TNFR2 (CD122b), that are devoid of intrinsic catalytic activity (2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar). TNFR1-initiated signaling pathways have been extensively investigated. Upon TNF binding to the extracellular domain, TNFR1 recruits TNFR-associated death domain protein (TRADD) to its cytosolic death domain (3Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 4Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). TRADD in turn functions as a platform adaptor to recruit both receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1) and TNFR-associated factor-2 (TRAF2), assembling a multiprotein complex that activates downstream signaling pathways. Specifically, RIP1 and TRAF2 recruit MEKK3 and TAK-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAP3Ks), leading to activation of NF-κB (5Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P.

Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that important signaling components of the TNF pathway are found in different complexes that are sequentially formed after TNF stimulation. An initial membrane-bound complex (complex I) composed of TNFR1-TRADD-RIP1-TRAF2 specifically activates the NF-κB pathway. Activated NF-κB promotes the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes such as cFLIP (cellular Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein) (11Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). The role of complex I in the JNK/p38 MAPK cascade has not been defined (8Varfolomeev E.E. Ashkenazi A. Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The TNFR1-associated signaling complex is rapidly internalized and dissociated from complex I. After a lag of some several hours, internalized TRADD-RIP1-TRAF2 may recruit Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), procaspase-8, and procaspase-10 to form a cytoplasmic complex (complex II). Complex II promotes autocatalytic activation of pro-caspase-8 to initiate apoptosis unless the NF-κB-induced long isoform of cFLIP (FLIPL) is also present in the complex (11Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). However, the events between the disassembly of complex I and the formation of complex II are not well established. TRAF2 and RIP1 are present in both TNF signaling complex I and TNF signaling complex II. Indeed, overexpression of either TRAF2 or RIP1 results in JNK, p38, and NF-κB activation, suggesting that RIP1 and TRAF2 mediate these pathways. TRAF2 is a member of a family of signal-transducing proteins containing C-terminal TRAF domains and N-terminal RING and zinc fingers (12Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Studies in transfected cells have shown that the intact RING finger of TRAF2 is critical for TRAF2 function since a TRAF2 mutant with deletion of the N-terminal (87–501) behaves as a dominant negative mutant for both NF-κB and JNK activation (13Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). RIP1 contains a N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain, and a C-terminal death domain (DD). RIP1 via its DD binds to the DD of TRADD. RIP1 also interacts with TRAFs (TRAF1, -2, and -3) via its intermediate domain. The essential function of RIP1 in TNF-induced activation of NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways has been demonstrated in RIP1-deficient cells (9Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S. Shank J. Ventura J.J. Cusson N.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). RIP1 is also essential for Toll-like receptor-3-induced NF-κB activation (16Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The role of RIP1 in JNK activation remains controversial (9Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S.

Among MAP3Ks, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) is an enzyme that specifically activates a cascade ending with JNK/p38 MAPK (but not NF-κB) activation. However, the mechanism for ASK1 activation by TNF remains unclear. Structurally, ASK1 is a 170-kDa protein containing an inhibitory N-terminal domain, an internal kinase domain, and the C-terminal domain (19Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten D.P. Saitoh M.

ASK1 via its C-terminal domain binds to TRAFs, and this association is required for ASK1 activation (20Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The current model for ASK1 activation by TNF involves several critical steps including release of inhibitors (thioredoxin and 14-3-3) (21Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y.

Cell Physiol. 2002; 191: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We have recently identified ASK-interacting protein 1 (AIP1, a novel member of the Ras-GAP family; also called DAB2IP for DAB2-interacting protein) as a novel transducer of TRAF2 in TNF-induced ASK1-JNK signaling. AIP1 in a closed form is localized to the plasma membrane of EC, where it associates with TNFR1. In response to TNF, AIP1 dissociates from TNFR1 with concomitant cytoplasmic translocation and opens its closed conformation to allow formation of a complex composed of TRADD, TRAF2, RIP, and AIP1 (AIP1 complex). The AIP1 complex is distinct from the complex I and complex II and initiates specific activation of the ASK1-JNK/p38 MAPK pathway (25Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Guicciardi M.E. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1813-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Zhang H.

However, the mechanism by which TNF induces the opening of AIP1 conformation and formation of AIP1 complex (TRAF2-RIP1-AIP1-ASK1) has not been defined. In the present study, we show that a TNF-inducible 14-3-3-binding site (p-Ser-604) on AIP1 is critical for the opening of its closed conformation and for the AIP1-mediated TNF signaling. We also show that RIP1 in the AIP1 complex mediates TNF-induced AIP1 phosphorylation at Ser-604. Furthermore, mutation of AIP1 at Ser-604 (AIP1-S604A) blocks TNF-induced complex formation of AIP1 with TRAF2, RIP1, and ASK1, as well as TNF-induced ASK1-JNK/p38 MAPK activation. Our results demonstrate that RIP1-mediated AIP1 phosphorylation at the 14-3-3-binding site Ser-604 plays a critical role in TNF-induced ASK1-JNK/p38 signaling. Plasmid Construction—Expression plasmids for TRAF2, ASK1, and AIP1 have been described previously (25Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin.

Transfection and Reporter Assay—BAEC were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).

Generation of Antibodies against Phospho-AIP1-specific Antibody—Polyclonal antibodies directed against specific phospho-AIP1 (p-Ser-604) were produced from BIOSOURCE by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic phospho-peptide corresponding to residues surrounding AIP1 Ser-604. The peptide sequence is AC-CPARSSpSYSEAN-amide, where pS indicates phospho-Ser-604 and AC indicates acetylated. The peptide was synthesized with N-terminal cysteine residues and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin for immunization. The antibodies were affinity-purified from rabbit antisera by affinity chromatography steps using protein A columns to purify immunoglobulins followed by specific phospho-peptide (immunogen) columns. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—BAEC after various treatments were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1.5 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.75% Brij 96, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min on ice. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (25Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Zhang H. Zhang R. Luo Y. D'Alessio A. Pober J.S. Min W. J. Biol.

Anti-TRAF2, anti-RIP1, anti-ASK1, anti-14-3-3 (mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal), anti-PARP, and anti-GST antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science, and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) antibody was from Sigma. Anti-phospho- and total JNK were from BIOSOURCE. RNA Interference for RIP1—Two pairs of siRNA oligonucleotides for human RIP1 (sense strand, 5′-GGA GCA AAC UGA AUA AUG AAG AGC A-3′ (siRIP1-A); 5′-GGG UGA UGA GGG AAG GCA UAA AGG G-3′ (siRIP1-B); and a pair of control siRNA oligonucleotide: 5′-CAG AGA GGA GGA AAG GAG ACG CAG G-3′) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). 20 nm siRNA was transfected into cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following protocols provided by the manufacturer. 72 h after transfection, cells were harvested for protein analyses as described. AIP1 Contains a 14-3-3-binding Site at Ser-604 of the C-terminal Domain—We have previously shown that the C-terminal half of AIP1 maintains AIP1 in a closed inactive state in resting EC by binding to its N-terminal half and that TNF treatment opens this closed conformation, leading to an association of AIP1 with TRAF2 and ASK1 (25Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism by which TNF induces a dissociation of the C-terminal domain from the N-terminal domain, we searched for potential functional motifs located in the C-terminal domain by the Scansite program. The C-terminal domain of AIP1 (AIP1-C) contains two potential non-classic 14-3-3-binding sites (29Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar) surrounding Thr-811 (RGRTPPRXXp(S/T)XP) and Ser-604 (RSSSYSRX1–2pSX2–3S) (bold letters indicate phosphorylation sites) (Fig. 1a). We first determined whether AIP1-C binds to 14-3-3. AIP1-F (the full-length), AIP1-N (amino acid 1–522), and AIP1-C (amino acids 523–1065) were transfected into BAEC (which are easily transfectable), and the 14-3-3 binding of AIP1 was determined by an in vitro GST-14-3-3 pulldown assay. As a control, the C-terminal domain of ASK1 (ASK1-C) containing a 14-3-3-binding site was pulled down by GST-14-3-3. AIP1-C, but not AIP1-N, bound to GST-14-3-3 (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, AIP1-F was not pulled down by GST-14-3-3. The likely explanation is that AIP1-F protein exists in a closed conformation in resting cells through an intramolecular interaction between its N-terminal and C-terminal domains as we had demonstrated previously (25Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To further define the 14-3-3-binding site, we generated a mutation at Ser-604 (AIP1-C-S604A) or Thr-811 (AIP1-C-T811A) on AIP1-C by site-specific mutagenesis. AIP1-C (WT), AIP1-C-T811A, or AIP1-C-S604A was each transfected into BAEC, and 14-3-3 binding was determined. Mutations at Ser-604, but not at Thr-811, abolished the 14-3-3 binding (Fig. 1c), suggesting that the Ser-604 of AIP1 is critical for 14-3-3 binding. TNF Treatment Induces Phosphorylation of AIP1 at Ser-604 Concomitant with an Association with 14-3-3—Since TNF induces a disruption of the closed conformation of AIP1 (25Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we determined whether phosphorylation of AIP1 (p-Ser-604) as well as its 14-3-3 binding to AIP1-F is induced by TNF treatment. To this end, we first developed a rabbit polyclonal antibody against p-Ser-604 of AIP1 (anti-p-Ser-604) using a phospho-peptide compassing the p-Ser-604 of AIP1 as an antigen (see “Experimental Procedures”). To determine the specificity of anti-p-Ser-604, cell lysates containing AIP1-C and AIP1-C-S604A expressed from 293T transfectants were used for Western blot. Consistent with its binding to 14-3-3 (Fig. 1), AIP1-C was basally phosphorylated at Ser-604 as detected by anti-p-Ser-604 (Fig. 2a). In contrast, AIP1-C-S604A was not recognized by anti-p-Ser-604, confirming the specificity of the antibody. To determine whether p-Ser-604 and the 14-3-3 binding of AIP1 are induced by TNF, BAEC were transfected with AIP1-F or AIP1-F-S604A followed by treatment with TNF (10 ng/ml for 15 min). Phosphorylation of AIP1 was first detected by Western blot with anti-p-Ser-604. Phosphorylation of Ser-604 in AIP1-F was not detected in resting EC and was highly induced in response to TNF (Fig. 2b). In contrast, AIP1-F-S604A did not show detectable phosphorylation under either resting or TNF-treated state (Fig. 2b). The 14-3-3 binding of AIP1 was then determined by an in vitro GST-14-3-3 pulldown assay. Results showed that AIP1-F from TNF-treated EC but not from resting EC bound to GST-14-3-3 (Fig. 2c). Similarly, AIP1-F-S604 failed to bind to GST-14-3-3 (Fig. 2c). These results support the conclusion that TNF induces phosphorylation of AIP1 at Ser-604 and a subsequent 14-3-3 binding. To determine whether endogenous AIP1 in EC shows a similar pattern of phosphorylation at the 14-3-3-binding site (p-Ser-604), BAEC were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) for various times (0–60 min), and endogenous AIP p-Ser-604 was determined by Western blot with a phospho-specific antibody. Association of AIP1 with 14-3-3 was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-14-3-3 antibody followed by Western blot with anti-AIP1. Phosphorylation of AIP1 (p-Ser-604) was undetectable in resting EC but strongly induced in response to TNF. TNF-induced p-Ser-604 peaked at 15 min and declined by 60 min (Fig. 2d). Similarly, association of AIP1 with 14-3-3 was not observed in resting EC but dramatically induced in response to TNF at 15 min followed by a decline at 60 min (Fig. 2e). As a control, activation of ASK1-JNK signaling was determined by Western blot with phospho-specific antibodies against active ASK1 and JNK (Fig. 2f). AIP1 phosphorylation/14-3-3 binding and ASK1-JNK activation showed a similar kinetics in response to TNF (Fig. 2f). Similar results were obtained for endogenous AIP1 in HAEC (not shown). Critical Roles of AIP1 p-Ser-604 in TNF-induced Formation of AIP1 Signaling Complex—To define the role of AIP1 phosphorylation in TNF signaling, we determined the effects of the non-phosphorylatable form of AIP1 on TNF-induced associations of AIP1 with TRAF2, RIP1, and ASK1. BAEC were transfected with AIP1-F or AIP1-F-S604A followed by TNF treatment (10 ng/ml for 15 min). Association of AIP1 with endogenous TRAF2, RIP1, and ASK1 was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-TRAF2, anti-RIP1, or anti-ASK1 antibody followed by Western blot with anti-FLAG. Similar to our previous findings on endogenous AIP1 in EC (27Zhang H. Zhang R. Luo Y. D'Alessio A. Pober J.S. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44955-44965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), AIP1-F associated with TRAF2 (Fig. 3a), RIP1 (Fig. 3b), and ASK1 (Fig. 3c) in response to TNF. However, AIP1-F-S604A failed to bind to TRAF2, RIP1, or ASK1 (Fig. 3, a–c). These data suggest that phosphorylation of AIP1 at the 14-3-3-binding site (p-Ser-604) plays a critical role in TNF-induced association of AIP1 with TRAF2, RIP1, and ASK1. The role of AIP1 p-Ser-604 in TNF signaling was further analyzed for its effects on TNF-induced activation of ASK1-JNK by a reporter gene assay. BAEC were transfected with a JNK/p38-dependent reporter gene in the presence of a vector control, AIP1-F, or AIP1-F-S604A. BAEC were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml for 6 h), and TNF-induced luciferase activity was determined as described previously (25Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3d, AIP1-F augmented, whereas AIP1-F-S604 blunted, TNF-induced JNK reporter gene activity. Previously, we had shown that AIP1 specifically induces ASK1-JNK activation while inhibiting TNF-induced NF-κB signaling (27Zhang H. Zhang R. Luo Y. D'Alessio A. Pober J.S. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44955-44965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The effect of AIP1 phosphorylation on a κB-dependent reporter gene was determined. As expected, AIP1-F expression inhibited TNF-induced κB reporter gene activity. However, AIP1-F-S604A augmented TNF-induced activation of κB reporter gene (Fig. 3e). Taken together, these data suggest that AIP1 phosphorylation at the 14-3-3-binding site (p-Ser-604) is critical not only for TNF-induced formation of AIP1-containing signaling complex (TRAF2-RIP1-AIP1-ASK1) but also for the ability of AIP1 to switch from NF-κB to JNK/p38 MAPK activation. A Critical Role of RIP1 in TNF-induced AIP1 Phosphorylation and JNK/p38 Activation—Given that TNF induces an association of AIP1 with TRAF2-RIP1 signaling complex (27Zhang H. Zhang R. Luo Y. D'Alessio A. Pober J.S. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44955-44965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and that RIP1 is a Ser/Thr kinase implicated in TNF-induced JNK activation (17Devin A. Lin Y. Liu Z.G. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we reasoned that RIP1 might be the kinase responsible for AIP1 phosphorylation at Ser-604. To test this hypothesis, we used both overexpression and siRNA knockdown approaches to determine the role of RIP1 in AIP1 phosphorylation. BAEC were transfected with AIP1-F or AIP1-F-S604A in the presence or absence of RIP1, and AIP1 p-Ser-604 was determined by p-Ser-604-specific antibody and by a GST-14-3-3 pulldown assay. Co-expression of RIP1 increased both the phosphorylation of and the 14-3-3 binding to AIP1-F but not to AIP1-F-S604A (Fig. 4, a and b). To determine the role of endogenous RIP1 in AIP1 phosphorylation, a siRNA against human RIP1 (siRIP1-A) was transfected to HAEC. AIP1 phosphorylation was determined by a GST-14-3-3 pulldown assay. RIP1 siRNA, but not a control siRNA, significantly knocked down endogenous RIP1 in EC. TNF failed to induce AIP1 phosphorylation (measured by the 14-3-3 binding) in RIP1-knockdown EC (Fig. 4c). TNF-induced JNK/p38 MAPK activation was also determined by Western blot with phospho-specific antibodies. Knockdown of RIP1 resulted in significant inhibition of TNF-induced activation of JNK/p38 MPAK (Fig. 4d). Similar results were obtained from another pair of siRNA against RIP1 (siRIP1-B). These data suggest a critical role of RIP1 in TNF-induced AIP1 phosphorylation at Ser-604 and activation of downstream JNK/p38 MAPK. RIP Associates with the GAP Domain of AIP1—To define the molecular interaction between RIP1 and AIP1, we mapped the critical domains of RIP1 and AIP1 for their interactions. RIP1 contains a N-terminal kinase domain (KD, amino acids 1–300), an intermediate domain (ID, amino acids 301–558), and a C-terminal DD (amino acids 559–671) (Fig. 5a). To map the critical domain in RIP1 for AIP1 binding, Myc-tagged RIP1-WT (amino acids 1–671), RIP1-ΔKI (deletion of amino acids 132–322 containing part of the KD and ID), or RIP1-KD (9Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S. Shank J. Ventura J.J. Cusson N. Vaillancourt R.R. Su B. Davis R.J. Kelliher M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was co-transfected with FLAG-tagged AIP1 in BAEC. As overexpression of RIP1, particularly mutant with RIP1-ΔKI containing the DD with a deletion of KD, causes cell death (data not shown, also see Fig. 6), a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD was added to cell culture to detect expression of RIP1 proteins. AIP1-RIP1 interaction was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc followed by Western blot with anti-FLAG. Results showed that RIP1-WT, but not RIP1-ΔKI or RIP1-KD, associated with AIP1 (Fig. 5b), suggesting that both the kinase domain and the intermediate domain are critical for AIP1 binding. AIP1-N contains a pleckstrin homology (PH), a protein kinase C-conserved domain 2 (C2), and a GAP domain, whereas AIP1-C contains a leucine-zipper, a proline-rich region (PR), and a period-like domain (PER). We have generated various AIP1 truncation mutants involving both N-terminal (N, PHC2, PH, and ΔPH) and C-terminal domains (C, C-PR, and C-ΔPR) (Fig. 5a). To determine whether RIP1 binds to the N-terminal half on AIP1, BAEC were transfected with FLAG-tagged AIP1-N truncation mutants in the presence of RIP1 (FLAG-tagged). Association between RIP1 and AIP1-N was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-RIP1 followed by Western blot with anti-FLAG. RIP1 associated with AIP1-N and ΔPH, but not PHC2 or PH, suggesting that the GAP domain of AIP1 is critical for RIP1 binding (Fig. 5c). Using the same approach, we found that RIP1 bound to AIP1-C, PR, and ΔPR, suggesting that the PER domain is critical for RIP1 interaction (Fig. 5c). Previously, we have shown that the N-terminal C2 domain and the C-terminal PER domain of AIP1 are critical for the binding of ASK1 and TRAF2, respectively (27Zhang H. Zhang R. Luo Y. D'Alessio A. Pober J.S. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44955-44965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5d). Taken together, these data suggest that AIP1 uses different domains to interact with TRAF2, RIP1, and ASK1 and may function as a scaffolding protein to facilitate a formation of TNF-induced TRAF2-RIP1-ASK1 signaling complex.FIGURE 6Critical roles of RIP1-mediated AIP1 p-Ser-604 in TNF signaling and EC apoptosis. a and b, the effects of RIP1-mediated p-Ser-604 on TNF-induced activation of JNK/p38 and NF-κB reporter gene. BAEC were transfected with a JNK- or NF-κB-dependent reporter gene with AIP1 (F (the full-length) or S604A) in the presence or absence of RIP1.

VC, vector control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Critical Roles of RIP1-mediated AIP1 p-Ser-604 in TNF Signaling—To determine the functional significance of RIP1-mediated AIP1 phosphorylation, we examined whether RIP1 augments AIP1-mediated JNK/p38 activation and EC apoptosis. To this end, we first examined the effects of RIP1- and AIP1-mediated JNK/p38 activation in a JNK/p38 MAPK reporter gene assay. BAEC were transfected with the reporter gene in the presence of RIP1, AIP1-F, or AIP1-F-S604 alone or combinations. Cells were then treated with TNF for 12 h, and the JNK/p38 reporter gene activity was determined. Consistent with previous findings (25Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), expression of RIP1 or AIP1 induced JNK/p38 reporter gene activity. Co-expression of RIP1 with AIP1, but not with AIP1-F-S604, synergistically induced the JNK/p38 reporter gene activation (Fig. 6a). Moreover, AIP1-F-S604A blunted RIP1-induced JNK/p38 activity. As a control, RIP1 strongly activated a κB reporter gene. Consistent with the effect of AIP1 on TNF-induced κB reporter gene activity (Fig. 3e), AIP1-F inhibited, but AIP1-F-S604A augmented, RIP1-induced κB reporter gene activity (Fig. 6b). These data suggest that RIP1-mediated phosphorylation of AIP1 at Ser-604 is critical for RIP1/AIP1-mediated JNK/p38 activation. We then determined the cooperative function of RIP1 and AIP1 in TNF-induced EC apoptosis. BAEC were transfected with vector control, RIP1, AIP1-F, or AIP1-F-S604 alone or combinations. The cells were untreated or treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) plus cycloheximide (CHX, 10 mg/ml) for 6 h, and EC apoptosis was determined by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining for nuclei fragmentation. In the absence of TNF + CHX, overexpression of AIP1 or RIP1, but not AIP1-F-S604A, induced EC apoptosis. RIP1 enhanced the effect of AIP1-F but not of AIP1-F-S604A. TNF + CHX alone caused EC apoptosis, which was increased by RIP1 or by AIP1 or, to the greater extent, by a combination of RIP1 and AIP1. More importantly, AIP1-F-S604A blocked TNF + CHX-induced EC apoptosis (Fig. 6c). The RIP1/AIP1-induced EC death could be blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD, suggesting that RIP1-AIP1 induce a caspase-dependent apoptotic death pathway (Fig. 6c, +zVAD). Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) is a 113-kDa protein that binds specifically at DNA strand breaks, and cleavage of PARP (to 89 kDa) by caspases has been used to serve as an early marker of apoptosis. We determined the effects of AIP1-S604A on TNF(+CHX)-induced PARP cleavage. Consistent with the DNA fragmentation assay, overexpression of AIP1-F-S604A strongly blocked TNF(+CHX)-induced PARP cleavage in BAEC (Fig. 6d). The addition of Z-VAD completely blocked TNF(+CHX)-induced PARP cleavage (not shown). Taken together, these data strongly support the critical roles of AIP1 phosphorylation in TNF-induced JNK activation and in EC apoptosis. In this report, we present evidence for a critical role of AIP1 phosphorylation (p-Ser-604) in TNF signaling. TNF treatment induces phosphorylation of AIP1 at Ser-604 with a similar kinetics as ASK1-JNK/p38 activation. More importantly, mutation of AIP1 at Ser-604 (AIP1-S604A) blocks TNF-induced complex formation of AIP1 with TRAF2, RIP1, and ASK1, suggesting that AIP1-S604A remains in a closed, inactive state. These data demonstrate that AIP1 phosphorylation is essential for opening of its closed conformation, a crucial step for AIP1 function in TNF signaling. Supporting this conclusion, AIP1-S604A blocks TNF-induced ASK1-JNK/p38 activation. As p-Ser-604 is tightly associated with 14-3-3 binding to AIP1, we speculate that p-Ser-604-mediated 14-3-3 binding may facilitate AIP1 conformation change. Whether or not 14-3-3 binding is required for AIP1 opening will require further investigation. Tschopp’s group (11Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the initial plasma membrane-bound complex I (TNFR1-TRADD-RIP1-TRAF2) is responsible for NF-κB activation and a cytoplasmic complex (complex II) in which the internalized TRADD, RIP, or TRAF2 recruits FADD and pro-caspase-8 for apoptotic signaling. However, it has not been determined whether either complex I or complex II is active in the initiation of JNK/p38 MAPK signaling. It has been proposed that that complex I recruits one or more MAP3Ks to induce JNK/p38 MAPK activation (8Varfolomeev E.E. Ashkenazi A. Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 11Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). Our previous report (27Zhang H. Zhang R. Luo Y. D'Alessio A. Pober J.S. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44955-44965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the present data demonstrate that AIP1 signaling complex might represent such an intermediate complex, which is structurally and functionally distinct both from complex I and from complex II in TNF signaling. Specifically, an AIP1 signaling complex (TRADD-RIP1-TRAF2-ASK1) lacks TNFR1 (a complex I component) and FADD (a component of complex II). AIP1 specifically recruits MAP3K ASK1 to initiate ASK1-JNK/p38 cascade; furthermore, AIP1 inhibits TNF-induced NF-κB pathway. In the present study, we provide further characterization and regulation of AIP1 signaling complex. We show that the Ser/Thr protein kinase RIP1 associates with the GAP domain of AIP1. Furthermore, RIP1 mediates TNF-induced AIP1 phosphorylation at Ser-604, resulting in activation of the downstream JNK/p38 MAPK cascade. This was demonstrated by both overexpression and siRNA knockdown of RIP1 in EC. Thus, AIP1 utilizes a C-terminal PER domain, an N-terminal GAP domain, and an N-terminal C2 domain to bind to TRAF2, RIP1, and ASK1, respectively. Similarly, TRAF2 binds to AIP1 via its N-terminal RING finger (27Zhang H. Zhang R. Luo Y. D'Alessio A. Pober J.S. Min W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44955-44965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whereas RIP1 binds to AIP1 via its kinase/intermediate domains (this study). Moreover, these interactions induce an opening of AIP1 closed conformation, resulting in formation of AIP1 signaling complex. Previous studies indicate that TRAF2 binds to TRADD via a C-terminal TRAF domain, whereas RIP1 binds to TRADD via its C-terminal DD (5Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 6Baud V. Karin M.

Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is conceivable that TRADD functions as a platform adaptor to initiate assembly of TRADD-RIP1-TRAF2 complex, whereas AIP1 functions as a scaffold protein to facilitate the formation of the AIP1 signaling complex (TARDD-RIP1-TRAF2-AIP1-ASK1). The role of RIP1 in NF-κB activation has been extensively investigated. RIP1, either via MEKK3 and/or via TAK1 or directly, recruits IκB kinases complex to complex I, resulting in activation of NF-κB pathway (9Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S. Shank J. Ventura J.J. Cusson N. Vaillancourt R.R. Su B. Davis R.J. Kelliher M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RIP1 does not require its kinase activity for the activation of NF-κB because reintroduction of a kinase-dead form of RIP1 into RIP1-deficient cells completely restores NF-κB activation. In contrast, the kinase activity of RIP1 seems to be critical for TNF-induced MAPK cascades (9Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S. Shank J. Ventura J.J. Cusson N. Vaillancourt R.R. Su B. Davis R.J. Kelliher M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 10Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which RIP1 mediates JNK/p38 MAPK is unclear. Previous data suggest that RIP1 directly associates with MEKK3, but not ASK1. Here, our results suggest that RIP1 may act through AIP1 to form a complex with ASK1. Furthermore, RIP1 enhances ASK1-JNK/p38 MAPK signaling by mediating AIP1 phosphorylation. Thus, RIP1 synergizes AIP1 (but not AIP1-S604A)-mediated JNK/38 MAPK activation and EC apoptosis. Our study provides a link between RIP1 to the downstream JNK/p38 MAPK pathway. It needs to be determined whether RIP1 directly or through other kinases phosphorylates AIP1. Based on these results, we propose the following model for the function of AIP1 phosphorylation in TNF signaling. AIP1 exists in an inactive form complexed with TNFR1 in resting EC. In response to TNF, AIP is unfolded, dissociates from TNFR1, and binds to RIP1. In TNF-treated EC, RIP1 mediates AIP1 phosphorylation at a 14-3-3-binding site (Ser-604), and this phosphorylation (and thus the 14-3-3 binding) on AIP1 appears to be critical for an opening of its closed conformation. Once in the open conformation, AIP1 associates with TRAF2, RIP1, and ASK1, stabilizing the ASK1 signaling complex. This complex activates the ASK1-JNK/p38 MAPK cascade. Our study uncovers a novel mechanism by which AIP1 mediates TNF signaling."

It comprises the α-helical, cationic core region of porcine NK-lysin a homolog of human granulysin and of amoebapores of pathogenic amoeba. Here we visualized the impact of NK-2 on Escherichia coli by electron microscopy and used NK-2 as a template for sequence variations to improve the peptide stability and activity and to gain insight into the structure/function relationships. We synthesized 18 new peptides and tested their activities on seven Gram-negative and one Gram-positive bacterial strains, human erythrocytes, and HeLa cells. Although all peptides appeared unordered in buffer, those active against bacteria adopted an α-helical conformation in membrane-mimetic environments like trifluoroethanol and negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol (PG) liposomes that mimick the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. This conformation was not observed in the presence of liposomes consisting of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) typical for the human cell plasma membrane. The interaction was paralleled by intercalation of these peptides into PG liposomes as determined by FRET spectroscopy. A comparative analysis between biological activity and the calculated peptide parameters revealed that the decisive factor for a broad spectrum activity is not the peptide overall hydrophobicity or amphipathicity, but the possession of a minimal positive net charge plus a highly amphipathic anchor point of only seven amino acid residues (two helical turns).

Acquired resistance of pathogenic bacteria to classical antibiotics is an increasing and still unsolved problem in health care (1Norrby S.R. Nord C.E. Finch R. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2005; 5: 115-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Of particular concern are nosocomial infections caused more and more frequently by bacterial strains multiresistant to a wide variety of antibiotics including sometimes last resort drugs like vancomycin.

Biopolymers. 2005; 80: 717-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Prominent representatives of AMP are linear α-helical peptides like magainins from frog skin, insect cecropins, or disulfide-bridged peptides like the β-sheet defensins or the α-helical granulysin and NK-lysin (6Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5449-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar, 7Steiner H. Hultmark D. Engstroöm A. Bennich H. Boman H.G.

Whereas defensins are found in the granules of neutrophils (α-defensins) or on epithelia (β-defensins), granulysin, and NK-lysin, saposin-like proteins like the pulmonary surfactant protein B (SP-B) (10Munford R.S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1653-1663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are present in granules of NK- and T-cells. Common features of AMP include their cationic nature, amphipathic secondary structure, small size, and ability to rapidly bind to and permeabilize the membrane of their target cell and cause its death usually within minutes. It is well established that the bacterial membrane is the primary target of AMP in vivo and that peptide specificity depends on the presence of characteristic lipid molecules in the cell envelope of bacteria like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), exclusively found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and certain phospholipids like phosphatidylglycerol and other lipids (11Matsuzaki K. Sugishita K. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3423-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 12Breukink E. Wiedemann I. van Kraaij C. Kuipers O.P. Sahl H. de Kruijff B.

Even in the case that the interaction of AMP with the cell envelope does not lead to a lethal hit, the peptides have to pass this barrier to reach their putative intracellular targets. This particular mechanism of action is thought to greatly hamper the emergence of mutants resistant to these compounds (16Peschel A. Sahl H.G. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). We aim at using natural AMP as templates for the development of new antibacterial drugs. For this purpose, it is of utmost importance to understand their mode of action at the molecular level and to unravel the structural features which determine a peptide to be a potent and selective antibiotic. Though many studies have dealt with this topic, the issue is far from being set. Previously, we have described a broad spectrum antibacterial peptide, termed NK-2, derived from the cationic core region of NK-lysin, namely helix 3 and 4 (14Andraö J. Koch M.H.J. Bartels R. Brandenburg K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Andraö J. Leippe M. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 188: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The peptide adopts an amphipathic α-helical secondary structure in hydrophobic environment (17Andraö J. Leippe M. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 188: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It binds to, intercalates into and permeabilizes model membranes mimicking the lipid matrix of the bacterial cell envelope (13Schroöder-Borm H. Willumeit R. Brandenburg K. Andraö J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1612: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Andraö J. Koch M.H.J. Bartels R. Brandenburg K. Antimicrob.

Acta. 2005; 1669: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, we constructed a number of peptide variants based on the NK-2 sequence and performed a comprehensive functional and structural investigation. The goal of this study was to improve the therapeutic efficacy of the membranolytic peptide NK-2 in terms of stability and antibacterial activity, in particular against some important Gram-negative pathogens. In addition, the collection of data for such a group of related peptides enabled us to carry out the analysis of their structure/function relationships. This may contribute to the understanding of the molecular principles of recognition and killing of bacteria by antimicrobial peptides thereby providing necessary information for the design of urgently needed new antimicrobial drugs. Polymyxin B was purchased in its sulfate salt form from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Phospholipids (l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC, chicken egg), l-α-phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol (PG, chicken egg), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorac-(1-glycerol) (POPG)) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Lipids (purity >99%) were used without further purification. Fluorescently labeled phospholipids N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4yl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) and N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-phosphatidylethanolamine (Rh-PE) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). SDS and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol were obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). All other chemicals were analytical grade and acquired from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Peptides (including melittin) were synthesized by the solid-phase peptide synthesis technique in an automatic peptide synthesizer (model 433 A; Applied Biosystems) according to the fastmoc synthesis protocol of the manufacturer, including the removal of the N-terminal Fmoc group. The peptides with an amidated C terminus were synthesized on an Fmoc-amide resin, whereas the acidic C terminus was obtained by synthesis on a preloaded Wang resin. The peptides were deprotected and cleaved from the resin with 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% anisole, 2% thioanisole, 3% dithiothreitol, for 3 h at room temperature. After cleavage, the suspension was filtered and the soluble peptides were precipitated with ice-cold diethylether followed by centrifugation and extensive washing with ether. Peptides were purified by RP-HPLC using an Aqua-C18 column (Phenomenex; Aschaffenburg, Germany). Elution was done with a gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Cytotoxicity of the peptides was determined against HeLa cells in medium by a MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay as described previously (19Andraö J. Lohner K. Blondelle S.E. Jerala R. Moriyón I. Koch M.H.J. Garidel P. Brandenburg K. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and by a neutral red uptake assay directly accessing the membrane permeabilization by the peptides. For both assays, peptide stocks were solubilized in 4 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0. Peptides were incubated with initially seeded 104 cells/well (MTT) or 5 × 104 cells/well (neutral red) in a microtiter plate for 24 h at 37 °C. As a measure of cell viability, the conversion of MTT into a tetrazolium salt was determined by absorbance at 540 nm. Neutral red dye (Sigma) was added to every well at a final concentration of 0.33 mg/ml. The dye was allowed to react with cells for 3 h at 37 °C, and then cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline buffer to eliminate extracellular dye. The internalized dye was extracted from the cells by adding a solution of 50% ethanol and 1% acetic acid (v/v) and concentration of neutral red was determined by absorbance at 540 nm. Assay for Hemolytic Activity—Hemolytic activity of the peptides against human erythrocytes was determined as described previously (19Andraö J. Lohner K. Blondelle S.E. Jerala R. Moriyón I. Koch M.H.J. Garidel P. Brandenburg K. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were incubated with a freshly prepared erythrocyte suspension from human blood (5% of normal hematocrit) in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, for 30 min at 37 °C. Released hemoglobin was determined photometrically at 412 nm. The antibacterial activity of the peptides was determined by microdilution susceptibility assays performed (i) in Mueller-Hinton broth and (ii) in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0 supplemented with 10% LB broth against a panel of Gram-negative and a representative Gram-positive bacterial strain (Table 1).TABLE 1Bacterial strains used in this studyStrainCharacteristicsEscherichia coli K12 ATCCaATCC, American type culture collection. 23716Gram-negative, LPS rough mutantEscherichia coli ATCC 25922Gram-negative, clinical isolate, S-form LPSAcinetobacter baumanii ATCC 19606Gram-negative, clinical isolateBordetella bronchiseptica CUNbCUN, Clínica Universitaria de Navarra, Spain. 11844-99Gram-negative, clinical isolateBrucella abortus 9.49 (per-)Gram-negative, attenuated per mutant from B. abortus 2308 (30Monreal D.

Open table in a new tab Susceptibility testing was performed following the recommendations of the Clinical Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS) (20Wayne P.A. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically Approved Standard: M7-A5. 2000; (5th Ed.)Google Scholar). Peptides (2 mg/ml in 4 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) were 2-fold diluted in Mueller-Hinton Broth (ref. 275730, pH 7.3, Difco Laboratories, Le Pont de Claix, France) in 96-well microtiter plates (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) to obtain concentrations from 512 to 0.25 μg/ml in a volume of 100 μl. Bacteria were grown on Mueller-Hinton agar plates (BioMé;rieux, Marcy l′Etiole, France) for 1–3 days depending on the growth rate of the bacteria, suspended in 2 ml of 0.9% saline and adjusted to 108 CFU/ml. The bacterial suspension was diluted 100-fold in Mueller-Hinton broth, and 0.1 ml of this new dilution (105 CFU) was added to the peptide dilutions. The microtiter plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each peptide against a given bacterial strain was regarded as the minimal concentration of the peptide, which prevents the growth of that organism (as judged by lack of cloudiness in the well) 24 h (48 h for Brucella) after inoculation. The bactericidal effect of the peptides was determined, after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, by plating 10 μl of the content of non-cloudy wells onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1–5 days, and a viable count was performed. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of each peptide for a given bacterial strain was regarded as the minimal concentration of the peptide which kills 99.9% of the CFU present in the final inoculum. Assays in Luria-Bertani (LB) Medium/Buffer—Peptides (dissolved in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0) were 2-fold diluted in the same buffer in 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner). Subsequently, a suspension of log-phase bacteria in LB was added (10 μl, containing 104 CFU) to the peptide solution (90 μl). The plates were incubated overnight in a wet chamber at 37 °C under constant shaking, and bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 620 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Rainbow, Tecan, Crailsham, Germany). The MIC was defined as the lowest peptide concentration, at which no bacterial growth was measurable. Portions of each well (10 μl) were diluted with 90 μl of Hepes buffer, plated out in duplicate on LB agar plates, incubated overnight at 37 °C, and bacterial colonies were counted. The MBC was defined as the peptide concentration at which no colony growth was observed. Experiments were performed at least twice in duplicates. CD data were acquired with a Jasco J-715 CD spectrophotometer using quartz cuvettes with an optical path length of 0.1 cm. The response was measured from 190 to 300 nm with 0.2-nm step resolution and 1-nm bandwidth. The rate was 50 nm/min using a 2-s response time. Each spectrum is a sum of at least four scans to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. All spectra are reported in terms of mean residue molar ellipticity [θ]R deg cm2 dmol–1. Spectra were collected for samples of 63 μm peptide in 10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7, in trifluoroethanol and in the presence of 10 mm SDS micelles and large unilamellar lipid vesicles (LUV) composed of 1 mm POPC and POPG. For the measurements in the presence of lipids, a defined amount of lipid in chloroform was dried over a stream of nitrogen gas and stored over vacuum overnight to remove trace amounts of organic solvent. The dried lipid film was then dispersed in buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) and hydrated at ∼10 °C above the liquid crystalline phase of the lipids for 2–4 h, with intermittent, vigorous vortex mixing and sonication. LUV were prepared by the extrusion method using a Mini-Extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.). The vesicle suspension was extruded through a 0.1-μm polycarbonate filter for 21 times. The size of the vesicles was controlled by Dynamic Light Scattering. To analyze the secondary structure content of the peptides the program CONTIN/LL (21Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 22Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Anal.

Intercalation of peptides into phospholipid liposomes composed of natural PC, and PG was determined at 37 °C by FRET spectroscopy applied as a probe dilution assay (24Schromm A.B. Brandenburg K. Rietschel E.T. Flad H.D. Carroll S.F. Seydel U. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Peptides were added to liposomes, which were labeled with the donor dye NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) and acceptor dye Rhodamine-PE. Intercalation was monitored as the increase of the ratio of the donor fluorescence intensity ID at 531 nm to that of the acceptor intensity IA at 593 nm (FRET signal) in dependence on time. Log-phase bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 23716) grown in LB broth were washed, suspended in 10% LB/90% 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and adjusted to a density of 5 × 108 CFU/ml. Peptide NK-2, NK11, or buffer was added to 1 ml of bacterial suspension (final peptide concentration 4 and 20 μm) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under constant shaking. Subsequently, bacteria were fixed using 2% osmium tetroxide, for 1.5 h (25Griffith O.H. Lesch G.H. Rempfer G.F. Birrell G.B. Burke C.A. Schlosser D.W. Mallon M.H. Lee G.B. Stafford R.G. Jost P.C. Marriott T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After fixation, the samples were washed three times with distilled water. The post-fixation positive stain was carried out with a 2% aqueous uranyl-acetate solution (1 h), and the washing procedure was repeated. Then the material was dehydrated in a series of ethanol washes (30, 50, 70, 90, and 100%), each for 15 min. The material was transferred to propylene oxide, for 15 min. All above mentioned procedures were carried out at room temperature. Infiltration of the samples was done overnight in a 1:1 propylene oxide-Epon-resin-mix, at 4 °C. Then the samples were embedded in Epon-resin, polymerization was carried out at 60 °C overnight. Ultrathin-sectioning (80–100 nm) was performed with a diamant-knife, using a pyramytom. The slices were placed on a copper grid (400 squares) and counterstained with lead citrate, in a CO2-free environment. Pictures were taken with the EM Zeiss 910. The net charge (Q) of the peptides was calculated by subtracting the number of aspartic acid residues (the only negatively charged amino acid residues present in the peptides) from all the positive charges (lysine, arginine, and the peptide N terminus). Because the C terminus of all peptides used was amidated, it did not bear a negative charge. The mean hydrophobicities (H) and hydrophobic moments (μH) of the peptides were calculated using the consensus scale of hydrophobicity proposed by Eisenberg et al. (26Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaroy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic moments were calculated using the Profilegraph program (27Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Bioinformatics. 1992; 8: 331-337Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) under the assumption that the peptides adopt an ideal α-helix, (i) for the entire peptides and (ii) for a seven amino acid residue segment, i.e. the two most amphipathic helical turns. A mean MIC value of the peptides was calculated using the MIC values obtained against five representative Gram-negative strains (E. coli ATCC 25922, Acinetobacter baumanii ATCC 19606, Brucella abortus 9.49 (per-), Bordetella bronchiseptica CUN 11844-99, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa CUN 4158-02; see Table 1). If the MIC was higher than the maximum peptide concentration tested (e.g. 256 μg/ml), the next higher concentration was taken for calculation. Ultrastructural Analysis of Peptide-treated E. coli—The anti-bacterial efficacy of the peptide NK-2 (14Andraö J. Koch M.H.J. Bartels R. Brandenburg K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Andraö J. Leippe M. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 188: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and its interaction with and permeabilizing potency on model membranes mimicking the bacterial envelope is well documented (13Schroöder-Borm H. Willumeit R. Brandenburg K. Andraö J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1612: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Andraö J. Koch M.H.J. Bartels R. Brandenburg K. Antimicrob.

Acta. 2005; 1669: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, experimental evidence at the ultrastructural level that would provide a direct link from the model membrane studies to the in vitro antibacterial testing is still lacking. To close this gap, we incubated bacteria (our internal reference strain E. coli ATCC 23716) in the absence and presence of NK-2, at concentrations close below and above the MIC (4 μm and 20 μm under the incubation conditions), and subsequently analyzed the bacteria by transmission electron microscopy. As a control we used the almost inactive peptide NK11 (20 μm). Differences in the ultrastructure between bacteria incubated in buffer or in the presence of NK11 on the one hand, and in the presence of NK-2 on the other hand were dramatic (Fig. 1). Whereas the morphology of bacteria incubated in the presence of NK11 (Fig. 1C) was only slightly changed when compared with the buffer control (Fig. 1, A and D), due to the action of NK-2 (at 4 and 20 μm), the outer membrane of E. coli appeared detached from the inner membrane, thereby increasing the average diameter of the cells. At 20 μm NK-2 concentration highly electrodense clusters were found inside and outside of cells (Fig. 1, B and E). For some bacteria, the envelope seemed to be almost completely destroyed, and the cell content was released to the surrounding medium (Fig. 1F). At first glance, all the observed features were indicative of a direct lytic action of NK-2, which will likely alter the permeability properties of the bacterial cell envelope. However, we observed no bleb (finger-like extensions) formation. This and the fact that the cytoplasm of the treated cells that remained unbroken appeared less electrodense than that of untreated control bacteria suggest that the peptide may reach an intracellular target(s) such as DNA, as it has been claimed for other antimicrobial peptides (28Friedrich C.L. Moyles D. Beveridge T.J. Hancock R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2086-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 29Powers J.P. Martin M.M. Goosney D.L. Hancock R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 1522-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Design of Shortened NK-2 Variants—Our rationale to generate shortened derivatives of NK-2 with potentially improved activity was based on two criteria: (i) to preserve N- and C-terminal positively charged lysine residues, which have been shown to reduce the hemolytic activity of the peptide (17Andraö J. Leippe M. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 188: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); and (ii) to maintain the amphipathic nature and charge pattern of the parent peptide NK-2. The amphipathicity of this peptide is reflected by the segregation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid residue side chains (Fig. 2) under the assumption of an ideal α-helix (Refs. 13Schroöder-Borm H. Willumeit R. Brandenburg K. Andraö J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1612: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Andraö J. Leippe M. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 188: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and this report). Our most basic modification entailed the replacement of the non-functional sole cysteine residue within the NK-2 sequence with a serine residue (C7S), resulting in the peptide NK27. This substitution is expected to reduce the sensitivity of the peptides to oxidation, thereby improving stability. To address the influence of the C terminus on secondary structure and function, we synthesized a single peptide with a non-amidated C-terminal end (NK27-OH). Peptides N17, C20, and C20-DK comprise the N- and the C-terminal part of NK-2, whereas peptide I10 is composed of the overlapping internal residues shared by N17 and C20 (Table 2). Shortening and conservation of amphipathicity was achieved by the consecutive omission of putative internal helical terms of the peptide NK-2. Following this strategy, we constructed and synthesized additional peptides ranging from 10 to 27 amino acid residues in length (Table 2). As internal standards for the biological assays we included bee venom melittin, a cationic linear α-helical peptide well known for its potent hemolytic and antibacterial activities, and the cyclic lipopeptide polymyxin B, a very effective albeit toxic antibiotic.TABLE 2Sequence, length (n), net charge (Q), mean hydrophobicity (H), and amphipathicity (μH) of NK-2 and derived synthetic peptides Open table in a new tab Cytotoxicity and Hemolytic Activity of Peptides—Cytotoxicity of the peptides was assayed against human HeLa cells by the MTT and the neutral red test (Table 3), and hemolytic activity was monitored by hemoglobin release from human erythrocytes (Fig. 3). Besides the highly hemolytic melittin, only peptides NK-2, NK27, and NK23c induced a noteworthy hemolysis. A similar spectrum of activity was observed against metabolically active nucleated human cells. Melittin, NK-2, and five derived peptides exhibited a detectable cytotoxicity in the MTT test at 100 μg/ml. These peptides were also assayed by the neutral red uptake test. Because the latter assay allowed to detect membrane permeabilization, and the results obtained were very similar to the MTT assay it is likely that the cytotoxic activity of the peptides is directly connected to membrane lysis. Interestingly, unlike NK27, the non-amidated NK27-OH was neither hemolytic (not shown) nor considerably toxic for HeLa cells (Table 3).TABLE 3Cytotoxic activities of synthetic peptides against HeLa cellsPeptideCytotoxicityMTTNeutral red% of controlNK-228.7 ± 9.331.6 ± 11.9NK2738.4 ± 10.324.8 ± 15.8NK27-OH6.5 ± 17.36.9 ± 4.9NK19a21.1 ± 4.056.4 ± 3.3NK19bKR6.6 ± 7.913.5 ± 19.3NK136.4 ± 3.018.5 ± 2.6Melittin90.1 ± 4.286.0 ± 1.5 Open table in a new tab Antibacterial Activ"
https://openalex.org/W2028917655,"Galanin receptor 1 (GALR1) maps to a common region of 18q loss in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and is frequently inactivated by methylation. To investigate effects of GALR1 and its signaling pathways, we stably expressed hemaglutinin-tagged GALR1 in a human oral carcinoma cell line (UM-SCC-1-GALR1) that expresses no endogenous GALR1. In transfected cells, galanin induced activation of the extracellular-regulated protein kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) and suppressed proliferation. Galanin stimulation mediated decreased expression of cyclin D1 and increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI), p27Kip1 and p57Kip2. Pretreatment with the ERK1/2-specific inhibitor U0126 prevented these galanin-induced effects. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation did not differ in UM-SCC-1-GALR1 and UM-SCC-1-mock cells after galanin treatment. Pertussis toxin and LY294002 inhibition demonstrated that galanin and GALR1 induce ERK1/2 activation via Gαi, not the PI3K pathway-linked to the Gβγ subunit. Galanin and GALR1 also inhibit colony formation and tumor growth in vivo. Our results implicate GALR1, a Gi protein-coupled receptor, as a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits cell proliferation via ERK1/2 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2019924027,"In the previous study, we demonstrated the involvement of dual specificity phosphatase 22 (DUSP22/LMW-DSP2) in regulating the leukemia inhibitory factor/interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-mediated signaling pathway. In this study, we show beta-estradiol (E2)-induced DUSP22 mRNA expression in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive breast cancer cells, whereas E2-induced phosphorylation and activation of ERalpha was suppressed by overexpression of DUSP22 but not catalytically inactive mutants. Furthermore, small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of DUSP22 expression enhanced ERalpha-mediated transcription and endogenous gene expression. In fact, DUSP22 associated with ERalpha in vivo and both endogenous proteins interacted in ERalpha-positive breast cancer T47D cells. These results strongly suggest that DUSP22 acts as a negative regulator of the ERalpha-mediated signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1984264347,"Protein kinase D (PKD), a family of serine/threonine kinases, can be activated by a multitude of stimuli in a protein kinase C-dependent or -independent manner. PKD is involved in signal transduction pathways controlling cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility, and protein trafficking. Despite its versatile functions, few genuine in vivo substrates for PKD have been identified. In this study we demonstrate that the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) is a direct substrate for PKD. PKD1 and CREB interact in cells, and activated PKD1 provokes CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133 both in vitro and in vivo. A constitutive active mutant of PKD1 stimulates GAL4-CREB-mediated transcription in a Ser-133-dependent manner, activates CRE-responsive promoters, and increases the expression of CREB target genes. PKD1 also enhances transcription mediated by two other members of the CREB family, ATF-1 and CREM. Our results describe a novel mechanism for PKD-induced signaling through activation of the transcription factor CREB and suggest that stimulus-induced phosphorylation of CREB, reported to be mediated by protein kinase C, may involve downstream activated PKD.

PKD was originally considered to be a member of the PKC family (1Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol.

Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 111Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The PKDs share a similar architecture consisting of a C-terminal catalytic domain, an N-terminal regulatory domain that encompasses two cysteine-rich regions (C1a and C1b), and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (4Van Lint J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 13205-13208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid sequences of PKD1–3 reveals that the highest homology lies in the catalytic domain, followed by C1a, C1b, and PH domain, suggesting that isoform-specific functions may be due to the regulatory part of the kinase (8Wang Q.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 317-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). PKD1 can be activated by several mechanisms. The most studied mechanism involves a sequential activation of phospholipase C that results in the generation of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG) and subsequent activation of the classical (α, βI, βII, and γ) and novel (δ, ɛ, η, and θ) PKC isoforms. Binding of DAG to the C1b domain of PKD1 directs its translocation to the plasma membrane where activated novel PKC phosphorylates PKD1 at Ser-744/748 in the activation loop, causing activation of the enzyme. The activated enzyme can be imported via its C1b motif into the nucleus, where it transiently accumulates before being exported to the cytosol through a CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway that requires the PH domain of PKD (4Van Lint J.

Mutations and deletions in the regulatory domain induce activation of PKD to various extents, and the entire regulatory domain has an inhibitory effect on the kinase activity (9Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Indeed, PKD can also be activated through caspase-mediated cleavage of the regulatory domain (10Endo K. Oki E. Biedermann V. Kojima H. Yoshida K. Johannes F.J. Kufe D. Datta R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18476-18481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Gβγ subunits can activate PKD1 through direct interaction with the PH domain (11Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Van L.J. Laudenslager J. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V. Cell. 1999; 98: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, a recent report suggested that the β1γ2-mediated activation of PKD required PKCη (12Diaz Anel A.M. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKD can be activated by bone morphogenetic protein 2 and endothelin-I in a PKC-independent manner, but the mechanisms remain elusive (13Lemonnier J. Ghayor C. Guicheux J. Caverzasio J.

Depending on the cell type and external stimulus, PKD localizes to different cellular compartments (4Van Lint J. Rykx A. Maeda Y. Vantus T. Sturany S. Malhotra V. Vandenheede J.R. Seufferlein T. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This suggests that PKD can regulate several cellular functions according to its cellular localization. PKD was shown to be involved in the fission of carriers from the trans-Golgi network to plasma membrane (15Ghanekar Y. Lowe M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 511-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and PKD-mediated phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ results in enhanced vesicular stomatitis virus-G protein transport to the plasma membrane (16Hausser A. Storz P. Martens S. Link G. Toker A. Pfizenmaier K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). PKD can also participate in cell motility (17Prigozhina N.L.

PKD mediates PDGF-induced suppression of epidermal growth factor-triggered c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in a cell-dependent manner (19Bagowski C.P. Stein-Gerlach M. Choidas A. Ullrich A.

Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1211-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). More than 20 different protein kinases that are compounds of distinct signaling pathways have been described as CREB kinases (34Johannessen M. Delghandi M.P. Moens U. Cell.

These observations prompted us to test whether CREB is a PKD substrate. Our results show that CREB is an in vitro and in vivo PKD substrate and that PKD activates CREB-dependent transcription in a Ser-133-dependent manner. The biological consequences of these findings are discussed. Materials—12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 4-β-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), myelin basic protein (MBP), sodium orthovanadate, and doxorubicin were purchased from Sigma.

This fragment was used to replace the corresponding area in GST-CREB, creating the GST-CREBS133A plasmid. pCRE-luc was purchased from Clontech, and pmutCRE-luc has been previously described (49Johannessen M. Delghandi M.P. Seternes O.M. Johansen B. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). VP16-CREB was created by subcloning of the ∼1-kb EcoRI and BamHI fragment from CREB-pGADP into VP16 (Clontech). CREB-pGADP was prepared as follows; PCR was performed with GAL4-CREB as a template, using the primers 5′-ATGACATGGAATTCGGAGCAGACAAC-3′ and 5′-CTTGRGGCAGTAAGGATCCTTAAGTG-3′, which includes a restriction site for EcoRI and BamHI respectively. The resulting PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into pGADT7 (Clontech). To clone the PH-KD domain of PKD1 (corresponding to the fragment generated by cleavage with caspase-3, consisting of amino acid residues 427–918 of mouse PKD1), PCR on full-length PKD cDNA was performed using the primers 5′-GCA CAC GAA GCG GTC GAC CAG CAC TGT G-3′ and 5′-CCA GGT CTG ATA GAG CTC TAG CCA AGG GTG ACT C-3′. The PCR product was digested with SalI and SacI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pSL1180. The PH-KD sequences were then excised with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3.1 to generate the eukaryotic expression vector for the PH-KD fragment of PKD1. Site-directed Mutagenesis—All PCR-based site-directed mutageneses were performed using Stratagene QuikChange according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The complementary primer sets for the generation of S89A, S98A, and S121A mutations in GAL4-CREB and GAL4-CREBS133A or GST-CREB expression plasmids were as follows: S89A, 5′-CAGTTCAGTCTGCATGCAAGGACTTAAAAAGAC-3′; S98A, 5′-GGACTTAAAAAGACTTTTCGCCGGCACTCAGATTTCACC-3′; S121A, 5′-GGAGTCTGTGGATAGTGTAACTGATGCGCAAAAACGAAGGG-3′ (only one strand is shown). All the mutations were verified by sequencing. Sequencing—Cycle sequencing was performed using the Big Dye sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

Luciferase assays were as described previously (49Johannessen M. Delghandi M.P. Seternes O.M. Johansen B. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As neither empty expression vector nor dominant negative (dn) PKD1 affected CREB-mediated transcription, we chose to use dnPKD1 as a reference to compare the activity of CREB in the presence of activated PKD1. Immunoprecipitation—Confluent 10-cm plates with HEK293 cells transfected with appropriate constructs were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and harvested in a cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) (53Elliott M.R.

Lysates were precleared with random but irrelevant antibody for 1 h at 4°C followed by precipitation of the nonspecific complexes with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The precleared lysates were then incubated with anti-CREB protein for 1 h at 4°C, followed by precipitation of the complexes with protein G-Sepharose. The immune complexes were washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer (see above) and twice in ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analyses were performed on immune complexes or extracts derived from cells grown in 6-well trays. The cells were washed twice in PBS, harvested in 80 μl of lysis buffer (0.25 m dithiothreitol, 1:1 NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (four times), and double distilled H2O), heated to 70 °C for 10 min, and sonicated for 4 s. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–12% NuPAGE; Invitrogen) and transferred to 0.45-μm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (Nestlē), 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer. The blots were subsequently incubated for 1 h in room temperature with alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (DAKO, Denmark) in blocking buffer before exposure to chemiluminescence substrate CDP-Star. To verify equal protein loading, the membranes were stripped for 5 min in 0.2 m NaOH, washed three times in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), blocked, and reprobed with anti-CREB antibody. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA from transfected HEK293 cells was isolated using the Nucleospin RNA II purification kit (Clontech and Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Two μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Biocompare, Bio-Rad) and subjected to PCR. The primers for APRT and the PCR conditions have been described previously (49Johannessen M. Delghandi M.P. Seternes O.M. Johansen B. Moens U. Cell.

To amplify Nur77 cDNA, the following primers were used: 5′-TCTGCTCAGGCCTGGTGCTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCACCAAGTCCTCCAGCTTG-3′ (reverse). The PCR cycling conditions were 30 times at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. PCR products were visualized on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel.

https://openalex.org/W2027317507,"The actin-binding protein filamin A (FLNa) is associated with diverse cellular processes such as cell motility and signaling through its scaffolding properties. Here we examine the effect of FLNa on the regulation of signaling pathways that control the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The lack of FLNa in human M2 melanoma cells was associated with constitutive and phorbol ester-induced expression and secretion of active MMP-9 in the absence of MMP-2 up-regulation. M2 cells displayed stronger MMP-9 production and activity than their M2A7 counterparts where FLNa had been stably reintroduced. Using an MMP-9 promoter construct (pMMP-9-Luc), in vitro kinase assays, and genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that FLNa mediated transcriptional down-regulation of pMMP-9-Luc by suppressing the constitutive hyperactivity of the Ras/MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. Experimental evidence indicated that this phenomenon was associated with destabilization and ubiquitylation of Ras-GRF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates H-Ras by facilitating the release of GDP. Ectopic expression of Ras-GRF1 was accompanied by ERK activation and elevated levels of MMP-9 in M2A7 cells, whereas a catalytically inactive dominant negative Ras-GRF1, which prevented ERK activation, reduced MMP-9 expression in M2 cells. Our results indicate that expression of FLNa regulates constitutive activation of the Ras/ERK pathway partly through a Ras-GRF1 mechanism to modulate the production of MMP-9.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). Melanoma progression, as in many other cancers, is associated with invasion into surrounding tissues, which depends on MMP-mediated proteolytic degradation of the basement membrane and ECM. Among its members, the 72-kDa gelatinase A (MMP-2) and 92-kDa gelatinase B (MMP-9) are thought to be key enzymes for degrading type IV collagen, a major component of the basement membrane. Contributions of these enzymes in both physiological and pathophysiological processes such as tumor cell invasion and metastasis have been well documented (2Himelstein B.P. Canete-Soler R.

The expression of MMP-9 can be induced by a variety of mitogens, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), tumor necrosis factor α and phorbol esters. There are a number of transcription factors that bind in the upstream regulatory region of the MMP-9 gene, which helps explain the multiple mechanisms of regulation of MMP-9 gene expression in tumor cell lines (12Ma Z.

Stimulus-mediated activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is required for expression of MMP-9, via the binding of AP-1 and ETS family of transcription factors to the human MMP-9 promoter (14Gum R.

Filamin A (FLNa), a member of the non-muscle actin-binding protein family, is a widely expressed molecular scaffold that regulates signaling events involved in cell shape change and motility by interacting with integrins, transmembrane receptor complexes, adaptor molecules, and second messengers (18Feng Y.

In addition, the ability of tissue factor to promote vascular remodeling and tumor cell metastasis have been shown to be mediated by interaction with FLNa (23Ott I. Fischer E.G. Miyagi Y. Mueller B.M. Ruf W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and remodeling of the cytoskeleton has been identified as having a role in cell migration and acquisition of invasive behavior (24de Curtis I.

Thus, the ability of FLNa to act as integrator of cell mechanics (20Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) is of significant interest, and has led us to hypothesize that this scaffold protein provides a molecular pathway to support metastasis and motility through regulation of MMP expression in melanoma. The present study was designed to determine the importance of FLNa in the regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels in the human melanoma M2 cell line. Using FLNa-deficient M2 cells and M2 cells stably expressing normal concentration of human FLNa (M2A7 cells) we found a significant reduction in MMP-9 secretion and activity upon FLNa expression, and have assessed here the intracellular mechanisms responsible. Our data indicate a dampening in the constitutive activation of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK cascade in M2A7 cells through a decrease in steady-state levels of GTP-bound Ras. A number of studies have been reported on the important role of guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in Ras activation (26Arozarena I. Aaronson D.S. Matallanas D. Sanz V. Ajenjo N. Tenbaum S.P.

Castro A.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 71: 391-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FLNa interacts with Trio, a RhoGEF that controls RhoG/Rac1 GTPase function (28Bellanger J.M. Astier C. Sardet C. Ohta Y. Stossel T.P. Debant A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 888-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); however, it remains unclear whether FLNa can limit the GTP-bound Ras levels through down-regulation of GEFs that target Ras. In this study, we present evidence that expression of FLNa was associated with reduction of Ras-GRF1 levels through ubiquitylation-mediated proteolysis. Ectopic expression of Ras-GRF1 but not the ΔCdc25 mutant form of Ras-GRF1 was correlated with an increase in the Raf-1/ERK pathway and the levels of MMP-9. These results suggest that FLNa may be a negative regulator of Ras-GRF1, thereby blocking the sustained activation of the Ras/ERK signal transduction pathway required for MMP-9 expression in melanoma.

M2 and M2A7 cells were plated in duplicates, and transfected with either pcDNA3.1 or FLNa construct at a ratio of 4 μg of plasmid/60-mm dish, using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). In other experiments, RasN17 (2 μg), HA-Ras-GRF1 (1–2 μg), or AU5-ΔCdc25 (2–4 μg) were transfected into M2 and M2A7 cells (35-mm2 dishes) with MMP-9 luciferase (1 μg) and pSV-β-galactosidase (0.2 μg) constructs. At 30 h post-transfection, the cells were serum-starved for different times as described, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI) for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays (kits from Promega) and Western blot analysis. Gelatin Zymography—Growth-arrested M2 and M2A7 cells were incubated in the serum-free MEM for 24 h at 37 °C. Gelatinase activity in conditioned medium was measured by zymography. An equal amount of proteins from the concentrated conditioned medium (25 μl) was separated on a 10% Zymogram gel containing 0.1% gelatin, and the gel was incubated in the zymogram developing buffer (Invitrogen) for 16 h at 37 °C to evaluate activities of MMP-9 and MMP-2. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 and then destained to reveal areas of gelatinolytic activity. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol, followed by RT-PCR reaction. MMP-9 forward (5′-GATGCGTGGAGAGTCGAAAT-3′) and reverse (5′-CACCAAACTGGATGACGATG-3′) primers, MMP-2 forward (5′-ACAAAGAGTTGGCAGTGCAA-3′) and reverse (5′-CACGAGCAAAGGCATCATCC-3′) primers, and GAPDH forward (5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′) and reverse (5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′) primers were synthetized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). For all reactions, PCR conditions comprised 25 cycles of 94 °C (45 s), 50 °C (45 s) and 72 °C (45 s). PCR products were resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the relative intensity of MMP-2 (303 bp), MMP-9 (329 bp) and GADPH (220 bp) bands was determined following ethidium bromide staining and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences Life Science). Samples were standardized for equal expression of GADPH. Quantitative Real Time PCR—cDNA were prepared from treated M2 and M2A7 cells, and the quantitative PCR analysis was performed by using TaqMan® Gene Expression Assay (Part 4324018) from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Primers for MMP-9 (catalog number Hs00234579), MMP-2 (catalog number Hs00234422), and reference gene GAPDH (catalog number Hs99999905) were predesigned by Applied Biosystems according to the sequences available from NCBI with the accession numbers NM_004994.2, NM_004530.2, and NM_002046.3, respectively. Each reaction was carried out in tetraplicate in the ABI 7300 Real Time PCR System. To determine the relative quantitation of gene expression, the comparative CT (threshold cycle) method was used (30Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (123392) Google Scholar) and normalized to the amount of GADPH RNA present in each sample. Assays—To evaluate the amount of MMP-9 secretion, the conditioned medium from M2 and M2A7 cells was concentrated and assayed for MMP-9 protein by ELISA, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Calbiochem). Ras activation assay was performed as followed: Briefly, M2 and M2A7 cells were rinsed in PBS and then serum-starved for 4 h before cell lysis. Ras activation was then determined using a RasGTPase Chemi ELISA kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). B-Raf and c-Raf kinase cascade assay kits were used to measure cellular Raf activities via phosphorylation of recombinant inactive MEK1 and its inactive substrate ERK2. Activation of ERK2 leads to phosphorylation of myelin basic protein as ERK substrate. In brief, after PBS washes, cells were lysed in ice-cold Tris lysis buffer (TLB: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm Na2HPO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem)]. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and protein content was measured using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 500 μg of soluble cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of polyclonal anti-B-Raf (07-453) or c-Raf (07-396) antibody (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) in the presence of protein A/G PLUS agarose beads (Calbiochem) for 2 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed and resuspended in kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). In vitro kinase assays were then performed in two stages, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.). Subcellular Fractionation—Serum-starved cells were left untreated or treated either with 20 nm EGF or 100 nm PMA for 10 min. The cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture set I). The cells were homogenized by passing them five times through a 23-gauge needle on ice and centrifuged at 1300 × g for 5 min to sediment nuclei and unbroken cells. The clarified homogenate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and saved as cytosol, and the pelleted membranes were washed twice in lysis buffer and then resuspended in TLB buffer. Protein concentration for the cytosol, and membrane fractions was determined by the BCA method. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—After cell lysis in immune precipitation buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.01% sodium azide, and protease inhibitor mixture set I), the clarified lysates (500 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of rabbit anti-Ras-GRF1, anti-SOS1 or anti-c-Myc antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) for 90 min at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed two times with immune precipitation buffer, two times with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl, and twice with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100. Total cell extracts and immunoprecipitated complexes were separated by 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE, and then subjected to immunoblotting with specific primary antibodies. The signals were quantified using a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The antibodies used in these studies included polyclonal antibodies that were raised against phospho-MEK1/2 (9121), phospho-ERK1/2 (7071), phospho-AKT (Ser473; 9271), phospho-IκBα (9241), total STAT3 (9132), MMP-9 (2270), and c-Fos (4384), and were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (sc-8017) and anti-phospho-Jun (sc-822), and polyclonal antibodies directed against SOS1 (sc-256), Ras-GRF1 (sc-863), clathrin (sc-9069), ERK1/2 (sc-094), c-Src (sc-18), IKKα (sc-7607), and p89TFIIH (sc-293) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal antibodies against FLNa, panRas (OP40), and phospho-Raf-1 (Ser338; 05-538) were purchased from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flanders, NJ), Calbiochem and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. FLNa Attenuates Constitutive and Phorbol Ester-mediated MMP-9 Secretion and Activity—In vivo, MMP-2 and -9 are two major gelatinases produced by human melanomas, and their proteolytic activity is thought to be necessary in both physiological and pathophysiological processes. Gelatin zymography was carried out to resolve the two closely related activities. The level of active MMP-9 was markedly higher in M2 cells when compared with M2A7 cells, both in the absence and the presence of PMA (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, MMP-2 activity levels were found to be very low and unresponsive to PMA stimulation (Fig. 1A). To verify whether the presence of FLNa differentially affected MMP-9 and MMP-2 at the mRNA level, cells were serum-starved, lysed, and mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR. The results showed that the MMP-9 PCR product was present in M2 cells, but not in M2A7 cells (Fig. 1B), consistent with the gelatin zymography data. In contrast, MMP-2 mRNA level was comparable in both cell lines following normalization with GADPH mRNA. Real time PCR analysis was also carried out and demonstrated a ∼30-fold increase in MMP-9 mRNA levels in PMA-stimulated M2 cells as compared with unstimulated cells (Fig. 1C, filled bars). Pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 sharply reduced the PMA response. In contrast, no significant increase in the amount of MMP-9 mRNA was observed in M2A7 cells post-PMA treatment (Fig. 1C, open bars). MMP-2 mRNA levels were unresponsive to PMA stimulation in both M2 and M2A7 cells (data not shown). In keeping with these observations, all subsequent experiments were performed studying the regulation of MMP-9. The differential ability of M2 and M2A7 cells at promoting MMP-9 expression and activity was associated with differences in MMP-9 secretion (Fig. 1D). Using an ELISA assay to measure the amount of MMP-9 released in the medium, we showed that control M2 cells secreted MMP-9 at a rate of 0.12 ± 0.05 ng/ml/24 h, while no response was observed with M2A7 cells. A significant increase in MMP-9 secretion of ∼8-fold above the control was found upon a 24-h exposure of M2 cells to the phorbol ester PMA (100 nm) (Fig. 1D). In contrast, MMP-9 secretion was found to be below the detection limit following stimulation of M2A7 cells with PMA. These results were corroborated by gelatinase activity (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–6). As anticipated, pharmacological inhibition of the ERK/MAPK pathway with U0126 blocked the basal and PMA-induced release of MMP-9 in M2 cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, our data suggest that FLNa is a negative regulator of MMP-9 expression. FLNa Attenuates the MMP-9 Promoter—The human MMP-9 promoter (–670/+54) has been previously found to contain binding sites for AP-1, NF-κB and SP-1 proteins (13Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar). In a first series of experiments, wild type and mutant forms of the promoter were used to delineate the gene elements needed for constitutive and PMA-induced MMP-9 gene expression in M2 cells (Fig. 2A). More than 3.8-fold induction of the wild-type MMP-9 promoter construct was observed in response to PMA. It is interesting to note that mutation of the AP-1-binding site markedly reduced promoter activity in control and PMA-stimulated cells, whereas inactivation of the NF-κB binding site elicited a ∼40% decrease in the PMA response (Fig. 2A). We then addressed whether pharmacological inhibition of the MEK/ERK or IKK/NF-κB pathway might reduce MMP-9 reporter activity. At 36 h post-transfection, the M2 cells were either untreated or treated with U0126 or the IKK inhibitor BMS345541 for 1 h prior to the addition of 100 nm PMA for 7 h (Fig. 2B). While basal MMP-9 reporter activity was reduced by ∼50% in cells treated with the MEK inhibitor U0126, PMA-mediated increases in pMMP-9-Luc activity felt sharply upon inhibition of either pathway as compared with control cells (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with earlier findings suggesting that activation of the MMP-9 promoter requires synergistic cooperation between various cis-acting elements (12Ma Z. Shah R.C. Chang M.J. Benveniste E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5496-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a marked reduction in MMP-9 promoter activation was observed in FLNa-expressing M2A7 cells when compared with M2 cells treated in the absence or the presence of PMA (Fig. 2C). These results recapitulate the MMP-9 activity determined by gelatin zymography (Fig. 1A). Importantly, transient expression of FLNa in M2 cells elicited an increase in FLNa protein levels (Fig. 2C, upper panel), while inhibiting both the basal and PMA-induced MMP-9 gene promoter construct activation (Fig. 2C, lower panel). There was markedly reduced expression of MMP-9 protein in response to PMA in M2 cells transfected with FLNa (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 4, top). Reprobing the blots demonstrated similar expression of ERK1/2 (Fig. 2D, bottom). Taken together, these results provide evidence that the differences in MMP-9 expression between M2 and M2A7 cells are not attributable to clonal variations, but instead suggest that FLNa inhibits the expression of MMP-9. FLNa Reduces the Constitutive Activation of the Raf-1/ERK Cascade—To investigate the signaling pathways that are affected by FLNa expression, we focused on the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade and the PI 3-kinase/AKT pathway. Total lysates from M2 and M2A7 cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against phosphorylated (e.g. activated) Raf-1 (pSer338), MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and AKT. M2 cells had relatively high levels of phosphorylated forms of Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 in basal conditions that were increased severalfold in the presence of PMA stimulation (Fig. 3A). The stable expression of FLNa in M2A7 cells was associated with a reduction in basal phosphorylation levels of these intermediates when compared with M2 cells (Fig. 3A, lane 3 versus 2). No significant difference in AKT phosphorylation was observed between M2 and M2A7 cells (data not shown). Interestingly, one of the AP-1 subunits, the immediate-early gene c-Fos, was detected in M2 cells under basal conditions, and a decrease in c-Fos migration occurred following 15 min of PMA treatment (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with its phosphorylation. There was little c-Fos expression, if any, in M2A7 cells exposed in the absence or presence of PMA, despite the presence of ERK activation upon PMA stimulation. Because of the important role for NF-κB in regulating melanoma cell migration, we measured also the levels of phosphorylated IκBα in lysates from M2 and M2A7 cells, and found measurable IκBα phosphorylation in unstimulated M2 cells (Fig. 3A, fifth panel). Moreover, short-term treatment with PMA led to significant increase in phospho-IκBα levels in M2A7 cells, although to levels that were lower to those observed in M2 cells. These results support earlier findings about enhanced NF-κB activation in melanoma by phorbol esters (31La Porta C.A. Comolli R. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2591-2597PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis utilizing antibodies against c-Src and IKKα confirmed equal protein loading in each lane. Stable expression of FLNa in M2A7 cells is associated with reduction i"
https://openalex.org/W1980287237,"In vivo studies have shown that neurons in the neocortex can generate action potentials at high temporal precision. The mechanisms controlling timing and reliability of action potential generation in neocortical neurons, however, are still poorly understood. Here we investigated the temporal precision and reliability of spike firing in cortical layer V pyramidal cells at near-threshold membrane potentials. Timing and reliability of spike responses were a function of EPSC kinetics, temporal jitter of population excitatory inputs, and of background synaptic noise. We used somatic current injection to mimic population synaptic input events and measured spike probability and spike time precision (STP), the latter defined as the time window (Δt) holding 80% of response spikes. EPSC rise and decay times were varied over the known physiological spectrum. At spike threshold level, EPSC decay time had a stronger influence on STP than rise time. Generally, STP was highest (≤2.45 ms) in response to synchronous compounds of EPSCs with fast rise and decay kinetics. Compounds with slow EPSC kinetics (decay time constants>6 ms) triggered spikes at lower temporal precision (≥6.58 ms). We found an overall linear relationship between STP and spike delay. The difference in STP between fast and slow compound EPSCs could be reduced by incrementing the amplitude of slow compound EPSCs. The introduction of a temporal jitter to compound EPSCs had a comparatively small effect on STP, with a tenfold increase in jitter resulting in only a five fold decrease in STP. In the presence of simulated synaptic background activity, precisely timed spikes could still be induced by fast EPSCs, but not by slow EPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W1974311793,"Shigella dysenteriae, like many bacterial pathogens, has evolved outer membrane receptor-mediated pathways for the uptake and utilization of heme as an iron source. As a first step toward understanding the mechanism of heme uptake we have undertaken a site-directed mutagenesis, spectroscopic, and kinetic analysis of the outer membrane receptor ShuA of S. dysenteriae. Purification of the outer membrane receptor gave a single band of molecular mass 73 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Initial spectroscopic analysis of the protein in either detergent micelles or lipid bicelles revealed residual heme bound to the receptor, with a Soret maximum at 413 nm. Titration of the protein with exogenous heme gave a Soret peak at 437 nm in detergent micelles, and 402 nm in lipid bicelles. However, transfer of heme from hemoglobin yields a Soret maximum at 413 nm identical to that of the isolated protein. Further spectroscopic and kinetic analysis revealed that hemoglobin in the oxidized state is the most likely physiological substrate for ShuA. In addition, mutation of the conserved histidines, H86A or H420A, resulted in a loss of the ability of the receptor to efficiently extract heme from hemoglobin. In contrast the double mutant H86A/H420A was unable to extract heme from hemoglobin. These findings taken together confirm that both His-86 and His-420 are essential for substrate recognition, heme coordination, and transfer. Furthermore, the full-length TonB was shown to form a 1:1 complex with either apo-ShuA H86A/H420A or the wild-type ShuA. These observations provide a basis for future studies on the coordination and transport of heme by the TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors.

The ability to acquire iron is essential for the survival and virulence of the large majority of pathogenic bacteria (1Braun V. Contrib. Microbiol. 2005; 12: 210-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial pathogens have therefore evolved sophisticated systems to acquire a variety of iron complexes (2Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Most bacteria excrete siderophores, high affinity low molecular weight chelators that sequester iron for internalization via receptor-mediated uptake. In addition, many pathogens obtain iron by utilizing the host's iron and heme 2The abbreviations used are: heme, iron protoporphyrin IX irrespective of oxidation state; metHbtetramer, tetrameric hemoglobin in the ferric (Fe3+) state; metHbdimer, dimeric hemoglobin in the ferric (Fe3+) state; oxy-Hb, oxygenated tetrameric hemoglobin in the ferrous (Fe2+) state; metMb, myoglobin in the ferric (Fe3+) state; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride. 2The abbreviations used are: heme, iron protoporphyrin IX irrespective of oxidation state; metHbtetramer, tetrameric hemoglobin in the ferric (Fe3+) state; metHbdimer, dimeric hemoglobin in the ferric (Fe3+) state; oxy-Hb, oxygenated tetrameric hemoglobin in the ferrous (Fe2+) state; metMb, myoglobin in the ferric (Fe3+) state; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride.-containing proteins (2Wandersman C.

Microbiol. 2000; 3: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These complex transport systems in Gram-negative bacteria all require a TonB-dependent high affinity outer membrane receptor to facilitate transport across the outer membrane (4Postle K. Kadner R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 869-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The transport of heme across the outer membrane is driven by coupling the cytoplasmic membrane potential via the TonB-ExbBD complex to the receptor. Following transport across the outer membrane, a periplasmic-binding protein shuttles the heme to the cytoplasmic ATPase/permease, where the heme is internalized and further utilized (5Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Koster W. Front Biosci. 2005; 10: 462-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Higgins C.F. Res.

In Shigella dysenteriae, the sloughing off of intestinal epithelial cells and the excretion of the Shiga toxin, which causes apoptosis in intestinal cells leading to dysentery and hemolytic uremia, suggests that heme in the form hemoglobin may be a major source of iron (18Cherla R.P. Lee S.Y. Tesh V.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 228: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Sansonetti P.J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 3-14PubMed Google Scholar). The heme operon of S. dysenteriae, Shigella heme uptake (shu) encodes an outer membrane receptor (ShuA), a periplasmic heme-binding protein (ShuT), and the ATPase/permease genes (ShuU and -V) required for heme-uptake across the cytoplasmic membrane. The cytoplasmic heme-binding protein (ShuS) was recently characterized and shown to bind DNA as well as heme (20Wilks A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 387: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the protein may play a duel role in sequestering the prooxidant heme and protecting the cellular compartment from oxidative damage. More recently the shuS gene of S. dysenteriae was shown to be required for efficient heme utilization (21Wyckoff E.E. Lopreato G.F. Tipton K.A. Payne S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5658-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In keeping with its role in efficient heme utilization it has recently been shown that a homolog of ShuS from P. aeruginosa, PhuS, encoded within the phu (Pseudomonas heme utilization) operon is a heme-trafficking protein to the iron-regulated heme oxygenase (22Lansky I.B. Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Block D. Rodgers K.R. Ratliff M. Wilks A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13652-13662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although a heme oxygenase has not yet been identified in the S. dysenteriae genome, it is evident from genetic studies that the cytoplasmic heme-binding proteins are required for efficient heme utilization. Although there is a great deal of evidence for the direct utilization of hemeproteins by the outer membrane receptors of Gram-negative pathogens, much of it comes from in vivo studies (reviewed in Refs. 2Wandersman C. Delepelaire P. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar and 3Wandersman C. Stojiljkovic I. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Specifically, the hemeprotein preference of the ShuA receptor in vitro has not previously been determined. We herein report for the first time the purification and characterization of the ShuA receptor ShuA of S. dysenteriae. Furthermore we have determined the ligand specificity and oxidation state preference of the S. dysenteriae ShuA receptor. We further show that the conserved histidine residues His-86 and His-420 are critical for the initial binding and sequestration of heme by the ShuA receptor. Finally, we provide the first evidence that a full-length TonB protein forms a 1:1 complex with the ShuA receptor. Bacterial Strains—DNA manipulations were carried out in Escherichia coli strain DH 5α (F′, ara D (lac-proAB) rpsL φ80dlacZ DM15 hasd R17) and E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (B F- dcm ompT hsdS (rB- mB-) gal λ (DE3)) was utilized for the production of ShuA. E. coli strain M15(pREP4) (F-, nals, strs, rifs, his-, lac-, ara, gal, mtl, recA+, uvr+, lon+) was used for TonB production. Construction of the Expression Vectors pEShuA and pND43TonB—The shuA gene was PCR-amplified from plasmid pSHU9 (23Mills M. Payne S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first 27 amino acid residues corresponding to the signal peptide were not included in the final shuA gene construct (see Fig. 1A). The forward primer (ShuAF) was designed to include an MscI site preceding the codon for amino acid 28 of ShuA 5′-GGCCTGTGGCCATGGCTACTGAAACCATGACC-3′. In designing the reverse primer (ShuAR) 5′-CTGGCTCTCGAGCCATTGATAACTCACGAAAAT-3′ the stop codon in the shuA gene was removed to utilize a His6 tag preceding the XhoI site in the expression vector pET22b. The resulting construct thus encoded a protein in which the native S. dysenteriae signal peptide is replaced with the native N-terminal pelB signal sequence of E. coli to target secretion of the protein to the outer membrane. Additionally, the His6 tag at the C terminus allowed for rapid purification of the protein. The tonB expression plasmid, pND34, was kindly provided by Prof. Shelley Payne, University of Texas, Austin. The full-length tonB gene from S. dysenteriae was PCR-amplified and cloned into the expression vector pQE2 utilizing the BseRI and HindIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively, to generate pND34. Site-directed Mutagenesis of ShuA—Mutagenesis was carried out by PCR utilizing the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Strat-agene, La Jolla, CA). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing at the Biopolymer Facility, School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore. Expression and Purification of Wild-type, H86A, H420A, and H86A/H420A ShuA—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells freshly transformed with either wild-type or mutant pEShuA constructs were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB)-ampicillin (100 μg/ml) plates. A 300-ml Terrific Broth-carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) sub-culture from the freshly transformed cells was grown for 12 h at 37 °C. The subculture was then used to inoculate 1 liter Terrific Broth-carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) cultures. The cells were grown for 36 h at 25 °C and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman JA-10 rotor. The harvested cells were lysed in 100 ml of BugBuster® HT (Novagen) containing 4% (w/v) Triton X-100, 4% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, and one protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Diagnostic GmbH). The lysed cells were then subjected to one pass through a Thermo Spectronic French pressure cell at 1000 p.s.i., and further incubated at 25 °C for 30 min to ensure micelle formation. The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 1 h in a Beckman JA-20 rotor. The supernatant was retained, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 300 mm NaCl, 4% (w/v) Triton X-100, 4% (w/v) glycerol, and 10 mm benzamidine and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min to promote formation of detergent micelles. The resuspended pellet was again centrifuged, and the supernatants from both extractions were pooled and applied to an Ni-NTA-agarose column (3 × 3 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 2 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The column was then washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 400 mm imidazole, 30 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The fractions containing ShuA, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and applied to a S-300 Sephadex size-exclusion column (1 × 15 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 100 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled, and the protein was then concentrated over PBE 94 Polybuffer™ Exchanger (Amersham Biosciences) chromatofocusing column (1.5 × 3.5 cm) equilibrated with 0.025 m imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% w/v Triton X-100. ShuA was eluted from the column with Polybuffer™ 74 (Amersham Biosciences) at a pH of 5.4, which corresponded to the calculated pI. The fractions containing ShuA were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The protein was further purified and concentrated over a DEAE column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 30 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The purified protein eluted from the column in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 500 mm NaCl and 30 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 750 nm using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. N-terminal sequencing of the purified ShuA was carried out at the Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid Biotechnology Center, Beckman Center (Stanford, CA). Lipid Bicelle Formation—The purified ShuA protein was exchanged by successive dialysis into 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 30 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. An 80:20 ratio of lipids 1,2-dimyrstoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine to 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phophocholine was prepared in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 30 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Purified ShuA was added to achieve a final lipid to protein ratio of 500:1 (w/w). The lipid-protein solution was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The mixed bicelles were then dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 150 mm NaCl. The dialysis buffer was changed 3 times at 24-h intervals (24Fanucci G.E. Cadieux N. Kadner R.J. Cafiso D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11382-11387Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 25Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The protein-lipid bicelles were stored for 2 weeks at 4 °C under nitrogen or at -80 °C. Expression and Purification of TonB—E. coli M15(pREP4) cells were transformed with pND34 and grown on LB-ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) plates overnight. A 250-ml inoculum in LB-Amp/Kan was grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. The subculture was then used to inoculate 1-liter LB-Amp/Kan cultures. The cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6, and protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cultures were grown for an additional 4 h at 25 °C, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The harvested cells were lysed, and TonB was solubilized as previously described for ShuA (see above). The resulting supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (1 × 30 cm) previously equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. The TonB protein was eluted from the column with a gradient from 50 to 500 mm NaCl. The fractions containing TonB, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and applied to a S300 Sephadex size-exclusion column (1 × 15 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 100 mm NaCl. Ton B protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Secondary Structure as Measured by CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded for the wild-type and mutant ShuA proteins in octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside micelles and for the wild-type ShuA in 1,2-dimyrstoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine:1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phophocholine lipid bicelles. All samples were recorded at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter from 190 to 260 nm with 0.2-mm resolution and 1.0-cm bandwidth. The mean residue ellipticity (deg cm2 dmol-1) was calculated using CDPRO software supplied by the manufacturer. Heme Binding to ShuA—Heme binding was observed by difference (Δ absorbance) spectroscopy between 300 and 700 nm. Heme binding reactions were carried out in 1-ml reaction volumes containing 5 μm ShuA in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 30 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and 5 μm hemin. UV-visible absorbance spectra were recorded at 60-s intervals over a 30-min time period. The rate of heme association with ShuA was determined by measuring the ΔA437 as a function of time and fit to a first-order reaction. Heme stoichiometry was determined by using the pyridine hemochrome method (26Fuhrop J.H. Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metallopor-phyrins. 1975; (pp. , Elsevier, Amsterdam): 804-808Google Scholar). Heme concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 418.5, 526, and 555 nm following the addition of dithionite using the extinction coefficients of 170, 17.5, and 34.4 mm-1 cm-1. The protein concentration was calculated based on the empirically calculated extinction coefficient of 117.7 mm-1 cm-1 (ExPASy). Protein concentrations, calculated utilizing the empirically calculated extinction coefficient, were in close agreement with protein concentrations measured with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Attempts to calculate the extinction coefficient for the native protein by measuring the absorbance of the unfolded protein and the empirically calculated extinction coefficient were unsuccessful due to the tendency of the protein to remain insoluble on unfolding. Fluorescence quenching of tryptophan residues was also monitored to determine the heme stoichiometry of ShuA. The protein was excited at a wavelength of 295 nm, and the emission spectrum at 338 nm was recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50 luminescence spectrometer. Fluorescence emission spectra of ShuA (1 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) 30 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside were measured over a heme concentration range of 0.01 to 30 μm. Size-exclusion Chromatography of metHbdimer and metHbtetramer as Heme Substrates for ShuA—metHbdimer (α1β1) was produced by incubation of metHbtetramer (α1β1/α2β2) at 37 °C (27Hargrove M.S. Whitaker T. Olson J.S. Vali R.J. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17385-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of human hemoglobin at 25 °C and 37 °C was confirmed by fast-protein liquid chromatography on a Superdex S200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). Molecular mass markers were also run at both temperatures to generate a standard curve in the range of 669-17 kDa. At the higher temperature the methemoglobin substrate exists as the αβ-dimer, whereas at 25 °C the tetramer was the only species observed (data not shown). Size-exclusion Separation of the Wild-type and Mutant ShuA Proteins from Hemoglobin following Heme Transfer—The wild-type or His mutant proteins (10 μm) were incubated at 25 °C with 1 μm metHbtetramer for 20 min. ShuA was separated from metHbtetramer over a Sephadex S300 column (1 × 15 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 30 mm β-d-glucopyranoside. Fractions containing ShuA as determined by SDS-PAGE were analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy. The Soret maxima of the ShuA, and hemoglobin proteins were recorded prior too and following incubation and fast-protein liquid chromatography separation. The absorbance values following chromatography were corrected for any dilution factor. The transfer of heme from metHbtetramer to ShuA was determined by the relative change in absorption of the heme in both ShuA and hemoglobin. Kinetic Measurement of Heme Transfer from metHbtetramer, metHbdimer, or Myoglobin—The rate of heme transfer from metHbtetramer, metHbdimer, oxy-Hb, or metMb was measured by stopped-flow spectrometric methods on an Applied Photo-physics SX18MV instrument. MetHbtetramer, metHbdimer, or metMb (100 μm) were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 500 mm NaCl and 30 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The reduced deoxy-Hbtetramer was prepared in a Plas Labs anaerobic chamber by the addition of dithionite to the metHbtetramer solution. Excess reductant was removed over a Sephadex G-25 column, and the ferrous complex was then exposed to air to generate the oxy-Hb complex. Reactions were initiated with ShuA (10 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 500 mm NaCl and 30 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside in syringe A and metHbtetramer (0.25 μm), metHbdimer (0.5 μm), oxy-Hb (0.25 μm), or metMb (1 μm) in syringe B. Single wave-length absorbance changes at 413 nm versus time were recorded until no further change in the absorbance was noted. The data for metHb was collected at 25 °C (metHbtetramer) and 37 °C (metHbdimer) and fit using Pro-Kineticist software supplied by Applied Photophysics. In Vitro Cross-linking of ShuA and Hemoglobin—ShuA in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 30 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was incubated with an equimolar ratio of hemoglobin in a final reaction volume of 500 μl at a total protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The cross-linking agent 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) was added at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, and the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (28Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14720-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Samples were separated on a 4-15% Tris-HCl pre-cast gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-ShuA antibodies at 1:2000 dilution. Protein-Protein Interactions of the ShuA and TonB Proteins—The Histagged holo-ShuA, apo-ShuA, or H86A/H420A with TonB were mixed in 2:1 TonB:ShuA molar equivalents. ShuA (100 μg) in 50 μl of Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 30 mm octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was added to 100 μl of Ni-NTA resin previously equilibrated and incubated at 4 °C with end-over-end shaking for 20 min. The full-length purified TonB (300 μg) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 100 mm NaCl was added, and the mixture was incubated for a further 20 min. The resin-bound proteins were then washed (×5) in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 2 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. The resin-bound proteins were eluted (×2) in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 400 mm imidazole, 30 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Protein-protein interaction and complex formation were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluted fractions. The ShuA H86A/H420A mutant was utilized in experiments requiring apo-ShuA due to the inability to obtain the purified wild-type receptor free of heme. Control reactions were carried out with TonB alone to ensure that the protein is efficiently eluted under the wash conditions. Construction of the ShuA Structural Model—The model was predicted using the XM3 program developed at the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, BioCentrum, The Technical University of Denmark, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark (29Lund O. Nielsen M. Lundegaard C. Worning P. CASP5 Conference. 2002; A102Google Scholar). A large sequence data base consisting of all of the known structures in the NCBI PDP data base was iteratively searched to find a sequence template from proteins with known structure with an E value of <0.05. The method differs from the PDB-BLAST method in that a sequence profile is only made if a template is not readily found in the data base of known structures. Query and template sequences are subsequently aligned using a score based on profile-profile comparisons. Using this approach the template selected was the ferric-enterobactin receptor (FepA) structure (PDB entry 1UJW), which bears 22% identity to ShuA. The query was then aligned to the template using a local alignment algorithm with a maximum number of gaps set to 20, a first gap penalty of 11, and a gap elongation penalty of 1 (30Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7063) Google Scholar). The corresponding atoms derived from the alignment were extracted from the template file and used as a starting point for the homology modeling. Missing atoms were added using the segmod program (31Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 507-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) from the GeneMine package (Bioinformatics, UCLA). The structure was then refined using the encad program (32Levitt M. Hirschberg M. Sharon R. Dagget V. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 215-231Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar) also from the GeneMine package. Expression, Purification, and Characterization of the Wild-type, H86A, H420A, and H86A/H420A ShuA Proteins—Analysis of the full-length ShuA protein sequence with the SignalP program (ExPASy) identified a signal peptide cleavage site between amino acid residues 28 and 29 (Fig. 1A). This signal peptide was replaced with the E. coli N-terminal PelB signal peptide upon construction of the expression vector that allowed secretion of the protein to the outer membrane. Following solubilization and purification of the protein a single band of molecular mass 73 kDa was observed on SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1B, inset). N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein confirmed that the PelB signal peptide had been cleaved during cellular processing with the first five amino acids corresponding to Thr-Glu-Thr-Met-Thr. The UV-visible absorbance spectrum of the purified ShuA in octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside detergent micelles had a Soret maximum at 413 nm, presumably due to residual heme bound to the receptor (Fig. 1B). Reconstitution of the protein by titrating with heme and monitoring the decrease in tryptophan fluorescence at 338 nm as a function of heme concentration gave a stoichiometry of one heme molecule per ShuA monomer (data not shown). However, an accurate Kd could not be determined due to the inability to remove the residual heme from the receptor. The Soret maximum upon reconstitution of the protein with exogenously added heme shifted the Soret from 413 to 437 nm with visible bands at 542 nm and 566 nm (Fig. 2A). It was also noted that upon addition of a 1:1 molar ratio of heme to protein a complete shift of the Soret to 437 nm occurred over a 20-min time period (data not shown). As will be outlined below the substrate specificity and manner in which the heme is delivered to the receptor is critical, and “free” heme is not a physiologically relevant substrate. To determine if the shift in Soret was the result of structural perturbation on solubilization of the receptor into detergent micelles, the heme-ShuA complex was incorporated into mixed lipid bicelles to better mimic the outer membrane (33Fanucci G.E. Lee J.Y. Cafiso D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 13932-13933Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast to the heme-ShuA complex in detergent micelles, the spectrum of the reconstituted heme complex in lipid bicelles gave a broad Sore"

Consequently, there is a rapidly growing database of these short sequences from a wide variety of taxa. In this study, we have analyzed the correlation between the nucleotide content of the short DNA barcode sequences and the genomes from which they are derived. Our results show that such short sequences can yield important, and surprisingly accurate, information about the composition of the entire genome. In other words, for unsequenced genomes, the DNA barcodes can provide a quick preview of the whole genome composition."
https://openalex.org/W2051382711,"Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for some esophageal cancers, but the molecular mechanisms of radiosensitivity remain unknown. RUNX3, a novel tumor suppressor of gastric cancer, functions in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-dependent apoptosis. We obtained paired samples from 62 patients with advanced esophageal cancers diagnosed initially as T3 or T4 with image diagnosis; one sample was obtained from a biopsy before presurgical radiotherapy, and the other was resected in surgical specimens after radiotherapy. RUNX3 was repressed in 67.7% cases of the pretreatment biopsy samples and 96.7% cases of the irradiated, resected samples. The nuclear expression of RUNX3 was associated with radiosensitivity and a better prognosis than cytoplasmic or no RUNX3 expression (P<0.003); cytoplasmic RUNX3 expression was strictly associated with radioresistance. RUNX3 was downregulated and its promoter was hypermethylated in all radioresistant esophageal cancer cell lines examined. Stable transfection of esophageal cancer cells with RUNX3 slightly inhibited cell proliferation in vitro, enhanced the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of TGF-β and increased radiosensitivity in conjunction with Bim induction. In contrast, transfection of RUNX3-expressing cells with a RUNX3 antisense construct or a Bim-specific small interfering RNA induced radioresistance. Treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine restored RUNX3 expression, increased radiosensitivity and induced Bim in both control and radioresistant cells. These results suggest that RUNX3 silencing promotes radioresistance in esophageal cancers. Examination of RUNX3 expression in pretreatment specimens may predict radiosensitivity, and induction of RUNX3 expression may increase tumor radiosensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2040325440,"The heme-containing periplasmic nitrite reductase (cd1 NIR) is responsible for the production of nitric oxide (NO) in denitrifying bacterial species, among which are several animal and plant pathogens. Heme NIRs are homodimers, each subunit containing one covalently bound c-heme and one d1-heme. The reduction of nitrite to NO involves binding of nitrite to the reduced protein at the level of d1-heme, followed by dehydration of nitrite to yield NO and release of the latter. The crucial rate-limiting step in the catalytic mechanism is thought to be the release of NO from the d1-heme, which has been proposed, but never demonstrated experimentally, to occur when the iron is in the ferric form, given that the reduced NO-bound derivative was presumed to be very stable, as in other hemeproteins. We have measured for the first time the kinetics of NO binding and release from fully reduced cd1 NIR, using the enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its site-directed mutant H369A. Quite unexpectedly, we found that NO dissociation from the reduced d1-heme is very rapid, several orders of magnitude faster than that measured for b-type heme containing reduced hemeproteins. Because the rate of NO dissociation from reduced cd1 NIR, measured in the present report, is faster than or comparable with the turnover number, contrary to expectations this event may well be on the catalytic cycle and not necessarily rate-limiting. This finding also provides a rationale for the presence in cd1 NIR of the peculiar d1-heme cofactor, which has probably evolved to ensure fast product dissociation.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a facultative anaerobe, can use denitrification as the anaerobic energy-producing pathway (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar). This microorganism is an opportunistic pathogen, and it has been shown that, in the host, the denitrification pathway not only works as a source of electrons (2Hassett D.J. Cuppoletti J. Trapnell B. Lymar S.V. Rowe J.J. Yoon S.S. Hilliard G.M. Parvatiyar K. Kamani M.C. Wozniak D.J. Hwang S.H. McDermott T.R. Ochsner U.A. Adv. Drug. Deliv.

Hayashi M. Kuroi A. Ishii M. Igarashi Y. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3960-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). More recently, low concentrations of NO have also been shown to control the lifestyle of P. aeruginosa by inducing dispersal of the multicellular assemblies (biofilms) strictly related to chronic pulmonary infections (4Barraud N. Hassett D.J. Hwang S.H. Rice S.A. Kjelleberg S. Webb J.S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7344-7353Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Therefore, pathogenesis, NO metabolism, and denitrification are strictly related. The conversion of nitrite (NO-2) to nitric oxide (NO) is catalyzed in denitrifying bacteria by the periplasmic nitrite reductases (NIR), which are either copper- or heme-containing enzymes (5Rinaldo S. Cutruzzolà F. Bothe H. Ferguson S.J. Newton W.E. Biology of the Nitrogen Cycle. 2007: 37-55Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa NIR belongs to the latter type, being a homodimer of two 60-kDa subunits, each containing one covalently bound c-heme and one d1-heme. Extensive spectroscopic and functional studies have been carried out on cd1 NIRs (5Rinaldo S. Cutruzzolà F. Bothe H. Ferguson S.J. Newton W.E. Biology of the Nitrogen Cycle. 2007: 37-55Google Scholar, 6Cutruzzolà F. Rinaldo S. Centola F. Brunori M. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); the c-heme domain is the entry site of the electrons, whereas catalysis occurs at the level of the d1-heme. The established physiological role of these enzymes is to catalyze the one-electron reduction of NO-2 to NO. The reaction cycle involves binding of nitrite to the reduced protein at the level of the d1-heme, followed by dehydration of nitrite to yield NO and release of the product (7Silvestrini M.C.

The rate-limiting step in the catalytic mechanism is thought to be the release of NO from the d1-heme; the current working hypothesis postulates that release of NO is likely to occur when the d1-heme iron atom is in the oxidized state, because the reduced NO-bound derivative of other hemeproteins is generally known to be very stable (10Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). According to this interpretation in the literature, the fully reduced NO-bound state of the protein has been always considered a “dead-end” inhibited state of cd1 NIRs (7Silvestrini M.C. Tordi M.G. Musci G. Brunori M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11783-11787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8George S.J. Allen J.W. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N. J. Biol.

A puzzling observation concerning this hypothesis is that rapid kinetic studies failed to show kinetically competent NO dissociation from the oxidized d1-heme, even at low reductive pressure (8George S.J.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11208-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) has shown that in a site-directed mutant in which the protein has the c-heme oxidized and the d1-heme reduced, reduction of nitrite can occur but the NO produced is unable to dissociate; thereby, the final species is the fully oxidized NO-bound enzyme. We have measured for the first time the kinetics of NO binding to and release from the fully reduced state of cd1 NIR, using the enzyme from P. aeruginosa and its site-directed mutant H369A. We observe that the dissociation rate constant of NO from reduced d1-heme (koff ∼ 6–35 s–1) is much more rapid than previously assumed on the basis of extensive information available on b-type heme-containing ferrous proteins. This totally unexpected result allows us to re-discuss the reaction mechanism of nitrite reduction catalyzed by cd1 NIRs. Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—Wild type cd1 NIR was purified following Parr et al. (13Parr S.R. Barber D. Greenwood C. Phillips B.W. Melling J. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of His-369 to Ala and purification of the mutant were already described in Ref. (9Cutruzzolà F. Brown K. Wilson E.K. Bellelli A. Arese M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the Pseudomonas putida expression system, the H369A protein is synthesized with the c-heme, but no d1-heme; this semi-apo-NIR is then reconstituted in vitro with the d1-heme extracted from wild type cd1 NIR (14Silvestrini M.C. Cutruzzolà F. D'Alessandro R. Brunori M. Fochesato N. Zennaro E. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reconstitution was carried out by incubating the protein at 15 °C in 50 mm Bis-Tris buffer at pH 7.0 with a 1.5 stoichiometric excess of d1-heme, followed by gel filtration. The extinction coefficient used in this report for the oxidized cd1 NIR was ɛ412 nm = 141 mm–1 cm–1 (15Silvestrini M.C. Colosimo A. Brunori M. Walsh T.A. Barber D. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This corresponds to the concentration of the monomer and thus of the d1-heme active sites. Amperometric NO Measurements—The NO production was measured anaerobically with a NO-sensitive Clark-type electrode (World Precision Instruments) at 20 °C in 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.2 and 7.0, or 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6 and 8.0. The electrode was calibrated at each pH by addition of 1 μl of a NO stock solution prepared by equilibrating degassed buffer with a tonometer containing 1 atm NO (Air Liquide, Paris, France) ([NO] in solution = 2 mm at 20 °C). The cd1 NIR (1 nm) was incubated in the reaction chamber with 10 mm sodium ascorbate and 0.1 mm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (Sigma-Aldrich) as electron donors, and the nitrite reductase activity was recorded after addition of sodium nitrite (0.3 mm; Sigma-Aldrich). The deoxy myoglobin (Mb, from horse; Sigma-Aldrich) solution was prepared as follows. A ferric Mb solution was reduced by addition of solid sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), and the excess of reductant was removed by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephadex G25 column (GE Healthcare). The resulting oxyMb derivative was incubated in degassed 50 mm Bis-Tris buffer, pH 7.0, in the presence of 5 mm sodium ascorbate and 0.13 mg/ml of ascorbate oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the oxygen ligand. The protein was added in the electrode chamber at the final concentration of 1.5 μm (ɛ560 nm = 13.8 mm–1 cm–1) (16Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers of Biology. 21. 1971: 19Google Scholar). Laser Photolysis Measurements—A 10-μm protein solution in 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, at room temperature (both for the wild type and H369A cd1 NIR) was reduced anaerobically with 5 mm sodium ascorbate in a fully filled cuvette (1-cm path length) for fluorescence assays. Different amounts (30–90 μm) of a NO solution were added anaerobically to produce the reduced NO-bound derivative. The instrument used for photolysis experiments has been described elsewhere (17Arcovito A. Gianni S. Brunori M. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Bellelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41073-41078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and uses a Nd-YAG solid-state laser with a 5-ns pulse (Quanta System HIL 101, second harmonic λ = 532 nm, E = 80 mJ/pulse) that was focused onto the filled cuvette containing the desired solution. The experimental data thus collected are time courses at single wavelength; they are converted to absorbances by means of the IGORPRO package (Wavemetrics). Single wavelength time courses are fitted as a single exponential using the nonlinear least squares routines provided by the IGORPRO package (Wavemetrics). The observed recombination rate constants were plotted as a function of the final NO concentration to extrapolate the second order rate constant; all the data were corrected for the dilution of the sample upon each NO addition. Stopped-flow Measurements—All the stopped-flow experiments described in this work were carried out anaerobically. The concentration of the samples in the different experiments is always given “before mixing”; a 1:1 dilution was always used in the symmetric mixing apparatus. All the experiments were performed with an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow apparatus (DX.17MV; Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). To calculate the rate of NO dissociation a monochromatic light source was used in the single wavelength acquisition mode; the use of the diode array acquisition mode was limited because photodissociation of NO is known to affect the rate, which is ∼2–4 times faster with this setup. The analysis of the kinetics was carried out with the IgorPro program (Wavemetrics). The reduced cd1 NIR was prepared anaerobically by adding 5 mm sodium ascorbate to the oxidized protein in degassed buffer (either 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.2, pH 7.0, or 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) at 20 °C. The reduced NO-bound derivative was obtained after addition of a stoichiometric amount of either NO or NO-2 to the reduced protein. All spectra were recorded in a JASCO V550 spectrophotometer. The reduced NO-bound wild type cd1 NIR (8–18 μm) (cd1 NIR-NO) was rapidly mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with a solution of human deoxy hemoglobin (deoxyHb) at different concentrations (18–80 μm in heme, calculated using ɛ555 nm = 12.5 mm–1 cm–1) (16Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers of Biology. 21. 1971: 19Google Scholar) in 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7, at 20 °C. Under these conditions the following reaction occurs. cd1 NIR-NO + deoxyHb → cd1 NIR+ Hb-NO REACTION 1 The kinetics is rate-limited by NO dissociation from cd1 NIR. The deoxyHb was prepared by degassing a solution of oxy-hemoglobin in the presence of 5 mm sodium ascorbate and 20 μl of a 13-mg/ml solution of ascorbate oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich). To determine the pH dependence of the NO dissociation rate, the same experiment was carried out also at pH 6.2 (in 50 mm Bis-Tris buffer) and pH 8.0 (in 50 mm Tris buffer) by mixing a 15-μm solution of reduced NO wild type cd1 NIR with an 80-μm (in heme) solution of deoxyHb. The NO dissociation rate constant from the reduced NO-bound H369A NIR was determined at p 7.0 and 20 °C by mixing a 20-μm solution of the sample with a 64-μm (in heme) solution of deoxyHb in the stopped-flow apparatus, as reported for the wild type protein. To further investigate the dissociation rate constant of NO bound to the reduced d1-heme, the experiment with deoxyHb was also carried out for both the reduced wild type and H369A proteins (8 μm, pH 7.0, 20 °C) starting from the NO derivative prepared incubating anaerobically the reduced protein with a stoichiometric amount of sodium nitrite (Sigma-Aldrich). Each sample was mixed in the stopped-flow apparatus with a 40-μm (in heme) solution of deoxyHb. To determine the dissociation rate of NO from the reduced d1-heme, the reduced NO-bound wild type cd1 NIR (10.4 μm) was also rapidly mixed with a 5–20-mm potassium cyanide solution, and the formation of the reduced cyanide-bound derivative was followed at different wavelengths. Under these conditions, cyanide displaces NO by binding to the reduced d1-heme; the kinetics is rate-limited by NO dissociation. As a reference, the fully reduced NO-bound protein (5.2 mm) was also incubated anaerobically with 20 mm cyanide, and the spectrum was collected in a JASCO V550 spectrophotometer. Production of NO under Steady-state Conditions—The release of NO from P. aeruginosa cd1 NIR under steady-state conditions can be measured directly using a NO-sensitive electrode. Fig. 1A shows the traces recorded at pH 6.2 and pH 7; the NO produced by the enzyme is rapidly scavenged if deoxymyoglobin is added to the reaction mixture, as expected. The release of NO is clearly pH-dependent, as previously suggested, with a turnover number of 11.2 (±1.2) s–1 at pH 6.2 and 1.9 (±0.05) s–1 at pH 8.0, in good agreement with literature data (15Silvestrini M.C. Colosimo A. Brunori M. Walsh T.A. Barber D. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Cutruzzolà F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Preincubation (at pH 7.0) of the reaction mixture containing the reductants and nanomolar cd1 NIR with micromolar NO before the addition of nitrite does not significantly inhibit the rate of production of NO (Fig. 1B, inset). This suggests that, in the presence of substrate, even a large excess of free NO is unable to inactivate the enzyme. The NO Association Rate Constant—The NO association rate constant was measured by laser flash photolysis at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2). Time courses were followed at 460 nm with different ligand concentrations. The traces could be always fitted well with a single-exponential expression (Fig. 2, inset). The small absorbance change observed in the experiment is partly due to the laser setup, which enables us to obtain a very limited photolysis with NO. In the case of cd1 NIR we cannot exclude that there may be a geminate effect, but it is also certain that the small amplitude observed is largely due to the lack of quanta. Because it is known that at pH 7.0 some NO may bind to the ferrous c-heme of cd1 NIR (15Silvestrini M.C. Colosimo A. Brunori M. Walsh T.A. Barber D. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the kinetics was also monitored at 630 nm (where no spectral contribution of the c-heme is present) and at pH 8.0 (where NO binding to the c-heme does not occur) (15Silvestrini M.C. Colosimo A. Brunori M. Walsh T.A. Barber D. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (data not shown). No difference was observed in the kinetics, suggesting that the association rate measured reflects NO binding to the reduced d1-heme only. The second-order association rate constant (kon), obtained from the linear dependence of the observed rate constant (kobs) on ligand concentration (Fig. 2), is 3.9 × 108 m–1 s–1 (Table 1) at pH 7.0. No significant pH dependence was observed between pH 6.2 and 8 (not shown).TABLE 1Comparison of the kinetic parameters for NO binding and dissociation to reduced cd1 NIRs (determined in this work) and those of selected ferrous hemeproteinsProteinpHkonkoffMethodRef.m-1 s-1s-1Wild type6.2k1 = 31.0 ± 2.5HumanThis workc2+d2+NOk2 = 3.7 ± 0.6deoxyHb7.03.9(±0.3) × 108k1 = 27.5 ± 1.5HumanThis workk2 = 3.8 ± 0.4deoxyHb7.0aThe reduced NO-bound cd1 NIR was obtained by addition of a stoichiometric amount of sodium nitrite to the fully reduced protein.k1 = 31.7 ± 2.0HumanThis workk2 = 3.5 ± 0.5deoxyHb7.0k1 = 43.5 ± 3.5KCNThis workk2 = 8 ± 18.0k1 = 17.7 ± 2.5HumanThis workk2 = 2.2 ± 0.5deoxyHbH369A7.01.9(±0.2) × 108k1 = 16.8 ± 1.5HumanThis workc2+d2+NOk2 = 2.3 ± 0.4deoxyHb7.0aThe reduced NO-bound cd1 NIR was obtained by addition of a stoichiometric amount of sodium nitrite to the fully reduced protein.k1 = 19.0 ± 2.0HumanThis workk2 = 3.8 ± 0.5deoxyHbMb (sw)7.01.7 × 10710-4Dithionite+ CO19Moore E.G.

Open table in a new tab The NO Dissociation Rate Constant—The dissociation of NO from the fully reduced NO-bound derivative of hemeproteins is usually very slow (10–3-10–5 s–1); the classical approach used to determine this value involves dilution of the reduced NO-bound hemeprotein into a solution containing a large excess of a NO scavenger, usually sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) or hemoglobin, and eventually a high affinity ligand such as carbon monoxide (CO). The reaction is followed spectrophotometrically over a long time range (hours), monitoring the appearance of the reduced CO-bound form; under these conditions the observed kinetics is rate-limited by NO dissociation (19Moore E.G. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2788-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of cd1 NIR, however, the CO association rate for the reduced d1-heme is fairly slow (2 × 104 m–1 s–1) (20Parr S.R. Wilson M.T. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Wilson E.K. Bellelli A. Liberti S. Arese M. Grasso S. Cutruzzolà F. Brunori M. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7556-7564Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as compared with other hemeproteins (0.5–5 × 106 m–1 s–1) (16Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers of Biology. 21. 1971: 19Google Scholar, 22Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. Chem. Rev. 1994; 94: 699-714Crossref Scopus (728) Google Scholar) and the amount of CO to compete effectively with NO is not achievable. Moreover, the products of dithionite oxidation are known to bind the reduced d1-heme (23Parr S.R. Wilson M.T. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which would further complicate analysis of the results. Thus, in the case of cd1 NIR the dithionite-CO method cannot be used to determine unequivocally the NO dissociation rates. The alternative approach to measure NO dissociation rate constant is based on the high affinity of deoxyHb for NO (Kd ∼ 10–11 m) (19Moore E.G. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2788-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); using an excess deoxyHb, the NO released by cd1 NIR is rapidly and effectively scavenged by Hb (see Reaction 1 under “Experimental Procedures”). Upon mixing reduced NO-bound cd1 NIR with an excess deoxyHb in the stopped-flow (diode array), analysis of the spectra shows that a reaction has already occurred after 10 s (Fig. 3). The increase in absorbance at 460 nm, where the contribution of Hb is minimal, can only be interpreted with the formation of the reduced ligand-free cd1 NIR. The NO dissociation was then time-resolved upon mixing reduced NO-bound cd1 NIR and excess deoxyHb in the stopped-flow and following the kinetics at single wavelength. Fig. 4 shows the time course at 460 nm recorded at three different pH values (6.2, 7.0, 8.0, panels A, B, and C, respectively). The observed kinetic amplitude corresponds to the expected absorbance change going from the reduced NO-bound to the reduced cd1 NIR (see also Fig. 3, inset). All traces can be fitted with a double-exponential expression, yielding the values of k1 and k2 listed in Table 1. The contribution of each exponential process was found to be ∼50% of the total change in signal amplitude. The NO dissociation rate was found to be essentially independent of deoxyHb concentration in the range explored (1–4 molar excess of Hb with respect to cd1 NIR), which is consistent with the model assuming that NO dissociation is rate-limiting. A small (2-fold) decrease in the value for the two rate constants has been observed at pH 8.0 (see Table 1). At pH 7.0 the two dissociation rate constants were determined to be ∼27.5 s–1 and 3.8 s–1. Very similar rates were obtained when the reduced NO-bound enzyme was prepared by addition of stoichiometric nitrite (Fig. 4D), indicating that the species from which NO is dissociating rapidly is the same in both cases. Because this NO dissociation rate is much more rapid than values reported in the literature for many other ferrous NO-bound hemeproteins, we have confirmed this unexpected result by an independent experiment. It was shown previously (24Barber D. Parr S.R. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Sun W. Arese M. Brunori M. Nurizzo D. Brown K. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Cutruzzolà F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that reduced cd1 NIR has an unusually high affinity for anionic ligands as cyanide (Kd = 9.5 μm), and we have attributed the majority of this effect to the conserved His-369 on the distal side of the d1-heme (25Sun W. Arese M. Brunori M. Nurizzo D. Brown K. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Cutruzzolà F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore we used cyanide in a displacement reaction, adding a concentrated KCN solution to reduced NO-bound cd1 NIR. The spectrum of the resulting mixture (containing 20 mm KCN) (Fig. 5A) shows that after ∼2 min the spectrum corresponds to that of the cyanide adduct, confirming that displacement of NO has already occurred. When the same experiment was repeated in the stopped-flow, the time course of formation of the cyanide derivative was easily followed (Fig. 5B), and the two rate constants are listed in Table 1. A small (2-fold) dependence of the measured NO dissociation rate constants upon cyanide concentration between 5–20 mm was observed (not shown). The values obtained using the cyanide displacement approach are in good agreement with those obtained from the deoxyHb experiments (see above and Table 1), confirming that fast NO dissociation occurs independently from the method used to monitor the reaction. NO Association and Dissociation Rate Constants for the H369A Mutant—The site-directed mutant H369A was previously shown to be unable to catalyze effectively nitrite reduction to NO (9Cutruzzolà F. Brown K. Wilson E.K. Bellelli A. Arese M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and to bind anions with extremely low affinity (9Cutruzzolà F. Brown K. Wilson E.K. Bellelli A. Arese M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Sun W. Arese M. Brunori M. Nurizzo D. Brown K. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Cutruzzolà F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To assess the role of the conserved distal His-369 residue in the reactivity with NO, we have measured both the association (Fig. 2, Table 1) and dissociation rate constants (Fig. 4, B and D, and Table 1). The results show that the conserved His-369 does not significantly affect the binding or the dissociation of NO from the ferrous d1-heme. This work provides much new insight into the mechanism of P. aeruginosa cd1 NIR by the unequivocal determination of the microscopic constants for NO binding to and release from the ferrous d1-heme-NO complex. The reduction of nitrite to NO by a heme-containing enzyme such as cd1 NIR poses a mechanistic problem because the product NO is known to bind with very high affinity to reduced hemes and thus must be quickly released in the bulk to avoid inhibition. Fig. 6 summarizes the current view of the catalytic cycle for the cd1 NIR. Upon mixing nitrite with the reduced enzyme (c2+ d12+), the formation of the initial complex (c2+ d13+ NO-2) is followed by production of NO involving bond breaking and loss of a water molecule; yet this is assumed to be reversible. The resulting mixed valence species (c2+ d13+NO) may enter pathway (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2909) Google Scholar) where dissociation of NO and further reduction to the starting fully reduced ligand-free NIR (c2+ d12+) occurs. This pathway, involving release of NO from the oxidized d1-heme, was proposed to be the most likely one to account for the enzyme turnover (8George S.J. Allen J.W. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Cutruzzolà F. Brown K. Wilson E.K. Bellelli A. Arese M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brunori M. Proc.

The primary observation of the present work is that NO dissociates very rapidly from the ferrous d1-heme, an unexpected and surprising result. The measured rate constants are 104–106-fold greater than those measured for any NO complex of ferrous b-type heme-containing proteins reported in the literature (10Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Moore E.G. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol.

Med. 2005; 39: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and Table 1). The kinetics of NO release from the fully reduced NO-bound wild type cd1 NIR is biphasic with values of 35 and 6 s–1 at pH 7.0 (average from values listed in Table 1). Although the biphasicity is not understood at present, it might be related to the dimeric structure of the enzyme, which has been previously shown to display cooperative behavior with some ligands, such as CO (20Parr S.R. Wilson M.T. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and cyanide (24Barber D. Parr S.R. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An intrinsic functional asymmetry of the enzyme is also evident in the reaction with macromolecular electron donors (such as azurin and cytochrome c551) (27Parr S.R. Barber D. Greenwood C. Brunori M. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Silvestrini M.C. Tordi M.G. Colosimo A. Antonini E. Brunori M. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and in the intramolecular electron transfer step (29Blatt Y. Pecht I. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2917-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The fast rates of NO dissociation were also observed starting from the NO complex obtained by allowing the enzyme to carry out one catalytic cycle by adding stoichiometric nitrite to the reduced protein (see Fig. 4D). This suggests that the species that dissociates NO rapidly is identical to the fully reduced NO-bound derivative obtained by direct binding of gaseous NO to ferrous cd1 NIR (Fig. 3, inset). The nitrite reductase activity of cd1 NIRs was shown by us and other groups to yield NO as the reaction product, with turnover numbers ranging from 2 to 10 s–1 (depending on the conditions used in the assay) (18Cutruzzolà F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 231-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Richter C.D. Allen J.W. Higham C.W. Koppenhofer A. Zajicek R.S. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3093-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Preincubation of nanomolar cd1 NIR with micromolar NO before the addition of nitrite does not significantly inhibit the production of NO from the enzyme (Fig. 1B, inset). This result clearly indicates that, in the presence of the substrate, a large excess of free NO is unable to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme. These results cast some doubt on the belief that the fully reduced NO-bound derivative (c2+ d12+NO) can be considered a dead-end species, unable to dissociate NO. Indeed, present results demonstrate that NO dissociation from the reduced d1-heme occurs much more rapidly than expected, suggesting that this species may likely be a genuine catalytic intermediate (Fig. 6, pathway 2). We thus propose that the fully reduced enzyme (c2+ d12+) may also originate along pathway 2. Given that the rate constant for dissociation of NO from reduced cd1 NIR measured in the present report is somewhat faster than the turnover number, this event may well be on-pathway and not necessarily rate-limiting. It must be mentioned that at present we have no information on the rate of NO dissociation from the c3+d12+ NO mixed valence species (see Fig. 6), which is unstable and difficult to populate. At this stage we cannot exclude that fast NO dissociation can also occur from this mixed valence species, before re-reduction of the c-heme moiety. However, the finding that NO release from the reduced d1-heme occurs at a rate that is much faster than that of ferrous b-type heme-containing proteins stands out as a novelty. Previous pre-steady-state studies failed to demonstrate that the oxidized d1-heme NO complex is able to spontaneously dissociate NO (8George S.J. Allen J.W. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); reduction of the enzyme by an external electron donor was already pointed out to be crucial to have product dissociation, because it is possible to observe steady-state turnover under conditions in which a large excess of reducing equivalents is available (9Cutruzzolà F. Brown K. Wilson E.K. Bellelli A. Arese M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Silvestrini M.C.

Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3093-3100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The present rapid kinetics study is thus fully consistent with the idea that, under high reductive pressure, rapid NO dissociation may indeed occur. The value of the association rate constant (3.9 × 108 m–1 s–1) measured for the P. aeruginosa cd1 NIR lies in the range of values measured for other hemeproteins, which are ∼107-108 m–1 s–1 (10Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 31Cassoly R. Gibson Q.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of NO to the reduced d1-heme occurs rapidly; this is consistent with an unhindered d1-heme site, which is known to be high spin-pentacoordinated (32Walsh T.A. Johnson M.K. Greenwood C. Barber D. Springall J.P. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taking into account the values for the association and dissociation rate constants (Table 1) the affinity of P. aeruginosa cd1 NIR for NO can be evaluated to be in the range Kd = 10–7-10–8 m. Most reduced hemeproteins display a much higher affinity, usually ∼10–11 m; the difference with cd1 NIR is entirely due to the faster NO dissociation characteristic of the latter enzyme. The other relevant outcome of this study is the observation that in the H369A mutant the dissociation rate for NO is essentially the same as for the wild type protein (only 2 times slower). We have previously shown that in this mutant the nitrite reductase activity is severely reduced (turnover number 0.08 s–1, pH 6.2) (9Cutruzzolà F. Brown K. Wilson E.K. Bellelli A. Arese M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because the mutant protein binds anions with a significantly lower affinity (25Sun W. Arese M. Brunori M. Nurizzo D. Brown K. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Cutruzzolà F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but is able to dissociate NO equally well (this work), the major role of His-369 in P. aeruginosa cd1 NIR must be in controlling the binding of the anionic substrate NO-2. The unexpected finding reported here may also provide a rationale for the (to-date) puzzling presence in cd1 NIR of the peculiar d1-heme, unique to this class of enzymes. The d1-heme is a 3,8-dioxo-17-acrylate-porphyrindione; the presence of the electronegative oxo groups confers to the macrocycle distinct redox properties, rendering it harder to oxidize than the corresponding isobacteriochlorines (33Barkigia K.M. Chang C.K. Fajer J. Renner M.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1701-1707Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The d1-heme structure might be a prerequisite for the fast rate of NO dissociation from the ferrous form, a property that cannot be achieved with a standard b-type heme. Interestingly, other heme groups belonging to different hemeproteins, such as the heme d of cytochrome bd from Escherichia coli, have been recently shown to dissociate NO more rapidly (0.133 s–1) than b-type-containing hemeproteins (34Borisov V.B. Forte E. Sarti P. Brunori M. Konstantinov A.A. Giuffrè A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 355: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the latter case it has been suggested that expression of bd-type oxidases, instead of heme copper ones, would promote pathogenicity of the microorganism by enhancing bacterial tolerance to nitrosative stress. Thus, the chemical structure of the heme controls the rate of NO dissociation even in proteins whose physiological role is not to produce NO; the need for cd1 NIR to have this peculiar cofactor can be now fully appreciated. In summary, we have shown that P. aeruginosa cd1 NIR quickly dissociates NO from the ferrous d1-heme iron. We have examined product formation under different experimental conditions and propose an alternative yet plausible mechanism of the catalytic cycle in which the fully reduced NO-bound derivative can be viewed as a genuine on-pathway intermediate.

In this study, we show that calreticulin induces fibronectin gene expression and matrix deposition, leading to differences in cell spreading and focal adhesion formation in cells differentially expressing calreticulin. We further show that these effects of calreticulin occur via a c-Src-regulated pathway and that c-Src activity is inversely related to calreticulin abundance. Since c-Src is an important regulator of focal contact turnover, we investigated the effect of c-Src inhibition on cells differentially expressing calreticulin. Inhibition of c-Src rescued the poorly adhesive phenotype of the calreticulin-underexpressing cells in that they became well spread, commenced formation of numerous focal contacts, and deposited a rich fibronectin matrix. Importantly, we show that c-Src activity is dependent on releasable Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, thus implicating Ca2+-sensitive pathways that are affected by calreticulin in cell-substratum adhesion. We propose that calreticulin affects fibronectin synthesis and matrix assembly via the regulation of fibronectin gene expression. In parallel, calcium-dependent effects of calreticulin on c-Src activity influence the formation and/or stability of focal contacts, which are instrumental in matrix assembly and remodeling.

It is an important chaperone, working in conjunction with calnexin and protein disulfide isomerase; it affects intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis via its Ca2+ storage capacity and its effects on both the SERCA pumps and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (2.John L.M.

Calreticulin has been shown to affect cell adhesion via the induction of vinculin and N-cadherin expression and its involvement in β-catenin-associated pathways (4.Opas M. Szewczenko-Pawlikowski M.

Fibronectin is a large glycoprotein which is secreted by the cell into the extracellular matrix (ECM) as a soluble dimer that, via cellular interactions, is deposited as a fibrillar meshwork that is bound to the surface of cells. Fibronectin affects the formation and the stability of cell-substratum adhesions, and conversely, cell-substratum adhesions may affect fibronectin matrix deposition (7.Katz B.Z. Zamir E. Bershadsky A. Kam Z. Yamada K.M. Geiger B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1047-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 8.Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Fibronectin assembly cannot proceed without the presence of cells (9.McDonald J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 183-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which implies intracellular inside-out signaling pathways that are crucial for fibronectin fibrillogenesis (10.Wierzbicka-Patynowski I. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3269-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Fibronectin matrices are essential for embryonic development, wound healing, and tumorigenesis (11.Wu C. Bauers R.L. Juliano R.L. McDonnell J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as such are both spatially and temporally regulated (11.Wu C. Bauers R.L. Juliano R.L. McDonnell J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is crucial to discern the mechanisms by which a fibronectin matrix is deposited and regulated. Fibronectin is bound to and regulated by cells at specific sites of cell-substratum adhesions that serve to link the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton via transmembrane integrin heterodimers (12.Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Forces due to integrin binding to ECM ligands cause the bundling of the actin cytoskeleton into tension-generating stress fibers. This tension also causes the clustering of integrins and associated cytoskeletal proteins, such as vinculin, paxillin, talin, c-Src, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), into strong cell substratum adhesions termed focal contacts (or focal adhesions) (8.Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar, 12.Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). FAK plays a central role in cell-matrix adhesion and is also a substrate for Src (15.Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ezzel et al. (16.Ezzell R.M. Goldmann W.H. Wang N. Parasharama N. Ingber D.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) have shown that the ability of cells to spread out on a substratum correlates directly with the efficacy with which vinculin is coupled to focal contacts. Thus, calreticulin-overexpressing cells, which possess the greatest amount of vinculin, are well spread on the substratum, whereas the calreticulin underexpressers with the least amount of vinculin are poorly spread (4.Opas M. Szewczenko-Pawlikowski M. Jass G.K. Mesaeli N. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1913-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation has also been shown to regulate cell-substratum adhesion (17.Zhang Z. Izaguirre G. Lin S.Y. Lee H.Y. Schaefer E. Haimovich B. Mol. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 866-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of protein tyrosine kinases, particularly c-Src, in the regulation of cell-substratum adhesion in cells differentially expressing calreticulin. c-Src is an important regulatory molecule of focal contacts and belongs to a family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases, including the ubiquitous kinases Yes and Fyn (21.Brickell P.M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1991; 72: 97-108PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To determine how calreticulin, a Ca2+-binding ER-resident protein, influences cell spreading, fibronectin matrix deposition, and cell-substratum adhesion, we examined the activity of c-Src in cells differentially expressing calreticulin on both uncoated and fibronectin-coated surfaces. This study presents novel findings on the role of calreticulin in fibronectin matrix deposition and the regulation of c-Src activity via its influence on releasable Ca2+ from the ER. Cell Culture−Mouse L fibroblasts differing in calreticulin expression used for this study have been extensively characterized and described elsewhere (4.Opas M. Szewczenko-Pawlikowski M. Jass G.K.

Sense and antisense cDNA were used to generate stable cell lines either over- or underexpressing calreticulin, respectively (23.Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Calreticulin-overexpressing cells displayed approximately twice as much calreticulin as control L fibroblasts, as determined by Western blot analysis. Calreticulin-underexpressing cells displayed approximately half as much calreticulin as control L fibroblasts. L fibroblasts were maintained in antibiotic free, high glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml Geneticin. RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting−RNA extraction and Northern blotting were performed as described previously (23.Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The blots were normalized by probing with human glyceraldehde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. Western Blotting−Protein samples from cellular lysates (40,000 cells/lane and 2 μg/lane for molecular weight markers) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (24.Mery L.

All horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:10,000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Isolation of the ECM fractions and identification of fibronectin in the ECM was carried out as previously described (28.Kornblihtt A.R. Pesce C.G. Alonso C.R. Cramer P. Srebrow A. Werbajh S. Muro A.F. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ECM was isolated by sequential washes with 1) PBS; 2) 3% Triton X-100 in PBS; 3) 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 m NaCl; 4) 2% deoxycholate in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 10 mm EDTA. All washes were carried out at room temperature for 3 min in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The material remaining after the washes was considered to be ECM and was scraped in 1% SDS and boiled for 5 min prior to loading. Sample Preparation for Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)−Aliquots of conditioned media were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized using Bio-Rad silver stain. For protein identification by MALDI-TOF MS, the band of interest was excised from the gel and placed in 1% acetic acid. Gel fragments were then washed with water, incubated in acetonitrile for 15 min at room temperature, and reduced in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 50 °C. After a second acetonitrile wash, the gel fragments were alkylated with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 55 mm iodoacetamide for 20 min at room temperature in the dark and washed in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. After a final acetonitrile wash, the gel fragments were dried by SpeedVac for 1 min. For trypsin digestion, the gel fragments were rehydrated in digestion buffer (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 5 mm CaCl2, and 12.5 ng/μl sequencing grade trypsin) (Promega) for 45 min on ice, and then incubated overnight at 37 °C. To extract tryptic fragments, after brief centrifugation, the liquid fraction was transferred to a fresh tube containing 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min at 37 °C. After a second extraction, the liquids were pooled and purified by repeated passage through a ZipTipC18 (Millipore). The sample was eluted with 65% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS by the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of Toronto. Protein identification was performed using the ProFound data mining software (available on the World Wide Web at prowl.rockefeller.edu). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting−Cells were trypsinized, rinsed with PBS, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After rinsing, the cells in suspension were incubated with anti-α5 or -β1 integrin primary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature under gentle agitation. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with secondary antibodies. The cells were rinsed with PBS, resuspended at equal densities, and analyzed using an EPICS Elite Cell Sorter (Beckman-Coulter). Fibronectin Patterned Substrata−Coverslips were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin from Sigma in PBS for 90 min at 37 °C and then rinsed in PBS. The coated surface was then scratched with a 1-ml pipette tip to remove fibronectin, creating areas of fibronectin carpet next to areas without. Immunolabeling and Microscopy−For immunolocalization, cells on coverslips were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After washing (three times for 5 min) in PBS, the cells were permeabilized for 2 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in buffer containing 100 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, and 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (pH 6.9) and then washed three times for 5 min in PBS and incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature at the following dilutions in PBS: anti-fibronectin, 1:50, anti-α5 integrins, 1:50, anti-vinculin, 1:20; Texas Red phalloidin, 1:10. After washing in PBS, the cells were stained with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (1:50 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. After the final wash, slides were mounted in Vinol 205S, which contained 0.25% 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane and 0.002% p-phenylenediamine or in Immuno Fluore (ICN Biochemicals). A Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal fluorescence microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser was used for fluorescence and phase-contrast microscopy. Tyrphostins, Radicicol, and Calcium Treatments−Before any treatments, equal numbers of cells were plated and grown overnight (12 h). Treatment times listed are those that follow this overnight attachment and growth. Cells were treated with 100 μm tyrphostin A1, A23, A25, or A63 for 24 h. The cells were then fixed and stained for immunofluorescence imaging as described above. For c-Src inhibition experiments, cells were treated with 5 μm radicicol (Sigma) overnight (12 h). The next day, cells were washed three times with PBS and replaced with fresh growth medium for 5 h. The cells were then collected either for Western blotting or fixed and stained for immunofluorescence imaging. Thapsigargin was used to reduce the concentration of Ca2+ in the ER. Cells were treated with 1 μm thapsigargin for 30 min at 37 °C and immediately collected for Western blotting of Src Tyr(P)418. For Western blotting of fibronectin and immunofluorescence of fibronectin deposition, cells were treated with 1 μm thapsigargin or 1 μm ionomycin for 2 h, followed by overnight growth in regular growth medium. Calcium Measurements−For measurements of intracellular Ca2+, cultured L cells, either in suspension or adherent to tissue culture dishes, were loaded with fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes) at a concentration of 3 μm, for 30 min at 37 °C. A Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope (Diaphot) optically interfaced to a dual wavelength excitation ratio fluorimeter (Photon Technology International) was used to estimate changes in intracellular [Ca2+], based on changes in fluorescence intensity at alternating 346/381 nm excitations. For bradykinin stimulation experiments, bradykinin (Sigma) was reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to fura-2-loaded cells at a concentration of 2 μm to stimulate calcium release from intracellular stores. For the experiments using L cells plated on fibronectin, fura-2-loaded cells were trypsinized and suspended in a buffer solution containing HEPES, NaCl, KCl, glucose, MgSO4, Na2HPO4, and CaCl2. Cells were then seeded onto 32-mm diameter coverslips that were precoated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma). Intracellular [Ca2+] was measured at 5, 15, and 30 min postplating. As a control, the experiment was performed with fura-2-loaded cells seeded onto untreated glass coverslips.

Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), were used in this study. Our previous studies showed that calreticulin influences the expression of vinculin, an intracellular component of focal contacts; thus, we examined here whether the extracellular face of focal contacts may also be affected by calreticulin. Our particular focus was on fibronectin, a major component of integrin-based cell substratum adhesions. Interestingly, we found that cells differentially expressing calreticulin differed in their ability to synthesize fibronectin. Using Northern blotting of total cellular lysates of L fibroblasts grown for 24 h, we found that calreticulin overexpressers had greater levels of fibronectin mRNA in comparison with either calreticulin underexpressers or control cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, calreticulin overexpressers contained the most intracellular fibronectin protein, whereas the underexpressers had the least amount and control cells were intermediate (Fig. 1B). The increased fibronectin protein in calreticulin overexpressing L fibroblasts was accompanied by an increase in the deposition of extracellular fibronectin into the matrix (Fig. 1B′). Next, we determined whether calreticulin’s effects were specific for fibronectin or if the secretion of other proteins was also affected. Conditioned media from the L fibroblast cell lines were collected at various time points and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were revealed by silver staining. Overall, there were no changes in the bulk outflow of proteins from cells differentially expressing calreticulin (Fig. 1, C and C′). However, there were differences in the secretion of a high molecular weight protein that migrated at the same mobility as fibronectin-positive controls, such that secretion was increased in calreticulin overexpressers and decreased in calreticulin underexpressers. Control cells secreted an intermediate amount of this protein (Fig. 1, C and C′). To identify this unknown protein, the indicated band (Fig. 1C, arrowhead) was excised from the gel and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The tryptic fingerprint was compared against a data base using the ProFound software. The first ranked retrieved protein from the list was fibronectin, with a molecular mass of 276.15 kDa. Of the 26 peptides measured, eight were found in the data base with sequence coverage of 5% (supplemental Table 1). Proteins from SDS-PAGE of conditioned media were also transferred to nitrocellulose before silver staining. Western blotting confirmed the identity of the secreted high molecular weight protein to be fibronectin (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results show that calreticulin-overexpressing L cells have increased fibronectin mRNA and protein and secrete more fibronectin, which leads to a greater accumulation of it in the matrix. Importantly, this trend is also seen in HEK293 cells containing the calreticulin gene driven by a doxycycline-sensitive promoter following calreticulin induction, as well as in mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines with normal calreticulin levels compared with calreticulin-null cells. 4S. Papp, M. P. Fadel, and M. Opas, unpublished data. In all cases, there is greater fibronectin expression in cells with greater calreticulin abundance. L Fibroblasts Overexpressing Calreticulin Assemble an Elaborate Fibronectin Matrix, whereas Calreticulin Underexpressers Exhibit Poor Fibronectin Deposition−We next examined if the relationship between the level of calreticulin expression and deposition of fibronectin into the ECM led to differential fibronectin matrix assembly. Using indirect immunofluorescence with anti-fibronectin antibodies on nonpermeabilized cells, we showed that crowded calreticulin overexpressers assembled an extensive, weblike fibronectin matrix after overnight growth in culture (Fig. 2). High magnification reveals extensive, thick fibronectin fibrils. Crowded L fibroblasts underexpressing calreticulin assembled a poor fibronectin matrix, which consisted of a loose arrangement of thin fibrils and patches. The fibronectin matrix assembled by control cells was intermediate between that of overexpressers and underexpressers (Fig. 2). Focal Contact Formation and Differential Localization of the Fibronectin Receptor in L Cells−Since the deposition and organization of a fibronectin matrix is cell-dependent and, more specifically, is remodeled by focal contacts, we next analyzed the adhesive architecture of cells. L fibroblasts double-labeled with fluorescently tagged phalloidin to reveal the F-actin cytoskeleton and an antibody to vinculin to show focal contacts were examined. Increased focal contact formation and a more robust stress fiber-containing actin cytoskeleton are evident in calreticulin-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3A). The calreticulin underexpressers are poorly spread and have very few focal contacts and no stress fibers. Quantification of the number of vinculin-containing focal contacts per cell reveals a significantly greater number of focal contacts in calreticulin overexpressers compared with control cells (Fig. 3B). Calreticulin underexpressers contain only a slight number of focal contacts, which are significantly lower than those in control cells (Fig. 3B). The fibronectin receptor in L fibroblasts is the α5β1 integrin heterodimer, and the extracellular domain of the α5 subunit is responsible for ligand binding (11.Wu C. Bauers R.L. Juliano R.L. McDonnell J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21883-21888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next wanted to determine if the difference in fibronectin matrix assembly in L cells was due to differential fibronectin receptor expression at the cell surface, since changes in calreticulin expression do not affect the total protein levels of α5β1 integrins in these cells (4.Opas M.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed no differences in the surface expression of α5 and β1 integrins (Fig. 4A). However, the observed difference in fibronectin matrix deposition in L fibroblasts could result from differential receptor localization. Thus, immunolocalization of the α5 integrin subunit was performed, and distinct differences were detected in its localization to the cell surface in each L fibroblast cell line. Crowded calreticulin-overexpressing cells formed abundant α5 integrin-rich patches, which had the appearance of focal contacts (Fig. 4B). In calreticulin underexpressers, α5 integrin-positive patches were very scarce, and there was little focal contact formation (Fig. 4B). Control cells had an intermediate morphology with respect to α5 integrin and vinculin-containing focal contacts (Figs. 3A and 4B). Preformed Fibronectin Induces Cell Spreading and Increased Focal Contact Formation, with the Greatest Changes Occurring in Calreticulin Underexpressers−Since the calreticulin-underexpressing cells were unable to assemble a robust fibronectin matrix and showed poor focal contact formation, we asked if an exogenous preadsorbed fibronectin matrix would rescue the poor adhesive phenotype of these cells. Cells were grown overnight on precoated fibronectin substrata, and were imaged by confocal microscopy following double label immunolocalization for vinculin and fibronectin. This time of growth in vitro allowed for imaging of both preformed fibronectin matrix remodeling and initial stages of fibronectin matrix deposition on glass. To visualize changes in cellular morphology and adhesiveness due to fibronectin, we imaged the cells at the interface between the fibronectin carpet and fibronectin-free bare glass, positioned so as to fit into a single microscopic field of view. On glass, calreticulin-overexpressing cells were well spread, made many vinculin-positive focal contacts, and deposited fibronectin, whereas the calreticulin underexpressers were poorly spread with few, if any, focal contacts (Figs. 3A and 5A). In stark contrast, calreticulin underexpressers on fibronectin carpets spread extensively, and vinculin staining revealed a dramatic increase in the number of vinculin-containing focal contacts in calreticulin underexpressers"
https://openalex.org/W2171361212,"The anthrax toxin receptors, ANTXR1 and ANTXR2, act as molecular clamps to prevent the protective antigen (PA) toxin subunit from forming pores until exposure to low pH. PA forms pores at pH ∼6.0 or below when it is bound to ANTXR1, but only at pH ∼5.0 or below when it is bound to ANTXR2. Here, structure-based mutagenesis was used to identify non-conserved ANTXR2 residues responsible for this striking 1.0 pH unit difference in pH threshold. Residues conserved between ANTXR2 and ANTXR1 that influence the ANTXR2-associated pH threshold of pore formation were also identified. All of these residues contact either PA domain 2 or the neighboring edge of PA domain 4. These results provide genetic evidence for receptor release of these regions of PA as being necessary for the protein rearrangements that accompany anthrax toxin pore formation."

We have previously showed BRCA1 splice variant BRCA1a/p110 to induce apoptosis of human breast cancer cells. In the current study, stable expression of BRCA1a/p110 resulted in inhibition of growth of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and triple-negative (TN) human breast, ovarian, prostate and colon cancer cells and mouse fibroblast cells. Similar to wild-type BRCA1, only those cells with wild-type Rb were sensitive to BRCA1a-induced growth suppression and the status of p53 did not affect the ability of BRCA1a to suppress growth of tumor cells. BRCA1a also significantly inhibited tumor mass in nude mice bearing human CAL-51 TN breast cancer, ES-2 ovarian cancer and PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts. These results suggest that the majority of exon 11 sequences (residues 263–1365) are not required for the tumor suppressor function of BRCA1 proteins. This is the first report demonstrating antitumor activity of BRCA1a in human ER-positive and TN breast, hormone-independent ovarian and prostate cancer cells. Currently, there are no effective treatments against TN breast cancers and results from these studies will provide new treatments for one of the biggest needs in breast cancer research."
https://openalex.org/W2013273232,"Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and sensory rhodopsin II (SRII) function as a light-driven proton pump and a receptor for negative phototaxis in haloarchaeal membranes, respectively. SRII transmits light signals through changes in protein-protein interaction with its transducer HtrII. Recently, we converted BR by three mutations into a form capable of transmitting photosignals to HtrII to mediate phototaxis responses. The BR triple mutant (BR-T) provides an opportunity to identify structural changes necessary to activate HtrII by comparing light-induced infrared spectral changes of BR, BR-T, and SRII. The hydrogen out-of-plane (HOOP) vibrations of the BR-T were very similar to those of SRII, indicating that they are distributed more extensively along the retinal chromophore than in BR, as in SRII. On the other hand, the bands of the protein moiety in BR-T are similar to those of BR, indicating that they are not specific to photosensing. The alteration of the O–H stretching vibration of Thr-204 in SRII, which we had previously shown to be essential for signal relay to HtrII, occurs also in BR-T. In addition, 1670(+)/1664(-) cm-1 bands attributable to a distorted α-helix were observed in BR-T in a HtrII-dependent manner, as is seen in SRII. Thus, we identified similarities and dissimilarities of BR-T to BR and SRII. The results suggest signaling function of the structural changes of the HOOP vibrations, the O–H stretching vibration of the Thr-215 residue, and a distorted α-helix for the signal generation.

Many photochemically reactive proteins are used to capture energy by light-driven ion transport in prokaryotes and plants, whereas others are used for photosensory signaling. Photosensory functions are myriad, including light regulation of motility (phototaxis) in microorganisms, vision in higher animals, and light control of gene expression in all domains of life (e.g. carotenogenesis, circadian entrainment, plant morphogenesis) (1Briggs W. Spudich J.L. Handbook of Photosensory Receptors. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2004: 1-473Google Scholar). Rhodopsins, 7-transmembrane receptors using retinal as a chromophore, are widespread among microorganisms and animals (2Spudich J.L. Yang C.S. Jung K.H. Spudich E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 365-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The microbial rhodopsin family is unusual in that many are light-driven ion transporters, whereas other homologous members of the family are sensory receptors that interact with transducer proteins to activate signal transduction pathways (3Spudich J.L.

Science. 2001; 293: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) show close similarities in architecture, helix positions, and location of the retinal-binding pocket (see Fig. 1). However the detailed structures are very different, because 74% of their residues differ. SRII forms a 2:2 signaling complex with its cognate transducer protein HtrII in the membrane (8Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Buldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and signals transmitted from SRII to HtrII modulate a phosphotransfer pathway controlling the flagellar motor switch. Light absorbed by SRII triggers trans-cis isomerization of the retinal chromophore (9Kandori H. Tomioka H. Sasabe H. J. Phys. Chem. A. 2002; 106: 2091-2095Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This photoexcitation results in the sequential appearance of photointermediates K, L, M, and O, followed by return to the unphotolyzed (i.e. dark) form of the protein (4Kamo N. Shimono K. Iwamoto M. Sudo Y. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2001; 66: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Protein structural changes in these intermediate states alter the structure of the bound HtrII, a process called signal relay. The mechanism of signal relay, i.e. the nature of these structural changes, is a central question in current studies of sensory receptors (3Spudich J.L. Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 480-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The signal relay mechanism from SR receptors to their cognate Htr transducers has become a focus of interest in part because of its importance to the general understanding of communication between integral membrane proteins, about which little is known. To determine the minimal core of the signaling mechanism, we worked on defining the minimal modifications necessary to convert BR into a protein that would mimic SRII and relay the photosignal to HtrII. We recently found that just three residues in BR replaced by the corresponding residues in SRII enable BR to efficiently relay the retinal photoisomerization signal to HtrII and induce phototaxis responses at 35% of the efficiency of SRII (10Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The signal relay-competent triple mutant of BR (designated “BR-T”) contains the mutations P200T, V210Y, and A215T (Fig. 1). The surface mutations P200T and V210Y are important for binding to the HtrII molecule (11Sudo Y. Yamabi M. Kato S. Hasegawa C. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1274-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas on the basis of our previous measurements in SRII (12Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Wada A. Ito M. Kamo N. Kandori H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 16036-16037Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 13Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Kandori H. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34239-34245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we predict that the replacement A215T is required for an HtrII-dependent steric constraint between the retinylidene C14–H and the Thr residue that occurs upon photoisomerization. The resulting hydrogen-bonding alteration between the residues Thr-215 and Tyr-185 in BR-T upon formation of the earliest intermediate (K) is essential for signal relay (10Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), as is the corresponding hydrogen bond in SRII (13Sudo Y. Furutani Y. Kandori H. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34239-34245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This finding provides an approach for identifying the structural changes necessary to activate the HtrII transducer protein by comparison of light-induced changes in BR, BR-T, and SRII. Here we have applied Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, a powerful tool for investigating protein structural changes of rhodopsins in atomic detail (14Kandori H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Earlier, we reported structural changes in BR and SRII detected by means of low temperature FTIR spectroscopy (15Kandori H.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9075-9083Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, the FTIR spectra of BR-T in the presence and absence of HtrII are compared with those of BR and SRII. Sample Preparations—Expression plasmids of BR-T and BR-T·HsHtrII were constructed as previously described (10Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed in H. salinarum Pho81Wr- cells as described previously (19Perazzona B. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6475-6478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pho81Wr- lacks the four rhodopsins (BR, HR, SRI, and SRII) as well as the two transducer proteins (HtrI and HtrII). To obtain a high expression level, the strong bop promoter was used. Purple membrane was prepared using essentially the same method as previously described (20Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). FTIR Spectroscopy—Low temperature FTIR spectroscopy was as described previously (15Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Tanimoto T. Furutani Y. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2300-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The samples were washed three times with a buffer at pH 7.0 (2 mm phosphate) for spectral measurements of K- and L intermediates. 90 μl of the sample was dried on a BaF2 window with a diameter of 18 mm. After hydration by H2O, D2O, or D 182O, the sample was placed in a cell, which was mounted in an Oxford DN-1704 cryostat placed in the Bio-Rad FTS-40 spectrometer. The light-adapted state was obtained by illumination of the film with >500 nm of light for 1 min at 273 K. The BR-TK minus BR-T difference spectra were measured at 77 K as follows. To convert BR-T to BR-TK, the sample was irradiated for 2 min with 500 nm light; subsequent illumination with >640 nm light for 60 s reconverted BR-TK into BR-T. The difference spectrum was calculated from the spectra constructed with 128 interferograms collected before and after the photoillumination. Twenty-four spectra obtained in this way were averaged for the BR-TK minus BR-T spectrum. The BR-TL minus BR-T difference spectra were measured at 170 K as follows. Illumination with >580 nm of light at 170 K for 1 min converted BR-T to the L intermediate. The spectrum by photoreversion of BR-TL to BR-T was not a mirror image of the BR-TL minus BR-T spectrum (forward photoreaction). Therefore, four spectra obtained by illumination were averaged to obtain the BR-TL minus BR-T spectrum. Infrared Spectral Changes of BR-T upon Formation of the K Intermediate—Fig. 2 shows the K minus initial state infrared difference spectra of BR (21Tanimoto T. Furutani Y. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2300-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), BR-T, and SRII (Fig. 2, a–c) (15Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) measured at 77K and pH 7. In Fig. 2, a and c, the negative and positive bands at 1530(-)/1514(+) and 1554(-)/1544(+) cm-1 correspond to ethylenic C=C stretching vibrations of the retinal chromophore in BR and SRII, respectively. The bands at 1203(-)/1194(+) cm-1 for BR and 1204(-)/1198(+) cm-1 for SRII correspond to the C–C stretching vibration of the chromophore at position C14–C15. It is well known that these bands indicate the formation of the K intermediate (15Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The similar frequency shifts, 1533(-)/1524(+) cm-1 for C=C stretching vibration and 1202(-)/1195(+) cm-1 for C–C stretching vibration, were observed in BR-T, indicating the formation of the K intermediate. The bands at 1533(-)/1524(+) cm-1 in BR-T are relatively small. This appears to be due to the smaller frequency shift (9 cm-1) than in BR (16 cm-1), resulting in mutual cancellation of the positive and negative bands. Also in SRII, the bands at 1554(-)/1544(+) cm-1 (frequency shift = 10 cm-1) are smaller than in BR (frequency shift = 16 cm-1). One of the differences between BR and BR-T is the appearance of a positive band at 1157 cm-1 in BR-T. The band was also observed in SRII at 1159 cm-1, suggesting similar structural changes of some C–C stretching vibration between BR-T and SRII upon formation of the K intermediate, not occurring in BR. HOOP Vibrations of the Retinal Chromophore in BR-T—A previous FTIR study (15Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) showed remarkable spectral differences in the region of hydrogen out-of-plane (HOOP) vibrations of the retinal chromophore (1000-800 cm-1) between BR and SRII, which provide information about the chromophore distortion upon photoisomerization. For the BR spectrum (Fig. 3a), there are D2O-sensitive intense bands at 974 and 957 cm-1, which have been assigned as HOOP vibrations of C15–H and N–H groups (22Maeda A. Sasaki J. Pfefferle J.M. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 911-921Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The SRIIK minus SRII spectrum exhibits more peaks (Fig. 3c), which are interpreted in terms of more extended chromophore distortion in the K intermediate of SRII (15Kandori H. Shimono K. Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9238-9246Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). By using all seven monodeuterated retinal analogues, we have assigned the 966(+)/971(-) and 958(+)/961(-) cm-1 bands as originating from the C7=C8 and C11=C12 Au (irreducible representation of diene vibrations) HOOP modes, respectively (23Furutani Y. Sudo Y. Wada A. Ito M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11836-11843Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The positive bands at 1001, 994, and 979 cm-1 were assigned to the C15-HOOP vibrations of the K intermediate. Another positive band at 864 cm-1 was assigned to the C14-HOOP vibration. These bands were also observed in BR-T at 964(+)/971(-), 958(+)/961(-), 996(+), 992(+), 979(+), and 861(+) cm-1 (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the structural changes spread to the middle part of the retinal chromophore. In addition, a positive band at 1023 cm-1 appears in BR-TK.A similar band is also present at 1024 cm-1 in the SRIIK, which was assigned to symmetric rocking of methyl groups connected to the C9 and C13 atoms (23Furutani Y. Sudo Y. Wada A. Ito M. Shimono K. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11836-11843Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the BR spectra, two intense positive bands at 811 and 803 cm-1 appeared in the 900-800 cm-1 region. We predicted that the bands originated from wagging vibrations of the retinal chromophore, because resonance Raman studies revealed that such vibrations appeared in the 900-800 cm-1 region (24Palings I. van den Berg E.M. Lugtenburg J. Mathies R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1498-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, the bands disappeared in BR-T as well as in SRII. Thus these results indicate that the structural changes of the retinal chromophore of BR-T are very similar to those of SRII. Vibrational Bands of C=N Stretching Vibrations of the Retinal Schiff Base and the Protein Moiety in BR-T—Fig. 4 shows spectral changes in the 1780-1560 cm-1 region, where most signals originate from protein vibrations. One exception is the C=N stretching vibration of the retinylidene Schiff base that appears in the 1650-1600 cm-1 region (25Siebert F. Mantele W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 130: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The overall spectral shape of BR-T looks similar to that of BR, not SRII. The C=N stretching vibrations of BR are located at 1641(-)/1608(+) cm-1 in H2O and at 1628(-)/1606(+) cm-1 in D2O (Fig. 4a), whereas those of SRII are located at 1657(-)/1600(+) cm-1 in H2O and at 1633(-)/1597(+) cm-1 in D2O (Fig. 4c). The bands at 1641(-)/1612(+) cm-1 in H2O and 1628(-)/1608(+) cm-1 in D2O appeared in the case of BR-T, which are similar frequencies to BR, implying that structure and structural changes of the C=N stretching vibrations in BR-T are almost the same as those in BR. Fig. 4 also shows vibrational bands of the protein. The intense peaks at 1704(-)/1700(+) cm-1 (Fig. 4c) originate form the C=O stretching vibrations of the side chain of Asn-105 in SRII (26Kandori H. Shimono K. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because the Asn is replaced by aspartate both in BR and BR-T, the spectrum lack the bands, but contain the D2O-sensitive bands at 1742(-)/1732(+) cm-1 for BR (27Braiman M.S. Mogi T. Marti T. Stern L.J. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8516-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and at 1740(-)/1731(+) cm-1 for BR-T, respectively (Fig. 4, a and b), showing similar structural changes of the aspartic acid (Asp-115) between BR and BR-T. The band pair at 1623(+)/1617(-) cm-1 in BR (Fig. 4a) was assigned to the C=O stretching vibrations of amide I of Val-49 (28Yamazaki Y. Tuzi S. Saito H. Kandori H. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Maeda A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4063-4068Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In BR-T, a band pair was also observed at 1623(+)/1618(-) cm-1, indicating the similar structural changes of Val-49 between BR and BR-T. In BR, the 1668(-)/1664 cm-1 bands correspond to the frequency region typical for the amide I vibration of the highly dichroic αII-helix (29Krimm S. Dwivedi A.M. Science. 1982; 216: 407-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast, the intensity of the bands was markedly decreased in SRII and BR-T. Because the αII-helix possesses considerably distorted structure (29Krimm S. Dwivedi A.M. Science. 1982; 216: 407-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the structural changes of distorted α-helix did not occur upon formation of the K intermediates in both BR-T and SRII. Except for the changes in the αII-helix region, the spectra of BR-T is likely similar to BR in the typical amide I vibrational region (1670-1600 cm-1), suggesting that protein structural changes in BR-T are similar to that in wild-type BR. X–D (X=O,N) Stretching Vibrations in BR-T—Fig. 5 shows a spectral comparison in the 2780-1850 cm-1 region between hydration with D2O(red lines) and D 182O(blue lines) for BR (Fig. 5a) (21Tanimoto T. Furutani Y. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2300-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), BR-T (Fig. 5b) and SRII (Fig. 5c) (30Kandori H. Furutani Y. Shimono K. Shichida Y. Kamo N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15693-15698Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), where isotope shifts were observed for many bands. We assign the green-labeled bands to the O–D stretching vibrations of water because of the isotope shift. In BR, negative peaks at 2690, 2636, 2599, 2323, 2292, and 2171 cm-1 and positive peaks at 2684, 2675, 2662, 2359, and 2265 cm-1 were earlier assigned to vibrations of water molecules (21Tanimoto T. Furutani Y. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2300-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5a). Because the frequencies of the negative peaks at 2321, 2292, and 2171 cm-1 are much lower than those of fully hydrated tetrahedral water molecules (31Kandori H. Shichida Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 11745-11746Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the hydrogen bonds of those water molecules must be very strong. The strong hydrogen-bonded water molecules were observed not only in BR but also in BR-T (at 2323, 2292, and 2195 cm-1) and SRII (at 2307 and 2213 cm-1). A band of the strongest hydrogen-bonded water molecule at 2171 cm-1 in BR, which was assigned to the O–D stretching vibration of water 402 hydrating Asp-85 (32Shibata M. Tanimoto T. Kandori H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 13312-13313Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), shifted to 2195 cm-1 in BR-T. In BR-T, the introduced Thr-215 probably forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr-185 (as discussed below). Because Tyr-185 also forms a hydrogen bond with Asp-212, the hydrogen bond between them becomes weaker. Moreover, Asp-212 directly forms a hydrogen bond with water 402 (33Shibata M. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7406-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because the hydrogen bond between Asp-212 and water 402 becomes stronger, the hydrogen bond between Asp-85 and water 402 becomes weaker. As a result, the band at 2171 cm-1 in BR shifts to 2195 cm-1 in BR-T. Supporting this interpretation, the candidate band for the O–D stretching vibration of water 402 hydrating Asp-212 (2636 cm-1) seems to be down-shifted to 2628 cm-1. Recently Fututani et al. (34Furutani Y. Shibata M. Kandori H. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2005; 4: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) proposed that the existence of strongly bound water molecules was required for proton pumping, because it was well correlated with proton pumping activity of archaeal rhodopsins. Sudo and Spudich (10Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) confirmed that BR-T in the absence of bound HtrII does pump protons with similar efficiency as wild-type BR. Therefore, this result is consistent with the correlation between the strongly hydrogen-bonded water molecule and pumping activity. The frequency region shown in Fig. 5 also contains X–D stretching vibrations other than water molecules. In the BRK minus BR spectrum, the bands at 2506(-)/2465(+) cm-1 labeled in purple and the underlined bands at 2171(-) and 2124(-) cm-1 were assigned to the O–D stretching vibrations of Thr-89 (35Kandori H. Kinoshita N. Yamazaki Y. Maeda A. Shichida Y. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Bizounok M. Herzfeld J. Raap J. Lugtenburg J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9676-9683Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Kandori H. Kinoshita N. Yamazaki Y. Maeda A. Shichida Y. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Bizounok M. Herzfeld J. Raap J. Lugtenburg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4643-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the N–D stretching vibrations of the retinal Schiff base (37Kandori H. Belenky M. Herzfeld J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6026-6031Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, the negative 2171 cm-1 band contains both the O–D stretch of water and the N–D stretch of the Schiff base. In the BR-TK minus BR-T spectrum, there are similar bands. The bands at 2506(-)/2471(+) cm-1 can be assigned to the O–D stretching vibrations of Thr-89 in analogy to wild-type BR. The O–D frequencies of Thr-89 in BR-T and BR-TK (2506 and 2471 cm-1) are almost identical to those of Thr-89 in BR and BRK (2506 and 2465 cm-1), respectively, indicating that the strength of hydrogen bonding between Thr-89 and Asp-85 is identical to that in BR. Although not assigned directly by use of the labeled protein, the bands at 2179 and 2128 cm-1 in BR-T (Fig. 5b) are likely to originate from N–D stretching of the Schiff base, whose frequencies are very similar to those in BR (2171 and 2124 cm-1). This fact indicates similar hydrogen bonding strengths between BR-T and BR. The frequency of the intense band (2179 cm-1 for BR-T and 2171 cm-1 for BR) corresponds to the results obtained for the C=N stretching vibrations as shown in Fig. 4. Intriguingly, a new negative band at 1993 cm-1 appears in BR-T (Fig. 5b). The corresponding band at 2004 cm-1 was also observed in SRII spectra (Fig. 5c) and was not observed in BR spectra (Fig. 5a). It is assignable to an X–D stretching vibration, because there is no band in the corresponding region of the difference spectra measured in H2O. However, this band does not originate from O–D stretching vibrations of water, because no isotope shift was observed in the sample hydrated with D 182O. In addition, the band at 2004 cm-1 in SRII was not affected by [15N]lysine-labeled SRII as reported previously (38Shimono K. Furutani Y. Kamo N. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7801-7806Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It may originate from an N–D stretching vibration of the guanidium group of Arg, which is suggested to form a strong hydrogen bond because of its relatively low frequency. In the case of BR, the bands at 2292(-)/2266(+) cm-1 and at 2579(-)/2567(+) cm-1 were assigned to the N–D stretching vibrations of Arg-82 (39Tanimoto T. Shibata M. Belenky M. Herzfeld J. Kandori H. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9439-9447Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Spectral Differences Caused by Association with HtrII in Vibrations in the Low Frequency Region—Fig. 6, a and b, shows BR-TK minus BR-T and SRIIK minus SRII infrared difference spectra in the absence (dotted lines) and presence (solid lines) of HtrII. The right panels show the spectra in the 1320-900 cm-1 region. Both dotted and solid lines in BR-T look very similar in this frequency region, implying that complex formation of BR-T with HtrII has almost no effect on the spectral changes in the 1320-900 cm-1 region upon retinal photoisomerization. It should be noted that BR-T is almost completely in complex with HtrII, because the BR-T·HtrII complex does not show measurable photoinduced proton transport activity (10Sudo Y. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16129-16134Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore the lack of effect in this spectral region is not due to lack of binding. Furthermore, in BR-T, a spectral difference was observed in the frequency region of the amide I vibration of αII-helix (1664(-)/1670(+) cm-1) (Fig. 6a, left panel). The new bands appear at 1663(-)/1671(+) cm-1 in an HtrII-dependent manner. As described above, because the αII-helix possesses considerably distorted structure, the results suggest that the structural changes of distorted α-helix are caused by association with HtrII both in the case of BR-T and SRII. Another difference due to HtrII is that the negative band at 1653 cm-1 in BR-T without HtrII completely disappeared in BR-T with HtrII, and a new band appeared at 1655 cm-1 (Fig. 6a), suggesting that amide-I vibration of the peptide backbone of BR and/or HtrII was greatly altered by association with HtrII. The O–H Stretching Vibrations of the Introduced Thr Residue into BR—Fig. 7, a and b, shows the BR-TK minus BR-T and SRIIK minus SRII infrared difference spectra in the absence and presence of HtrII. Also shown is the BRK minus BR infrared difference spectrum. Previously we reported that the hydrogen bond betwe"

It is activated to factor Va by thrombin following proteolytic removal of a large central B-domain. Although this reaction is well studied, the mechanism by which bond cleavage and B-domain release facilitate the transition to the active cofactor state has not been defined. Here we show that deletion or substitution of specific B-domain sequences drives the expression of procoagulant function without the need for proteolytic processing. Conversion to the constitutively active cofactor state is related, at least in part, to a cluster of amino acids that is highly basic and well conserved across the vertebrate lineage. Our findings demonstrate that discrete sequences in the B-domain serve to stabilize the inactive procofactor state, with proteolysis primarily functioning to remove these inhibitory constraints.

These unexpected results provide new insight into the mechanism of factor V activation. Many proteins involved in hemostasis circulate in blood in a quiescent state and only express activity following limited proteolysis. One of these proteins, factor V (FV), 2The abbreviations used are: FV, factor V; FVIII, factor VIII; FVa, activated factor V; FX, factor X; FXa, factor Xa; S2238, H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginyl-ρ-nitroanilide; DAPA, dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide; PCPS, small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% (w/w) phosphatidylcholine and 25% (w/w) phosphatidylserine; PD-FV, plasma-derived factor V; rFVa, recombinant FVa; OG488-FXa, factor Xa modified with Oregon Green488. is synthesized as a large multi-domain (A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2) protein sharing homology with factor VIII (FVIII), except in the B-domain (1Mann K.G. Kalafatis M. Blood. 2002; 101: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Kane W.H. Colman R.W. Marder V.J. Clowes A.W. George J.N. Goldhaber S.Z. Hemostasis and Thrombosis. 2006: 177-192Google Scholar). Factor V circulates as a procofactor and has minimal procoagulant activity (3Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Foster W.B. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13970-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin catalyzes the conversion of FV to factor Va (FVa) following three cleavages (Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545), thereby releasing the heavily glycosylated B-domain that spans amino acids 710–1545 (5Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4846-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Factor Va is a heterodimer consisting of a noncovalently associated heavy and light chain and functions as a cofactor within the prothrombinase complex. Because FV cannot function in prothrombinase, the proteolytic conversion of FV to FVa must result in structural changes necessary for function. Most approaches aimed at understanding FV activation are principally based on correlating proteolysis within the B-domain with the expression of procoagulant activity (4Foster W.B. Nesheim M.E.

These studies support the idea that bond cleavage at Arg1545 is required for the expression of full cofactor activity. However, how proteolysis directly contributes to the development of FVa cofactor activity is not well defined. An alternative way of looking at this problem is to evaluate how FV is preserved as an inactive procofactor. One possibility is that binding sites on the heavy and/or light chain that are important to cofactor function are in a conformational state that precludes factor Xa (FXa)/prothrombin binding. Proteolysis could then drive cofactor activation in a manner analogous to the activation strategy used by the chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, protease activated receptors, and fibrinogen (18Khan A.M. James M.N.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 19Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar, 20Doolittle R.F. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1559-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, bond cleavage is required to unmask new sequences, which then act to facilitate the necessary conformational change for activation (18Khan A.M. James M.N.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that B-domain sequences serve an inhibitory function by rendering binding sites on the heavy and/or light chain inaccessible to FXa or prothrombin. Proteolysis would then promote dissociation of inhibitory B-domain sequences effecting activation. Aspartic and cysteine proteases use this approach to control the inactivity of the zymogen (21Khan A.R. Khazanovich-Bernstein N. Bergmann E.M. James M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10968-10975Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A signature feature of this strategy is the ability to constitutively activate the protein by removing inhibitory sequences in the absence of proteolysis. Evidence that FV may use this strategy comes from the expression of a FV derivative in which a large segment of the B-domain was deleted (FVdes811–1491 or FV-810; see Scheme 1). This variant was shown to have significant procoagulant activity (13Keller F.G. Ortel T.L. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kane W.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4118-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Kane W.H. Devore-Carter D. Ortel T.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6762-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and more recent work indicates that FV-810 binds FXa membranes with high affinity and functions in an equivalent way to FVa in the absence of intentional proteolysis (23Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the B-domain must somehow interfere with binding interactions that govern the function of FVa. In the current study we used a series of activity and direct binding measurements to characterize a panel of progressively finer B-domain-truncated variants to explore this idea further and define regions within the B-domain that may be involved in stabilizing the FV procofactor state.

The molecular weights and extinction coefficients of FVB8–131, FVB8–104, and FVB8–46 were assumed to be the same as FV-1033. Construction of Recombinant FV Derivatives—The construction of FV-810 (see Scheme 1) has been previously described (23Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Specific oligonucleotides used to generate FV-902 were as follows: primer A, 5′-GAAGAGGTGGGAATACTT-3′ corresponds to the cDNA sequence encoding for amino acid residues 319 to 325; primer B, 5′-CTCAATGTAATCTGTATCACTAGGAGGGTC-3′ in which the first 15 bases encode for residues 1496–1492 and the last 15 bases encode for residues 902–898; primer C, 5′-GACCCTCCTAGTGATACAGATTACATTGAG-3′, in which the first 15 bases encode for residues 898–902 and the last 15 bases encode for residues 1492–1496; and primer D, 5′-TCTGTCCATGATAAGAAATGG-3′ corresponds to the FV cDNA sequence encoding for residues 1877–1871. The resulting DNA fragment was TOPO cloned (Invitrogen), then digested with Bsu36I and SnaBI, gel-purified, and subcloned into pED-FV digested with the same enzymes (23Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To ensure the absence of polymerase-induced errors, the entire modified cDNA was sequenced. The remaining constructs outlined in Scheme 1 were prepared in the same way, except primers B and C were appropriately changed. Expression and Purification of rFV Derivatives—Plasmids encoding each of the FV constructs were transfected into baby hamster kidney cells, and stable clones were established as described (23Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8773-8779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Protein expression levels varied from 0.5 to 4 μg/106cells/24 h. Each of the FV derivatives was purified essentially as described (23Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with a final yield of ∼0.5–2 mg of protein/liter of conditioned medium. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. FV-specific Prothrombin Time-based Clotting Assay—Factor V/Va (200 nm) derivatives were prepared in assay buffer. For experiments in which pretreatment with thrombin was intended, the samples (200 nm) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 2 nm thrombin, followed by the addition of 3 nm hirudin. The samples were then diluted to less than 1 nm in assay buffer with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and specific clotting activity using FV-deficient plasma was assayed as described (11Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11896-11906Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The data are presented as the mean values ± S.D. Fluorescence Intensity Measurements—Samples (2.5 ml) in assay buffer were maintained at 25 °C in 1 × 1-cm2 quartz cuvettes, and steady state fluorescence intensity was measured using λex = 480 and λem = 520 nm with a long pass filter (KV500, Schott, Duryea, PA) in the emission beam. Measurements, including controls, were performed as described (26Buddai S.K. Toulokhonova L. Bergum P.W. Vlasuk G.P. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

Kinetics of Protein Substrate Cleavage—Steady state initial velocities of macromolecular substrate cleavage by prothrombinase were determined discontinuously at 25 °C as described (30Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37863-37870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Progress curves of prethrombin-2 activation were performed using the following reaction conditions: PCPS (20 μm), DAPA (3 μm), and prethrombin-2 (1.4 μm) were incubated with the various cofactors (3.0 nm) in assay buffer, and the reaction was initiated with FXa (3.0 nm). When prothrombin was used as protein substrate, the following reaction conditions were used: PCPS (20 μm), DAPA (3 μm), and prothrombin (1.4 μm) were incubated with the various cofactors (0.1 nm), and the reaction was initiated with FXa (1.0 nm). At various time points, aliquots of the reaction mixture were quenched, and thrombin generation was determined by using the chromogenic substrate S2238. Data Analysis—The binding data were analyzed according to the referenced equations by nonlinear least squares regression analysis using the Marquardt algorithm (38Bevington P.R. Robinson K.D. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. 1992; (McGraw-Hill, New York)Google Scholar). The quality of each fit was assessed by the criteria described (39Straume M. Johnson M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Dissociation constants (Kd) and stoichiometries (n) for the interaction between FXa and membrane-bound FVa were obtained from the dependence of the fluorescence intensity on the concentrations of cofactor (40Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reported estimates of error for binding data represent ± 2 S.D. Expression of FV Derivatives—We have previously shown that FV-810 is functionally equivalent to FVa (23Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that reintroducing portions of the B-domain would yield a molecule with procofactor-like properties. Because the C-terminal half of the B-domain (i.e. residues 1019–1545) varies considerably in length or is absent among different vertebrates (41Davidson C.J. Tuddenham E.G. McVey J.H. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 42Jiang Y. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7527-7532Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 43Vos H.L. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 3: P0041Google Scholar), we chose to extend the length of FV-810 by ∼50–100-amino acid increments from the N-terminal side (Scheme 1). SDS-PAGE analyses indicated that each of the proteins migrated with the expected mobility (Fig. 1). Plasma-derived FV, PD-FVa, and rFVa used as controls are included on the gel. Following treatment with thrombin, the proteins migrated in the expected way on the gel yielding FVa. Additional control experiments revealed no significant difference in the rate of proteolysis of the variants compared with FV when using thrombin or FXa (data not shown). Characterization of FV Variants—Initial experiments focused on the clotting activity of the B-domain variants prior to and following treatment with thrombin (Table 1). In this assay system, PD-FV has a low specific activity, which increases ∼10-fold following thrombin activation. This specific activity is comparable with the levels observed for PD-FVa, rFVa, and FV-810. Extending the B-domain length by adding amino acids 811–902 to FV-810 (resulting in FV-902) did not significantly change the specific clotting activity. A further increase in B-domain length to 378 amino acids (FV-1033) decreased the specific activity to levels seen for the procofactor, PD-FV. Extension beyond 378 amino acids (FV-1053, FV-1106, and FV-1152) was without functional consequence, because each of these variants had a procofactor-like specific activity. Factor V-956 had an intermediate specific activity (Table 1).TABLE 1Characterization of B-domain-truncated FV variantsCofactor speciesSpecific activityaThe mean values ± S.D. are presented from three determinations.

Progress curves of the conversion of prethrombin-2 to thrombin using equimolar concentrations of (pro)cofactor (3 nm) and FXa (3 nm) yielded results that were consistent with the clotting assay. Thrombin increased linearly over time when using PD-FVa, rFVa, FV-810, and FV-902, and the initial rates of thrombin generation were within a factor of two (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Once again, FV-956 had reduced activity compared with FVa. In contrast, PD-FV, FV-1152, FV-1106, FV-1053, and FV-1033 had very little activity (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Furthermore, the progress curves were characterized by an obvious lag in thrombin generation, which is expected when the product further activates the procofactor (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained when using prothrombin as the macromolecular substrate (data not shown). In both the clotting and purified component assays, pretreatment of each of these rFV derivatives with thrombin resulted in full activation (Tables 1 and 2).TABLE 2Initial rates of prethrombin-2 activationCofactor speciesInitial velocityaThe data are representative of two to three similar experimentsInitial velocityaThe data are representative of two to three similar experiments,bActivated with thrombin prior to the addition in the prothrombinase assaynm IIa/minnm IIa/minPD-FVa23NAdNA, not applicablerFVa23NAFV-8103522FV-9023030FV-9561518FV-1033-c-, a lag was observed; thus, we were not able to determine a value26FV-1052-26FV-1106-22FV-1152-24PD-FV-20a The data are representative of two to three similar experimentsb Activated with thrombin prior to the addition in the prothrombinase assayc -, a lag was observed; thus, we were not able to determine a valued NA, not applicable Open table in a new tab Binding of (Pro)Cofactors to FXa Membranes—Based on the functional measurements, the B-domain-truncated FV derivatives could be grouped into two categories: cofactor-like (FV-810, FV-902, and FV-956) and procofactor-like (FV-1033, FV-1053, FV-1106, and FV-1152). Because FV binds poorly to active site-blocked FXa (23Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we evaluated the ability of each variant to bind FXa membranes. Equilibrium fluorescence measurements were used to establish binding parameters describing the interaction between the cofactor and membrane-bound FXa. Using a fixed concentration of OG488-FXa, subsequent titration with incremental additions of rFVa, FV-810, and FV-902 (Fig. 3) yielded a saturable increase in fluorescence intensity with comparable dissociation constants (Kd) and stoichiometries (n) (Table 1). Recombinant FV-956 bound with a 5–10-fold reduced affinity, which possibly accounts for the decreased cofactor activity observed in the functional measurements (Table 1), because both of these assays use limiting concentrations of cofactor. In contrast, no significant increase in fluorescence intensity was observed when using PD-FV or FV-1033 (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained with FV-1053, FV-1106, and FV-1152 (data not shown). Treatment of PD-FV, FV-1033, FV-1053, FV-1106, and FV-1152 with thrombin followed by assessment of direct binding yielded dissociation constants consistent with FVa (data not shown), indicating that once activated each of the variants can assemble within prothrombinase. Consistent with our previous findings (23Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), control experiments indicated that each of the FV variants was not cleaved during the binding measurements (data not shown; see Fig. 5B for FV-810 and FV-1033).FIGURE 5Direct binding measurements with FV-1033 derivatives. A, reaction mixtures containing 10 nm OG488-FXa and 50 μm PCPS in assay buffer were titrated with increasing concentrations of PD-FVa (▪), FVB8–131 (×), FVB8–104 (▪), FVB8–46 (□), and FV-1033 (▾). The data for FV-1033 are provided as a comparison and are the same as those in Fig. 3. Fluorescence (F) intensity was measured at 25 °C. The lines are drawn following analysis to independent, noninteracting sites, and the fitted values (Kd and n) are given in Tables 1 and 3. The data are representative of two to three similar experiments. B, SDS-PAGE analysis.

The apparent molecular weights of the standards are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Contribution of Specific B-domain Sequences to Preserving the Procofactor State—The findings suggest that either specific sequences (residues 902–1033) or a specific length (∼378 residues) of the B-domain somehow plays a role in the mechanism by which FV is maintained as a procofactor. To discriminate between these possibilities, we constructed additional FV variants that retained a B-domain length of 378 amino acids but that had portions of residues 900–1030 exchanged with FVIII B-domain sequences that share no homology with sequences within the FV B-domain. Using the procofactor-like FV-1033 as a scaffold, three derivatives were prepared with B-domain lengths of 378 amino acids: FVB8–131, FVB8–104, and FVB8–46, representing 131, 104, and 46 amino acids from the FV B-domain exchanged with FVIII B-domain (Fig. 4). We chose regions of the FVIII B-domain that did not contain known thrombin or intracellular furin cleavage sites (44Vehar G. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F. Oppermann H. Keck R. Wood W. Harkins R. Tuddenham E.G.D. Lawn R. Capon D. Nature. 1984; 312: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). As expected, SDS-PAGE revealed that FVB8–131, FVB8–104, and FVB8–46 have apparent molecular weights equivalent to FV-1033 (Fig. 4). Following incubation with thrombin, each of the derivatives was processed to yield the expected heavy and light chains, and the rate of proteolysis was comparable with FV (data not shown). By using either a purified component assay (data not shown) or a one-stage prothrombin time-based clotting assay or by monitoring direct binding to FXa membranes, we found that each of these variants had properties most consistent with the cofactor-like form (Table 3 and Fig. 5A). Control experiments revealed that the variants were not cleaved during the course of the binding measurements (Fig. 5B). This indicates that proteolysis of the variants is not a requirement for high affinity binding to FXa membranes. When the variants were incubated with thrombin, their specific activities increased only ∼1.5-fold compared with an activation quotient of ∼12 with FV-1033. The activity and direct binding measurements indicate that these derivatives were not completely identical to FVa, because they had ∼65% of full cofactor activity. This is likely due to the finding that the variants bound with a slightly reduced affinity to FXa membranes (∼2–4-fold). In addition"
https://openalex.org/W1985501352,"Lineage-specific, or taxonomically restricted genes (TRGs), especially those that are species and strain-specific, are of special interest because they are expected to play a role in defining exclusive ecological adaptations to particular niches. Despite this, they are relatively poorly studied and little understood, in large part because many are still orphans or only have homologues in very closely related isolates. This lack of homology confounds attempts to establish the likelihood that a hypothetical gene is expressed and, if so, to determine the putative function of the protein.We have developed ""QIPP"" (""Quality Index for Predicted Proteins""), an index that scores the ""quality"" of a protein based on non-homology-based criteria. QIPP can be used to assign a value between zero and one to any protein based on comparing its features to other proteins in a given genome. We have used QIPP to rank the predicted proteins in the proteomes of Bacteria and Archaea. This ranking reveals that there is a large amount of variation in QIPP scores, and identifies many high-scoring orphans as potentially ""authentic"" (expressed) orphans. There are significant differences in the distributions of QIPP scores between orphan and non-orphan genes for many genomes and a trend for less well-conserved genes to have lower QIPP scores.The implication of this work is that QIPP scores can be used to further annotate predicted proteins with information that is independent of homology. Such information can be used to prioritize candidates for further analysis. Data generated for this study can be found in the OrphanMine at http://www.genomics.ceh.ac.uk/orphan_mine."

Depending on the type of the interaction domain, F-box proteins have been classified into three major classes; two classes of F-box proteins contain WD40 repeats and leucine-rich repeats (5.Smith T.F.

The substrate of NIPA, cyclin B1, together with its associated kinase Cdk1, form the maturation-promoting factor that essentially regulates the transition from G2 phase into mitosis. Although mitotic entry requires activity of cyclin B1/Cdk1, mitotic exit requires its destruction. At mitotic entry, regulation of the maturation-promoting factor occurs at two distinct levels: the regulated phosphorylation of the Cdk1 subunit and the nuclear abundance of cyclin B1. In the case of Cdk1, inhibitory phosphates are regulated by the kinase Wee1 and the phosphatase Cdc25 (11.Russell P. Nurse P.

The timely abundance of cyclin B1 in the nucleus is procured by G2 phase-specific phosphorylation of cyclin B1 that mediates nuclear translocation and the timely termination of nuclear cyclin B1 destruction mediated by the SCFNIPA complex (9.Bassermann F. von Klitzing C.

In late mitosis, control of cyclin B1 is governed by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) that targets cyclin B1 for proteasomal destruction to allow for subsequent mitotic exit (17.King R.W.

A feature of cyclin B1/Cdk1 marks its ability to control its own regulators. At the G2/M transition and early mitosis, cyclin B1/Cdk1 has been shown to further activate Cdc25 via phosphorylation and to induce Wee1 degradation (20.Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J.

Moreover, cyclin B1/Cdk1 regulates mitotic APC/C activity via phosphorylation of the APC and its subunits Cdc 20 and Cdh1 to control the sequential activation of APCCdc20 and APCCdh1 (19.Zachariae W.

To further classify the F-box protein NIPA, we have attempted to identify the protein interaction region of this molecule that mediates binding to its substrate cyclin B1. We identify a 50-amino-acid region spanning from amino acids 352–402 in the C terminus of NIPA as the relevant binding determinant. Next to Ser-354, we found 2 new residues within this region, Ser-359 and Ser-395, whose phosphorylation is necessary for efficient dissociation of the SCFNIPA in late G2 and mitosis. Moreover, we show that cyclin B1/Cdk1 phosphorylates NIPA at Ser-395 in mitosis. These findings suggest that cyclin B1/Cdk1 contributes to the efficient mitotic inactivation of the SCFNIPA complex in terms of a negative feedback loop and may thus contribute to the regulation of its own nuclear abundance in early mitosis. Plasmids, Antibodies, and Immunological Procedures−Details of the construction of the various NIPA plasmids are available from the authors upon request. Point mutations of the NIPA cDNA were engineered using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), whereas deletion mutants were prepared by PCR using standard cloning procedures. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma (anti-FLAG (M2), anti-Myc (clone 9E10), anti-β-actin). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (anti-cyclin A, anti-cyclin B1, anti-Skp1) and Zymed Laboratories Inc. (anti-cul1). Immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitations were performed as described (27.Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Cell Cycle Analysis−HeLa, Cos1, and 293T cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections of HeLa, 293T, and Cos1 cells were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), or Dotap (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagents, respectively. Stable transfections of HeLa cells were performed using the FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) reagent and subsequent selection with Zeocin® at 100 μg/ml. Cell synchronization at G2/M was performed by sequential culture with 2 mm thymidine and 40 ng/ml nocodazole and subsequent collection of rounded cells. Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry and subsequent analysis using the FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). GST Fusion Proteins and Pull-down Assays−NIPA WT and all NIPA point and deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli using pGEX vectors (Amersham Biosciences). For protein purification, bacteria (BL-21) were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.7 in Luria-Bertani medium, induced at 37 °C with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside, and cultivated for 2 h. Bacteria were then pelleted, resuspended in NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine), and sonicated. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. 30 μl of glutathione-S-Sepharose 4b beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the cleared lysate, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed three times with NETN buffer. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (28.Bassermann F. Jahn T. Miething C. Seipel P. Bai R.Y. Coutinho S. Tybulewicz V.L. Peschel C. Duyster J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12437-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Quantification was performed using the QantityOne® software (Bio-Rad). Binding affinity was determined as the ratio of bound protein and applied GST protein. Kinase Assays−For kinase assays using fully purified components, active forms of the kinases (cyclin B1/Cdk1, Plk1, GSK3β, or CK2) and purified substrates (GST·NIPA WT or NIPA mutants, GST·Cdc25c, histone H1, Tau-1, and casein) were transferred into the kinase reactions, which contained 80 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min. For kinase assays using depleted HeLa extracts, HeLa cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mm sodium PPi (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of phenanthroline, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), and immunodepletion was carried out using 4 μg of the indicated antibodies. Thereafter, 10 μl of the respective lysates were transferred to the kinase reactions containing GST or GST·NIPA as a substrate. The kinase reaction was carried out in a volume of 40 μl using the experimental conditions detailed above. Xenopus Extracts−Xenopus CSF egg extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (29.Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). CSF release was induced by adding 600 μm CaCl2 to the extract. DNA and spindle morphology were examined as described previously (30.Desai A. Murray A. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 61: 385-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Identification of the Protein Interaction Region of NIPA−To define the region of NIPA, which is required for binding to its substrate cyclin B1, various deletion mutants of NIPA were tested for their ability to form a complex with cyclin B1. GST fusion proteins of the respective deletions were engineered, and binding to Myc-tagged human cyclin B1 was assayed thereafter. This pull-down strategy was applied to circumvent any interference due to variations in the subcellular distribution of the NIPA deletions. These binding studies could delineate the region minimally required for binding to a C-terminal 50-amino-acid segment located between amino acids 352 and 402 of NIPA (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). This region contains Ser-354, a residue previously shown to be phosphorylated in late G2. The presence of this site within the substrate binding region is in line with the recent finding that the G2/M phase-specific phosphorylation of NIPA not only abrogated binding to Skp1 but also terminated the binding of NIPA to cyclin B1 (9.Bassermann F. von Klitzing C. Munch S. Bai R.Y. Kawaguchi H. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. Cell. 2005; 122: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The region directly adjacent to Ser-354, both upstream and downstream, was not sufficient to mediate binding to NIPA as shown by the lack of binding of the NIPA AA327–377 mutant (Fig. 1). Thus, a further binding determinant was expected to be located between amino acids 378 and 402. Surprisingly, this determinant could be located to amino acids 395–402, a sequence that contains the previously described nuclear localization signal of NIPA (Fig. 1) (8.Ouyang T. Bai R.Y. Bassermann F. Von Klitzing C. Klumpen S. Miething C. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30028-30036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since proteasomal degradation of cyclin B1 by the SCFNIPA complex is determined to occur exclusively in the nucleus, it is tempting to speculate that the necessity of an intact nuclear localization signal for the binding of NIPA to cyclin B1 has evolved to ensure this nuclear restriction. Further conserved motifs, in particular a canonical protein interaction motif, were not detectable in this region. On the basis of the described features of the substrate interaction region, we suggest placing NIPA in the FBXO group of F-box proteins according to the recent nomenclature guidelines (7.Jin J. Cardozo T. Lovering R.C. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Cyclin B1/Cdk1 Phosphorylates NIPA in Vitro−Cyclin B1/Cdk1 can control its own regulators such as Cdc25, Wee1, and the APC/C. We thus went on to investigate whether cyclin B1/Cdk1 may serve as a kinase for NIPA. First, we applied an in vitro kinase assay using purified cyclin B1/Cdk1 and GST·NIPA to investigate whether cyclin B1/Cdk1 can phosphorylate NIPA in a direct manner. As depicted in Fig. 2A, cyclin B1/Cdk1 was able to specifically confer 32P to NIPA (lane 3). We further wished to investigate whether the substrate interaction region of NIPA detailed above serves as a sufficient substrate for this phosphorylation event. Fig. 2A, lane 6, demonstrates that phosphorylation of NIPA by cyclin B1/Cdk1 indeed occurs within the protein interaction region. Specificity was ascertained using GST and different deletion mutants of NIPA lacking the substrate binding region (lanes 2, 5, and 7). Of note, no phosphorylation of NIPA was observed when using active cyclin A/Cdk2 in this assay (data not shown). Next, we searched for the relevant phosphoacceptor sites within the NIPA substrate binding region. Since we could previously demonstrate that serine residue 354 is involved in G2 phase-specific phosphorylation of NIPA in vivo (9.Bassermann F. von Klitzing C. Munch S. Bai R.Y. Kawaguchi H. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. Cell. 2005; 122: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we tested a NIPA Ser-354 point mutant (NIPA S354A) for phosphorylation by cyclin B1/Cdk1 using the in vitro setting described for Fig. 2A. Fig. 2B, lane 4, demonstrates that mutation of Ser-354 to alanine caused only minor decrease of cyclin B1/Cdk1-specific phosphorylation of NIPA, thus suggesting the presence of other phosphoacceptor sites. Since Ser-354 is not located in a consensus phosphorylation site for Cdk1, we reasoned that Cdk1 phosphoacceptor sites present in the protein binding region may be involved. We identified three putative Cdk phosphorylation sites located on serine residues 359, 370, and 395 that resemble the core Cdk consensus site ((S/T)P) (Fig. 2C). All of these sites are conserved in human and mouse, whereas only Ser-359 and Ser-395 are conserved from human to Xenopus (Fig. 2C). Of note, only Ser-395 resembles the more complex Cdk1 consensus sequence (S/T)PX(K/R), where X is any amino acid (31.Nigg E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We went on to mutate these residues to alanine and investigated these mutants as to their impact on cyclin B1/Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of NIPA in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2B, mutation of serine 395 impaired cyclin B1/Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of NIPA to a clearly higher extent than NIPA S354A (lane 5), whereas NIPA S370A and NIPA Ser-359 were phosphorylated to an extent similar to NIPA WT (lanes 7 and 8). Notably, a NIPA S354A,S359A double mutant (lane 6) incorporated similar amounts of 32P as NIPA WT, thus suggesting that the minor reduction in phosphorylation of the NIPA S354A mutant is likely not cyclin B1/Cdk1-specific. Thus, Ser-395 serves as a phosphoacceptor site for cyclin B1/Cdk1 in vitro. Next, we sought to investigate other G2/M kinases with regard to their ability to phosphorylate NIPA within the protein binding region. We performed consensus sequence analysis of this region and found Ser-354 within a consensus sequence for glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β, SXXXS) and Ser-359 within a consensus sequence for casein kinase 2 (CK2, SXX(D/E)). In addition, we chose Plk1 as a further candidate, given the pivotal role of this kinase in regulating mitotic entry. The candidate kinases were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay together with GST·NIPA or known substrates of the respective kinases, and incorporation of 32P was analyzed thereafter. As shown in Fig. 2D, none of the tested kinases was able to specifically phosphorylate NIPA in vitro. Thus, GSK3β, CK2, and Plk1 are most likely not relevant kinases of the NIPA protein binding region. Of note, NIPA contains a consensus phosphorylation site for the Akt kinase (RXRXX(S/T)) outside of the protein binding region at serine residue 407. Some recent evidence suggests a role for Akt in regulating the mitotic and meiotic G2 to M transition by inhibiting the Wee1 and Myt1 kinases (32.Katayama K. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 33.Okumura E. Fukuhara T. Yoshida H. Hanada Si S. Kozutsumi R. Mori M. Tachibana K. Kishimoto T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We therefore mutated Ser-407 to alanine and analyzed the shift in electrophoretic mobility in G2/M-arrested cells. However, this mutation was not able to affect phosphorylation of NIPA (supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, although several other candidate kinases of NIPA were investigated in this study, we were not able to identify relevant kinases other than cyclin B1/Cdk1. Cyclin B1/Cdk1-dependent Phosphorylation of NIPA by Mitotic and Meiotic Cell Extracts−To further substantiate the role of cyclin B1/Cdk1 in phosphorylating NIPA in mitosis, we tested whether mitotic HeLa cell extracts depleted of cyclin B1 or cyclin A were able to phosphorylate NIPA. We found that extracts precleared with an anti-cyclin B1 antibody had a strongly reduced capability to phosphorylate NIPA (Fig. 3A). Depletion with an anti-cyclin A antibody or preimmune serum did not affect the phosphorylation reaction (Fig. 3A). Only mitotic extracts were able to phosphorylate NIPA, whereas interphase extracts did not possess any kinase activity toward NIPA, consistent with the recently described onset of NIPA phosphorylation in late G2 phase and persistence throughout mitosis (Fig. 3A) (9.Bassermann F. von Klitzing C. Munch S. Bai R.Y. Kawaguchi H. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. Cell. 2005; 122: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B demonstrates effective depletion of both cyclin A and cyclin B1 in the respective extracts. Next, we investigated the presence of kinase activity toward NIPA in Xenopus oocytes, using either metaphase-arrested CSF extracts or Ca2+-stimulated G1 extracts. This model allows a very distinguished analysis of cyclin B1/Cdk1 kinase activity since metaphase cells contain high cyclin B1/Cdk1 activity due to the Xerp1-mediated arrest just prior to APC-dependent cyclin B1 destruction and the prompt inactivation of cyclin B1/Cdk1 as cells are released from this arrest subsequent to Ca2+ stimulation (34.Schmidt A. Duncan P.I. Rauh N.R. Sauer G. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 35.Rauh N.R. Schmidt A. Bormann J. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Nature. 2005; 437: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Using this experimental approach, we found substantial and rapid phosphorylation of NIPA using CSF-arrested extracts, whereas no phosphorylation of NIPA was detectable when using the Ca2+ stimulated extracts (Fig. 3C). Microscopic examination of the extract revealed decondensed chromatin upon calcium addition, confirming that the extracts had entered interphase (Fig. 3D). This finding further underlines a function of cyclin B1/Cdk1 in phosphorylating NIPA in mitosis. Phosphorylation of NIPA in Mitosis Involves Serine Residues 359 and 395 in Vivo−To further investigate the role of cyclin B1/Cdk1 in phosphorylating NIPA in vivo, we went on to examine the NIPA point mutants described above (NIPA-354A, -359A, -370A, -395A) as to their impact on the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of NIPA at the G2/M transition. To this end, HeLa cell lines with stable expression of the respective constructs of NIPA were generated. These lines were synchronized at prometaphase, and phosphorylation was analyzed thereafter with regard to the shift of NIPA in electrophoretic mobility. As described previously, mutation of serine 354 to alanine largely abolished phosphorylation of NIPA at G2/M (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). Surprisingly, both the S359A and the S395A mutants were significantly less phosphorylated at G2/M when compared with NIPA WT (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10). Although the decrease in phosphorylation of S359A was similar to S354A, phosphorylation of the S395A mutant as determined by electrophoretic mobility was somewhat stronger than S354A yet clearly inferior to NIPA WT. The NIPA S370A mutant displayed a wild-type phenotype (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lanes 7 and 8). A similar synchrony of the different mutants at prometaphase was ascertained by DNA content analysis (Fig. 4B). To further analyze the impact of the described mutations on the G2/M-specific phosphorylation of NIPA, we generated double mutants (NIPA S354A,S359A, NIPA S354A,S395A, NIPA S359A,S395A) and a triple mutant (NIPA S354A,S359A,S395A) thereof. Again, stable HeLa lines were generated, and the electrophoretic shift of each mutant was analyzed in G2/M-arrested cells. Although mutation of 2 residues synergistically reduced phosphorylation when compared with the single mutants of NIPA (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lanes 11–16), only the triple mutant demonstrated a near to complete loss of phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lanes 17 and 18). These data suggest the presence of at least 3 distinct serine residues of NIPA that are involved in the phosphorylation process in late G2 and mitosis and demonstrate that phosphorylation of the cyclin B1/Cdk1 phosphorylation site (Ser-395) is an integral part of this process. We next investigated the functional consequence of NIPA phosphorylation at Ser-359 and Ser-395. G2/M-specific phosphorylation of NIPA at Ser-354 has previously been shown to abolish binding to Skp1, thus inactivating the SCFNIPA complex (9.Bassermann F. von Klitzing C. Munch S. Bai R.Y. Kawaguchi H. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. Cell. 2005; 122: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We therefore went on to investigate the ability of the various NIPA single, double, and triple mutants to bind to Skp1 in G2/M-arrested cells using the stably transfected HeLa cell lines described above. To this end, immunoprecipitations of the FLAG-tagged NIPA mutants were performed, and binding to endogenous Skp1 was analyzed. In these binding experiments, both NIPA Ser-359 and NIPA Ser-395 maintained binding to Skp1 in G2/M cells, whereas the binding of NIPA WT and Ser-370 was markedly reduced (Fig. 4A, lanes 1, 2, and 5–10, and 4C). NIPA S354A retained binding to Skp1, similar to NIPA S359A (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4, and 4C). Similarly, the double and triple mutants of NIPA retained binding to Skp1 at G2/M (Fig. 4C, lanes 11–18). Equivalent results were obtained for the binding of the NIPA mutants to Cul1, a further member of the core SCF complex (Fig. 4A). Thus, in addition to Ser-354, both residues Ser-359 and Ser-395 appear to be necessary for the efficient dissociation of NIPA from Skp1 at G2/M. The functional consequence of an assembled SCFNIPA complex in mitosis is continued degradation of cyclin B1. We thus investigated the levels of cyclin B1 in mitotic extracts of the stable cell lines described above. Our results show that the physiological mitotic increase of cyclin B1 was markedly reduced in cells expressing NIPA S359A and NIPA S395A, similar to the control, NIPA S354A. Both NIPA WT and NIPA S370A retained the physiological mitotic increase of cyclin B1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–10, and 4D). The double and triple mutants of NIPA demonstrated a similar phenotype as the respective single mutants (Fig. 4A, lanes 11–18, and 4D) These data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-354, -359, and -395 is required to efficiently inactivate the SCFNIPA complex at G2/M. To rule out the possibility that mutation of Ser-359 and Ser-395 interfered with phosphorylation of Ser-354, thus undermining the role of Ser-359 and Ser-395 as independent phosphorylation sites, we investigated phosphorylation of these mutants when coexpressed with the oncogenic fusion protein NPM·ALK (36.Morris S.W. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T. Science. 1994; 263: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). Overexpression of NPM·ALK has previously been shown to activate a Ser/Thr kinase that phosphorylates NIPA at Ser-354 (8.Ouyang T. Bai R.Y. Bassermann F. Von Klitzing C. Klumpen S. Miething C. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30028-30036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To this end, we coexpressed NPM·ALK with NIPA WT or either of the NIPA-S354A, NIPA-S359A, or NIPA-395A mutants and subsequently analyzed NIPA with regard to electrophoretic mobility. Although mutation of Ser-354 completely abolished the NPM·ALK induced phosphorylation of NIPA, NIPA-Ser-359 and -Ser-395 were phosphorylated like NIPA WT, thus excluding the possibility that phosphorylation of Ser-354 is perturbed by mutating Ser-359 or Ser-395 (Fig. 4E). The Ser/Thr kinase activated by NPM·ALK may be a potential candidate for NIPA phosphorylation at G2/M under physiological conditions. Thus, this finding may further suggest the presence of distinct kinases for Ser-354 and Ser-359. In this report, we have further characterized the previously identified F-box-containing protein NIPA with regard to the site of interaction with its substrate cyclin B1 and the underlying mechanism of its G2/M-specific phosphorylation. We define the protein binding region of NIPA as a C-terminal stretch spanning from amino acids 352–402. This location of the substrate binding determinant is typical for F-box proteins and present among most members of this protein family (4.Cardozo T. Pagano M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this binding region contains three G2/M-specific phosphorylation sites of NIPA: the previously described Ser-354 and 2 novel residues, Ser-359 and Ser-395, which will be discussed in more detail below. The presence of these sites within the substrate binding region is in line with the recently described observation that the G2/M phase-specific phosphorylation of NIPA not only abrogated binding to Skp1, thereby inactivating the SCFNIPA complex, but also terminated the binding of NIPA to cyclin B1 (9.Bassermann F. von Klitzing C. Munch S. Bai R.Y. Kawaguchi H. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. Cell. 2005; 122: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This constellation underlines the pivotal role of the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of NIPA in regulating its function and may hint at a role for this phosphorylation event in determining a cell cycle-dependent conformation of the NIPA protein. In addition, the protein binding region of NIPA comprises the nuclear localization signal (amino acids 395–402). Since proteasomal degradation of cyclin B1 by the SCFNIPA complex is determined to occur exclusively in the nucleus, it is tempting to speculate that the necessity of an intact nuclear localization signal for the binding of NIPA to cyclin B1 has evolved to ensure this nuclear restriction. Further conserved motifs, in particular a canonical protein interaction motif, were not detectable in this region. So far, the only potential substrate interaction motif of NIPA predicted by different search algorithms (PFAM, SMART) is a zinc finger-like domain in the N terminus of NIPA (amino acids 102–156). However, in our binding studies, we were not able to detect any role for this putative domain in mediating the binding of NIPA to cyclin B1. On the basis of the described features of the substrate interaction region, we suggest placing NIPA in the FBXO group of F-box proteins according to the recent nomenclature guidelines (7.Jin J. Cardozo T. Lovering R.C. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We have further investigated the possibility that cyclin B1/Cdk1 is involved in the G2/M-specific phosphorylation process of NIPA. Indeed, we find this mitotic kinase to phosphorylate NIPA both in vitro and in vivo, and we identify Ser-395 as the relevant phosphorylation site. Importantly, this phosphorylation event is functionally implicated in the inactivation of the SCFNIPA complex in mitosis. This constellation resembles a situation where a target of an SCF complex can contribute to the inactivation of its own destruction machinery, thus regulating its own activity. Although such feedback mechanisms have so far been unappreciated for SCF substrates, they have been described for cyclin B1/Cdk1 with regard to its mitotic regulators such as Cdc25, Wee1, and the APC/C (19.Zachariae W.

Our data may thus provide a framework of how to integrate the SCFNIPA complex into this interplay to ensure the timely “switch-on” and maintenance of cyclin B1/Cdk1 activity at G2/M. The present study investigated the effect of the various point mutations on the G2/M-specific shift of NIPA in stably transfected HeLa cell lines. We found that this system detects alterations of the electrophoretic mobility far more differentiated than Cos1 cells, which we utilized to identify Ser-354 as a major phosphorylation site in our previous study (9.Bassermann F. von Klitzing C. Munch S. Bai R.Y. Kawaguchi H. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. Cell. 2005; 122: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although mutation of Ser-354 is sufficient to abolish the G2/M-specific shift of NIPA in Cos1 cells, the use of HeLa cells enabled us to find residual phosphorylation of the NIPA S354A mutant at G2/M, which eventually contributed to identify Ser-359 and Ser-395 as further functionally relevant phosphorylation sites. These findings suggests that at least three distinct phosphorylation sites are involved in the process that eventually inactivates the SCFNIPA in late G2 phase and mitosis. Although cyclin B1/Cdk1 is identified as the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of NIPA at Ser-395, the kinase(s) for Ser-354 and Ser-359 remain unknown despite the effort described in this study. Given that initial phosphorylation of NIPA in late G2 inactivates the SCFNIPA complex, thus allowing for cyclin B1 expression (9.Bassermann F. von Klitzing C. Munch S. Bai R.Y. Kawaguchi H. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. Cell. 2005; 122: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the process of NIPA phosphorylation at G2/M is likely to be sequential. Moreover, it appears conceivable that this process involves several distinct kinases. This notion is supported by our observation that overexpression of NPM·ALK only associates with phosphorylation of Ser-354, whereas Ser-359 or Ser-395 is not phosphorylated under this condition. NPM·ALK has previously been shown to activate a so far unknown Ser/Thr kinase that phosphorylates NIPA (8.Ouyang T. Bai R.Y. Bassermann F. Von Klitzing C. Klumpen S. Miething C. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30028-30036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This Ser/Thr kinase may therefore be a candidate for NIPA phosphorylation at G2/M under physiological conditions. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser-354 and Ser-359 may require distinct kinases, potentially in an interdependent manner. The identification of these kinases will remain a subject of future investigation. In summary, we suggest a model where initial phosphorylation at Ser-354 and Ser-359 dissociates the SCFNIPA complex to initiate its inactivation and cyclin B1/Cdk1 enhances phosphorylation thereafter to ensure its own activity (Fig. 5).

Here we address the question of how PTPMEG2 is targeted to this subcellular location. Using a series of deletion mutants, we pinpointed the N-terminal Sec14p homology (SEC14) domain of PTPMEG2, residues 1-261, as the region containing the secretory vesicle targeting signal. This domain, alone or appended to a heterologous protein, was localized to intracellular vesicle membranes. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified a number of secretory vesicle proteins that interacted directly with the SEC14 domain of PTPMEG2, providing a mechanism for PTPMEG2 targeting to secretory vesicles. Two such proteins, mannose 6-phosphate receptor-interacting protein TIP47 and Arfaptin2, were found to alter PTPMEG2 localization when overexpressed, and elimination of TIP47 resulted in loss of PTPMEG2 function. We conclude that the N terminus of PTPMEG2 is necessary for the targeting of this phosphatase to the secretory vesicle compartment by association with other proteins involved in intracellular transport.

We conclude that the N terminus of PTPMEG2 is necessary for the targeting of this phosphatase to the secretory vesicle compartment by association with other proteins involved in intracellular transport. Proteins destined for secretion are synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes and are transported through the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus to the trans-Golgi network, where they are sorted into transport vesicles targeted for either the constitutive or the regulated secretory pathways. The latter transport vesicles fuse with each other to form condensing vacuoles referred to as immature secretory vesicles, which subsequently become mature secretory vesicles following an active concentration process that involves influx of more material via transport vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (anterograde transport) as well as removal of excess membrane and proteins by retrograde transport to the trans-Golgi network (1Roche P.A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By electron microscopy, this process can be seen as an increasingly dense core of matrix inside the maturing vesicle. Depending on cell type, mature dense core secretory vesicles have a diameter of 150-600 nm, each cell type containing a relatively narrow range of vesicle sizes. Mature secretory vesicles are stored in the cytoplasm of cells until triggered to undergo exocytosis (2Jahn R. Lang T. Suödhof T.

Immunol. 2006; 7: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Platelets contain numerous vesicles with clotting factors, vasoactive agents, and growth factors. Mast cells are specialized to degranulate large, dense core, secretory vesicles that contain histamine, vasoactive molecules, and leukotrienes upon stimulation by antigen-IgE complexes. Cytotoxic T cells contain specialized dense core granules with granzyme, perforin, and other lytic enzymes, which are released in a receptor-triggered and directional manner to kill target cells. In hematopoietic cells, secretory vesicles share many components with lysosomes and have been viewed as specialized lysosomes (4Page L.J. Darmon A.J. Uellner R. Griffiths G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A hallmark of the regulated secretory pathway is its response to extracellular stimuli. In both endocrine and hematopoietic cells, the use of this pathway can be up-regulated severalfold, and in some instances, the contents of the vesicles are acutely expelled in response to receptor triggering (4Page L.J. Darmon A.J. Uellner R. Griffiths G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, a key function of helper T cells in the initiation of an immune response is to actively secrete a number a cytokines, which recruit and activate other cell types involved in inflammation and the ensuing innate and adaptive immune responses. Depending on the subtype of helper T cell, these polypeptides include numerous interleukins (e.g. IL-2, -4, -5, and -12), interferons, and growth factors (e.g. for granulocytes and monocytes).

Structurally, PTPMEG2 is also unique among mammalian PTPs in that it contains a domain in its N terminus with homology to yeast Sec14p, a phosphatidylinositol-binding protein (10Sha B. Phillips S.E.

A physiological substrate for PTPMEG2 is the vesicle fusion protein N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), the dephosphorylation of which stimulates the homotypic fusion of secretory vesicles (9Huynh H. Bottini N. Williams S. Cherepanov V. Musumeci L. Saito K. Bruckner S. Vachon E. Wang X. Kruger J. Chow C-W. Pellecchia M. Monosov E. Greer P. Trimble W. Downey G.P. Mustelin T. Nat.

We recently reported that PTPMEG2-/- mice are immunodeficient and display severe developmental malformations, particularly evident as defective skull formation and intracranial bleeding (13Wang Y.

Mustelin T. Downey G.P. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1587-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The animals remain small, and the majority of them die before birth or within the first neonatal days. Platelet activation is defective, and T cells stimulated through their antigen receptors secrete very little interleukin-2 (13Wang Y. Vachon E. Cherepanov V. Li J. Zhang J. Saito K. Moraes T. Suzuki T. Chow C-W. Kruger J. Shannon P. Bottini N. Huynh H. Ni H. Yang H. McKerlie C. Quaggin S. Zhao Z.J. Marsden P.A. Siminovitch K.A. Mustelin T. Downey G.P. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1587-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All of these abnormalities may be caused by defective secretion. Indeed, electron microscopy of thymocytes and splenocytes from PTPMEG2-/- mice reveal that these cells have very few secretory vesicles of normal size and morphology (13Wang Y. Vachon E. Cherepanov V. Li J. Zhang J. Saito K. Moraes T. Suzuki T. Chow C-W. Kruger J. Shannon P. Bottini N. Huynh H. Ni H. Yang H. McKerlie C. Quaggin S. Zhao Z.J. Marsden P.A. Siminovitch K.A. Mustelin T.

More specifically, we have proposed (7Wang X. Huynh H. Gjoörloff-Wingren A. Monosov E. Stridsberg M. Fukuda M. Mustelin T. J.

Furthermore, maturing secretory vesicles normally maintain an equilibrium between continuing fusion events with incoming transport vesicles and a retrograde transport of excess membrane and unnecessary material back to the Golgi apparatus. This dynamic balance results in increasing concentration (“condensation”) of secretory vesicle contents and control of mature secretory vesicle size. It appears that PTPMEG2 regulates this balance by promoting fusion (anterograde transport) and reducing condensation (retrograde transport), thus increasing the size of secretory vesicles. An important step toward a more complete mechanistic understanding of PTPMEG2 function would be the elucidation of how this protein is targeted to the proper subcellular location. In this study, we asked which part of PTPMEG2 is responsible for targeting the protein to the secretory vesicle compartment, and then we sought to determine the proteins in this location with which the targeting domain of PTPMEG2 interacts.

To construct an expression vector for the C-terminal deletion mutants of PTPMEG2, cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1-261, 1-291, and 1-301 of PTPMEG2 were amplified by PCR and ligated into the EcoRI site of pEFHA vector. For expression of enhanced green fluorescent fusion proteins (EGFP), pEF5HA-EGFP vector was constructed by ligating the PCR-amplified EGFP-encoding sequence from pEGFP-N3 into pEF5HA vector using NotI and XbaI sites. The expression vectors for the N-terminal and C-terminal EGFP fusion proteins of PTPMEG2 were constructed by subcloning the cDNA for PTPMEG2 into the pEF5HA-EGFP vector using the XbaI site and EcoRI sites, respectively. The expression vector for the EGFP fusion protein of the N-terminal deletion of PTPMEG2 (ΔN-PTPMEG2-EGFP) was constructed by ligating the PCR-amplified cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 323-593 of PTPMEG2 into the XbaI site of the pEF5HA-EGFP vector. The expression vectors for TIP47, ARL6IP, Rab28, BNIP3, FKBP8, and amino acids 283-353 of TC-PTP were constructed by amplifying those cDNAs by PCR from the Jurkat cDNA library and ligating them into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pEF5V5 and pEF5F expression plasmids, which we constructed from pEF5HA by replacing the 5′ HA epitope tag encoding sequence with a sequence encoding the V5 tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) or the triple FLAG tag (DYKDDDDKG)3. All constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Cells and Transfections—RBL-2H3 mast cells, Jurkat T leukemia cells, and HeLa cells were kept at logarithmic growth in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Transient transfections of Jurkat cells were carried out by electroporation and RBL, HeLa, and 293T cells by liposome transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Electroporation conditions typically involved 2 × 107 cells and a total of 1-10 μg of plasmid DNA; in each transfection the amount of DNA was kept constant by adding empty vector. Cells were used for experiments 48 h after transfection. HeLa cells stably transfected with an RNA interference (RNAi) plasmid for TIP47 used the sequence CCC GGG GCT CAT TTC AAA C, starting at position 1435 in the 3′-untranslated region of the human TIP47 mRNA as a target. In brief, two complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized containing the above target sequence followed by a spacer of 9 nucleotides, the target sequence in reverse orientation, and a sequence of 5 thymidines as a terminator of transcription. Both primers were annealed and cloned into the pSHH plasmid (Biocarta, Carls-bad, CA) using the XhoI and XbaI restriction sites. The plasmid was transfected using Effectene (Qiagen) as a transfection reagent. Co-transfection of a plasmid containing a neomycin resistance gene was used, to allow the selection of cells stably expressing the RNAi vector. The derived HeLa clones were assayed by immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting for the suppression of TIP47. A single clone in which TIP47 expression was reduced by more than 90% was used for all further experiments. Immunoblots and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as before (9Huynh H.

Briefly, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in freshly made 3.7% formaldehyde. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin and 2.5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were mounted onto glass slides and viewed under a confocal laser scanning microscopy FluoView™ FV1000 (Olympus American, Melville, NY). Differential interference contrast images were taken of most cells. For three-dimensional reconstructions, 20 serial z-sections were taken at 0.5-μm increments. The serial sections were then processed by using the software program Volocity (Volocity2 Pro Image3, LLC). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The cDNA encoding the N-terminal SEC14 domain of PTPMEG2 (amino acids 1-326) was subcloned into the pGilda vector to generate in-frame fusion proteins with the LexA DNA-binding domain and used as bait. Library screening by the yeast two-hybrid method was performed according to the manual of Origen Technologies (Rockville, MD). Briefly, the yeast EGY48 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MAT, trp1, ura3, his, leu2::plexApo6-leu2) was first transformed with the bait plasmid and the lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18-34 and then with a human Jurkat T cell pJG4-5 cDNA library. A total of 6 million transformants were assayed for growth on leucine-deficient SD plates. Positive colonies were then reassayed for growth and for β-galactosidase activity on the leucine-deficient SD plates. The cDNA inserts of isolated library plasmids from these LEU+/lacZ+ clones were amplified by PCR and sequenced. The obtained sequence tags were subjected to BLAST searches to identify the genes. Subcellular Location of PTPMEG2 Deletion Mutants—Expression of PTPMEG2 in Jurkat T cells, RBL mast cells, or COS cells results in the accumulation of nearly all the epitope-tagged protein on the surface of large vesicles, which represent fused and enlarged secretory vesicles (6Gjoörloff-Wingren A.

Such vesicles also formed when a fusion protein of PTPMEG2 and EGFP (Fig. 1a) was expressed in RBL mast cells (Fig. 1b), Jurkat T cells, or HeLa cells (not shown). They were readily visualized in live cells as well and remained stable for many hours in untreated cells. Similar results were obtained with both N- and C-terminal fusions of EGFP, except that the former gave rise to somewhat smaller vesicles. In contrast, a fusion protein of PTPMEG2 lacking the first 322 amino acid residues with EGFP (ΔN-PTPMEG2-EGFP) was diffusely cytoplasmic (Fig. 1c). Thus it appears that amino acid residues 1-322, which comprise the SEC14 domain and the linker region (residues 251-322), contain the necessary motif(s) for vesicle targeting. In a reciprocal approach, HA-tagged constructs of the N terminus of PTPMEG2 with increasing portions of the linker region were constructed, expressed in RBL cells (Fig. 1d) or HeLa cells (not shown), and visualized with Alexa488-conjugated anti-HA antibodies after the cells were fixed. Although only full-length PTPMEG2 caused the formation of large fused vesicles (because it is catalytically active), fusion proteins containing amino acid residues 1-261, 1-291, 1-301, and 1-326 were vesicular (Fig. 1, e-g). Their intracellular pattern was very similar to that of the catalytically inactive full-length PTPMEG2-C515S (6Gjoörloff-Wingren A. Oh P. Saxena M. Han S. Wang X. Williams S. Schnitzer J. Mustelin T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Wang X. Huynh H. Gjoörloff-Wingren A. Monosov E. Stridsberg M. Fukuda M. Mustelin T. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4612-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Very similar results were obtained using EGFP fusion proteins of the same PTPMEG2 constructs (not shown). We concluded that amino acids 1-261 contain sufficient vesicle targeting information. This region coincides with the SEC14 domain. Identification of Proteins Interacting with the MEG2 N Terminus—To gain some insight into the mechanism by which the SEC14 domain of PTPMEG2 targets to the secretory vesicle membrane, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the SEC14 domain plus linker as bait. Amino acid residues 1-326 of PTPMEG2 were cloned into the “bait” vector pGilda, which was transfected into yeast together with a Jurkat cDNA library in the “prey” vector pJG4-5. 43 positive clones, retained after two rounds of specificity testing, were subsequently sequenced and found to encode eight different proteins, all of which are known to be at least partly localized to post-Golgi vesicle membranes, including transport vesicles, secretory vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. These proteins were the mannose 6-phosphate receptor-associated protein TIP47 (gi 20127486), Arfaptin2 (gi 6912602), vesicle-associated transporter 1 (VAT1; gi 18379349), the GTPase Rab28 (gi 4758994), adenovirus E1B-19K/Bcl2-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3; gi 7669481), and FK506-binding protein 8 (FKBP8; gi 5630440) (Fig. 2a), as well as Arf-like protein 6-interacting protein (ARL6IP; Gi 24308007) and the C terminus of the 48-kDa isoform of TC-PTP (not shown). These eight proteins were taken as candidates for PTPMEG2 interactors potentially involved in targeting of PTPMEG2 to secretory vesicles or possibly to other intracellular membranes. Co-immunoprecipitation of Vesicle Traffic Proteins with PTPMEG2—To determine whether the potential interactors physically associate with PTPMEG2 strongly enough to with-stand detergent lysis and immunoprecipitation, we cloned seven of the potential interactors into the pEF5F expression plasmid, which we constructed from pEF5HA by replacing the 5′ HA epitope tag-encoding sequence with a sequence encoding a triple FLAG tag. All seven proteins expressed well in transfected Jurkat cells (Fig. 2b, bottom row) or 293T cells (not shown), and they all co-immunoprecipitated PTPMEG2-(1-326), albeit to various extents (Fig. 2b, top row). Arfaptin2 and FKBP8 co-immunoprecipitated the highest amounts of PTPMEG2, whereas TIP47 immunoprecipitated much less and VAT-1 not at all. The reciprocal experiment, namely co-immunoprecipitation of the interacting proteins with PTPMEG2, gave similar results. The interaction between TIP47 and PTPMEG2 was confirmed in additional experiments but was always of low stoichiometry. Co-localization and Effects on PTPMEG2 Function—Next we examined by confocal microscopy whether the interacting proteins co-localized with PTPMEG2 and whether they influenced the effect of PTPMEG2 on secretory vesicle size. The accumulation of PTPMEG2 on a large vesicle makes co-localization readily detectable (7Wang X. Huynh H. Gjoörloff-Wingren A. Monosov E. Stridsberg M. Fukuda M. Mustelin T. J.

Nika K. Ishihara H. Godzik A. Mustelin T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6661-6671Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When the seven potential interactors were co-expressed with PTPMEG2 in RBP mast calls (Fig. 3) and the cells stained for the FLAG and HA tags, a number of different patterns were seen. TIP47 (Fig. 3b) showed only a little co-localization but consistently caused a further enlargement of the already large PTPMEG2-containing vesicle. In contrast, Arfaptin2 (Fig. 3c) prevented PTPMEG2 from accumulating on a large vesicle at all. This could be due to inhibition of PTPMEG2-induced fusion, accelerated fission, PTPMEG2 mislocalization, or other mechanisms. Notably, PTPMEG2 and Arfaptin2 showed a great deal of colocalization on granular and small vesicle-like structures. VAT1 (Fig. 3d) did not co-localize or affect PTPMEG2 distribution at all (Fig. 3d), in agreement with its low ability to co-immunoprecipitate with PTPMEG2 (Fig. 2b). ARL6IP (Fig. 3e) and FKBP8 (Fig. 3f) both showed a pattern of partial co-localization with clear enrichment on the PTPMEG2-positive vesicle, as well as some staining of other parts of the cell. FKBP8 appeared to decrease the size of the PTPMEG2-containing fused vesicle and to increase the amount of PTPMEG2 on small granules. BNIP3 showed a pattern similar to VAT1 (not shown), whereas Rab28 staining resembled FKBP8 staining (not shown). In Jurkat T cells, most of the interacting proteins showed very similar staining patterns as in RBL cells, with two exceptions: TIP47 was expressed at lower levels and accumulated in a set of small vesicles in the close vicinity of the large PTPMEG2-containing vesicle, which also was somewhat larger in these cells when TIP47 was co-expressed (Fig. 4, b-d). Interestingly, some of the TIP47-positive vesicles touched the PTPMEG2-positive vesicle, and there appeared to be vesicles with both proteins (Fig. 4e). This may indicate a role for TIP47 in the transport of PTPMEG2 from the Golgi/trans-Golgi network to the large fused secretory vesicle. Also VAT1 had a somewhat different subcellular distribution in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4f) compared with RBL cells; more VAT1 was close to the plasma membrane, and a small portion of VAT1 co-localized wit"
https://openalex.org/W2054778954,"Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be purified from serum of chronically-infected patients in the form of Lipo-Viro-Particles (LVP), which are triglycerid-rich lipoprotein-like particles containing viral RNA and proteins. Since LVP is a constant feature of chronically infected patients, we asked whether purified LVP could interfere with the immune response by acting directly on dendritic cell (DC) function. Methods and Findings We have analyzed the impact of LVP on the maturation monocyte-derived DC induced by TLR3 or TLR4 ligands. Following incubation with LVP, immature DC supported weak transient HCV-RNA replication and type I IFN synthesis. This, however, did not lead to viral particle production nor to maturation of DC. LVP-treatment prior to TLR3 stimulation by polyI:C only enhanced the secretion of IL-12, IL-6 and TNFα yielding typical mature DC. In contrast, LVP-treated DC activated by the TLR4 ligand LPS yielded phenotypically mature DC with reduced capacity to secrete both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Their ability to stimulate allogeneic T lymphocytes was strongly affected since activated T cells produced IL-5 and IL-13 instead of IFNγ. Addition of IFNα prevented the effect of LVP on DC function. Restoration of IFNγ secretion by T cells was obtained by blocking ERK activation in DC, while induction of IL-5 and IL-13 secretion was inhibited by blocking the p38-MAPK pathway in DC. Conclusions LVP can interfere with TLR4-triggered maturation of DC, inducing a shift in DC function that stimulates Th2 cells instead of Th1, by a mechanism that is ERK- and p38-MAPK-dependent. The effect of LVP on DC polarization was reversed by IFNα, providing an additional rationale for the interferon therapy of chronically-infected patients. By acting on TLR4 pathway with LVP, HCV may thus exploit a natural protective mechanism of the liver and the intestine normally used to control inflammation and immunity to commensal microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W1997579482,"Background Proper regulation of the cohesion at the centromeres of human chromosomes is essential for accurate genome transmission. Exactly how cohesion is maintained and is then dissolved in anaphase is not understood. Principal Findings We have investigated the role of the cohesin complex at centromeres in human cells both by depleting cohesin subunits using RNA interference and also by expressing a non-cleavable version of the Rad21 cohesin protein. Rad21 depletion results in aberrant anaphase, during which the sister chromatids separate and segregate in an asynchronous fashion. However, centromere cohesion was maintained before anaphase in Rad21-depleted cells, and the primary constrictions at centromeres were indistinguishable from those in control cells. Expression of non-cleavable Rad21 (NC-Rad21), in which the sites normally cleaved by separase are mutated, resulted in delayed sister chromatid resolution in prophase and prometaphase, and a blockage of chromosome arm separation in anaphase, but did not impede centromere separation. Conclusions These data indicate that cohesin complexes are dispensable for sister cohesion in early mitosis, yet play an important part in the fidelity of sister separation and segregation during anaphase. Cleavage at the separase-sensitive sites of Rad21 is important for arm separation, but not for centromere separation."
https://openalex.org/W2001589509,"Why is it hard to divide attention between dissimilar activities, such as reading and listening to a conversation? We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study interference between simple auditory and visual decisions, independently of motor competition. Overlapping activity for auditory and visual tasks performed in isolation was found in lateral prefrontal regions, middle temporal cortex and parietal cortex. When the visual stimulus occurred during the processing of the tone, its activation in prefrontal and middle temporal cortex was suppressed. Additionally, reduced activity was seen in modality-specific visual cortex. These results paralleled impaired awareness of the visual event. Even without competing motor responses, a simple auditory decision interferes with visual processing on different neural levels, including prefrontal cortex, middle temporal cortex and visual regions."
https://openalex.org/W2013670750,"By comparative DNA fingerprinting, we identified a 357-bp DNA fragment frequently amplified in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC). This fragment overlaps with an expressed sequence tag mapped to 7q22. Further 5' and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends revealed that it is part of a novel, single-exon gene with full-length mRNA of 2052 bp and encodes a nuclear protein of 109 amino acids ( approximately 15 kDa). This gene, designated as gene amplified in esophageal cancer 1 (GAEC1), was located within a 1-2 Mb amplicon at 7q22.1 identified by high-resolution 1 Mb array-comparative genomic hybridization in 6/10 ESCC cell lines. GAEC1 was ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues including esophageal and gastrointestinal organs; with amplification and overexpression in 6/10 (60%) ESCC cell lines and 34/99 (34%) primary tumors. Overexpression of GAEC1 in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts caused foci formation and colony formation in soft agar, comparable to H-ras and injection of GAEC1-transfected 3T3 cells into athymic nude mice formed undifferentiated sarcoma in vivo, indicating that GAEC1 is a transforming oncogene. Although no significant correlation was observed between GAEC1 amplification and clinicopathological parameters and prognosis, our study demonstrated that overexpressed GAEC1 has tumorigenic potential and suggest that overexpressed GAEC1 may play an important role in ESCC pathogenesis."
