We profiled transcriptomes of ∼6,000 single cells from 18 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, including five matched pairs of primary tumors and lymph node metastases. Stromal and immune cells had consistent expression programs across patients. Conversely, malignant cells varied within and between tumors in their expression of signatures related to cell cycle, stress, hypoxia, epithelial differentiation, and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (p-EMT). Cells expressing the p-EMT program spatially localized to the leading edge of primary tumors. By integrating single-cell transcriptomes with bulk expression profiles for hundreds of tumors, we refined HNSCC subtypes by their malignant and stromal composition and established p-EMT as an independent predictor of nodal metastasis, grade, and adverse pathologic features. Our results provide insight into the HNSCC ecosystem and define stromal interactions and a p-EMT program associated with metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2772451653,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and intracellular tau inclusions. However, the exact mechanistic link between these two AD lesions remains enigmatic. Through injection of human AD-brain-derived pathological tau (AD-tau) into Aβ plaque-bearing mouse models that do not overexpress tau, we recapitulated the formation of three major types of AD-relevant tau pathologies: tau aggregates in dystrophic neurites surrounding Aβ plaques (NP tau), AD-like neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads (NTs). These distinct tau pathologies have different temporal onsets and functional consequences on neural activity and behavior. Notably, we found that Aβ plaques created a unique environment that facilitated the rapid amplification of proteopathic AD-tau seeds into large tau aggregates, initially appearing as NP tau, which was followed by the formation and spread of NFTs and NTs, likely through secondary seeding events. Our study provides insights into a new multistep mechanism underlying Aβ plaque-associated tau pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2772691327,"Musicians can perform at different tempos, speakers can control the cadence of their speech, and children can flexibly vary their temporal expectations of events. To understand the neural basis of such flexibility, we recorded from the medial frontal cortex of nonhuman primates trained to produce different time intervals with different effectors. Neural responses were heterogeneous, nonlinear, and complex, and they exhibited a remarkable form of temporal invariance: firing rate profiles were temporally scaled to match the produced intervals. Recording from downstream neurons in the caudate and from thalamic neurons projecting to the medial frontal cortex indicated that this phenomenon originates within cortical networks. Recurrent neural network models trained to perform the task revealed that temporal scaling emerges from nonlinearities in the network and that the degree of scaling is controlled by the strength of external input. These findings demonstrate a simple and general mechanism for conferring temporal flexibility upon sensorimotor and cognitive functions. Humans can deliberately control the timing of their actions but the neural mechanisms underlying such control are largely unknown. In this article, Wang, Narain and their colleagues report that such flexibility emerges in rhesus monkeys from the ability of their brain to flexibly control the speed at which cortical responses unfold in time."
https://openalex.org/W2772430771,"Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis during stress responses, but its role in lung fibrosis is unknown. Here we found that the activity and expression of iodothyronine deiodinase 2 (DIO2), an enzyme that activates TH, were higher in lungs from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis than in control individuals and were correlated with disease severity. We also found that Dio2-knockout mice exhibited enhanced bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Aerosolized TH delivery increased survival and resolved fibrosis in two models of pulmonary fibrosis in mice (intratracheal bleomycin and inducible TGF-β1). Sobetirome, a TH mimetic, also blunted bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. After bleomycin-induced injury, TH promoted mitochondrial biogenesis, improved mitochondrial bioenergetics and attenuated mitochondria-regulated apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. TH did not blunt fibrosis in Ppargc1a- or Pink1-knockout mice, suggesting dependence on these pathways. We conclude that the antifibrotic properties of TH are associated with protection of alveolar epithelial cells and restoration of mitochondrial function and that TH may thus represent a potential therapy for pulmonary fibrosis."

Secretory and transmembrane proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as unfolded polypeptides and emerge as folded and processed proteins. The protein folding capacity of the ER, as measured by its luminal volume and the levels of its protein-folding and processing machinery, is matched to the inward flux of secretory and transmembrane proteins by an unfolded protein response (UPR) (Cox et al., 1997Cox J.S.

A stress signal arising from an imbalance between unfolded proteins and the ER machinery is recognized by three ER-localized transmembrane proteins—IRE1, PERK, and ATF6—that affect a rectifying transcriptional and translational response to restore protein-folding homeostasis (reviewed in Walter and Ron, 2011Walter P.

Although a good deal is known about the effector functions of the UPR transducers, the physiological significance of ER stress, and the response to it (reviewed in Wang and Kaufman, 2016Wang M.

Dimerization emerges as a key upstream event both in IRE1 activation and in activation of PERK, which shares with IRE1 a structurally related ER-stress-sensing luminal domain (Harding et al., 1999Harding H.P.

Crystal structures reveal transient PERK luminal domain tetramerization in endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling.EMBO J. 2015; 34: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Two hypotheses have been put forth to explain the coupling of ER stress to dimerization. In one hypothesis, unfolded proteins are proposed to serve as activating ligands by directly binding to the luminal domain and stabilizing it in a dimeric conformation. An alternative hypothesis holds that the UPR is organized along principles similar to its cytosolic counterpart, the heat shock response, in which an imbalance between unfolded proteins and heat shock protein (Hsp)70 chaperones is recognized via the former’s ability to compete for the latter, kinetically disrupting repressive complexes between chaperones and stress transducers (Abravaya et al., 1992Abravaya K. Myers M.P. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I.

Microbiol. 1998; 30: 567-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The IRE1 luminal domain crystallizes as a dimer, which, in the yeast protein, is traversed by a groove that could engage an extended peptide as a stabilizing ligand (Credle et al., 2005Credle J.J. Finer-Moore J.S. Papa F.R. Stroud R.M. Walter P. On the mechanism of sensing unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 18773-18784Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Yeast IRE1LD peptide ligands have been identified, but when added to solutions of yeast IRE1LD, they principally affect a transition from a collection of oligomers to higher-order oligomers (Gardner and Walter, 2011Gardner B.M. Walter P. Unfolded proteins are Ire1-activating ligands that directly induce the unfolded protein response.Science. 2011; 333: 1891-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of mammalian IRE1LD and the related PERKLD, the groove is occluded (Carrara et al., 2015aCarrara M. Prischi F. Nowak P.R. Ali M.M. Crystal structures reveal transient PERK luminal domain tetramerization in endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling.EMBO J. 2015; 34: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 2006Zhou J.

USA. 2006; 103: 14343-14348Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mammalian IRE1LD is a dimer even in pure, dilute conditions (Liu et al., 2000Liu C.Y. Schröder M. Kaufman R.J. Ligand-independent dimerization activates the stress response kinases IRE1 and PERK in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 2006Zhou J. Liu C.Y. Back S.H. Clark R.L. Peisach D. Xu Z. Kaufman R.J.

USA. 2006; 103: 14343-14348Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of unfolded protein binding in promoting the monomer-to-dimer transition that initiates UPR signaling remains unclear. The ER lumen has a single Hsp70 chaperone, BiP. Reversible chaperone repression as the regulatory principle of UPR activity is supported by an inverse correlation between IRE1 activity and the amount of the ER-localized BiP recovered in complex with it (Bertolotti et al., 2000Bertolotti A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18728-18735Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in yeast BiP (Kar2p) that stabilize the BiP-IRE1LD interaction repress the UPR (Kimata et al., 2003Kimata Y. Kimata Y.I. Shimizu Y. Abe H. Farcasanu I.C. Takeuchi M. Rose M.D. Kohno K. Genetic evidence for a role of BiP/Kar2 that regulates Ire1 in response to accumulation of unfolded proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2559-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and only unfolded proteins that engage BiP can induce the UPR (Ng et al., 1992Ng D.T. Watowich S.S. Lamb R.A. Analysis in vivo of GRP78-BiP/substrate interactions and their role in induction of the GRP78-BiP gene.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, beyond plausibility suggested by these correlative cell-biological findings and the argument of evolutionary analogy, this model was otherwise unsupported. Hsp70 chaperones undergo a nucleotide-binding and hydrolysis-dependent cycle that dramatically alters their affinity for substrates. The intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70s is low, and ATPase-accelerating J-protein co-chaperones are therefore required for efficient substrate recognition and binding by Hsp70 (reviewed in Kampinga and Craig, 2010Kampinga H.H. Craig E.A. The HSP70 chaperone machinery: J proteins as drivers of functional specificity.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, Mayer, 2013Mayer M.P. Hsp70 chaperone dynamics and molecular mechanism.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 507-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This feature arises from the ability of the co-chaperones to stimulate the ATPase activity of the Hsp70 via their conserved J domains while presenting diverse substrates to the Hsp70 via their divergent targeting domains. As a consequence, the Hsp70 initially interacts with substrates in a high-kon, ATP-bound state and then retains the substrate in a low-koff, ADP-bound state. Cycles of substrate release, accelerated by nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs, reviewed in Behnke et al., 2015Behnke J. Feige M.J. Hendershot L.M. BiP and its nucleotide exchange factors Grp170 and Sil1: mechanisms of action and biological functions.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 1589-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and rebinding, specified by the J domain co-chaperone, result in substrate-selective ultra-affinity (De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014De Los Rios P. Barducci A. Hsp70 chaperones are non-equilibrium machines that achieve ultra-affinity by energy consumption.eLife. 2014; 3: e02218Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, Misselwitz et al., 1998Misselwitz B.

Cell. 1998; 2: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) that is the basis for formation of Hsp70-substrate complexes. Here, we drew on these well-established principles to examine the possibility that past failures to obtain biochemical support for reversible BiP-mediated repression as the basis for UPR regulation arose from the absence of a suitable ER-localized co-chaperone in the experimental systems used. Hsp70s are recruited to their substrates by J-domain-containing co-chaperones (J-proteins). To examine the potential role of ER-localized J-proteins (ERdjs) in recruiting BiP to IRE1 to repress signaling, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to systematically inactivate the genes encoding the eight known ERdjs in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that expressed an XBP1s::Turquoise reporter of IRE1 RNase activity and a CHOP::GFP reporter primarily under the control of PERK. The two reporters responded in parallel to drug-induced unfolded protein stress (Figures 1A, inset, and S1A). Deletion of ERdj2 (Sec63) strongly activated both reporters (Figure 1A), consistent with a role for this co-chaperone in supporting BiP-mediated ER-protein-folding homeostasis or in repression of both IRE1 and PERK. In contrast, deletion of ERdj4 preferentially activated the XBP1::Turquoise reporter. The minor activation of CHOP::GFP observed in the ΔERdj4 cells was completely suppressed by treatment with the IRE1 inhibitor 4μ8c (Figure 1B), indicating that it arose not from PERK activation but rather from IRE1’s downstream contribution to CHOP induction (Wang et al., 1998Wang X.Z. Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Jolicoeur E.M. Kuroda M. Ron D. Cloning of mammalian Ire1 reveals diversity in the ER stress responses.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5708-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that, unlike ΔERdj2, activation of the IRE1 branch by ΔERdj4 is unlikely to reflect solely compromised ER protein folding. The ability of ERdj4 to repress IRE1 was dependent on the integrity of its J domain and its C-terminal targeting domain. Wild-type (WT) ERdj4 attenuated IRE1 activity in ΔERdj4 cells, but H54Q mutant ERdj4 (ERdj4QPD, disrupting the motif required for productive interactions with Hsp70, Wall et al., 1994Wall D. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. The NH2-terminal 108 amino acids of the Escherichia coli DnaJ protein stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK and are sufficient for lambda replication.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5446-5451PubMed Google Scholar) was largely inert (Figures 1C and S1B). Expression of an ER-localized truncated ERdj4 fused to mCherry (ERdj4 residues 1–90, containing the J domain, but lacking the C-terminal targeting domain), failed to attenuate IRE1 activity in ΔERdj4 cells and instead further activated both the IRE1 and PERK reporters (Figure S1C). This feature required integrity of the J domain (compare the red and green traces in Figure S1C) and is consistent with the ability of a deregulated J domain to perturb protein-folding homeostasis in the ER. Phosphorylation of endogenous IRE1α was consistently higher in ΔERdj4 CHO cells but increased further during ER stress (Figure 1D), a feature shared by the XBP1::Turquoise reporter (Figure S1D). These findings are consistent with a J-domain- and targeting-domain-dependent role for ERdj4 in the repression of endogenous IRE1 signaling. A special relationship between ERdj4 and the IRE1 branch of the UPR is further suggested by the selective regulation of the ERdj4 gene by IRE1/XBP1 activity (Adamson et al., 2016Adamson B. Norman T.M. Jost M. Cho M.Y. Nuñez J.K. Chen Y. Villalta J.E. Gilbert L.A. Horlbeck M.A. Hein M.Y. et al.A Multiplexed Single-Cell CRISPR Screening Platform Enables Systematic Dissection of the Unfolded Protein Response.Cell. 2016; 167: 1867-1882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2003Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. XBP-1 regulates a subset of endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone genes in the unfolded protein response.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar) and by the phenotype of ERdj4 inactivation in mice, which mimics XBP1 overexpression (Fritz and Weaver, 2014Fritz J.M. Weaver T.E. The BiP cochaperone ERdj4 is required for B cell development and function.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e107473Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The notion that ERdj4 may repress IRE1 directly was further supported by evidence that it plays a role in formation of the (hypothesized) repressive BiP-IRE1LD complex: the amount of BiP recovered in complex with endogenous IRE1α from ΔERdj4 cells was reduced by half relative to the WT cells (Figures 1E and 1F). To further probe ERdj4’s role in BiP recruitment to IRE1LD, we replaced the cytosolic effector domain of IRE1 with glutathione S-transferase (GST), yielding a convenient sensor comprised of IRE1α’s luminal and transmembrane domain fused to cytosolic GST and uncoupled from downstream signaling (Figure 2A). IRE1LD-GST recovered by glutathione affinity chromatography from ΔERdj4 cells was associated with some BiP. However, in ΔERdj4 cells, co-transfection of IRE1LD-GST with WT ERdj4 increased the recovery of BiP by 2.5-fold compared with co-transfection of ERdj4QPD (Figures 2B and 2C). ERdj4 expression did not increase the recovery of BiP in complex with the luminal domain of PERK (Figure 2D). ERdj6, another UPR-induced ER-localized J-protein, did not increase recovery of BiP in complex with IRE1LD-GST (Figure 2E). ERdj4 thus has a specific capacity to promote a BiP-IRE1LD complex. The luminal domain of IRE1 consists of a structured core region (CLD, core luminal domain) and a presumably unstructured tail region leading to the transmembrane domain (Zhou et al., 2006Zhou J. Liu C.Y. Back S.H. Clark R.L. Peisach D. Xu Z. Kaufman R.J. The crystal structure of human IRE1 luminal domain reveals a conserved dimerization interface required for activation of the unfolded protein response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 14343-14348Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). IRE1LD mutants with truncations in the tail region are reported to associate with less BiP than full-length IRE1LD do and, though regulated, have higher constitutive activity when overexpressed in ΔIRE1 cells, leading to the suggestion that BiP binds to the IRE1LD tail region to repress IRE1 signaling (Oikawa et al., 2009Oikawa D. Kimata Y. Kohno K. Iwawaki T. Activation of mammalian IRE1alpha upon ER stress depends on dissociation of BiP rather than on direct interaction with unfolded proteins.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 2496-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, in ΔERdj4 cells, ERdj4 was still able to increase BiP recovery with IRE1CLD-GST (Figure 2F), indicating its ability to act on the CLD. BiP has been reported to associate with IRE1LD in a nucleotide-independent manner via its nucleotide-binding domain rather than conventionally, by its substrate-binding domain (Carrara et al., 2015bCarrara M. Prischi F. Nowak P.R. Kopp M.C. Ali M.M. Noncanonical binding of BiP ATPase domain to Ire1 and Perk is dissociated by unfolded protein CH1 to initiate ER stress signaling.eLife. 2015; 4: e03522Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, addition of ATP destabilized both the BiP-IRE1LD-GST complex and the endogenous BiP-IRE1 complex (Figures 2G and 2H). Together, these findings indicate that BiP engages the core structured region of IRE1LD as a canonical Hsp70 substrate, an event that can be promoted by ERdj4. To determine whether the ERdj4-promoted BiP-IRE1LD complex influenced the IRE1LD monomer-dimer transition that initiates the UPR, we sought to establish a method to measure endogenous IRE1LD dimerization in cells. The crystal structure of dimeric, active human IRE1LD reveals a polar interaction between the side chains of Q105 from opposing protomers (Figure 3A, PDB: 2HZ6). Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homologous recombination, we replaced this residue with a cysteine at the endogenous Ern1/Ire1α locus. IRE1Q105C CHO cells retained the ability to mount a UPR (Figures 3B and S2). IRE1Q105C is expressed at a lower level than WT IRE1, possibly because it is less stable in cells. This decreased expression level likely accounts for the attenuated induction of the IRE1 branch of the UPR in IRE1Q105C cells (Figure S2). Despite its lower level of expression, ER stress induction by thapsigargin-mediated luminal calcium depletion effected formation of a disulfide in the IRE1Q105C mutant cells (Figure 3C), reflecting the close proximity of the cysteines in the activated dimer and providing a readout for stress-relevant IRE1LD dimer formation in vivo.Figure S2ERN1Q105C/IRE1Q105C Encodes a Functional (albeit Attenuated) IRE1, Related to Figure 3Show full captionHistogram of XBP1s::Turquoise and CHOP::GFP signals obtained by flow cytometry analysis of the indicated cell lines untreated or exposed overnight to 2-deoxyglucose (2DG, 4mM), or tunicamycin (Tm, 2.5 μg/ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Histogram of XBP1s::Turquoise and CHOP::GFP signals obtained by flow cytometry analysis of the indicated cell lines untreated or exposed overnight to 2-deoxyglucose (2DG, 4mM), or tunicamycin (Tm, 2.5 μg/ml). A modified version of IRE1LD-GST with the Q105C mutation was used to gauge the effect of ERdj4 on the monomer-dimer ratio (Figure 3D). Unlike endogenous IRE1Q105C, exogenously expressed IRE1LD Q105C-GST is abundant and spontaneously forms disulfide-linked IRE1LD Q105C-GST dimers (Figure 3E). When co-transfected, WT ERdj4 decreased by 2.5-fold the fraction of disulfide-linked, dimeric IRE1LD Q105C-GST. ERdj4QPD had no effect on the monomer-to-dimer ratio (Figures 3E and 3F). To determine whether ERdj4 promoted the BiP-IRE1LD complex by directly recruiting BiP to IRE1LD, we purified the three proteins from bacteria (Figure 4A). IRE1LD was tagged with biotin on its C terminus (IRE1LD-bio). Formation of a BiP-IRE1LD-bio complex was assessed by recovery on immobilized streptavidin (Figure 4B). BiP and IRE1LD formed a complex only in the presence of ERdj4 and ATP (Figure 4C, lanes 2, 4, and 9). Like its in vivo counterpart (Figures 2G and 2H), the isolated BiP-IRE1LD complex thus formed was sensitive to disruption by incubation with ATP (Figure 4C, upper panel; the residual BiP eluted with SDS, lower panel, reflects incompleteness of the preceding ATP elution). The ERdj4QPD mutation and mutations in BiP that interfered with its ATPase activity (BiPT229A) or substrate binding (BiPV461F) greatly enfeebled complex formation (Figure 4C, lanes 5, 7, and 8). Association of BiP’s isolated nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) with the IRE1LD was not observed (Figure S3A), pointing away from the non-canonical IRE1-BiP interaction (previously suggested by Carrara et al., 2015bCarrara M.

The isolated J domain of ERdj4 retained some ability to promote a BiP-IRE1LD complex (Figure 4C, lane 6) but was reproducibly weaker than full-length ERdj4, attesting to the importance of the C-terminal targeting domain of ERdj4. It is likely that multiple BiP molecules engaged the IRE1LD-bio via multiple binding sites or as BiP oligomers (Figure S3B). In the presence of ATP, ERdj4 also recruited BiP to the biotinylated core IRE1CLD, indicating that the IRE1LD tail region is not essential for complex formation between IRE1 and BiP (Figure 4D). To determine whether ERdj4 and BiP interfere with IRE1LD dimerization in vitro, we produced a non-biotinylated, tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TAMRA)-labeled fluorescent IRE1LD probe (IRE1LD-TAM) and measured the effect of BiP, ERdj4, and ATP on recovery of IRE1LD-TAM in complex with IRE1LD-bio (Figure 4E). Consistent with the high affinity of IRE1LD protomers for each other, IRE1LD-TAM formed a stable complex with IRE1LD-bio that was readily recovered on immobilized streptavidin. However, introduction of WT BiP, WT ERdj4, and ATP interfered with the IRE1LD dimer while forming a BiP-IRE1LD-bio complex (Figure 4F). Completion of the BiP cycle by addition of the nucleotide exchange factor GRP170/ORP150 significantly increased the amount of BiP recovered with IRE1LD-bio and further attenuated recovery of IRE1LD-TAM (Figures 4G, 4H, and S3C). Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) was used to dissect ERdj4-mediated BiP recruitment to IRE1LD. IRE1LD-bio immobilized onto the BLI sensor readily associated with both WT ERdj4 and mutant ERdj4QPD, generating a robust BLI signal (Figure 5A). The isolated J domain of ERdj4 did not interact with the IRE1LD-bio sensor, implicating the C-terminal domain"
https://openalex.org/W2772653075,"Given the importance of ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) in oncogenic pathways, identification of USP7 inhibitors has attracted considerable interest. Despite substantial efforts, however, the development of validated deubiquitinase (DUB) inhibitors that exhibit drug-like properties and a well-defined mechanism of action has proven particularly challenging. In this article, we describe the identification, optimization and detailed characterization of highly potent (IC50 < 10 nM), selective USP7 inhibitors together with their less active, enantiomeric counterparts. We also disclose, for the first time, co-crystal structures of a human DUB enzyme complexed with small-molecule inhibitors, which reveal a previously undisclosed allosteric binding site. Finally, we report the identification of cancer cell lines hypersensitive to USP7 inhibition (EC50 < 30 nM) and demonstrate equal or superior activity in these cell models compared to clinically relevant MDM2 antagonists. Overall, these findings demonstrate the tractability and druggability of DUBs, and provide important tools for additional target validation studies."
https://openalex.org/W2774170088,"TET enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which can lead to DNA demethylation. However, direct connections between TET-mediated DNA demethylation and transcriptional output are difficult to establish owing to challenges in distinguishing global versus locus-specific effects. Here we show that TET1, TET2 and TET3 triple-knockout (TKO) human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) exhibit prominent bivalent promoter hypermethylation without an overall corresponding decrease in gene expression in the undifferentiated state. Focusing on the bivalent PAX6 locus, we find that increased DNMT3B binding is associated with promoter hypermethylation, which precipitates a neural differentiation defect and failure of PAX6 induction during differentiation. dCas9-mediated locus-specific demethylation and global inactivation of DNMT3B in TKO hESCs partially reverses the hypermethylation at the PAX6 promoter and improves differentiation to neuroectoderm. Taking these findings together with further genome-wide methylation and TET1 and DNMT3B ChIP-seq analyses, we conclude that TET proteins safeguard bivalent promoters from de novo methylation to ensure robust lineage-specific transcription upon differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2772722011,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) produce most cellular energy through glycolysis rather than through mitochondrial respiration. Consistent with this notion, mitochondrial mass has been reported to be low in HSCs. However, we found that staining with MitoTracker Green, a commonly used dye to measure mitochondrial content, leads to artefactually low fluorescence specifically in HSCs because of dye efflux. Using mtDNA quantification, enumeration of mitochondrial nucleoids, and fluorescence intensity of a genetically encoded mitochondrial reporter, we unequivocally show here that HSCs and multipotential progenitors (MPPs) have higher mitochondrial mass than lineage-committed progenitors and mature cells. Despite similar mitochondrial mass, respiratory capacity of MPPs exceeds that of HSCs. Furthermore, although elevated mitophagy has been invoked to explain low mitochondrial mass in HSCs, we observed that mitochondrial turnover capacity is comparatively low in HSCs. We propose that the role of mitochondria in HSC biology may have to be revisited in light of these findings."

https://openalex.org/W2771593474,"Tumor hypoxia is associated with poor patient survival and is a characteristic of glioblastoma. Notch signaling is implicated in maintaining glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) within the hypoxic niche, although the molecular mechanisms linking hypoxia to Notch activation have not been clearly delineated. Here we show that Vasorin is a critical link between hypoxia and Notch signaling in GSCs. Vasorin is preferentially induced in GSCs by a HIF1α/STAT3 co-activator complex and stabilizes Notch1 protein at the cell membrane. This interaction prevents Numb from binding Notch1, rescuing it from Numb-mediated lysosomal degradation. Thus, Vasorin acts as a switch to augment Notch signaling under hypoxic conditions. Vasorin promotes tumor growth and reduces survival in mouse models of glioblastoma, and its expression correlates with increased aggression of human gliomas. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how hypoxia promotes Notch signaling in glioma and identify Vasorin as a potential therapeutic target."

Animal behavior is expressed on different timescales. Escape behaviors can be completed in a fraction of a second (Card and Dickinson, 2008Card G. Dickinson M.H.

These timescales interact, so that the probability of responding to an instantaneous stimulus depends on longer-lasting effects of context, learning, motivational states, and age. Our current understanding of the biological basis of behavior arises from well-defined stimulus paradigms that control the environment and experience and from increasingly precise control of genetic differences between individuals. The endogenous states that modify the effects of genes and the environment on intermediate timescales are less explored. Here, we use long-term behavioral analysis to address two questions: the organization of spontaneous behaviors over development and the existence of individual differences between isogenic animals. The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is ideal for exploring these questions. It is known for its reproducible development, yet even the genetically homogeneous progeny of self-fertilizing hermaphrodites can manifest inter-individual variability. Isogenic animals cultivated under the same conditions vary in life-history traits like the propensity to dauer formation (Fielenbach and Antebi, 2008Fielenbach N. Antebi A.

Rifkin S.A. Andersen E. van Oudenaarden A. Variability in gene expression underlies incomplete penetrance.Nature. 2010; 463: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Whether this variation is stochastic or consistent is difficult to determine, since most of these traits are only measured once per animal. Intrinsic phenotypic variability in individuals of identical genotypes has been described in a number of species. At the single-cell level, variability in clonal cell populations has been demonstrated in the transformation competence of Bacillus subtilis (Süel et al., 2006Süel G.M. Garcia-Ojalvo J. Liberman L.M. Elowitz M.B. An excitable gene regulatory circuit induces transient cellular differentiation.Nature. 2006; 440: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), in Tetrahymena motility (Jordan et al., 2013Jordan D.

Some of this variation appears to be stochastic and transient, but some persists over a cell’s lifetime and even across a few generations (Jordan et al., 2013Jordan D. Kuehn S. Katifori E. Leibler S.

Similarly, the behavior of several animal species includes reports of consistent individuality that is apparently independent of genetic or environmental causes. For example, the escape responses of pea aphids (Schuett et al., 2011Schuett W. Dall S.R.X. Baeumer J. Kloesener M.H. Nakagawa S. Beinlich F. Eggers T.

Psychobiol. 2011; 53: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the phototaxis and behavioral “handedness” of Drosophila (Buchanan et al., 2015Buchanan S.M. Kain J.S. de Bivort B.L.

An animal’s behavior can be expressed many times over its lifetime, a quality that makes it possible to determine whether one individual within an isogenic population is consistently different from others. Here we monitor the behavior of individual C. elegans animals continuously across development using a newly developed multi-camera imaging system to track spontaneous locomotion at high spatiotemporal resolution from hatching to adulthood. These behavioral measurements reveal stereotyped long-term behavioral trajectories across and within developmental stages, with characteristic active and less-active periods that last for hours. In addition, we find that a subset of animals expresses consistent behavioral biases across development that distinguish them from isogenic siblings raised under the same conditions. Both the structure of long-term behavior and individual consistency are regulated by neuromodulators that have distinct effects on behavioral outcomes. We tracked behaviors of C. elegans individuals grown from egg to adulthood in an environmental chamber with controlled temperature, humidity, and illumination (see STAR Methods and Figure 1A). Animals were cultivated in isolation in individual arenas filled with agar and a defined amount of UV-killed OP50 bacterial food to avoid social interactions. An imaging system with an array of cameras captured movies continuously at a frame rate of 3 frames/s and a spatial resolution of ∼10 μm. One camera imaged up to six circular arenas in a custom-made, laser-cut multi-well plate. Using 6 cameras, up to 36 animals per experiment were monitored for ∼60 hr spanning larval stages L1 to L4 and the first 16 hr of the adult stage, encompassing egg laying that began around 12–14 hr after the final molt. Each experiment captured approximately 650,000 movie frames per animal (Figure S1A and Movie S1).Figure S1Development Time and Roaming and Dwelling Classification in Wild-Type Individuals, Related to Figure 1 and STAR MethodsShow full caption(A) Locomotion trajectory of a single individual across 55 hours encompassing hatching to the adult stage.(B) Variation among wild-type individuals in the duration of each larval stage (upper panels), and measured from egg hatching to start of adulthood (bottom panel) (n = 125 individuals).

(C) Two-dimensional probability distributions of speed (μm/s) and angular velocity (degrees/s) averaged over 10 s time windows for 125 wild-type N2 individuals, demonstrating distinguishable roaming (R) and dwelling (D) states in each developmental stage. Wild-type animals varied by 10% (37 ± 1.6 [SD] hr) in the time from egg hatching to start of adulthood (Figure S1B). To minimize this effect and facilitate comparisons between mutant genotypes, we analyzed age-normalized behavioral trajectories aligned to larval stages, defined using the quiescent lethargus behavior of molting animals (Cassada and Russell, 1975Cassada R.C. Russell R.L. The dauerlarva, a post-embryonic developmental variant of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 1975; 46: 326-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). We then subdivided each larval stage into 75 bins for a total of 375 bins per behavioral trajectory (Figure 1B). The behavior of each animal across time was quantified using established parameters for spontaneous foraging states. During locomotion in a food environment, C. elegans spontaneously alternates between two foraging states called roaming and dwelling, spending seconds to minutes in each state (Ben Arous et al., 2009Ben Arous J.

Serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF initiate and extend opposing behavioral states in C. elegans.Cell. 2013; 154: 1023-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). When roaming, the animal explores a large area at a high speed with a low turning rate; when dwelling, the animal explores a smaller area by reducing its speed and increasing its turning rate (Figure 1A). Although the exact speed and turning rates vary as the animal grows, the distinction between roaming and dwelling is present at all developmental stages (Figure S1C). Under the conditions used here, roaming states represented 4%–16% of an animal’s behavior across development; the parameters we assessed here are the fraction of time spent in the roaming state and the average locomotion speed during roaming states. Quantification of the wild-type N2 population revealed a stereotyped long-term structure of roaming and dwelling behavior between and within different developmental stages (Figures 1C and 1D). On average, L1 animals spent the least time roaming. L2, L3, and L4 animals roamed more, but were not significantly different from each other, and adult animals roamed the most (Figures 1E and S2A). In addition, each stage had a characteristic behavioral substructure (Figures 1C and 1D). In the L1 stage, the roaming fraction increased over time. The L2 stage was weakly biphasic, with two blunted peaks of roaming activity. The L3 and L4 stages were strongly biphasic, with abundant roaming in the first half and little roaming in the second half of each stage, albeit with a second small roaming peak in L4. The temporal distinction between the first and second halves of each larval stage was statistically robust (Figures 1G and S2D). Adults increased the fraction of time spent roaming over the first 8 hr of adulthood, reaching a steady state for the second 8 hr. As a second behavioral parameter, we quantified the instantaneous speed of animals in the roaming state. The average wild-type roaming speed increased across all larval stages (Figures 1F and S2B). Unlike the fraction of time spent roaming, roaming speed was homogeneous within each larval stage (Figure 1G and S2E). In summary, C. elegans varies in the fraction of time spent roaming across and within different developmental stages, with a timescale of hours that is distinct from the minute-long timescale of individual roaming events. Each larval stage is subdivided into characteristic behavioral epochs in its first and second halves, in addition to the brief quiescent periods during molting. This complex roaming trajectory coexists with a stepwise increase of roaming speed at each successive larval stage. The long-term imaging configuration made it possible to detect substantial variation in the behavior of different individuals. For example, on average, animals spent 9% of the L2 stage roaming, but the range for different individuals was 1%–27% (Figure S2A). Roaming speed also varied across individuals (Figure S2B) but less so than the roaming fraction, as indicated by the lower coefficient of variation in this measurement (Figures S2C and S2F). Remarkably, single animals had consistent individual biases in roaming fraction and roaming speed that were sustained across developmental stages. We quantified these biases in behavior over time by ranking each individual against the entire population (n = 125) in 50 time bins representing the complete developmental trajectory. The rank approach allowed a unified comparison of behavior that corrects for its heterogeneity over developmental time. The distribution of rank scores across the time course was then analyzed to yield a normalized consistency index that is positive for animals that consistently roam more than the median in many time bins, negative for animals that consistently roam less, and close to zero for animals that do not show significant consistency in their behavior (Figures 2A–2D and Movie S2). Over the course of development, a significant fraction of animals showed individual bias in behavior: 8% of the animals consistently roamed more and 7.2% consistently roamed less than expected based on a shuffled dataset (Figure 2E). A similar developmentally normalized rank analysis of the average speed during roaming episodes showed that 8% of animals were consistently faster and 11.2% were consistently slower than expected in a shuffled dataset (Figure 2F). The animals with significant consistency in both roaming fraction and roaming speed overlapped more than expected by chance, but not entirely (Figure 2G). Differences in behavior between individuals were not heritable; populations grown from animals that showed extreme but opposite individual bias returned to the average population behavior (Figure S3). These results indicate that a subset of C. elegans animals of the same genotype in a common environment express long-term individual bias in behavior compared to the population and further indicate that different individuals can express consistent bias in different behavioral traits. A variety of genes are known to affect C. elegans roaming fraction or roaming speed over timescales of seconds to minutes (Ben Arous et al., 2009Ben Arous J. Laffont S. Chatenay D.

We found that the roaming fraction was consistently increased in tph-1 mutants across all developmental stages (Figures 3, 4A , and S4A). Despite this general scaling effect, the long-term trajectory of behavior within and between larval stages was preserved in tph-1 mutants.

Like tph-1 mutants, animals mutant for the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 roam more than wild-type animals as adults (Cheung et al., 2005Cheung B.H.H. Cohen M. Rogers C. Albayram O. de Bono M. Experience-dependent modulation of C. elegans behavior by ambient oxygen.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 905-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). npr-1 mutants also have a reduction in quiescent behavior during molting (Choi et al., 2013Choi S. Chatzigeorgiou M. Taylor K.P. Schafer W.R. Kaplan J.M. Analysis of NPR-1 reveals a circuit mechanism for behavioral quiescence in C. elegans.Neuron. 2013; 78: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (Figure 4B). We found that npr-1 mutants roamed more than the wild-type at all larval stages (Figures 4B and S4A) and that in addition, the behavioral trajectory within larval stages was highly abnormal. For example, npr-1 animals had much higher roaming fractions in the first half than in the second half of the L1 stage, the opposite pattern from wild-type (Figures 4B and S4F). npr-1 roaming trajectories within other stages were also distinct from the wild-type; for example, the suppression of roaming in the second half of the L3 and L4 stages was reduced (Figures 4B and S4F). npr-1 mutants are hypersensitive to the arousing effects of environmental oxygen (Cheung et al., 2005Cheung B.H.H.

Biol. 2005; 15: 905-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); the effects of the mutation suggest that these arousing effects override the typical developmental pattern. The transforming growth factor (TGF)-β mutant daf-7 roams less than wild-type in the adult stage (Ben Arous et al., 2009Ben Arous J. Laffont S. Chatenay D. Molecular and sensory basis of a food related two-state behavior in C. elegans.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7584Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We found that its effects were discontinuous across developmental stages: daf-7 animals roamed more than wild-type in the L2 stage and less in all other stages (Figures 4C and S4A). In addition, they lacked the roaming peak in the first half of the L3 and L4 stages (Figures 4C and S4G). daf-7 alters the developmental propensity to form an alternative larval stage called a dauer larva (Riddle et al., 1981Riddle D.L. Swanson M.M. Albert P.S. Interacting genes in nematode dauer larva formation.Nature. 1981; 290: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), but this effect was set aside by analyzing only animals that did not enter the dauer stage (58% of all animals under these conditions). Among the mutants studied here, only daf-7 altered developmental timing as well as behavior—the duration of the L1 and L2 stages was extended in all daf-7 larvae, consistent with broader metabolic and developmental effects of daf-7 (Figure S5A) (Wadsworth and Riddle, 1989Wadsworth W.G. Riddle D.L. Developmental regulation of energy metabolism in Caenorhabditis elegans.Dev. Biol. 1989; 132: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Roaming speed was also regulated by neuromodulators across development but in a distinct genetic and temporal pattern compared to roaming fraction. npr-1 neuropeptide receptor mutants had elevated roaming speeds at all stages (Figures 4D and S4B), but o"
https://openalex.org/W2771367425,"Ubiquitylation of the TNFR1 signalling complex (TNF-RSC) controls the activation of RIPK1, a kinase critically involved in mediating multiple TNFα-activated deleterious events. However, the molecular mechanism that coordinates different types of ubiquitylation modification to regulate the activation of RIPK1 kinase remains unclear. Here, we show that ABIN-1/NAF-1, a ubiquitin-binding protein, is recruited rapidly into TNF-RSC in a manner dependent on the Met1-ubiquitylating complex LUBAC to regulate the recruitment of A20 to control Lys63 deubiquitylation of RIPK1. ABIN-1 deficiency reduces the recruitment of A20 and licenses cells to die through necroptosis by promoting Lys63 ubiquitylation and activation of RIPK1 with TNFα stimulation under conditions that would otherwise exclusively activate apoptosis in wild-type cells. Inhibition of RIPK1 kinase and RIPK3 deficiency block the embryonic lethality of Abin-1 -/- mice. We propose that ABIN-1 provides a critical link between Met1 ubiquitylation mediated by the LUBAC complex and Lys63 deubiquitylation by phospho-A20 to modulate the activation of RIPK1."

We identify a class of segmentally repeated second-order somatosensory interneurons, that we named Wave, whose activation in anterior and posterior segments elicit backward and forward locomotion, respectively. Anterior and posterior Wave neurons extend their dendrites in opposite directions to receive somatosensory inputs from the head and tail, respectively. Downstream of anterior Wave neurons, we identify premotor circuits including the neuron A03a5, which together with Wave, is necessary for the backward locomotion touch response.

Appropriate response to tactile sensory stimuli is crucial for animal survival. Upon sensing a tactile stimulus, animals respond by choosing the most ethologically adequate behavior depending on the body location of the stimulus (Di Giminiani et al., 2013Di Giminiani P.

For instance, crayfish perform upward jumps in response to a posterior touch and backward jumps in response to an anterior touch (Edwards et al., 1999Edwards D.H. Heitler W.J. Krasne F.B.

Somatosensory inputs, such as mechanical and/or noxious cues, are sensed by receptors in the periphery and the information is passed along to the CNS. The spinal cord in vertebrates and nerve cord in invertebrates consist of homologous repeating units, neuromeres, each of which communicate with a corresponding skin area via the peripheral nerves. A somatosensory input from a specific location in the periphery is transmitted to the correspondent neuromere and the information is then processed to generate motor programs appropriate for the origin of the stimulus (Abraira and Ginty, 2013Abraira V.E.

Hence, each of the homologous neuromeres must possess unique neural architectures that match its receptive field (the segmental origin of the stimulus) to distinct motor programs. A common form of location-dependent behavioral responses is seen when an animal chooses the direction of movement upon encountering somatosensory stimuli. In many animal species, including nematodes (Chalfie et al., 1985Chalfie M. Sulston J.E. White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S.

For instance, in C. elegans command interneuron AVA or AVB induces backward or forward locomotion, respectively, in response to localized touch stimuli in the tail or head (Pirri et al., 2009Pirri J.K.

In adult Drosophila, a descending command-like neuron triggers backward walking, a behavior induced when the flies encounter impassable barriers or looming visual stimuli (Bidaye et al., 2014Bidaye S.S.

However, network mechanisms that process location-specific sensory inputs and subsequently trigger the appropriate sequence of motor outputs remain largely unknown. Here, we combined electron microscopy (EM) circuit mapping, opto- and electrophysiology, and behavioral analysis, to identify the circuitry basis for differential responses to body touch in Drosophila larvae. Similarly to worms and lampreys, fly larvae respond to touch in different body parts with specific escape behaviors. Namely, both gentle (Kernan et al., 1994Kernan M. Cowan D. Zuker C.

Res. 2014; 83: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We found a segmentally repeated neuron, that we named Wave, whose activation in anterior segments sufficed to elicit backward locomotion, and in posterior segments sufficed to elicit forward locomotion. While all Wave neurons are postsynaptic to both nociceptive (multidendritic [MD] class IV) and mechanoreceptive (MD class III) somatosensory neurons, anterior and posterior Wave neurons differed in their receptive fields, both behaviorally and in the spatial extent of their dendritic arbors. We also identified circuits downstream of Wave both driving motoneurons and laterally interacting with circuits for other escape responses such as rolling (Ohyama et al., 2015Ohyama T. Schneider-Mizell C.M. Fetter R.D. Aleman J.V. Franconville R. Rivera-Alba M. Mensh B.D. Branson K.M. Simpson J.H. Truman J.W. et al.A multilevel multimodal circuit enhances action selection in Drosophila.Nature. 2015; 520: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that homologous command-like interneurons can induce distinct escape behaviors by selectively integrating spatially localized stimuli and targeting distinct downstream circuits mediating different motor programs, thereby implementing location-dependent sensorimotor responses. On soft substrates, the wandering larvae mainly perform forward locomotion (Berni et al., 2012Berni J. Pulver S.R. Griffith L.C. Bate M.

Biol. 2012; 22: 1861-1870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereas backward locomotion is infrequent except when encountering noxious and/or mechanical stimuli (Green et al., 1983Green C.H.

A noxious touch (such as a pinprick) or a gentle touch to a behaving larva yields distinct responses depending on the location of the stimulation on the body (Titlow et al., 2014Titlow J.S. Rice J. Majeed Z.R. Holsopple E. Biecker S. Cooper R.L. Anatomical and genotype-specific mechanosensory responses in Drosophila melanogaster larvae.Neurosci.

The larvae transiently perform backward locomotion in response to touch on the larval head (which is defined here as the anterior end of the larva), whereas they escape by forward locomotion to touch on the tail (Figure 1A). We first tried to identify the sensory neurons that mediate the body-location-dependent touch responses to a pinprick. Previous studies have shown that a class of multidendritic sensory neurons, MD class IV (MD IV), are responsible for mechanical (Hwang et al., 2007Hwang R.Y. Zhong L. Xu Y. Johnson T. Zhang F.

We therefore first tested whether the activity of MD IV is necessary for the larval response to localized mechanical nociception. The probability of performing backward locomotion in response to head prick was significantly reduced upon inhibition of synaptic transmission from MD IV neurons (Figures 1B and 1B′), indicating that these neurons are partly required for the touch response. We also tested the requirement of another class of multidendritic sensory neurons, MD class III (MD III), which are known to mediate gentle-touch responses including backward locomotion (Kernan et al., 1994Kernan M.

Drosophila NOMPC is a mechanotransduction channel subunit for gentle-touch sensation.. 2013; 493: 221-225Google Scholar). Inhibition of MD III also resulted in significant reduction in the induction of backward locomotion upon a pinprick (Figure 1B′). These results suggest that both MD IV and MD III are involved in the touch response. We further studied the roles of the sensory neurons in an isolated CNS. We electrically stimulated the nerve root, which contains axons of all somatosensory neurons in a specific body wall hemisegment (to mimic head or tail touch), while performing calcium imaging of the motoneurons (to detect fictive locomotion, Figure 1C). We found that electrical stimulation of the nerve root in an anterior segment (A1) induced fictive backward locomotion (Figure S1 and Movie S1), in which the segmental motoneurons were sequentially activated from anterior to posterior segments (Pulver et al., 2015Pulver S.R. Bayley T.G. Taylor A.L. Berni J. Bate M. Hedwig B. Imaging fictive locomotor patterns in larval Drosophila.J. Neurophysiol. 2015; 114: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, electrical stimulation of the nerve root in a posterior segment (A7) induced fictive forward locomotion (Figure S1), indicating that location-dependent somatosensory responses are preserved in this physiological assay. The occurrence of backward motor pattern was greatly reduced when synaptic transmission from MD IV or MD III was inhibited (Figure 1C′). Thus, MD IV and MD III neurons are partly required for backward response to localized sensory inputs both in vivo and ex vivo. We searched for neurons whose activation induces backward locomotion in the larvae, by expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson in different subsets of GAL4-targeted cells and identified VT25803-GAL4-targeted cells (hereafter called VT25803 cells) as a candidate (Figures 2A and S2A). Interestingly, in four out of the nine cases examined, where photostimulation was applied during forward locomotion, backward locomotion was immediately induced before the completion of the forward peristalsis, and initiated in a middle segment near the segment contracted at the time of photostimulation (Figure 2A′; see also Movie S2). Such reversal in the middle of peristalsis is rarely seen in normal larvae; backward locomotion normally starts in the anterior-most segment and only after completion of the preceding forward peristalsis. VT25803-GAL4 drove expression in small subsets of cells in the brain and the ventral nerve cord (VNC) (Figure 2B). We used the GAL80-mediated intersectional method (Lue et al., 1987Lue N.F.

Biol. 1987; 7: 3446-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to narrow down the candidate neuron(s) eliciting the backward locomotion among GAL4-targeted cells. We found both tsh-GAL80, which represses GAL4-mediated expression in the VNC (Figure S2A), and Cha3.3kbp-GAL80, which represses GAL4 activity in subsets of cholinergic neurons (Figure S2B), significantly reduced the frequency of backward locomotion triggered by the optogenetic activation (Figure 2A). This led us to identify a single class of segmentally repeated pairs of abdominal neurons as the candidate, since they were the only cells that were Cha3.3kbp positive and present in the VNC. Morphology of the candidate neurons was studied in single-cell images generated by the MultiColor FLP-Out (MCFO) method (Nern et al., 2015Nern A. Pfeiffer B.D. Rubin G.M. Optimized tools for multicolor stochastic labeling reveal diverse stereotyped cell arrangements in the fly visual system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E2967-E2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar; Figure 2C). The unique morphological characteristics of the neurons, including the bifurcated, ipsi-lateral, and anteriorly projecting neurite projection, enabled us to identify the cells as the A02o neuron annotated by EM reconstruction as a postsynaptic target of MD IV (Ohyama et al., 2015Ohyama T. Schneider-Mizell C.M. Fetter R.D. Aleman J.V. Franconville R. Rivera-Alba M. Mensh B.D. Branson K.M. Simpson J.H. Truman J.W. et al.A multilevel multimodal circuit enhances action selection in Drosophila.Nature. 2015; 520: 633-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We renamed the neuron as Wave for its characteristic wavy axon. Wave neurons extend their dendrites to the ventro-medial neuropile where the axons of MD IV and MD III terminate (Grueber et al., 2007Grueber W.B. Ye B. Yang C.H. Younger S. Borden K. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Projections of Drosophila multidendritic neurons in the central nervous system: Links with peripheral dendrite morphology.Development. 2007; 134: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Wave neurons extend their axons to the dorsal neuropile where motoneuronal dendrites are present. The axons of Wave neurons in each neuromere are bundled to form a unique dorso-ventrally winding fascicle that extends the entire anteroposterior axis in the VNC (Figure S2F), which is the origin of the name of the neurons. These characteristics suggest that Wave neurons receive synaptic inputs from sensory neurons including MD IV and MD III and send information to the motor circuits. Immunostaining for neurotransmitter markers showed that Wave neurons were immunoreactive both to anti-choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and anti-vGluT (Figures S2C–S2D′) but not to anti-GABA (Figure S2E), suggesting that the neurons are cholinergic and glutamatergic. To further confirm that Wave neurons elicit backward locomotion and also to study the effect of locally activating a subset of Wave neurons, we conducted the following two lines of experiments to specifically manipulate the activity of Wave neurons. First, we generated a split GAL4 line (MB120B-spGAL4) that drives expression only in Wave neurons (Figure S2F) and performed an area-confined optogenetics assay. In this assay, we applied light in an area-confined manner (∼10 μm in diameter) to activate a subset of GAL4-targeted neurons (by using ChR2[T159C]) in one or a few segments, while monitoring motor activity by calcium imaging (by expressing R-GECO, a red fluorescent genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (Zhao et al., 2011Zhao Y. Araki S. Wu J. Teramoto T. Chang Y.F. Nakano M. Abdelfattah A.S. Fujiwara M. Ishihara T. Nagai T. Campbell R.E. An expanded palette of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators.Science. 2011; 333: 1888-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), under the regulation of tub-LexA) in an isolated CNS (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A; Movie S7; see also STAR Methods for detail). While tub-LexA drives expression of R-GECO pan-neuronally, directional activity propagation recorded in the dorsal neuropile perfectly coincided with fictive forward or backward locomotion detected in motoneurons (Figures S3B–S3E). Focal stimulation spotted within A1–A3 neuromeres induced consecutive backward waves, indicating that activation of Wave neurons in these neuromeres is sufficient to induce backward locomotion (Figures 3C, 3D, and 3D′). The induced backward waves initiated in the abdominal segment A1, unlike the spontaneously occurring backward waves, which initiate in the first thoracic neuromere (T1; Berni, 2015Berni J. Genetic dissection of a regionally differentiated network for exploratory behavior in Drosophila larvae.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 1319-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, Pulver et al., 2015Pulver S.R. Bayley T.G. Taylor A.L. Berni J. Bate M. Hedwig B. Imaging fictive locomotor patterns in larval Drosophila.J. Neurophysiol. 2015; 114: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This is reminiscent of the reversal of peristalsis in the middle of forward locomotion observed in the behaving larvae upon activation of VT25803 cells (see Figure 2A). Second, we used two-photon optogenetics to activate a single Wave neuron among the VT25803 cells. We expressed CsChrimson and GCaMP in VT25803 cells (Figure 3E) and first tested the efficiency and spatial resolution of the two-photon stimulation by imaging the activity of the Wave neuron itself. The two-photon stimulation efficiently activated the neuron with a spatial resolution of Δx, Δy <10 μm and Δz <18 μm, which is sufficient for single-cell stimulation among VT25803 cells (Figures S4A and S4B). We then examined whether Wave stimulation elicits fictive backward locomotion by monitoring the activity of other VT25803 cells, which show wave-like activities during fictive locomotion (Figures 3F and S4C–S4C″; Movie S8). We observed backward motor waves following the stimulation of Wave neurons (Figure 3G; Movie S4) at a frequency significantly higher than control groups (p = 0.024, Fisher’s exact test; Figures 3G and 3H). These results indicate that single-cell activation of Wave neurons in anterior abdominal segments is sufficient to trigger fictive backward locomotion. As described above, activation of cells targeted by the original VT25803-GAL4 in the larvae induced backward locomotion. In contrast, activation of Wave neurons using the highly specific MB120B-spGAL4, to our surprise, induced bouts of wiggling and bending, which are an initial posture for rolling, and some rolling events, but much fewer backward locomotion (Figure 4A). A possible explanation for the difference in the activation phenotypes was segmental difference in GAL4-expression. While MB120B-spGAL4 targeted Wave neurons in abdominal neuromeres from A2 to A6, VT25803-GAL4 drove strong expression in these neurons in more anterior neuromeres (from A1 to A4). Since Wave neurons are second-order sensory interneurons, they might convey location-dependent sensory information and induce distinct behaviors depending on their location in the VNC. To test this possibility, we again took advantage of the area-confined optogenetics assay and activated Wave neurons at different positions along the anterior-posterior axis. We observed that photostimulation in posterior neuromeres (A7 to A5) induced forward waves, whereas that in anterior neuromeres (A3-T1) induced backward waves (Figures 4B, 4C, and S5A; note that neurites but not cell bodies of Wave are present in T3–T1, Movie S3). Thus, Wave neurons elicit completely different motor outputs depending on the location of the activation, as was observed for localized activation of somatosensory inputs (Figure 1C). Surgical ablation of the brain did not abolish the induction of forward or backward waves (Figures 4D and S5B), suggesting that the downstream circuitry of Wave neurons inducing these behaviors is enclosed within the nerve cord. We also found that short-pulse stimulation (with a duration of 100 ms, where the timescale is far smaller than that of the fictive locomotion) was also sucient to induce forward or backward waves depending on the stimulus site (Figures S5C and S5C′), suggesting that “gating” mechanisms that prolong the motor commands are present in the downstream circuitry. The segmental difference in Wave function could reflect segmental difference in the pattern of dendritic and axonal projections, which we found are spatially segregated in the neuron (Figure S5D). Indeed, we found that Wave neurons in neuromere A2 (Figure 4E) and A3 (Figure S5E) extended their dendrites and axons anteriorly and intersegmentally to thoracic segments, where the head touch is mainly sensed (due to head involution in larvae, thoracic segment 1 (T1) acts as the most anterior part of the animal). In contrast, Wave neurons in neuromeres A4 (Figure S5E′), A5 (Figure S5E″), and A6 (Figure 4F) extended their dendrites and axons only in the neighboring abdominal segments. In particular, Wave neurons in A2 and A3 extend dendrites anteriorly, whereas those in A5 and A6 extend dendrites not only anteriorly but also posteriorly. Thus, the segmental differences in the projection pattern of Wave neurons (Figure S5F) are closely correlated to the functional difference in evoking distinct behaviors (Figures 4C and 4D; summarized in Figure 4G). It should be noted that a pair of Wave neurons in each segment were the only cells that express MB120B-spGAL4 and thus could be unequivocally identified. Furthermore, Wave neurons in each neuromere share the same cell body position and the pattern of proximal axon projection to the neuropile as described above, although they differ in their distal axonal and dendritic arborizations.

Here we describe an auto-/paracrine physiologic circuit that controls quiescence of MB-HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors marked by histidine decarboxylase (Hdc). Committed Hdc+ myeloid cells lie in close anatomical proximity to MB-HSCs and produce histamine, which activates the H2 receptor on MB-HSCs to promote their quiescence and self-renewal. Depleting histamine-producing cells enforces cell cycle entry, induces loss of serial transplant capacity, and sensitizes animals to chemotherapeutic injury. Increasing demand for myeloid cells via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment specifically recruits MB-HSCs and progenitors into the cell cycle; cycling MB-HSCs fail to revert into quiescence in the absence of histamine feedback, leading to their depletion, while an H2 agonist protects MB-HSCs from depletion after sepsis. Thus, histamine couples lineage-specific physiological demands to intrinsically primed MB-HSCs to enforce homeostasis."

Parvalbumin-immunopositive Teevra cells show the highest rhythmicity among MS neurons and fire with short burst duration (median, 38 ms) preferentially at the trough of both CA1 theta and slow irregular oscillations, coincident with highest hippocampal excitability. Teevra cells synaptically target GABAergic axo-axonic and some CCK interneurons in restricted septo-temporal CA3 segments. The rhythmicity of their firing decreases from septal to temporal termination of individual axons. We hypothesize that Teevra neurons coordinate oscillatory activity across the septo-temporal axis, phasing the firing of specific CA3 interneurons, thereby contributing to the selection of pyramidal cell assemblies at the theta trough via disinhibition.

We also found that, contrary to the current notions about CK2, some CK2 transcripts were downregulated in several cancers. Here, we investigate all other cancers using Oncomine to determine whether they also display significant CK2 transcript dysregulation. As anticipated from our previous analysis, we found cancers with all CK2 transcripts upregulated (e.g. cervical), and cancers where there was a combination of upregulation and/or downregulation of the CK2 transcripts (e.g. sarcoma). Unexpectedly, we found some cancers with significant downregulation of all CK2 transcripts (e.g. testicular cancer). We also found that, in some cases, CK2 transcript levels were already dysregulated in benign lesions (e.g. Barrett’s esophagus). We also found that CK2 transcript upregulation correlated with lower patient survival in most cases where data was significant. However, there were two cancer types, glioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma, where CK2 transcript upregulation correlated with higher survival. Overall, these data show that the expression levels of CK2 genes is highly variable in cancers and can lead to different patient outcomes."

We show the potential of AbCIDs for application in regulating human cell therapies by using them to induce CRISPRa-mediated gene expression and to regulate CAR T-cell activation.

In contrast, the molecular mechanism underlying CiVDS remains unknown. Both CDS and CiVDS occur in primary sensory DRG neurons (Liu et al., 2011Liu T. Shang S.J. Liu B. Wang C.H. Wang Y.S. Xiong W.

CiVDS dominates during tonic firing (< 4 Hz) at rest, whereas CDS becomes dominant during burst firing (> 20 Hz), corresponding to pain sensation, implying that CiVDS and CDS play complementary roles under physiological and pathological conditions (Zheng et al., 2009Zheng H.

Because only CiVDS (but not CDS) conducts exocytosis at rest (spontaneous APs at 1–4 Hz), CiVDS transmitter(s) may affect sensory homeostasis. Thus, we set out to explore the molecular mechanism and native transmitter(s) of CiVDS. Regarding the mechanism, a CiVDS model would contain at least 3 components: a voltage sensor, fusion machinery, and a linker of the voltage sensor and fusion machinery. Whole-cell membrane capacitance (Cm) measurement during whole-cell recording in the absence of internal and external Ca2+ has shown that CiVDS exocytosis is readily triggered by a brief depolarization (Figure 1A; Zhang and Zhou, 2002Zhang C. Zhou Z. Ca2+-independent but voltage-dependent secretion in mammalian dorsal root ganglion neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), so one or more voltage-sensing proteins on the plasma membrane must be involved to directly initiate CiVDS. We first screened for proteins containing the voltage-sensing motif S4 in the UniProt database and found ∼390 voltage-sensing proteins in mammals (Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Homo sapiens), all of which are voltage-gated channels. Therefore, we pharmacologically screened the voltage-gated channels (including Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels) for possible contribution to CiVDS via Cm recordings from freshly isolated DRG neurons. Following a 200-ms depolarization from –70 mV to 0 mV, a typical CiVDS signal (Cm jump of ∼200 10−15 F [fF]) occurred in DRG neurons in Ca2+-free bath solution (Figure 1A, left). For screening purposes, we applied available antagonists of voltage-gated channels: tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM) for Na+ channels, tetraethylammonium (TEA) (10 mM) for K+ channels, and ω-conotoxin GVIA (GVIA) (1 μM) for N-type Ca2+ channel CaV2.2, the most abundant voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in DRG neurons (Mintz et al., 1992Mintz I.M.

Intriguingly, the Cm jump was insensitive to TTX and TEA (Figures 1B; Figures S1 and S2) but notably reduced by GVIA (Figures 1A and 1B), which not only occludes the open pore but also blocks the gating charge of Cav2.2 (Yarotskyy and Elmslie, 2009Yarotskyy V.

To further investigate the role of CaV2.2 in CiVDS, we planned to use a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based knockdown (KD) approach, which required culturing DRG neurons for at least 3 days. To our surprise, CiVDS spontaneously decreased with culture time and had nearly disappeared after 3 days of culture (Figure 1C), whereas CDS increased (Figures S3A and S3B). Consistent with its involvement in CiVDS, both the expression level and the functional current of CaV2.2 decreased markedly after 3 days of culture (Figures 1D and 1E). Although this “spontaneous KD” precluded KD experiments in cultured DRG neurons, we were able to test whether CiVDS is rescued by overexpression (OE) of CaV2.2 after culture for 3 days. As expected, CaV2.2 OE fully restored CiVDS (Figures 1F and 1G) without affecting CDS (Figure S4), indicating a critical role of CaV2.2 channels in CiVDS. To further determine the role of endogenous CaV2.2 in CiVDS, we performed in vivo KD by surgically injecting shRNA-expressing adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) into the L5 DRG (Figure 2B). Two independent shRNAs were designed to target CaV2.2, whereas a non-targeting scrambled shRNA served as a control. Western blot and immunofluorescence showed efficient KD of CaV2.2 both in vitro and in vivo with the two shRNAs (Figures 2A and 2C) but not the scrambled shRNA (data not shown). In addition, real-time PCR showed that both shRNAs specifically targeted CaV2.2 but not other subtypes of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in DRG neurons (Figure S5A). Strikingly, Cm recordings demonstrated a dramatic decrease (∼70%) of CiVDS in CaV2.2 KD versus control neurons (Figures 2D and 2E). Together, all of these findings demonstrate that CaV2.2 channels are essential for CiVDS. To further characterize the voltage-sensing properties of CaV2.2 in triggering CiVDS, we generated loss-of-function mutations of CaV2.2 at its voltage-sensitive or pore filter regions (Catterall, 2010Catterall W.A. Ion channel voltage sensors: structure, function, and pathophysiology.Neuron. 2010; 67: 915-928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, Yang et al., 1993Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Molecular determinants of Ca2+ selectivity and ion permeation in L-type Ca2+ channels.Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). To generate voltage-insensitive CaV2.2, the conserved voltage-sensing and positively charged S4 motif in domain III was neutralized by substituting the second and third arginines (R1256 and R1259) with glutamines (S4 mutation; Figure 3A). As expected, the S4 mutant showed a dramatic reduction in the voltage-triggered Ca2+ current (Figure 3B). Cell surface biotinylation assays revealed similar expression of the S4 mutant and the wild-type (WT) CaV2.2 both for the total and plasma membrane (Figure 3C). Remarkably, unlike WT CaV2.2, the S4 mutation failed to rescue CiVDS after 3 days in culture (Figures 3D and 3E). Similarly, CDS was also reduced greatly in neurons expressing the S4 mutation (Figures S6A and S6B), probably caused by the reduced Ca2+ currents (Figure S6B). Next we examined whether a mutation at the pore region affects CiVDS. Glutamic acids (E314 and E664) located in the pore filter regions in domains I and II were mutated to glutamines to generate a pore region mutation (Figure 4A). Consistent with previous studies (Yang et al., 1993Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Molecular determinants of Ca2+ selectivity and ion permeation in L-type Ca2+ channels.Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), this mutation had no effect on membrane current but blocked the Ca2+ influx, as revealed by combining patch-clamp and [Ca2+]i measurements in HEK293A cells expressing WT CaV2.2 or the pore mutation (Figures 4B and 4C). Interestingly, the pore region mutant retained a rescue effect on CiVDS similar to WT CaV2.2 but dramatically blocked CDS (Figures 4D–4F; Figures S6C and S6D). These findings demonstrate that, upon membrane depolarization, the CaV2.2 channel triggers CiVDS in DRG neurons, and this is largely dependent on its voltage-sensing function but not the pore Ca2+ permeability. Although we have shown that CaV2.2 triggers CiVDS in DRG neurons upon membrane depolarization, how the membrane-localized CaV2.2 triggers vesicle fusion is still elusive. The SNARE complex (a conserved four-helix bundle formed by synaptobrevin/VAMP [vesicle-associated membrane protein], SNAP-25, and syntaxin 1) has long been considered an essential component of vesicle secretion (Hanson et al., 1997Hanson P.I.

Crystal structure of a SNARE complex involved in synaptic exocytosis at 2.4 A resolution.Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). We proposed that CaV2.2 triggers CiVDS through binding to the SNARE complex. To test this hypothesis, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) in native DRG tissues and found a physical interaction of CaV2.2 with SNAP-25 in DRG neurons (Figure 5A). Similar results were also obtained in vitro by overexpressing FLAG-CaV2.2 and SNAP-25 in HEK293A cells (Figure 5B). Second, immunofluorescence showed co-localization of CaV2.2 with SNAP-25 on the plasma membrane of DRG neurons (Figure 5C). Third, OE of SNAP-25 was able to rescue CiVDS in DRG neurons cultured for 3 days (Figures 5D and 5E). Fourth, we expressed tetanus toxin and botulinum toxin C in DRG neurons to cleave the SNARE complex (Blasi et al., 1993Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R.

Montecucco C. Tetanus and botulinum-B neurotoxins block neurotransmitter release by proteolytic cleavage of synaptobrevin.Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). DRG neurons expressing the combined toxins showed a significant reduction in CDS and fluorescence intensity of SNAP-25 and VAMP-2 24 hr after transfection (Figure S7), indicating efficient cleavage of the SNARE complex. Concurrently, the combined toxins blocked ∼50% of CiVDS in DRG neurons (Figures 5F and 5G). Together, these results demonstrate that CiVDS is SNARE-dependent and that the CaV2.2 channel can co-operate with the SNARE complex to mediate CiVDS in DRG neurons. Because we had shown that CaV2.2 binds the SNARE complex both in vitro and in vivo, we next investigated whether this binding is responsible for CiVDS in DRG neurons. Previous studies by Catterall, 1999Catterall W.A. Interactions of presynaptic Ca2+ channels and snare proteins in neurotransmitter release.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 144-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar have shown that the synprint region of CaV2.2, amino acids 773–859 in the intracellular loop between domains II and III, is essential for the binding between CaV2.2 and the SNARE complex (Sheng et al., 1994Sheng Z.H. Rettig J. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A. Identification of a syntaxin-binding site on N-type calcium channels.Neuron. 1994; 13: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Thus, we constructed synprint-truncated CaV2.2 and found that this truncation did not change the evoked Ca2+ current, as evidenced by recordings in HEK293A cells (Figures S8D and S8E), consistent with a previous report (Harkins et al., 2004Harkins A.B. Cahill A.L. Powers J.F. Tischler A.S. Fox A.P. Deletion of the synaptic protein interaction site of the N-type (CaV2.2) calcium channel inhibits secretion in mouse pheochromocytoma cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 15219-15224Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether CaV2.2- and SNARE-dependent CiVDS requires the synprint, first, coIP showed that synprint-truncated CaV2.2 (Δsynprint) lost the ability to bind the SNARE complex (Figures 6B and 6C ), indicating that the synprint region is the binding site between CaV2.2 and the SNARE complex. Second, to determine the function of this binding in CiVDS, a synprint peptide was synthesized and dialyzed into freshly isolated DRG neurons to disrupt the binding between CaV2.2 and the SNARE complex (Mochida et al., 1996Mochida S. Sheng Z.H. Baker C. Kobayashi H. Catterall W.A.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6647-6656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, the synprint peptide substantially inhibited CiVDS by >60%, whereas the control peptide targeting the corresponding region of the L-type Ca2+ channel (CaV1.1) had little effect (<15%; Figures 6D and 6E). Third, unlike WT CaV2.2, OE of the synprint-truncated CaV2.2 in DRG neurons failed to restore CiVDS after 3 days in culture (Figures 6F and 6G). Taken together, these results indicate that the CaV2.2 channel directly binds the SNARE complex through its synprint region to trigger CiVDS upon membrane depolarization. Although the presence and kinetics of activity-dependent Cm signals of CiVDS have been well-studied in DRG neurons (Liu et al., 2011Liu T. Shang S.J. Liu B. Wang C.H. Wang Y.S. Xiong W. Zheng L.H.

J. 2009; 96: 2449-2456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), it is important to determine the cargo content of CiVDS vesicles. It is known that ATP is released via CDS in DRG somata (Zhang et al., 2007aZhang X. Chen Y. Wang C. Huang L.Y. Neuronal somatic ATP release triggers neuron-satellite glial cell communication in dorsal root ganglia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 9864-9869Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To identify the CiVDS cargo, we used luciferase-luciferin assays to specifically measure possible ATP release during CiVDS and CDS. Dipyridamole (10 μM), an ATPase inhibitor, was used to reduce the hydrolysis of ATP. We found that, in Ca2+-free solution, stimulation with 100 mM KCl (0 mM Ca2+ [0Ca] 100 mM kCl [100K]) induced substantial ATP release from acutely isolated DRG neurons, and this was blocked by the CaV2.2 blocker ω-conotoxin GVIA (Figures 7A and 7B ). These findings indicate that ATP is a cargo of CiVDS and further confirms the role of CaV2.2 in CiVDS. We also tested CDS-mediated ATP release from the same batch of neurons. Because the hydrolysis of ATPase is Ca2+-dependent (Edström et al., 1980Edström A. Hanson M. Prus K. Wallin M. Ca2+- or Mg2+-dependent enzymatic ATP hydrolysis associated with the microsomal fraction of frog sciatic nerves.J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), 0Ca caffeine (20 mM), instead of 2Ca 100K solution, was used to trigger CDS (Chen et al., 2005Chen X.K. Wang L.C. Zhou Y. Cai Q. Prakriya M. Duan K.L. Sheng Z.H. Lingle C. Zhou Z. Activation of GPCRs modulates quantal size in chromaffin cells through G(betagamma) and PKC.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, we detected a robust ATP signal (Figures 7A and 7B). The evoked ATP release was from intact neurons because lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a marker of cell injury, was detected only after applying digitonin (Figures 7A and 7B). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that ATP is released via both CiVDS and CDS in freshly isolated DRG neurons. Next we aimed to visualize CiVDS-mediated exocytosis at the single-vesicle level with electron microscopy (EM) and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Wang et al., 2016Wang C. Wang Y. Hu M. Chai Z. Wu Q. Huang R. Han W. Zhang C.X. Zhou Z. Synaptotagmin-11 inhibits clathrin-mediated and bulk endocytosis.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, Zenisek et al., 2000Zenisek D. Steyer J.A. Almers W. Transport, capture and exocytosis of single synaptic vesicles at active zones.Nature. 2000; 406: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). First, with EM, we found that docked vesicles (∼100 nm in diameter) were notably reduced after 2 min incubation in 0Ca 100K solution, implying that ATP can be released from these CiVDS-like vesicles (both clear and dense-core vesicles; Figures 7C and 7D). Second, with TIRF imaging, synaptophysin (Spy)-pHluorin was expressed in DRG neurons cultured for ∼24 h to image the exocytosis of Spy-pHluorin-labeled individual vesicles in real time (Zhu et al., 2009Zhu Y. Xu J. Heinemann S.F. Two pathways of synaptic vesicle retrieval revealed by single-vesicle imaging.Neuron. 2009; 61: 397-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Following depolarization, Spy-pHluorin-containing vesicles underwent exocytosis in DRG neurons bathed in both Ca2+-free and Ca2+-containing solution (Figures 7E and 7F; Movies S1 and S2), implying that ATP can be released from CiVDS-mediated Spy-pHluorin-labeled clear vesicles. Third, again with TIRF, neuropeptide Y (NPY)-pHluorin was expressed in DRG neurons cultured for ∼24 h to image the quantal release of NPY-pHluorin-labeled vesicles in real time (Perrais et al., 2004Perrais D. Kleppe I.C. Taraska J.W. Almers W. Recapture after exocytosis causes differential retention of protein in granules of bovine chromaffin cells.J. Physiol. 2004; 560: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Following depolarization, NPY-pHluorin was discharged from single vesicles in DRG neurons bathed in both Ca2+-free and Ca2+-containing solution (Figures 7G and 7H; Movies S3 and S4), implying that ATP can be released from CiVDS-mediated dense-core vesicles. In addition, the release of both Spy-pHluorin- and NPY-pHluorin-labeled vesicles under CiVDS conditions was inhibited by a CaV2.2 blocker (GVIA; Figures 7F and 7H), further strengthening the role of CaV2.2 channels in CiVDS. In the present work, we demonstrated that the molecular machinery of CiVDS contains a voltage sensor, a fusion pore, and a linker. Cav2.2 functions as the voltage sensor, the SNARE complex (SNAP25-syntaxin-VAMP2) functions as the fusion pore, and their linker is the synprint site (amino acids 772–856) within the II-III intracellular loop of Cav2.2. The signal pathway is AP → Cav2.2 → synprint → SNARE/SNAP25 → CiVDS (Figure 8). In addition, our results identified that ATP is a cargo of CiVDS. One major finding of the present work is that Cav2.2 (the voltage sensor), SNARE (the fusion pore), and synprint (the linker) are the molecular building blocks of CiVDS. This is supported by the following evidence:(1) using Cm recording, TIRF imaging, and luciferase fluorescence assays, we found that the specific Cav2.2 blocker ω-conotoxin GVIA inhibited CiVDS (Figures 1A and 1B and 7A, 7B, 7F, and 7H); (2) CiVDS was rescued by OE of Cav2.2 following its spontaneous loss in culture for 3 days (Figures 1C-1G); (3) in vivo Cav2.2 KD significantly blocked CiVDS (Figures 2A–2E); (4) loss-of-function mutation of the voltage-sensing domain of CaV2.2 failed to restore CiVDS (Figures 3A–3E), whereas loss-of-function mutation of the pore filter region of Cav2.2 blocked Ca2+ influx but maintained the ability to rescue CiVDS (Figures 4A–4F) (findings 1–4 establish Cav2.2 as the voltage-sensor of CiVDS); (5) using EM and TIRF imaging, we observed the quantal release of clear and dense-core vesicles from DRG neurons through CiVDS (Figures 7C–7H), indicating that CiVDS is a type of vesicular exocytosis; (6) OE of SNAP-25 fully rescued CiVDS after its deletion by culture for 3 days (Figures 5D and 5E); (7) cleavage of the SNARE complex by tetanus toxin and botulinum toxin substantially blocked CiVDS (Figures 5F and 5G) (findings 5–7 suggest that SNARE is the fusion pore of CiVDS); (8) CaV2.2 bound to SNAP-25 in DRG neurons (Figures 5A–5C; Sheng et al., 1994Sheng Z.H.

https://openalex.org/W2774460623,"Tau is a microtubule (MT)-associated protein that regulates MT dynamics in the axons of neurons. Tau binds to MTs via its C-terminal MT-binding repeats. There are two types of tau, those with three (3R) or four (4R) MT-binding repeats; 4R tau has a stronger MT-stabilizing activity than 3R tau. The MT-stabilizing activity of tau is regulated by phosphorylation. Interestingly, both the isoform and phosphorylation change at the time of neuronal circuit formation during postnatal development; highly phosphorylated 3R tau is replaced with 4R tau, which is less phosphorylated. However, it is not known how the transition of the isoforms and phosphorylation are regulated. Here, we addressed this question using developing mouse brains. Detailed analysis of developing brains revealed that the switch from 3R to 4R tau occurred during postnatal day 9 (P9) to P18 under the same time course as the conversion of phosphorylation from high to low. However, hypothyroidism, which is known to delay brain development, delayed the timing of tau dephosphorylation but not the exchange of isoforms, indicating that isoform switching and phosphorylation are not necessarily linked. Furthermore, we confirmed this finding by using mouse brains that expressed a single isoform of human tau. Human tau, either 3R or 4R, reduced phosphorylation levels during development even though the isoform did not change. We also found that 3R tau and 4R tau were phosphorylated differently in vivo even at the same developmental days. These results show for the first time that the phosphorylation and isoform alteration of tau are regulated differently during mouse development."

In vivo and cell-based applications of sortase have been somewhat limited by the large range of calcium concentrations, as well as by the often transient nature of protein-protein interactions in living systems. In order to use sortase A for cell labeling applications, we generated a new sortase A variant by combining multiple mutations to yield an enzyme that was both calcium-independent and highly active. This variant has enhanced activity for both N- and C-terminal labeling, as well as for cell surface modification under physiological conditions."

Myoelectric activity from hemiparetic muscles is then used for continuous control of functional electrical stimulation (MeCFES) of same or synergic muscles to promote restoration of movements during task-oriented therapy (TOT). Use of MeCFES during TOT may help to obtain a larger functional and neurological recovery than otherwise possible.Multicenter randomized controlled trial.Eighty two acute and chronic stroke victims were recruited through the collaborating facilities and after signing an informed consent were randomized to receive either the experimental (MeCFES assisted TOT (M-TOT) or conventional rehabilitation care including TOT (C-TOT). Both groups received 45 minutes of rehabilitation over 25 sessions. Outcomes were Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE) scores and Disability of the Arm Shoulder and Hand questionnaire.Sixty eight subjects completed the protocol (Mean age 66.2, range 36.5-88.7, onset months 12.7, range 0.8-19.1) of which 45 were seen at follow up 5 weeks later. There were significant improvements in both groups on ARAT (median improvement: MeCFES TOT group 3.0; C-TOT group 2.0) and FMA-UE (median improvement: M-TOT 4.5; C-TOT 3.5). Considering subacute subjects (time since stroke < 6 months), there was a trend for a larger proportion of improved patients in the M-TOT group following rehabilitation (57.9%) than in the C-TOT group (33.2%) (difference in proportion improved 24.7%; 95% CI -4.0; 48.6), though the study did not meet the planned sample size.This is the first large multicentre RCT to compare MeCFES assisted TOT with conventional care TOT for the upper extremity. No adverse events or negative outcomes were encountered, thus we conclude that MeCFES can be a safe adjunct to rehabilitation that could promote recovery of upper limb function in persons after stroke, particularly when applied in the subacute phase."
https://openalex.org/W2775565993,"Deficits in empathy have been proposed to constitute a hallmark of several psychiatric disturbances like conduct disorder, antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders. Limited sensitivity to punishment, shallow or deficient affect and reduced physiological reactivity to environmental stressors have been often reported to co-occur with limited empathy and contribute to the onset of antisocial phenotypes. Empathy in its simplest form (i.e. emotional contagion) is addressed in preclinical models through the evaluation of the social transmission of emotional states: mice exposed to a painful stimulus display a higher response if in the presence of a familiar individual experiencing a higher degree of discomfort, than in isolation. In the present study, we investigated whether a reduction of emotional contagion can be considered a predictor of reduced sociality, sensitivity to punishment and physiological stress reactivity. To this aim, we first evaluated emotional contagion in a group of Balb/cJ mice and then discretised their values in four quartiles. The upper (i.e. Emotional Contagion Prone, ECP) and the lower (i.e. Emotional Contagion Resistant, ECR) quartiles constituted the experimental groups. Our results indicate that mice in the lower quartile are characterized by reduced sociability, impaired memory of negative events and dampened hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical reactivity to external stressors. Furthermore, in the absence of changes in oxytocin receptor density, we show that these mice exhibit elevated concentrations of oxytocin and vasopressin and reduced density of BDNF receptors in behaviourally-relevant brain areas. Thus, not only do present results translate to the preclinical investigation of psychiatric disturbances, but also they can contribute to the study of emotional contagion in terms of its adaptive significance."

High salt (i.e. high concentrations of NaCl) has been proposed to be an important environmental factor that influences immune responses in multiple ways. However, it remains unknown whether high salt regulates type I IFN production and signaling in macrophages. Here, we demonstrated that high salt promoted IFNβ production and its signaling in both human and mouse macrophages, and consequentially primed macrophages for strengthened immune sensing and signaling when challenged with viruses or viral nucleic acid analogues. Using both pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference we showed that these effects of high salt on IFNβ signaling were mediated by the p38 MAPK/ATF2/AP1 signaling pathway. Consistently, high salt increased resistance to vesicle stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in vitro. In vivo data indicated that a high-salt diet protected mice from lethal VSV infection.

High salt (increased sodium chloride) directly and markedly affects a variety of immune response and may regulate type I interferon production and signaling in macrophages.

Earlier reports have also demonstrated that high salt aggravates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by promoting Th17 cells (20Kleinewietfeld M. Manzel A. Titze J. Kvakan H. Yosef N. Linker R.A. Muller D.N. Hafler D.A.

Additionally, high salt dampens the immune suppressive functions of Treg cells, and thereby exacerbates both xenogeneic graft versus host diseases (22Hernandez A.L. Kitz A. Wu C. Lowther D.E.

A recent study has demonstrated that high-salt formulation of aluminum-based adjuvant strongly promotes cancer vaccine-induced immune responses and antitumor effects due to the improvement of antigen cross-presentation in dendritic cells (24Luo M. Shao B. Yu J.Y. Liu T. Liang X. Lu L. Ye T.H. He Z.Y. Xiao H.Y. Wei X.W. Simultaneous enhancement of cellular and humoral immunity by the high salt formulation of Al(OH)3 adjuvant.Cell Res. 2017; Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Despite the close relationships between high salt and immune responses, it remains unknown whether high salt regulates type I interferon production and signaling in macrophages. In this study we investigated the impact of high salt on type I interferon production and signaling as well as on host defense against viral infections. We first determined the expression profile of ISGs in both human and mouse macrophages treated with high salt. We then identified interferon β (IFNβ) as the mediator of the effects of high salt on ISGs. We next explored the influence of high salt on immune sensing and signaling of mouse macrophages responding to viruses or viral nucleic acids. We further uncovered the molecular mechanisms by which high salt regulated type I interferon production and signaling in macrophages. Finally, we studied the roles of high salt in resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection both in vitro and in vivo. Macrophages were treated with additional NaCl to explore the influence of high salt on type I interferon signaling. Gene ontology analysis of RNA-Seq results in human monocytes-derived macrophages demonstrated that the type I interferon signaling pathway and its associated responses to virus were among the most remarkably promoted biological processes by high salt (Fig. S1). Consistently, expression of dozens of ISGs was significantly increased by high salt (Fig. 1A). The up-regulated expression was further validated by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1B). Some of these ISGs including interferon-induced protein 44-like (IFI44L) and interferon α-inducible protein 27 (IFI27) rose by several 10-folds in high-salt–treated macrophages compared with those in untreated macrophages (Fig. 1, A and B). Results of qRT-PCR in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) showed that high salt increased transcription of ISGs both time and dose dependently (Fig. 1, C and D). These ISGs included 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 3 (Oas3), interferon-stimulated gene 15 (Isg15), interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7), interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (Ifit2), MX dynamin-like GTPase 2 (Mx2), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (Cxcl10). Furthermore, sodium gluconate, but not the same osmolarity of mannitol or urea, raised expression of ISGs (Fig. 1E). These data together indicated that increased sodium, but not elevation of osmolarity, was sufficient to up-regulate ISGs in macrophages. Both interferon α (IFNα) and interferon β (IFNβ) are engaged in type I interferon signaling (1Ivashkiv L.B. Donlin L.T. Regulation of type I interferon responses.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 (24362405): 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). We next addressed which interferon mediated the effects of high salt on ISGs in macrophages. Results of qRT-PCR showed that high salt up-regulated gene expression of IFNB1, but not IFNA, in both human monocyte-derived macrophages and mouse BMDMs (Fig. 2, A and B, and Fig. S2A). Importantly, the expression Ifnb1 was increased much earlier than that of ISGs by high salt in mouse BMDMs (Figs. 1C and 2B). Furthermore, type I IFN bioactivity assay indicated that much more IFNβ was produced in high-salt–treated BMDMs than untreated BMDMs (Fig. 2C). IFNβ neutralizing antibodies abolished high-salt–induced up-regulation of ISGs in BMDMs; whereas IFNα neutralizing antibodies did not affect this up-regulation (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2B). In addition, deficiency of interferon α and β receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) (Fig. S3A) consistently abolished this up-regulation of ISGs (Fig. 2E), but did not affect the high-salt–induced increase of Ifnb1 expression (Fig. S3B). These results together suggested a pivotal role of IFNβ in high-salt–induced expression of ISGs. Taken together, high salt enhanced type I interferon signaling through up-regulation of IFNβ in macrophages. ISGs play crucial roles in sensing viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns and transmitting host pattern recognition receptors-activated signaling (2Schneider W.M. Chevillotte M.D. Rice C.M. Interferon-stimulated genes: a complex web of host defenses.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 32 (24555472): 513-54510.1146/annurev-immunol-032713-120231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next explored whether high salt primes macrophage responses to virus and viral nucleic acids through up-regulating these ISGs. Mouse BMDMs were first treated with additional 50 mm NaCl for 16 h, washed with phosphate-buffered solution (PBS), and then stimulated with virus or viral nucleic acid analogues. Western blotting results demonstrated that high-salt pre-treatment was sufficient to significantly promote phosphorylation of Erk, JNK, TBK1, ATF2, c-Jun, and IRF3, all of which are critical players in controlling virus-induced IFNβ production, in mouse BMDMs treated with double-strand RNA analogue poly(I·C) (Fig. 3A). Consequently, high-salt pre-treatment markedly potentiated poly(I·C)-induced expression of Ifnb1 and subsequent ISGs including Ifit2 and Cxcl10 (Fig. 3B). Similarly, high-salt pre-treatment potentiated expression of Ifnb1 and ISGs in BMDMs treated with VSV or cytosolic DNA sensing pathway activator 5,6-dimethylxanthenone 4-acetic acid (DMXAA) (Fig. 3, C and D). Consistently, high-salt pre-treatment substantially augmented the secretion of IFNβ from macrophages treated with poly(I·C), VSV, or DMXAA (Fig. 3E). In addition, high-salt pre-treatment significantly enhanced the level of p-STAT1 (Tyr-701), but not of p-STAT1 (Ser-727), in BMDMs treated with poly(I·C) (Fig. S4, A and B), consistent with previous observations that IFNβ-induced engagement of IFNAR canonically promotes STAT1 phosphorylation at tyrosine 701, but not at serine 727 (25Bonjardim C.A. Ferreira P.C. Kroon E.G. Interferons: signaling, antiviral and viral evasion.Immunol. Lett. 2009; 122 (19059436): 1-1110.1016/j.imlet.2008.11.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These results collectively suggested that high salt primed macrophages to launch a more profound type I interferon production and signaling responding to viruses or viral nucleic acids. We next tried to delineate the underlying mechanisms by which high salt promoted IFNβ production and type I interferon signaling. Similar to our previous results (17Zhang W.C. Zheng X.J. Du L.J. Sun J.Y. Shen Z.X. Shi C. Sun S. Zhang Z. Chen X.Q. Qin M. Liu X. Tao J. Jia L. Fan H.Y. Zhou B. et al.High salt primes a specific activation state of macrophages, M(Na).Cell Res. 2015; 25 (26206316): 893-91010.1038/cr.2015.87Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), p38 phosphorylation was enhanced by additional NaCl treatment in BMDMs (Fig. S5A). Thereby, we further used both the p38 selective inhibitor SB203580 (abbreviated as SB) and RNA interference to explore its potential role in mediating the effects of high salt on type I interferon signaling in macrophages. Results of qRT-PCR illustrated that SB completely abrogated high-salt–induced up-regulation of Ifnb1 gene expression in BMDMs (Fig. 4A). Consequently, the induction of ISGs by high salt was markedly attenuated by SB treatment, and as a result SB significantly reduced expression of ISGs in high-salt–treated BMDMs (Fig. 4B). Similarly, knockdown of p38 ameliorated high-salt–induced up-regulation of ISGs (Fig. S5, B and C). In BMDMs challenged with both poly(I·C) and high salt, SB remarkably suppressed expression of Ifnb1 and Ifit2, an ISG (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the induction of IFNβ secretion by high salt was abolished by SB in poly(I·C)-challenged BMDMs (Fig. 4D). Putting these results together, p38 MAPK mediated high-salt–promoted IFNB1 and type I interferon signaling in macrophages either with or without poly(I·C) treatment. In addition, p-p38 was increased by additional 50 mm Na-gluconate, but not by the same osmolarity of mannitol or urea in mouse BMDMs (Fig. S5D), indicating that p38 phosphorylation was promoted specifically by high concentrations of sodium in mouse macrophages. Phosphorylation of JNK was not elevated by high salt alone (Fig. S5E). Although high salt increased phosphorylation of Erk (Fig. S5F), inhibition of Erk by PD98059 did not affect high-salt–induced up-regulation of ISGs (Fig. S5G). These results together suggested that p38 but not JNK or Erk mediated the effects of high salt on IFNβ production and type I interferon signaling in macrophages. Transcription factors ATF2 and c-Jun constitute a heterodimer AP1 that plays an essential role in regulating transcription of IFNB1 (26Honda K. Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Type I interferon [corrected] gene induction by the interferon regulatory factor family of transcription factors.Immunity. 2006; 25 (16979567): 349-36010.1016/j.immuni.2006.08.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 27Hornung V. SnapShot: nucleic acid immune sensors, part 1.Immunity. 2014; 41 (25517618): 86810.1016/j.immuni.2014.10.005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, p38 directly phosphorylates ATF2 and promotes its transcriptional activity (28Ouwens D.M. de Ruiter N.D. van der Zon G.C. Carter A.P. Schouten J. van der Burgt C. Kooistra K. Bos J.L. Maassen J.A. van Dam H. Growth factors can activate ATF2 via a two-step mechanism: phosphorylation of Thr71 through the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway and of Thr69 through RalGDS-Src-p38.EMBO J. 2002; 21 (12110590): 3782-379310.1093/emboj/cdf361Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored whether ATF2/AP1 was part of the mechanisms regarding how high salt induced expression of IFNB1 and ISGs. ATF2 phosphorylation, but not its total protein level, was significantly up-regulated by high salt in BMDMs (Fig. 5A). Results of qRT-PCR demonstrated that SR11302, an AP1 selective inhibitor, markedly reduced mRNA levels of Ifnb1 and ISGs in high-salt–treated mouse BMDMs (Fig. 5, B and C). Likewise, gene expression of Ifnb1 and Ifit2 were substantially inhibited by SR in BMDMs treated with both high salt and poly(I·C) (Fig. 5D). Moreover, the induction of IFNβ secretion by high salt was notably alleviated by SR in poly(I·C)-challenged BMDMs (Fig. 5E). Finally, both SB and p38 knockdown significantly reduced high-salt–induced phosphorylation of ATF2 in BMDMs (Fig. 5F and Fig. S6), suggesting that high salt promoted ATF2 phosphorylation through p38 activation. Taken together, a p38/ATF2/AP1 signaling axis mediated the impact of high salt on IFNB1 and type I interferon signaling in macrophages. Given the importance of IFNβ and ISGs in host defense (29McNab F. Mayer-Barber K. Sher A. Wack A. O'Garra A. Type I interferons in infectious disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 (25614319): 87-10310.1038/nri3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), we then tested whether high salt would strengthen the ability of cells to fight against virus infection. We first used cell lysis assay to detect survival of mouse BMDMs infected with vesicle stomatitis virus coexpressing GFP (VSV-GFP). Pre-treatment with high salt notably improved cell survival in VSV-GFP-infected BMDMs (Fig. 6, A and B). Moreover, mRNA levels of viral gene VSIVgp3 and EGFP were significantly lower in high-salt–treated BMDMs than those in untreated BMDMs, indicating less replication of VSV (Fig. 6C). Viral replication was then directly measured in L929 cells. Conditioned media from poly(I·C)-stimulated BMDMs restrained VSV replication in L929 cells, and this restraint was further potentiated by high-salt treatment in BMDMs (Fig. 6D). To investigate the effect of high salt on host defense against viral infections in vivo, mice were fed a high-salt diet (HSD) or chow diet (CD) and then infected with VSV. In mice with intraperitoneal injection of VSV, qRT-PCR results demonstrated that HSD significantly decreased the VSIVgp3 mRNA level in mouse lungs and brains, suggesting decreased viral load in these two tissues (Fig. 7A). HSD did not affect the expression of VSIVgp3 in other tissues such as livers, spleens, kidneys, or lymph nodes (Fig. S7). Monitoring the survival revealed that mice fed with HSD had a much lower mortality rate than those fed with CD (Fig. 7B). These results suggested that HSD improved mouse survival by suppressing VSV replication, in particular tissues such as lungs and brains. We further studied the effects of HSD on pulmonary VSV infection in mice. In mice with intrabronchial injection of VSV, HSD feeding resulted in significantly higher IFNβ protein levels in the sera (Fig. 7C). Plaque assay showed that VSV titers were remarkably lower in lungs from HSD-fed mice compared with CD-fed mice (Fig. 7D). Moreover, HSD strikingly lowered the mortality rate of mice with intrabronchial VSV infection (Fig. 7E). In summary, high salt alleviated viral load and improved survival in mice with either systemic or pulmonary VSV infection. Although recent studies have highlighted the important regulatory roles of high salt in macrophages, the impact of high salt on type I interferon production and signaling have not been explored in these cells. In this study, we demonstrated that high salt promoted the production of IFNβ and expression of ISGs in macrophages. We identified a p38/ATF2/AP1 axis that mediated these effects of high salt. Consequently, high salt enhanced the defense against viral infections in cell culture and in mice. Our data support that NaCl is an important regulator of innate immunity against viral infections in that it regulates type I interferon production and signaling in macrophages. We for the first time demonstrated that high salt promoted expression of ISGs through increased production of IFNβ in macrophages. Importantly, high salt primed macrophages to initiate a strengthened response to viruses or viral nucleic acid analogues, leading to enhanced defense against VSV infections.

https://openalex.org/W2771610616,"Food cleaning is widespread in the animal kingdom, and a recent report confirmed that (amongst other behaviours) wild western lowland gorillas also show food cleaning. The authors of this report conclude that this behaviour, based on its distribution patterns, constitutes a potential candidate for culture. While different conceptualisations of culture exist, some more and some less reliant on behavioural form copying, all of them assign a special role to social learning processes in explaining potentially cultural behaviours. Here we report the results of an experiment that tested to what extent food cleaning behaviour in a group of captive Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) relies on social learning processes. Subjects were provided with clean and dirty apples. When they were provided with dirty apples, all subjects showed evidence of food cleaning in at least 75% of trials. Preferred cleaning techniques differed between individuals, four out of five of subjects expressed a behaviour analogous to that reported in wild conspecifics. Given this occurrence of food cleaning in a culturally unconnected population of gorillas, we conclude that social learning is unlikely to play a central role in the emergence of the food cleaning behavioural form in Western lowland gorillas; instead, placing a greater emphasis on individual learning of food cleaning's behavioural form."
https://openalex.org/W2773425422,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a progressive neuromuscular disease caused by expanded CUG repeats, which misregulate RNA metabolism through several RNA-binding proteins, including CUG-binding protein/CUGBP1 elav-like factor 1 (CUGBP1/CELF1) and muscleblind 1 protein. Mutant CUG repeats elevate CUGBP1 and alter CUGBP1 activity via a glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)-cyclin D3-cyclin D-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) signaling pathway. Inhibition of GSK3β corrects abnormal activity of CUGBP1 in DM1 mice [human skeletal actin mRNA, containing long repeats ( HSALR) model]. Here, we show that the inhibition of GSK3β in young HSALR mice prevents development of DM1 muscle pathology. Skeletal muscle in 1-yr-old HSALR mice, treated at 1.5 mo for 6 wk with the inhibitors of GSK3, exhibits high fiber density, corrected atrophy, normal fiber size, with reduced central nuclei and normalized grip strength. Because CUG-GSK3β-cyclin D3-CDK4 converts the active form of CUGBP1 into a form of translational repressor, we examined the contribution of CUGBP1 in myogenesis using Celf1 knockout mice. We found that a loss of CUGBP1 disrupts myogenesis, affecting genes that regulate differentiation and the extracellular matrix. Proteins of those pathways are also misregulated in young HSALR mice and in muscle biopsies of patients with congenital DM1. These findings suggest that the correction of GSK3β-CUGBP1 pathway in young HSALR mice might have a positive effect on the myogenesis over time.-Wei, C., Stock, L., Valanejad, L., Zalewski, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2773834487,"The rapid and accurate identification of pathogen yeast species is crucial for clinical diagnosis due to the high level of mortality and morbidity induced, even after antifungal therapy. For this purpose, new rapid, high-throughput and reliable identification methods are required. In this work we described a combined approach based on two high-throughput techniques in order to improve the identification of pathogenic yeast strains. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of ITS and D1/D2 LSU marker regions together with FTIR spectroscopy were applied to identify 256 strains belonging to Candida genus isolated in nosocomial environments. Multivariate data analysis (MVA) was carried out on NGS and FT-IR data-sets, separately. Strains of Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, were identified with high-throughput NGS sequencing of ITS and LSU markers and then with FTIR. Inter- and intra-species variability was investigated by consensus principal component analysis (CPCA) which combines high-dimensional data of the two complementary analytical approaches in concatenated PCA blocks normalized to the same weight. The total percentage of correct identification reached around 97.4% for C. albicans and 74% for C. parapsilosis while the other two species showed lower identification rates. Results suggested that the identification success increases with the increasing number of strains actually used in the PLS analysis. The absence of reliable FT-IR libraries in the current scenario is the major limitation in FTIR-based identification of strains, although this metabolomics fingerprint represents a valid and affordable aid to rapid and high-throughput to clinical diagnosis. According to our data, FT-IR libraries should include some tens of certified strains per species, possibly over 50, deriving from diverse sources and collected over an extensive time period. This implies a multidisciplinary effort of specialists working in strain isolation and maintenance, molecular taxonomy, FT-IR technique and chemo-metrics, data management and data basing."
https://openalex.org/W2772215061,"Phototropin2 (phot2) is a blue-light (BL) receptor that regulates BL-dependent activities for efficient photosynthesis in plants. phot2 comprises two BL-receiving light-oxygen-voltage–sensing domains (LOV1 and LOV2) and a kinase domain. BL-excited LOV2 is thought to be primarily responsible for the BL-dependent activation of the kinase. However, the molecular mechanisms by which small BL-induced conformational changes in the LOV2 domain are transmitted to the kinase remain unclear. Here, we used full-length wild-type and mutant phot2 proteins from Arabidopsis to study their molecular properties in the dark and under BL irradiation. Phosphorylation assays and absorption measurements indicated that the LOV1 domain assists the thermal relaxation of BL-excited LOV2 and vice versa. Using small-angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopy, we observed that phot2 forms a dimer and has a rod shape with a maximum length of 188 Å and a radius of gyration of 44 Å. Under BL, phot2 displayed large conformational changes that bent the rod shape. By superimposing the crystal structures of the LOV1 dimer, LOV2, and a homology model of the kinase to the observed changes, we inferred that the BL-dependent change consisted of positional shifts of both LOV2 and the kinase relative to LOV1. Furthermore, phot2 mutants lacking the photocycle in LOV1 or LOV2 still exhibited conformational changes under BL, suggesting that LOV1 and LOV2 cooperatively contribute to the conformational changes that activate the kinase.

The C170A (C426A) mutant can bind one FMN molecule to the pocket of the α/β-scaffold of LOV1 (LOV2) but has lost the ability to form the S390 state in the photoreaction cycles of LOV1 (LOV2). D720N mutation results in the complete loss of the kinase activity of STK. By size-exclusion column chromatography (SEC), the apparent molecular weight of the WT was estimated as ∼220,000, indicating a dimeric form of WT in solution (Fig. S1B). The dark-adapted WT (D450 state) had absorption peaks at 474, 446, and 371 nm and a shoulder around 410 nm consistent with those of the LOV1-LOV2 fragment (19Christie J.M. Swartz T.E. Bogomolni R.A. Briggs W.R.

The absorbance values at 273 and 446 nm in the dark state indicated that each subunit was associated with two FMN molecules. Under BL irradiation, the WT showed absorption changes of the LOV domains (Fig. 1B) as observed for the LOV1-LOV2 fragment (16Kasahara M. Swartz T.E. Olney M.A. Onodera A. Mochizuki N. Fukuzawa H.

The kinase activity of the purified WT was examined by an autophosphorylation assay with and without BL irradiation (Fig. 1C). The WT showed phosphorylation activity in the dark as observed both in vivo and in vitro (3Christie J.M. Reymond P. Powell G.K. Bernasconi P. Raibekas A.A. Liscum E. Briggs W.R. Arabidopsis NPH1: a flavoprotein with the properties of a photoreceptor for phototropism.Science. 1998; 282 (9831559): 1698-170110.1126/science.282.5394.1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 19Christie J.M.

As expected, the D720A mutant displayed little phosphorylation. The C170A mutant showed BL-accelerated autophosphorylation activity as observed in the WT, whereas the C426A mutant displayed little autophosphorylation under BL. In a gel-shift assay, the WT, just after purification, had an apparent molecular weight larger than those of the WT incubated with λ-protein phosphatase (λPPase; New England Biolabs) and the D720N mutant (Fig. 1D). This result implied that the purified WT would be phosphorylated during overexpression and purification. In fact, 25 phosphorylation sites were identified in the previous study of the in vivo autophosphorylation of Atphot2 (32Inoue S. Matsushita T. Tomokiyo Y. Matsumoto M. Nakayama K.I. Kinoshita T. Shimazaki K. Functional analyses of the activation loop of phototropin2 in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2011; 156 (21427282): 117-12810.1104/pp.111.175943Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation sites in the N-terminal half of λPPase-treated phot2 in the dark and under BL irradiation were identified by mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig. 1E). No phosphorylation sites were detected in the N-terminal half of the D720N mutant used as a reference. The λPPase treatment dephosphorylated the WT except at Ser-284 located near the C terminus of LOV1. After incubation in the presence of ATP in the dark, λPPase-treated WT was phosphorylated at Ser-22. After BL irradiation for 1 h, an additional phosphorylation was identified at Ser-106, suggesting a BL-dependent conformational change around the N-terminal region of LOV1. In addition to the three single mutants described in the previous sections, two double mutants (C170A/D720N and C426A/D720N) and one triple mutant (C170A/C426A/D720N) were overexpressed and purified to study the influence of the photocycle of each LOV domain on the BL responses of phot2 (Fig. S1C). These mutants lack the kinase activity and are free from heterogeneity regarding phosphorylation, making them suitable for physicochemical measurements requiring homogeneity of specimens. The conversion from D450 to S390 and the dark reversion of S390 to D450 were measured by ultraviolet (UV)-visible absorption spectroscopy. The mutants were measured using SAXS as described below; therefore, they were suspended in the same buffer used in the SAXS experiments. In phot, the formation of S390 in LOV2 is essential (19Christie J.M. Swartz T.E. Bogomolni R.A. Briggs W.R. Phototropin LOV domains exhibit distinct roles in regulating photoreceptor function.Plant J. 2002; 32 (12383086): 205-21910.1046/j.1365-313X.2002.01415.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and the dark-reversion speed of S390 to D450 is one of the key factors for the activation of the kinase function (30Okajima K. Kashojiya S. Tokutomi S. Photosensitivity of kinase activation by blue light involves the lifetime of a cysteinyl-flavin adduct intermediate, S390, in the photoreaction cycle of the LOV2 domain in phototropin, a plant blue light receptor.J.

Both LOVs in the D720N mutant were almost completely converted to their S390 state under BL fluence at more than 450 μmol m−2 s−1 (Fig. 2A). BL irradiation at a fluence of 450 μmol m−2 s−1 converted more than 90% of C170A/D720N and C426A/D720N mutants to the S390 states of LOV2 and LOV1, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). The triple mutant, prepared as a reference for the other three mutants, displayed little change in its absorption spectrum under BL irradiation (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2E compares the dark reversion of C170A/D720N and C426A/D720N mutants with that of the D720 mutant. The dark-reversion kinetics of the D720N mutant was approximated by a double-exponential curve. The fast component, with a half-life time (τ½) of 54 s, corresponded to the dark reversion of LOV2, and the slow component, with a τ1/2 of 194 s, represented the reversion of LOV1. The dark reversion of LOV2 in the C170A/D720N mutant was approximated by a single-exponential curve with a τ½ value of 168 s, which was approximately 3 times longer than that of LOV2 in the D720N mutant. These findings suggested a significant influence of LOV1 on the dark reversion of LOV2. In contrast, the dark reversion of LOV1 in the C426A/D720N mutant, which was approximated by a single-exponential curve with a τ½ value of 68 s, was faster than that of the D720N mutant. Mutual influences on the photocycles between LOV1 and LOV2 were suggested by the prolongation of the S390 lifetime of LOV2 in the C170A mutant and the acceleration of the dark reversion of LOV1 in the C426A mutant. The low-resolution structure and BL-induced structural change of phot2 in solution were studied by SAXS for the D720N mutant because the heterogeneity of the phosphorylated WT and, probably, the phosphatase-treated WT was unsuitable for SAXS measurements. For each specimen solution, SAXS profiles were recorded in the dark (dark1), under BL at more than 450 μmol m−2 s−1 (light1), and again in the dark (dark2). The scattering intensities of light1 increased in S < 0.007 Å−1, whereas the profiles in the other regions remained almost the same (Fig. 3A). The intensity change in light1 at S = 0.005 Å−1 corresponded to ∼8% of the intensity of dark1. The profiles of dark2 resembled those of dark1, indicating that the BL-dependent SAXS changes were almost photoreversible (Fig. 3A, inset). These photoreversible SAXS changes were observed in the concentration range measured thus far. The Guinier analysis (Fig. 3B) and the concentration dependences of the radius of gyration (Rg) and zero-angle scattering intensities (Fig. 3C) indicated that the specimen solutions were almost monodispersive (Fig. 4C). A dimeric association of the D720N mutant was confirmed from the apparent molecular weight estimated from the zero-angle scattering intensity. This finding was consistent with the result of SEC (Fig. S1B). The Rg values of dark1 (44.3 ± 1.4 Å) and dark2 (44.9 ± 1.4 Å) were comparable and slightly larger than that of light1 (43.7 ± 1.4 Å) (Fig. 3C). The Rg values were likely photoreversible as expected from the profiles. The distance distribution functions P(r) of dark1, light1, and dark2, with shoulders at r > 70 Å, reflected their dimeric structures (Fig. 3D). The maximum dimensions were almost the same among dark1 (188 ± 2 Å), light1 (186 ± 2 Å), and dark2 (187 ± 2 Å). The molecular shapes of dark1, light1, and dark2 were restored by the program GASBOR. The model shapes were multiply restored for each condition, and then the most probable shape was selected after classification of the restored molecular shapes using multivariate analyses (Fig. 4, A and B). The molecular shapes of dark1 and dark2 appeared as elongated Z-shapes with approximate dimensions of 185 Å long and 80 Å wide in the Z-shape view and 55 Å thick in the rod-shape view. The molecular model of light1 appeared with a Z-shape but had a bend around the center in the rod -shape view, indicating"

Based on our previous finding that histone H2A deubiquitinase 2A-DUB/Mysm1 interacts with the p53 axis in hematopoiesis and tissue development, we analyzed the molecular basis of the skeletal phenotype of Mysm1-deficient mice and dissected the underlying p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Visible morphologic, skeletal deformations of young Mysm1-deficient mice-including a kinked and truncated tail and shortened long bones-were associated with osteopenia of long bones. On the cellular level, Mysm1-deficient primary osteoblasts displayed reduced potential to differentiate into mature osteoblasts, as indicated by decreased expression of osteogenic markers. Reduced osteogenic differentiation capacity of Mysm1-deficient osteoblasts was accompanied by an impaired induction of osteogenic transcription factor Runx2. Osteogenic differentiation of Mysm1-/- MSCs, however, was not compromised in vitro. In line with defective hematopoietic development of Mysm1-deficient mice, Mysm1-/- osteoclasts had reduced resorption activity and were more prone to apoptosis in TUNEL assays. Skeletal alterations and osteopenia of Mysm1-deficient mice were phenotypically completely rescued by simultaneous ablation of p53 in p53-/-Mysm1-/- double-deficient mice-although p53 deficiency did not restore Runx2 expression in Mysm1-/- osteoblasts on the molecular level but, instead, enhanced proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. In summary, our results demonstrate novel roles for Mysm1 in osteoblast differentiation and osteoclast formation, resulting in osteopenia in Mysm1-deficient mice that could be abrogated by the loss of p53 from increased osteogenic differentiation of Mysm1-/-p53-/- MSCs.-Haffner-Luntzer, M., Kovtun, A., Fischer, V., Prystaz, K., Hainzl, A., Kroeger, C.

From a cross of two parental lines, new lines are derived by single-seed descent (SSD) or doubled haploid (DH) technology. However, not all possible crosses between the parental lines can be carried out due to limited resources. Our objectives were to present formulas to characterize a cross by the mean and variance of the genotypic values of the lines derived from the cross, and to apply the formulas to predict means and variances of flowering time traits in recombinant inbred line families of a publicly available data set in maize. We derived formulas which are based on the expected linkage disequilibrium (LD) between two loci and which can be used for arbitrary mating systems. Results were worked out for SSD and DH lines derived from a cross after an arbitrary number of intermating generations. The means and variances were highly correlated with results obtained by the simulation software PopVar. Compared with these simulations, computation time for our closed formulas was about ten times faster. The means and variances for flowering time traits observed in the recombinant inbred line families of the investigated data set showed correlations of around 0.9 for the means and of 0.46 and 0.65 for the standard deviations with the estimated values. We conclude that our results provide a framework that can be exploited to increase the efficiency of hybrid and line breeding programs by extending genomic selection approaches to the selection of crossing partners."

Cross wavelet analyses were applied to infer potential non-stationary oscillating associations among GBS, dengue and MEI.We report a substantial increasing of local GBS and dengue cases (mainly imported) in recent year in Hong Kong. The seasonalities of GBS and dengue are different, in particular, GBS is low while dengue is high in the summer. We found weak but significant correlations between GBS and local meteorological factors. MEI could explain over 17% of dengue's variations based on Poisson regression analyses. We report a possible non-stationary oscillating association between dengue fever and GBS cases in Hong Kong. This study has led to an improved understanding about the timing and ecological relationships between MEI, GBS and dengue."
https://openalex.org/W2771342277,"Patients suffering from the progressive neurodegenerative disease Friedreich’s ataxia have reduced expression levels of the protein frataxin. Three major isoforms of human frataxin have been identified, FXN42-210, FXN56-210 and FXN81-210, of which FXN81-210 is considered to be the mature form. Both long forms, FXN42-210 and FXN56-210, have been shown to spontaneously form oligomeric particles stabilized by the extended N-terminal sequence. The short variant FXN81-210, on other hand, has only been observed in the monomeric state. However, a highly homologous E. coli frataxin CyaY, which also lacks an N-terminal extension, has been shown to oligomerize in the presence of iron. To explore the mechanisms of stabilization of short variant frataxin oligomers we compare here the effect of iron on the oligomerization of CyaY and FXN81-210. Using dynamic light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, electron microscopy (EM) and cross linking mass spectrometry (MS), we show that at aerobic conditions in the presence of iron both FXN81-210 and CyaY form oligomers. However, while CyaY oligomers are stable over time, FXN81-210 oligomers are unstable and dissociate into monomers after about 24 h. EM and MS studies suggest that within the oligomers FXN81-210 and CyaY monomers are packed in a head-to-tail fashion in ring-shaped structures with potential iron-binding sites located at the interface between monomers. The higher stability of CyaY oligomers can be explained by a higher number of acidic residues at the interface between monomers, which may result in a more stable iron binding. We also show that CyaY oligomers may be dissociated by ferric iron chelators deferiprone and DFO, as well as by the ferrous iron chelator BIPY. Surprisingly, deferiprone and DFO stimulate FXN81-210 oligomerization, while BIPY does not show any effect on oligomerization in this case. The results suggest that FXN81-210 oligomerization is primarily driven by ferric iron, while both ferric and ferrous iron participate in CyaY oligomer stabilization. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of bacterial and eukaryotic frataxins suggests that variations in the position of the acidic residues in helix 1, β-strand 1 and the loop between them may control the mode of frataxin oligomerization."

This initiative would generate a number of centers, both economic and political, which would facilitate greater interaction. To explore how information flows are merged and the specific opportunities that may be offered, Chinese cities along “the Belt and Road” are selected for a case study. Furthermore, urban networks in cyberspace have been characterized by their infrastructure orientation, which implies that there is a relative dearth of studies focusing on the investigation of urban hierarchies by capturing information flows between Chinese cities along “the Belt and Road”. This paper employs Baidu, the main web search engine in China, to examine urban hierarchies. The results show that urban networks become more balanced, shifting from a polycentric to a homogenized pattern. Furthermore, cities in networks tend to have both a hierarchical system and a spatial concentration primarily in regions such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta region. Urban hierarchy based on web search activity does not follow the existing hierarchical system based on geospatial and economic development in all cases. Moreover, urban networks, under the framework of “the Belt and Road”, show several significant corridors and more opportunities for more cities, particularly western cities. Furthermore, factors that may influence web search activity are explored. The results show that web search activity is significantly influenced by the economic gap, geographical proximity and administrative rank of the city."

Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (cCIMT) is a valid and reliable subclinical measure of atherosclerosis and is known to predict CVD. We performed genome-wide association (GWA) and admixture analysis among 682 HIV-positive and 288 HIV-negative Black, non-Hispanic women from the Women’s Interagency HIV study (WIHS) cohort using a combined and stratified analysis approach. We found some suggestive associations but none of the SNPs reached genome-wide statistical significance in our GWAS analysis. The top GWAS SNPs were rs2280828 in the region intergenic to mediator complex subunit 30 and exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 (MED30 | EXT1) among all women, rs2907092 in the catenin delta 2 (CTNND2) gene among HIV-positive women, and rs7529733 in the region intergenic to family with sequence similarity 5, member C and regulator of G-protein signaling 18 (FAM5C | RGS18) genes among HIV-negative women. The most significant local European ancestry associations were in the region intergenic to the zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 5D gene and NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 1 (ZSCAN5D | NDUF1) pseudogene on chromosome 19 among all women, in the region intergenic to vomeronasal 1 receptor 6 pseudogene and zinc finger protein 845 (VN1R6P | ZNF845) gene on chromosome 19 among HIV-positive women, and in the region intergenic to the SEC23-interacting protein and phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain containing 1A (SEC23IP | PPAPDC1A) genes located on chromosome 10 among HIV-negative women. A number of previously identified SNP associations with cCIMT were also observed and included rs2572204 in the ryanodine receptor 3 (RYR3) and an admixture region in the secretion-regulating guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SERGEF) gene. We report several SNPs and gene regions in the GWAS and admixture analysis, some of which are common across HIV-positive and HIV-negative women as demonstrated using meta-analysis, and also across the two analytic approaches (i.e., GWA and admixture). These findings suggest that local European ancestry plays an important role in genetic associations of cCIMT among black women from WIHS along with other environmental factors that are related to CVD and may also be triggered by HIV. These findings warrant confirmation in independent samples."
https://openalex.org/W2775265282,"Notch signaling is a ubiquitous signal transduction pathway found in most if not all metazoan cell types characterized to date. It is indispensable for cell differentiation as well as tissue growth, tissue remodeling, and apoptosis. Although the canonical Notch signaling pathway is well characterized, accumulating evidence points to the existence of multiple, less well-defined layers of regulation. In this study, we investigated the function of the intracellular domain (ICD) of the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 (DLL4). We provide evidence that the DLL4 ICD is required for normal DLL4 subcellular localization. We further show that it is cleaved and interacts with the JUN proto-oncogene, which forms part of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex. Mechanistically, the DLL4 ICD inhibited JUN binding to DNA and thereby controlled the expression of JUN target genes, including DLL4. Our work further demonstrated that JUN strongly stimulates endothelial cell tube formation and that DLL4 constrains this process. These results raise the possibility that Notch/DLL4 signaling is bidirectional and suggest that the DLL4 ICD could represent a point of cross-talk between Notch and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling."

In this theoretical study we propose a novel canonical microcircuit model and find that it supports two basic computational operations: a gating mechanism and working memory. By means of bifurcation analysis we systematically investigate the dynamical behavior of the canonical microcircuit with respect to parameters that govern the local network balance, that is, the relationship between excitation and inhibition, and key intrinsic feedback architectures of canonical microcircuits. We relate the local behavior of the canonical microcircuit to cognitive processing and demonstrate how a network of interacting canonical microcircuits enables the establishment of spatiotemporal sequences in the context of syntax parsing during sentence comprehension. This study provides a framework for using individualized canonical microcircuits for the construction of biologically realistic networks supporting cognitive operations."
https://openalex.org/W2775057420,"The insulin/TOR signal transduction pathway plays a critical role in determining such important traits as body and organ size, metabolic homeostasis and life span. Although this pathway is highly conserved across the animal kingdom, the affected traits can exhibit important differences even between closely related species. Evolutionary studies of regulatory regions require the reliable identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here we have focused on the Insulin Receptor (InR) expression from its P2 promoter in the Drosophila genus, which in D. melanogaster is up-regulated by hypophosphorylated Drosophila FOXO (dFOXO). We have finely characterized this transcription factor binding sites in vitro along the 1.3 kb region upstream of the InR P2 promoter in five Drosophila species. Moreover, we have tested the effect of mutations in the characterized dFOXO sites of D. melanogaster in transgenic flies. The number of experimentally established binding sites varies across the 1.3 kb region of any particular species, and their distribution also differs among species. In D. melanogaster, InR expression from P2 is differentially affected by dFOXO binding sites at the proximal and distal halves of the species 1.3 kb fragment. The observed uneven distribution of binding sites across this fragment might underlie their differential contribution to regulate InR transcription."

However, limited data is available on their possible health effects. The present study assessed behavioral and histopathological consequences of exposing mice to 7.5 kHz MF at 12 or 120 μT for 5 weeks. No effects were observed on body weight, spontaneous activity, motor coordination, level of anxiety or aggression. In the Morris swim task, mice in the 120 μT group showed less steep learning curve than the other groups, but did not differ from controls in their search bias in the probe test. The passive avoidance task indicated a clear impairment of memory over 48 h in the 120 μT group. No effects on astroglial activation or neurogenesis were observed in the hippocampus. The mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor did not change but expression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA was significantly increased in the 120 μT group. These findings suggest that 7.5 kHz MF exposure may lead to mild learning and memory impairment, possibly through an inflammatory reaction in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2774037821,"Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a foodborne pathogenic bacterium that causes acute gastrointestinal illness, but its mechanisms of infection are incompletely described. We examined how host cell sterol composition affected Y. pseudotuberculosis uptake. To do this, we depleted or substituted cholesterol in human MDA-MB-231 epithelial cells with various alternative sterols. Decreasing host cell cholesterol significantly reduced pathogen internalization. When host cell cholesterol was substituted with various sterols, only desmosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol supported internalization. This specificity was not due to sterol dependence of bacterial attachment to host cells, which was similar with all sterols studied. Because a key step in Y. pseudotuberculosis internalization is interaction of the bacterial adhesins invasin and YadA with host cell β1 integrin, we compared the sterol dependence of wildtype Y. pseudotuberculosis internalization with that of Δinv, ΔyadA, and ΔinvΔyadA mutant strains. YadA deletion decreased bacterial adherence to host cells, whereas invasin deletion had no effect. Nevertheless, host cell sterol substitution had a similar effect on internalization of these bacterial deletion strains as on the wildtype bacteria. The ΔinvΔyadA double mutant adhered least to cells and so was not significantly internalized. The sterol structure dependence of Y. pseudotuberculosis internalization differed from that of endocytosis, as monitored using antibody-clustered β1 integrin and previous studies on other proteins, which had a more permissive sterol dependence. This study suggests that agents could be designed to interfere with internalization of Yersinia without disturbing endocytosis."

However, the structural mechanisms that regulate the chaperone function of PDILTs are unknown. Here, we report the structures of human PDILT (hPDILT) determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.4 Å resolution and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Distinct from previously reported U-like structures of related PDI family proteins, our structures revealed that hPDILT folds into a compact L-like structure in crystals and into an extended chain-like structure in solution. The hydrophobic regions and the hydrophobic pockets in hPDILT, which are important for substrate recognition, were clearly delineated in the crystal structure. Moreover, our results of the SAXS analysis and of structure-based substitutions and truncations indicated that the C-terminal tail in hPDILT is required for suppression of aggregation of denatured proteins, suggesting that the tail is crucial for the chaperone activity of PDILT. Taken together, our findings have identified the critical regions and conformational changes of PDILT that enable and control its activity. These results advance our understanding of the structural mechanisms involved in the chaperone activity of PDILT."

Here, we found that BMSCs that were derived from donors with osteoporosis were ineffective as cytotherapy for patients with experimental colitis and graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). In vivo and in vitro assays revealed that the capacity of osteoporotic BMSCs to induce T-cell apoptosis declined as a result of decreased Fas and FasL protein. Additional analysis revealed that let-7a, a micro-RNA induced by TNF-α in osteoporosis, inhibited the expression of the Fas/FasL system via post-transcriptional regulation. By knocking down let-7a expression, we successfully recovered the immunosuppressive capacity of osteoporotic BMSCs and improved their therapy for experimental colitis and GVHD. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the immunomodulatory properties of BMSCs are suppressed in osteoporosis and illustrates the molecular mechanism that underlies this suppression.

Grey Level Co-Occurrence Texture Matrices (GLCMs) extracted from Landsat and ALOS-PALSAR were used in conjunction with local field data to model and map local-scale field AGB using the Random Forest algorithm (r = 0.92 and RMSE = 31.33 Mg·ha-1). A support vector regression (SVR) model was used to identify the factors influencing variation in avian species richness at a 1km scale. AGB is one of the most important determinants of avian species richness for the study area. Topographic factors and anthropogenic factors such as distance from the roads were also found to strongly influence avian species richness. Hotspots of high AGB and high species richness concentration were mapped using hotspot analysis and the overlaps between areas of high AGB and avian species richness was calculated. Results show that the overlaps between areas of high AGB with high IUCN red listed avian species richness and endemic avian species richness were fairly limited at 13% and 8% at the 1-km scale. The overlap between 1) low AGB and low IUCN richness, and 2) low AGB and low endemic avian species richness was higher at 36% and 12% respectively. The enhanced capacity to spatially map the correlation between AGB and avian species richness distribution will further assist the conservation and protection of forest areas and threatened avian species."
https://openalex.org/W2774326563,"The sudden movement of a wide-field image leads to a reflexive eye tracking response referred to as short-latency ocular following. If the image motion occurs soon after a saccade the initial speed of the ocular following is enhanced, a phenomenon known as post-saccadic enhancement. We show in macaque monkeys that repeated exposure to the same stimulus regime over a period of months leads to progressive increases in the initial speeds of ocular following. The improvement in tracking speed occurs for ocular following with and without a prior saccade. As a result of the improvement in ocular following speeds, the influence of post-saccadic enhancement wanes with increasing levels of training. The improvement in ocular following speed following repeated exposure to the same oculomotor task represents a novel form of sensori-motor learning in the context of a reflexive movement."
https://openalex.org/W2774812992,"Increased interest in clinical application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in various medical fields poses a demand for better understanding of processes triggered by photo-treatment. Most of the work on PDT performed so far has focused on the immediate effects of photo-treatment. It is generally accepted that cellular damage occurs during light exposure and within a short period thereafter. If cells are not killed during the PDT, they might recover, depending on the extent of the photo-induced damage. Little is known, however, about the relationship between the properties of photosensitizers (PSs) and the delayed consequences of PDT. The aim of this work was to investigate cellular responses to sub-lethal photodynamic treatment and how toxicogenic potency may be affected by molecular features of the PS. Results demonstrated that for cationic porphyrin-based PSs, lipophilicity is the main factor determining the fate of the cells in the 24-hour post-illumination period. PSs with amphiphilic properties initiated oxidative reactions that continued in the dark, long after light exposure, and caused suppression of metabolism and loss of cell viability with concomitant changes in electrophoretic mobility of proteins, including caspases. Apoptotic activity was not stimulated in the post-illumination period. This study demonstrated that in PDT mediated by amphiphilic cationic metalloporphyrin PSs, even when immediate photo-damage is relatively mild, destructive oxidative processes initiated during PDT continue in the absence of light to substantially impair metabolism, and that post-illumination protein modification may modify utilization of cell death pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2774442667,"This paper contributes to the pursuit of socially sustainable water and sanitation infrastructure for all people by discovering statistically robust relationships between Hofstede’s dimensions of cross-cultural comparison and the choice of contract award types, project type, and primary revenue sources. This analysis, which represents 973 projects distributed across 24 low- and middle-income nations, uses a World Bank dataset describing high capital cost water and sewerage projects funded through private investment. The results show that cultural dimensions explain variation in the choice of contract award types, project type, and primary revenue sources. These results provide empirical evidence that strategies for water and sewerage project organization are not culturally neutral. The data show, for example, that highly individualistic contexts are more likely to select competitive contract award types and to depend on user fees to provide the primary project revenue stream post-construction. By selecting more locally appropriate ways to organize projects, project stakeholders will be better able to pursue the construction of socially sustainable water and sewerage infrastructure."
https://openalex.org/W2774184826,"Decisional Balance and Processes of Change are generally addressed in motivational interventions for the treatment of cannabis use disorders. However, specific aspects of these multifaceted constructs, with greater relevance for severe cannabis users, need to be ascertained to enable better interventions. This study aimed to compare the different facets of decisional balance and processes of change between mild and severe cannabis users in a community-based sample of young undergraduates. Thirty-one severe cannabis users and 31 mild cannabis users, indicated with the Severity of Dependence Scale, were assessed using the Decisional Balance Questionnaire (DBQ) and the Processes of Change Questionnaire (PCQ). We found that severe cannabis users had higher scores in the DBQ dimensions of Utilitarian Gains for the Self, Utilitarian Gains for Significant Others, and Self-approval, as well as in the total subscale of Gains but not Losses. The group of severe cannabis users also had higher scores in the PCQ dimensions of Self-revaluations and Counter-conditioning. Our results pinpoint specific dimensions of Decisional Balance and Processes of Change that are endorsed by severe cannabis users. This knowledge could be applied to inform motivational interventions targeting severe cannabis users."
