https://openalex.org/W2986556792,"Gillman, Gilbert, Gillman and Spence in a recent paper1 reported a series of malformations obtained in newborn rats as a result of injection of the dye trypan blue into female rats during varying stages of pregnancy. One of the interesting features of these malformations in rats is their remarkable resemblance to abnormalities known to occur in mice as effects of mutations2,3."

https://openalex.org/W2043453975,"THE optical isomers of α-keto-(β-methylvaleric acid have been prepared by enzymatic oxidation of the corresponding D-amino-acids1. The keto-acid isomers (and their 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones) prepared by enzymatic oxidation of D-isoleucine and D-alloisoleucine exhibited optical rotations which were equal in magnitude and opposite in direction1,2. Furthermore, from microbiological studies (to be reported in detail elsewhere), a purity of at least 98 per cent may be assigned to the lævorotatory isomer of α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid prepared by enzymatic oxidation of D-isoleucine. These findings indicate that the configuration about the β-carbon atom is not measurably altered by enzymatic oxidation of the D-amino-acids or during isolation of the keto-acid."
https://openalex.org/W2050235261,"IN an investigation on the chemoreceptivity of Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon), Begg and Hogben1 stated that the normal undesiccated males of this species showed a response to moisture if the difference in relative humidity exceeded 50 per cent. In the desiccated males the reaction grew more pronounced. The preferred relative humidity was reported to be about 90 per cent. No response to humidity differences was observed in normal or desiccated females."

https://openalex.org/W2039286293,"ACCORDING to van Dam1, the high utilization of oxygen in fishes is due, among other things, to the circumstance that in the gills water and blood flow in opposite directions. The question rises whether this hypothesis can be verified experimentally. The direction of the blood stream in the gill lamellae is not liable to changes ; that of the water current, however, can be reversed."

https://openalex.org/W2083113684,"IT has already been shown1,2 that 4-amino-imidazole-5-carboxamide (I) is a precursor of the purines in E. coli; a purine-requiring mutant of the organism grows in a medium containing this substance. On the other hand, it has been observed3,4 that synthetic 4-amino-imidazole-5-carboxamide is little utilized by a growing culture of E. coli. The following observations will eliminate this apparent discrepancy."
https://openalex.org/W2053407021,"CYTOCHROME c is the only well-characterized natural haem–protein compound which, in the presence of excess acid acetone, is not split into haematin and protein. The stability of the haem – protein link in cytochrome c was further emphasized when Hill and Keilin1 attempted to prepare the unmodified porphyrin of the component. In the presence of reducing agents in acid solution iron is removed, leaving an ether-insoluble porphyrin which has been shown2,3 still to contain peptide groups. From a study of this ‘porphyrin c’, Theorell4 concluded that in native cytochrome c the haem is bound to the protein not only by linkage to the iron, but also by stable thio-ether linkages connecting the α-carbon atoms of side-chains 2 and 4 of protoporphyrin with two terminal 1-cysteine residues of the protein."

https://openalex.org/W2091796314,"THE alkaloid dioscorine, C13H19O2N, was first isolated in 1894 by Boorsma1 from Dioscorea hirsuta, Bl., and obtained in a crystalline condition by Schutte2. On the basis of degradation experiments, Gorter3 in 1911 suggested that the alkaloid belonged to the tropane group, and proposed the following structure:"

https://openalex.org/W2004500564,"Colter and Quastel1 have shown that many amines (benzedrine, ephedrine, tyramine, methylamine, di-methylamine, ethanolamine and histamine) act as competitive anticholine oxidases, and protect choline oxidase against the inactivating effect of nitrogen mustard. It is well known that irradiation with X-rays has many effects in common with mustards. Accordingly, we tried the least toxic of these amines as protector in mice against a lethal dose of X-rays."

https://openalex.org/W2086427859,"IT is stated by Knapp1 in his standard text-book on “Cacao Fermentation” that caffeine, the minor alkaloid of cocoa, occurs in fresh cacao beans as an L-epicatechin–caffeine complex. This statement would appear to be based on the work of Ultée and Van Dorssen2, who isolated such a complex from aqueous extracts of beans, and on the mainly unpublished work of Adam3,4, who showed that simple mixing of aqueous solutions of the two substances produced the sparingly soluble complex."

With the view of estimating the nicotine content in tobacco species grown in India, particularly in those of low nicotine content obtained in grafting experiments, a rapid semi-micro method of distillation followed by a spectrophotometric method of estimation have been developed."

https://openalex.org/W2007222491,"THE sensitivity of a subject to discomfort arising from his environment may be dependent in some degree on his familiarity with, or technical knowledge of, the environment. Some evidence to this effect has accumulated from a long series of field-studies of lighting. A subject may be unconscious of glare from a bare lamp over his desk until his attention is directed to it, but thereafter may become aware of glare-discomfort in other environments as well. Other workers have recorded similar effects1."
https://openalex.org/W2011698192,"M. Fabinyi and J. Szebehelyi1 have reported that histamine neutralizes the inhibition of hyaluronidase with heparin. We had already dealt with the problem of the influence of histamine on the system hyaluronic acid – hyaluronidase – hyaluronidase-inhibiting agents. Since we had not observed any effect of histamine at that time, we decided to repeat our investigations. Unfortunately, the communication by Fabinyi and Szebehelyi gives no information as to the source of their hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase, or the concentrations used in their investigations; and we have received no reply to a request for further information."
https://openalex.org/W2029717200,"IN the course of attempts, as yet unsuccessful, to produce a non-malignant ascites growth of undifferentiated cells in peritoneal exudate, virgin female mice of two genotypes were injected intraperitoneally with homologous embryonic tissue mince, dissociated in a Waring micro-blendor and capable of passage through a 22-gauge hypodermic needle. Embryos ranged from the 4½-mm. 13-day stage, at which condensations of mesenchyme appear at the location of the future skeletal axes, to 8 mm. in length. Each of ten hosts received an inoculum equivalent to three embryos."
