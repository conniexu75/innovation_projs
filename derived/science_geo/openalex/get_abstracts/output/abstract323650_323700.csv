https://openalex.org/W2014735733,"The kyanite-sillimanite-andalusite triple point exists in the pressure-temperature plane at 8 +/- 0.5 kb and 300 +/- 50 degrees C. Reactions are accomplished experimentally with a Bridgman opposed-anvil press (with an external furnace), modified to provide shearing of the sample charges. All three equilibrium boundaries are proved by reversed reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2042651763,Algae from terrestrial and fresh-water habitats in Antarctica were examined for ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Nostoc commune was the only species capable of growing in nitrogen-free medium; nitrogen fixation by this species was verified by assimilation of N(15). The importance of nitrogen-fixing algae to terrestrial life in the Antarctic is discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1979444895,"Wyoming montmorillonite (bentonite, particles 2 to 0.2 micro in diameter) treated with hydrogen-ionsaturated resin shows, on titration in 1N KNO(3) with NaOH by a continuously recording instrument, a third buffer range between pH 5.5 and 7.6 in addition to the first range where exchangeable hydronium is neutralized and the second range where a reaction with exchangeable aluminohexahydronium, Al(OH(2))(6)(3+), occurs. The third range increases considerably when the hydrogen-ion-saturated clay is aged, and is attributed to basic aluminum compounds formed in the presence of negative charges of montmorillonite, comparable to ""third range"" buffering noted in aged, partially neutralized aluminum chloride solutions."
https://openalex.org/W1975382350,"Xenon tetrafluoride reacts with water to yield xenon, oxygen, hydrofluoric acid, and a very soluble species containing xenon. Evaporation of the solution yields a white, crystal-line substance which has been identified as xenon (VI) oxide, XeO(3)."

https://openalex.org/W1983091841,The rare-earth element content of three tektites has been determined by neutron activation analysis. The relative abundance patterns are all nearly alike and are identical to the pattern characteristic of well-differentiated terrestrial sediments. Possible consequences of finding this pattern in truly extraterrestrial matter are considered.

https://openalex.org/W2065980128,"Fundamental fluorescence equations were examined. Deviations from the theoretical were observed by varying the light path length to determine effects on ""apparent"" fluorescence. It was found that the decrease in emission of morphine solutions with the increase in concentration was caused by absorption effects that prevented excitation of the whole system."
https://openalex.org/W2003127536,"A theoretical basis for logarithmic correlations of fractionated radionuclide compositions is described. Implications for nuclear chemical studies of bomb debris and application to the prediction of partition of Sr(90) and other biologically important radionuclides among particles of various sizes, and consequently between local and world-wide fallout, are indicated."

https://openalex.org/W1982479451,"Nuclear activation analysis-whether with instrumental or radiochemical procedures, manual or automatic systems-seems destined for an important place in analytic chemistry. Experience will determine the best choice of activating particles and the best detectors, or it may even lead to the development of entirely new techniques. But it seems evident that nuclear activation analysis will increasingly satisfy the need for precise, sensitive, and rapid elementary analysis, and will do so at relatively low cost."
