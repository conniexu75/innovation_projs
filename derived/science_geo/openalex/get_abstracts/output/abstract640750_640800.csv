https://openalex.org/W2978347532,"An axion insulator is a correlated topological phase, which is predicted to arise from the formation of a charge-density wave in a Weyl semimetal1,2-that is, a material in which electrons behave as massless chiral fermions. The accompanying sliding mode in the charge-density-wave phase-the phason-is an axion3,4 and is expected to cause anomalous magnetoelectric transport effects. However, this axionic charge-density wave has not yet been experimentally detected. Here we report the observation of a large positive contribution to the magnetoconductance in the sliding mode of the charge-density-wave Weyl semimetal (TaSe4)2I for collinear electric and magnetic fields. The positive contribution to the magnetoconductance originates from the anomalous axionic contribution of the chiral anomaly to the phason current, and is locked to the parallel alignment of the electric and magnetic fields. By rotating the magnetic field, we show that the angular dependence of the magnetoconductance is consistent with the anomalous transport of an axionic charge-density wave. Our results show that it is possible to find experimental evidence for axions in strongly correlated topological condensed matter systems, which have so far been elusive in any other context."

https://openalex.org/W2979144696,"Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disruption is an early pathogenic event in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Yet, direct links between NMJ pathways and ALS-associated genes such as FUS, whose heterozygous mutations cause aggressive forms of ALS, remain elusive. In a knock-in Fus-ALS mouse model, we identified postsynaptic NMJ defects in newborn homozygous mutants that were attributable to mutant FUS toxicity in skeletal muscle. Adult heterozygous knock-in mice displayed smaller neuromuscular endplates that denervated before motor neuron loss, which is consistent with 'dying-back' neuronopathy. FUS was enriched in subsynaptic myonuclei, and this innervation-dependent enrichment was distorted in FUS-ALS. Mechanistically, FUS collaborates with the ETS transcription factor ERM to stimulate transcription of acetylcholine receptor genes. Co-cultures of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons and myotubes from patients with FUS-ALS revealed endplate maturation defects due to intrinsic FUS toxicity in both motor neurons and myotubes. Thus, FUS regulates acetylcholine receptor gene expression in subsynaptic myonuclei, and muscle-intrinsic toxicity of ALS mutant FUS may contribute to dying-back motor neuronopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2978319538,"Axonal injury results in regenerative success or failure, depending on whether the axon lies in the peripheral or the CNS, respectively. The present study addresses whether epigenetic signatures in dorsal root ganglia discriminate between regenerative and non-regenerative axonal injury. Chromatin immunoprecipitation for the histone 3 (H3) post-translational modifications H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H3K27me3; an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin; and RNA sequencing were performed in dorsal root ganglia after sciatic nerve or dorsal column axotomy. Distinct histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility signatures correlated with gene expression after peripheral, but not central, axonal injury. DNA-footprinting analyses revealed new transcriptional regulators associated with regenerative ability. Machine-learning algorithms inferred the direction of most of the gene expression changes. Neuronal conditional deletion of the chromatin remodeler CCCTC-binding factor impaired nerve regeneration, implicating chromatin organization in the regenerative competence. Altogether, the present study offers the first epigenomic map providing insight into the transcriptional response to injury and the differential regenerative ability of sensory neurons. This manuscript describes the systematic investigation of epigenomic signatures discriminating between regenerative success and failure in dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons following axonal injury. This epigenomic map offers a tool to design novel approaches for neuronal repair."

We crossed one genome-edited dairy bull, homozygous for the dominant PC Celtic POLLED allele, with horned cows (pp) and obtained six heterozygous (PCp) polled calves. The calves had no horns and were otherwise healthy and phenotypically unremarkable. We conducted whole-genome sequencing of all animals using an Illumina HiSeq4000 to achieve ~20× coverage. Bioinformatics analyses revealed the bull was a compound heterozygote, carrying one naturally occurring PC Celtic POLLED allele and an allele containing an additional introgression of the homology-directed repair donor plasmid along with the PC Celtic allele. These alleles segregated in the offspring of this bull, and inheritance of either allele produced polled calves. No other unintended genomic alterations were observed. These data can be used to inform conversations in the scientific community, with regulatory authorities and with the public around 'intentional genomic alterations' and future regulatory actions regarding genome-edited animals."

https://openalex.org/W2978106477,"Phospholipids are key components of cellular membranes and are emerging as important functional regulators of different membrane proteins, including pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs). Here, we take advantage of the prokaryote channel ELIC (Erwinia ligand-gated ion channel) as a model to understand the determinants of phospholipid interactions in this family of receptors. A high-resolution structure of ELIC in a lipid-bound state reveals a phospholipid site at the lower half of pore-forming transmembrane helices M1 and M4 and at a nearby site for neurosteroids, cholesterol or general anesthetics. This site is shaped by an M4-helix kink and a Trp-Arg-Pro triad that is highly conserved in eukaryote GABAA/C and glycine receptors. A combined approach reveals that M4 is intrinsically flexible and that M4 deletions or disruptions of the lipid-binding site accelerate desensitization in ELIC, suggesting that lipid interactions shape the agonist response. Our data offer a structural context for understanding lipid modulation in pLGICs."
https://openalex.org/W2979001205,"Sensorimotor control during overt movements is characterized in terms of three building blocks: a controller, a simulator and a state estimator. We asked whether the same framework could explain the control of internal states in the absence of movements. Recently, it was shown that the brain controls the timing of future movements by adjusting an internal speed command. We trained monkeys in a novel task in which the speed command had to be dynamically controlled based on the timing of a sequence of flashes. Recordings from the frontal cortex provided evidence that the brain updates the internal speed command after each flash based on the error between the timing of the flash and the anticipated timing of the flash derived from a simulated motor plan. These findings suggest that cognitive control of internal states may be understood in terms of the same computational principles as motor control."

https://openalex.org/W2979318350,"The transcription factor FOXO3 has been associated in different tumor entities with hallmarks of cancer, including metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, maintenance of tumor-initiating stem cells, and drug resistance. In neuroblastoma (NB), we recently demonstrated that nuclear FOXO3 promotes tumor angiogenesis in vivo and chemoresistance in vitro. Hence, inhibiting the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, as no FOXO3 inhibitor is clinically available to date, we used a medium-throughput fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) screening in a drug-repositioning approach to identify compounds that bind to the FOXO3-DNA-binding-domain (DBD). Carbenoxolone (CBX), a glycyrrhetinic acid derivative, was identified as a potential FOXO3-inhibitory compound that binds to the FOXO3-DBD with a binding affinity of 19 µM. Specific interaction of CBX with the FOXO3-DBD was validated by fluorescence-based electrophoretic mobility shift assay (FAM-EMSA). CBX inhibits the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 target genes, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), DEPP-, and BIM promoter reporter assays, and real-time RT-PCR analyses. In high-stage NB cells with functional TP53, FOXO3 triggers the expression of SESN3, which increases chemoprotection and cell survival. Importantly, FOXO3 inhibition by CBX treatment at pharmacologically relevant concentrations efficiently repressed FOXO3-mediated SESN3 expression and clonogenic survival and sensitized high-stage NB cells to chemotherapy in a 2D and 3D culture model. Thus, CBX might be a promising novel candidate for the treatment of therapy-resistant high-stage NB and other ""FOXO-resistant"" cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2977662102,"There is few significant attempt to integrate environmental regulation, government financial support, and corporate technological innovation in a methodological framework. Employing the data of the industrial enterprises with an annual turnover of over 20 million yuan from 30 Chinese provinces or municipalities between 2008 and 2016, this paper applies the fixed effect regression model to reveal the relationships between environmental regulation, government financial support, and corporate technological innovation simultaneously. Results show that: (1) there exists a U-shaped relation between environmental regulation intensity and technological innovation of enterprises which declines first and then climbs up, and China is still at the stage of inhibition before the “inflection point”. (2) government financial support does not significantly work on technological innovation directly, but environmental regulation drives this effect to be achieved; when the value of lnER is higher than 3.69, government financial support can significantly facilitate corporate technological innovation. (3) the comparison between regional samples reveals that heterogeneity exists in the influence of environmental regulation intensity and government financial support on corporate technological innovation. The threshold value of enabling effects of environmental regulation in eastern region is higher than that of the central and western region. These results remain consistent after we experiment several robustness checks. Theory and policy implications of our work are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2978484099,"RNA-binding motif protein 10 (RBM10) is an RNA-binding protein frequently deleted or mutated in lung cancer cells. Recent reports showed that the knockdown of RBM10 in human cancer cells enhances the growth of mouse tumor xenografts, suggesting that RBM10 acts as a tumor suppressor. RBM10 also regulates alternative splicing and controls cancer cell proliferation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for its tumor suppression role remain largely unclear. Here, we for the first time report that RBM10 can induce apoptosis and inhibit cancer cell proliferation by activating p53. Our analysis of cancer genomic databases showed that patients with wild-type RBM10 and p53 survive longer than do those with mutated p53 or less RBM10. RBM10 overexpression markedly inhibited mitochondrial respiration, cell migration and proliferation of various cancer cells that harbor wild-type p53. Also, RBM10 overexpression elongated p53’s half-life by disrupting MDM2-p53 interaction and subsequently repressing p53 ubiquitination, whereas knockdown of RBM10 decreased p53 stability. Altogether, our results demonstrate that RBM10 inhibits cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in part by blocking the MDM2-p53 feedback loop."
https://openalex.org/W2978406298,"We analyse and compare NBA and Euroleague basketball through box-score statistics in the period from 2000 to 2017. Overall, the quantitative differences between the NBA and Euroleague have decreased and are still decreasing. Differences are even smaller after we adjust for game length and when playoff NBA basketball is considered instead of regular season basketball. The differences in factors that contribute to success are also very small—(Oliver’s) four factors derived from box-score statistics explain most of the variability in team success even if the coefficients are determined for both competitions simultaneously instead of each competition separately. The largest difference is game pace—in the NBA there are more possessions per game. The number of blocks, the defensive rebounding rate and the number of free throws per foul committed are also higher in the NBA, while the number of fouls committed is lower. Most of the differences that persist can be reasonably explained by the contrasts between the better athleticism of NBA players and more emphasis on tactical aspects of basketball in the Euroleague."
https://openalex.org/W2979095610,"Abstract Despite intense research and clinical efforts, patients affected by advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) have still a poor prognosis. The discovery of colorectal (CR) cancer stem cell (CSC) as the cell compartment responsible for tumor initiation and propagation may provide new opportunities for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Given the reduced sensitivity of CR-CSCs to chemotherapy and the ability of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) to promote colonic stem cell differentiation, we aimed to investigate whether an enhanced variant of BMP7 (BMP7v) could sensitize to chemotherapy-resistant CRC cells and tumors. Thirty-five primary human cultures enriched in CR-CSCs, including four from chemoresistant metastatic lesions, were used for in vitro studies and to generate CR-CSC-based mouse avatars to evaluate tumor growth and progression upon treatment with BMP7v alone or in combination with standard therapy or PI3K inhibitors. BMP7v treatment promotes CR-CSC differentiation and recapitulates the cell differentiation-related gene expression profile by suppressing Wnt pathway activity and reducing mesenchymal traits and survival of CR-CSCs. Moreover, in CR-CSC-based mouse avatars, BMP7v exerts an antiangiogenic effect and sensitizes tumor cells to standard chemotherapy regardless of the mutational, MSI, and CMS profiles. Of note, tumor harboring PIK3CA mutations were affected to a lower extent by the combination of BMP7v and chemotherapy. However, the addition of a PI3K inhibitor to the BMP7v-based combination potentiates PIK3CA -mutant tumor drug response and reduces the metastatic lesion size. These data suggest that BMP7v treatment may represent a useful antiangiogenic and prodifferentiation agent, which renders CSCs sensitive to both standard and targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2979419652,"A successful pregnancy is critically dependent upon proper placental development and function. During human placentation, villous cytotrophoblast (CTB) progenitors differentiate to form syncytiotrophoblasts (SynTBs), which provide the exchange surface between the mother and fetus and secrete hormones to ensure proper progression of pregnancy. However, epigenetic mechanisms that regulate SynTB differentiation from CTB progenitors are incompletely understood. Here, we show that lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; also known as KDM1A), a histone demethylase, is essential to this process. LSD1 is expressed both in CTB progenitors and differentiated SynTBs in first-trimester placental villi; accordingly, expression in SynTBs is maintained throughout gestation. Impairment of LSD1 function in trophoblast progenitors inhibits induction of endogenous retrovirally encoded genes SYNCYTIN1/endogenous retrovirus group W member 1, envelope (ERVW1) and SYNCYTIN2/endogenous retrovirus group FRD member 1, envelope (ERVFRD1), encoding fusogenic proteins critical to human trophoblast syncytialization. Loss of LSD1 also impairs induction of chorionic gonadotropin α (CGA) and chorionic gonadotropin β (CGB) genes, which encode α and β subunits of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), a hormone essential to modulate maternal physiology during pregnancy. Mechanistic analyses at the endogenous ERVW1, CGA, and CGB loci revealed a regulatory axis in which LSD1 induces demethylation of repressive histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9Me2) and interacts with transcription factor GATA2 to promote RNA polymerase II (RNA-POL-II) recruitment and activate gene transcription.

The primitive syncytium invades the endometrium and takes up nutrients from the maternal environment to ensure further embryonic development.

As a part of these repressive complexes, LSD1 specifically mediates demethylation of mono- and dimethylated H3K4, leading to transcriptional repression of a gene.

In those contexts, LSD1 functions as an activator of gene transcription as demethylation of H3K9 residues is often associated with gene activation. Thus, depending on the cellular context and interaction with other factors, LSD1 can promote either activation or repression of a gene. Mouse embryos with global deletion of Lsd1 gene die around embryonic day 7.5 (36Zhu D. Hölz S. Metzger E. Pavlovic M. Jandausch A. Jilg C. Galgoczy P. Herz C. Moser M. Metzger D. Günther T.

These studies reveal LSD1 as an important regulator of trophoblast development during placentation in mouse and in utero survival of a developing mouse embryo. Both mouse and human undergo hemochorial placentation; however, the trophoblast cell types and the placentation process in these two species differ significantly (52Schmidt A. Morales-Prieto D.M. Pastuschek J. Fröhlich K. Markert U.R. Only humans have human placentas: molecular differences between mice and humans.J. Reprod. Immunol. 2015; 108 (25817465): 65-7110.1016/j.jri.2015.03.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For example, mouse trophoblast syncytialization is not dependent on ERVW1 or ERVFRD1 as different endogenous retrovirally encoded proteins are involved in that process (53Dupressoir A. Vernochet C. Bawa O. Harper F. Pierron G. Opolon P. Heidmann T. Syncytin-A knockout mice demonstrate the critical role in placentation of a fusogenic, endogenous retrovirus-derived, envelope gene.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106 (19564597): 12127-1213210.1073/pnas.0902925106Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mouse placentation is not associated with induction of CGA and CGB expressions (52Schmidt A. Morales-Prieto D.M. Pastuschek J. Fröhlich K. Markert U.R. Only humans have human placentas: molecular differences between mice and humans.J. Reprod. Immunol. 2015; 108 (25817465): 65-7110.1016/j.jri.2015.03.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, despite this importance in the context of mouse placentation, the role of LSD1 in human trophoblast development is yet to be defined. In addition, it is also unknown how histone modification dynamics is regulated by LSD1 during human trophoblast development and whether LSD1 functions as a coactivator or a corepressor during that process. Given the conserved nature of LSD1 and the phenotype of the Lsd1-mutant mice, in this study, we investigated LSD1 expression at different stages of human placentation. We found that LSD1 is highly expressed in SynTBs throughout gestation. Therefore, we tested the importance of LSD1 via loss-of-function analyses and confirmed an essential role of LSD1 in human SynTB differentiation. Studies with gene-knockout mouse models and mouse TSCs indicated that LSD1 is essential to prevent premature differentiation of mouse TSCs and is also required for directing their differentiation fate (36Zhu D.

A search of published studies related to LSD1 function in human trophoblasts revealed only three studies with human trophoblast cell lines (HTR-8/SVneo, JEG3, and JAR cells), implicating LSD1 as a part of the gene regulatory machinery downstream of long noncoding RNAs (54Wu D.

Learning of associations involves plasticity of excitatory connectivity, but it remains poorly understood how information flow is reorganized in networks and how inhibition contributes to this process. We trained adult zebrafish in an appetitive odor discrimination task and analyzed odor representations in a specific compartment of the posterior zone of the dorsal telencephalon (Dp), the homolog of mammalian olfactory cortex. Associative conditioning enhanced responses with a preference for the positively conditioned odor. Moreover, conditioning systematically remapped odor representations along an axis in coding space that represented attractiveness (valence). Interindividual variations in this mapping predicted variations in behavioral odor preference. Photoinhibition of interneurons resulted in specific modifications of odor representations that mirrored effects of conditioning and reduced experience-dependent, interindividual variations in odor-valence mapping. These results reveal an individualized odor-to-valence map that is shaped by inhibition and reorganized during learning."

Here, using self-limited Escherichia coli peritonitis in mice, we identified endogenous maresin (MaR) CTR (MCTR), protectin (PD) CTR (PCTR), and resolvin CTR in infectious peritoneal exudates and distal spleens, as well as investigated enzymes involved in their biosynthesis. PCTRs were identified to be temporally regulated in peritoneal exudates and spleens. PCTR1 and MCTR1 were each produced by human recombinant leukotriene (LT) C4 synthase (LTC4S) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) [microsomal GST (mGST)2, mGST3, and GST-μ (GSTM)4] from their epoxide precursors [16S,17S-epoxy-PD (ePD) and 13S,14S-epoxy-MaR (eMaR)], with preference for GSTM4. Both eMaR and ePD inhibited LTB4 production by LTA4 hydrolase. LTC4S, mGST2, mGST3, and GSTM4 were each expressed in human M1- and M2-like macrophages where LTC4S inhibition increased CTRs. Finally, PCTR1 showed potent analgesic action. These results demonstrate CTR biosynthesis in mouse peritonitis, human spleens, and human macrophages, as well as identification of key enzymes in these pathways. Moreover, targeting LTC4S increases CTR metabolomes, giving a new strategy to stimulate resolution and tissue regeneration.-Jouvene, C. C., Shay, A. E., Soens, M. A., Norris, P. C., Haeggström, J.

MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein comprises S1 and S2 subunits, with the S1 subunit being a primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Recombinant RVΔP, which expresses S1 fused with transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains together with 14 amino acids from the ectodomains of the RV-glycoprotein (RV-G), was developed using a reverse genetics method and named RVΔP-MERS/S1. Following generation of RVΔP-MERS/S1 and RVΔP, our analysis revealed that they shared similar growth properties, with the expression of S1 in RVΔP-MERS/S1-infected cells confirmed by immunofluorescence and western blot, and the immunogenicity and pathogenicity evaluated using mouse infection experiments. We observed no rabies-associated signs or symptoms in mice inoculated with RVΔP-MERS/S1. Moreover, virus-specific neutralizing antibodies against both MERS-CoV and RV were induced in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with RVΔP-MERS/S1.

https://openalex.org/W2979968002,"Zinc transporter-8 (ZnT8) primarily functions as a zinc-sequestrating transporter in the insulin-secretory granules (ISGs) of pancreatic β-cells. Loss-of-function mutations in ZnT8 are associated with protection against type-2 diabetes (T2D), but the protective mechanism is unclear. Here, we developed an in-cell ZnT8 assay to track endogenous ZnT8 responses to metabolic and inflammatory stresses applied to human insulinoma EndoC-βH1 cells. Unexpectedly, high glucose and free fatty acids did not alter cellular ZnT8 levels, but proinflammatory cytokines acutely, reversibly, and gradually down-regulated ZnT8. Approximately 50% of the cellular ZnT8 was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which was the primary target of the cytokine-mediated ZnT8 down-regulation. Transcriptome profiling of cytokine-exposed β-cells revealed an adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) including a marked immunoproteasome activation that coordinately degraded ZnT8 and insulin over a 1,000-fold cytokine concentration range. RNAi-mediated ZnT8 knockdown protected cells against cytokine cytotoxicity, whereas inhibiting immunoproteasomes blocked cytokine-induced ZnT8 degradation and triggered a transition of the adaptive UPR to cell apoptosis. Hence, cytokine-induced down-regulation of the ER ZnT8 level promotes adaptive UPR, acting as a protective mechanism that decongests the ER burden of ZnT8 to protect β-cells from proapoptotic UPR during chronic low-grade inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2977763752,"Since the discovery that entomopathogenic fungi can live inside plants as endophytes, researchers have been trying to understand how this affects mainly plants and herbivores.

While we did not find any difference in nymph production for the first generation of aphids, second-generation aphids on both seed- and spray inoculated plants produced significantly higher numbers of nymphs than aphids on uninoculated plants. This emphasizes the importance of two (or multi-) generational experimentation. Beauveria bassiana was recovered from 26.0, 68.8 and 6.3% of respectively seed-, spray inoculated and control plants, thus, demonstrating its ability to live as an endophyte in V. faba. The confirmation that plants inoculated with entomopathogenic fungi can have a positive effect on pest insects makes careful consideration of these multi-trophic interactions imperative."

Natl. Acad. Sci USA 113:14025-14030). Here, we show if the lipid-to- MαCD ratio is too high or low, cells can round up and develop membrane leakiness. We found that this cell damage can be reversed/prevented if cells are allowed to recover from the exchange step by incubation in complete growth medium. After exchange and transfer to complete growth medium cell growth was similar to that of untreated cells. In some cases, cell damage was also prevented by carrying out exchange at close to room temperature (rather than at 37°C). Exchange with lipids that do (sphingomyelin) or do not (unsaturated phosphatidylcholine) support a high level of membrane order in lipid vesicles had the analogous effect on plasma membrane order, confirming exogenous lipid localization in the plasma membrane. Importantly, changes in lipid composition and plasma membrane properties after exchange and recovery persisted for several hours. Thus, it should be possible to use lipid exchange to investigate the effect of plasma membrane lipid composition upon several aspects of membrane structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2977664214,"The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is a globally distributed marine species whose evolutionary history has been molded by geological events and oceanographic and climate changes. Divergence between Atlantic and Pacific clades has been associated with the uplift of the Panama Isthmus, and inside the Pacific region, a biogeographic barrier located west of Hawaii has restricted the gene flow between Central/Eastern and Western Pacific populations. We investigated the carapace shape of C. mydas from individuals of Atlantic, Eastern Pacific, and Western Pacific genetic lineages using geometric morphometrics to evaluate congruence between external morphology and species' phylogeography. Furthermore, we assessed the variation of carapace shape according to foraging grounds. Three morphologically distinctive groups were observed which aligned with predictions based on the species' lineages, suggesting a substantial genetic influence on carapace shape. Based on the relationship between this trait and genetic lineages, we propose the existence of at least three distinct morphotypes of C. mydas. Well-defined groups in some foraging grounds (Galapagos, Costa Rica and New Zealand) may suggest that ecological or environmental conditions in these sites could also be influencing carapace shape in C. mydas. Geometric morphometrics is a suitable tool to differentiate genetic lineages in this cosmopolitan marine species. Consequently, this study opens new possibilities to explore and test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses in species with wide morphological variation and broad geographic distribution range."

Concurrent and convergent validity was assessed by computing correlations with validated questionnaires for measuring job crafting (Job Crafting Scale, JCS), engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, UWES-9) and job burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey, MBI-GS). The results indicated a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = .880) which was similar to the original scale, and provided a good fit to the three-dimensional model tested. Appropriate evidence of construct validity was also shown (r = .45 with total JCS; r = .52 with total UWES-9 and r-values between -.33 and .45 with MBI dimensions). The results confirmed that the Spanish translation of the JCQ is a suitable tool for measuring job crafting and enabling practitioners and researchers to further expand the existing knowledge of this concept."
https://openalex.org/W2980170829,"Arf GAP with Src homology 3 domain, ankyrin repeat, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain 1 (ASAP1) is a multidomain GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-type GTPases. ASAP1 affects integrin adhesions, the actin cytoskeleton, and invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. ASAP1's cellular function depends on its highly-regulated and robust ARF GAP activity, requiring both the PH and the ARF GAP domains of ASAP1, and is modulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). The mechanistic basis of PIP2-stimulated GAP activity is incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether PIP2 controls binding of the N-terminal extension of ARF1 to ASAP1's PH domain and thereby regulates its GAP activity. Using [Δ17]ARF1, lacking the N terminus, we found that PIP2 has little effect on ASAP1's activity. A soluble PIP2 analog, dioctanoyl-PIP2 (diC8PIP2), stimulated GAP activity on an N terminus–containing variant, [L8K]ARF1, but only marginally affected activity on [Δ17]ARF1. A peptide comprising residues 2–17 of ARF1 ([2–17]ARF1) inhibited GAP activity, and PIP2-dependently bound to a protein containing the PH domain and a 17-amino acid-long interdomain linker immediately N-terminal to the first β-strand of the PH domain. Point mutations in either the linker or the C-terminal α-helix of the PH domain decreased [2–17]ARF1 binding and GAP activity. Mutations that reduced ARF1 N-terminal binding to the PH domain also reduced the effect of ASAP1 on cellular actin remodeling. Mutations in the ARF N terminus that reduced binding also reduced GAP activity. We conclude that PIP2 regulates binding of ASAP1's PH domain to the ARF1 N terminus, which may partially regulate GAP activity."

However, iodine supplementation during early pregnancy and lactation can prevent the ill effects of iodine deficiency. This study evaluated maternal and infant thyroid function and infant visual information processing (VIP) in the context of maternal iodine supplementation. A community-based, randomized, supplementation trial was conducted. Mother infant dyads (n = 106) were enrolled within the first 10 days after delivery to participate in this study. Mothers were randomly assigned either to receive a potassium iodide capsule (225 μg iodine) daily for 26 weeks or iodized salt weekly for 26 weeks. Maternal thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroglobulin (Tg), urinary iodine concentration (UIC), breast milk iodine concentration (BMIC) and infant T4, TSH, UIC and VIP were measured as outcome variables. At baseline, neither mothers nor infants in the two groups were significantly different in any of the biomarkers or anthropometric measurements. Maternal TSH and goiter prevalence significantly decreased following iodine supplementation. The percentage of infants who preferentially remembered the familiar face was 26% in the capsule and 51% in the I-salt groups. Infant sex, length for age Z score, BMIC, maternal education and household food security were strong predictors of novelty quotient. In conclusion supplementation daily for six months with an iodine capsule or the use of appropriately iodized salt for an equivalent time was sufficient to reduce goiter and TSH in lactating women. Higher BMIC and LAZ as well as better household food security, maternal education, and male sex predicted higher novelty quotient scores in the VIP paradigm."

Using yeast as a model organism, we have shown previously that its two HIGD1 proteins, Rcf1 and Rcf2, are required for the generation and maintenance of a normal membrane potential (ΔΨ) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). We postulated that the lower ΔΨ observed in the absence of the HIGD1 proteins may be due to decreased proton pumping by complex IV (CIV) or enhanced leak of protons across the IMM. Here we measured the ΔΨ generated by complex III (CIII) to discriminate between these possibilities. First, we found that the decreased ΔΨ observed in the absence of the HIGD1 proteins cannot be due to decreased proton pumping by CIV because CIII, operating alone, also exhibited a decreased ΔΨ when HIGD1 proteins were absent. Because CIII can neither lower its pumping stoichiometry nor transfer protons completely across the IMM, this result indicates that HIGD1 protein ablation enhances proton leak across the IMM. Second, we demonstrate that this proton leak occurs through CIV because ΔΨ generation by CIII is restored when CIV is removed from the cell. Third, the proton leak appeared to take place through an inactive population of CIV that accumulates when HIGD1 proteins are absent. We conclude that HIGD1 proteins in yeast prevent CIV inactivation, likely by preventing the loss of lipids bound within the Cox3 protein of CIV.

It is important to note that this decrease in ΔΨ is independent of (i.e. not due to) the reduced accumulation of CIV that occurs in the absence of Rcf1. Decreases in ΔΨ were seen in the absence of only Rcf1 or only Rcf2 (8Strogolova V. Hoang N.H. Hosler J. Stuart R.A.

However, we could not rule out enhanced proton leak through CIV or some other component of the IMM. Here we measured the generation of ΔΨ by CIII of yeast in the presence or absence of the HIGD1 proteins and in the presence or absence of CIV to more precisely define the function of the yeast HIGD1 proteins. The data support the proposal that CIV is the dysfunctional component responsible for the lower ΔΨ of mitochondria in the absence of the HIGD1 proteins. However, the data are inconsistent with the proposal that the lower ΔΨ is due to decreased proton pumping by CIV. Rather, a population of inactive CIV appears to be capable of proton backleak across the IMM. Because disturbed lipid binding in Cox3 is known to enhance the inactivation of CIV (14Varanasi L.

The mechanism of CIII locks in its stoichiometry of charge separations, i.e. if CIII of intact mitochondria exhibits normal antimycin-sensitive ET activity, then it is capable of generating a normal ΔΨ. If the lower ΔΨ of Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria results from diminished proton pumping by CIV, then the ΔΨ developed by CIII, independent of CIV, should be the same in both Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria and normal mitochondria. If, however, the lower ΔΨ of Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria is due to increased proton leak across the IMM, the ΔΨ generated by CIII will be subject to this leak, and the ΔΨ generated by CIII will be lower in Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria than in normal mitochondria. The ΔΨ developed by CIII alone was assayed by measuring the uptake of the cationic fluorescent dye safranin during steady-state ET, using NADH or ethanol as electron donors and ferricyanide as the terminal electron acceptor (see “Experimental procedures”). Cyanide is present to inhibit CIV. NADH is oxidized by a peripheral membrane dehydrogenase that transfers the electrons to ubiquinone (21Luttik M.A. Overkamp K.M. Kötter P. de Vries S. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae NDE1 and NDE2 genes encode separate mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenases catalyzing the oxidation of cytosolic NADH.J. Biol.

Fig. 2C shows that CIII, even though it is present at normal levels and has normal activity (Fig. 2, A and B), showed an approximate 50% decline in safranin uptake in Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria during ET from NADH to ferricyanide. A similar result was obtained during the 10-fold slower rate of steady-state of ET through CIII driven by ethanol, which generates NADH in vivo as it is oxidized (Fig. 2D). In both cases, the ΔΨ generated by CIII ET is completely collapsed by addition of antimycin A (data not shown), confirming that antimycin A–sensitive ET through CIII is responsible for ΔΨ generation. Because the ΔΨ-generating power of CIII of WT and CIII of Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria are equal under these conditions, the lower ΔΨ in Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria indicated that a proton leak exists somewhere in the IMM of the mitochondria lacking the HIGD1 proteins. Comparison of the rates of coupled (controlled) ET and uncoupled (uncontrolled) ET through CIII provided independent confirmation that the ΔΨ generated by CIII is lower in intact Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria than in WT mitochondria. Controlled ET through CIII in intact WT mitochondria (Fig. 2E) is slower than in chemically uncoupled WT mitochondria (Fig. 2B) because of the inhibition of ET in intact mitochondria by ΔΨ. Controlled ET through CIII in Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria is also slower than in chemically uncoupled mitochondria (compare Fig. 2, B and E), but the extent of inhibition of ET by ΔΨ is clearly less than that in WT mitochondria. This indicates that a lower ΔΨ is generated by CIII ET in intact Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria than in intact WT mitochondria. Having established the presence of a leak for protons across the IMM of Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria, the obvious question is, where is it? Existing evidence suggests that the proton leak seen in the absence of the HIGD1 proteins occurs through CIV. The HIGD1 proteins form dynamic associations with CIV (1Strogolova V. Furness A.

In mitochondria lacking the HIGD1 proteins, CIV generates a lower-than-normal ΔΨ (8Strogolova V. Hoang N.H. Hosler J. Stuart R.A.

Despite these links to CIV, Rcf1 at least associates with other components in the IMM, particularly the ATP/ADP exchanger proteins (1Strogolova V. Furness A. Robb-McGrath M. Garlich J. Stuart R.A. Rcf1 and Rcf2, members of the hypoxia-induced gene 1 protein family, are critical components of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1-cytochrome c oxidase supercomplex.Mol. Cell.

Hence, the absence of the HIGD1 proteins could open a proton leak elsewhere in the IMM. We reasoned that if CIV is the source of the proton leak in Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria, then removing CIV from the IMM should remove the leak and restore the ability of CIII to maintain a normal ΔΨ.

The yeast strains Δcox11 and Δrcf1;Δrcf2 were crossed to obtain a triple mutant lacking Cox11 and the two HIGD1 proteins (Δrcf1;Δrcf2;Δcox11). We first examined the content and uncontrolled activity (i.e. in the absence of ΔΨ) of CIII in Δcox11 and Δrcf1;Δrcf2;Δcox11 (Fig. 2, A and B). The content of CIII appears to be lower in the absence of CIV (Fig. 2A). Compared with WT, the uncontrolled activity of CIII (TN) was 14% lower in the absence of CIV, although the data did not reach significance (Δcox11 versus WT, Fig. 2B). The uncontrolled activity of CIII is significantly lower than normal (by 43%) in the absence of both CIV and the HIGD1 proteins (Δrcf1;Δrcf2;Δcox11 versus the WT, Fig. 2B). The reason for these activity declines are not yet clear. Even with the lower inherent activity of the pool of CIII in Δrcf1;Δrcf2;Δcox11 mitochondria, the complex generated significantly greater ΔΨ during controlled ET than CIII in mitochondria that lack the HIGD1 proteins but contain CIV (Δrcf1;Δrcf2, Fig. 3). This result was observed during more rapid NADH-driven ET through CIII and during the slower ethanol-driven ET (Fig. 3). Compared with the WT, the removal of CIV (Δcox11) lowered the percentage of safranin uptake by up to 10%, perhaps consistent with the lower TN for CIII in the absence of CIV (Fig. 2B). However, there was no further significant loss of safranin uptake when the HIGD1 proteins were removed from Δcox11 mitochondria (Δcox11 versus Δrcf1;Δrcf2;Δcox11, Fig. 3). Despite the unexplained changes in CIII activity, the data make clear that removing CIV alleviates proton leak and restores the ability of CIII to maintain ΔΨ. This strongly favors the hypothesis that CIV is the source of increased proton leak in the absence of the HIGD1 proteins. In Δrcf1;Δrcf2 mitochondria, the lower-than-normal level of CIV is associated with a dimer of CIII formin"

We found that the residue that directly precedes the N-terminal carboxylate metal ligand is conserved as a glycine within the R2lox group but not in R2c. Substitution of the glycine with leucine converted the resting-state R2lox cofactor to an R2c-like cofactor, a μ-oxo/μ-hydroxo–bridged MnIII/FeIII dimer.

https://openalex.org/W2978280432,"Regime shifts involving critical transitions are a type of rapid ecological change that are difficult to predict, but may be preceded by decreases in resilience. Time series statistics like lag-1 autocorrelation may be useful for anticipating resilience declines; however, more study is needed to determine whether the dynamics of autocorrelation depend on the resolution of the time series being analyzed, i.e., whether they are time-scale dependent. Here, we examined timeseries simulated from a lake eutrophication model and gathered from field measurements. The field study involved collecting high frequency chlorophyll fluorescence data from an unmanipulated reference lake and a second lake undergoing experimental fertilization to induce a critical transition in the form of an algal bloom. As part of the experiment, the fertilization was halted in response to detected early warnings of the algal bloom identified by increased autocorrelation. We tested these datasets for time-scale dependence in the dynamics of lag-1 autocorrelation and found that in both the simulation and field experiment, the dynamics of autocorrelation were similar across time scales. In the simulated time series, autocorrelation increased exponentially approaching algal bloom development, and in the field experiment, the difference in autocorrelation between the manipulated and reference lakes increased sharply. These results suggest that, as an early warning indicator, autocorrelation may be robust to the time scale of the analysis. Given that a time scale can be shortened by increasing sampling frequency, or lengthened by aggregating data during analysis, these results have important implications for management as they demonstrate the potential for detecting early warning signals over a wide range of monitoring frequencies and without requiring analysts to make situation-specific decisions regarding aggregation. Such an outcome provides promise that data collection procedures, especially by automated sensors, may be used to monitor and manage ecosystem resilience without the need for strict attention to time scale."

The identification of the specific species involved in clinical cases using conventional diagnostic methods is challenging. Therefore, a recombinant chimeric polypeptide based on the seven known variable lipoproteins (A-G) specific of MHR and a cocktail of surface proteins detergent-extracted from MHS cultures were generated and their suitability as antemortem biomarkers for serodiagnosis of MHR- and MHS-infection were evaluated by ELISA. M. hyorhinis and MHS ELISA performance, evaluated using serum samples collected over a 56-day observation period from pigs inoculated with MHR, MHS, M. hyopneumoniae, M. flocculare, or Friis medium, varied by assay, targeted antibody isotype, and cutoffs. The progressions of MHR and MHS clinical diseases were evaluated in relation to the kinetics of the isotype-specific antibody response in serum and bacterial shedding in oral fluids during the observation period. In pigs inoculated with MHR, bacterial DNA was detected in one or more of the 5 pens at all sampling points throughout the study, IgA was first detected at DPI 7, one week before the first clinical signs, with both IgA and IgG detected in all samples collected after DPI 14. The peak of MHS shedding (DPI 8) coincided with the onset of the clinical signs, with both IgA and IgG detected in all serum samples collected ≥ DPI 14. This study demonstrated, under experimental conditions, that both ELISAs were suitable for early detection of specific antibodies against MHR or MHS. The diagnostic performance of the MHR and MHS ELISAs varied depending on the selected cutoff and the antibody isotype evaluated. The high diagnostic and analytical specificity of the ELISAs was particularly remarkable. This study also provides insights into the infection dynamics of MHR-associated disease and MHS-associated arthritis not previously described."
https://openalex.org/W2979414355,"Phytophthora capsici is a soil borne pathogen, and is among the most destructive pathogens for Capsicum annuum (chile). P. capsici is known to cause diseases on all parts of the chile plants. Therefore, it requires independent resistance genes to control disease symptoms that are induced by each of the P. capsici strains. This requirement of multiple resistance genes to confer resistance to P. capsici, in chile makes breeding for resistance a daunting pursuit. Against this backdrop, a genetic engineering approach would be to introduce a broad host resistance gene into chile in order to protect it from different races of P. capsici. Notably, a broad host resistance gene RB from Solanum bulbocastanum has been shown to confer resistance to P. infestans in both S. tuberosum and S. lycopersicum. We agroinfiltrated the RB gene into the leaves of susceptible chile plants, demonstrating that the gene is also capable of lending resistance to P. capsici in chile. We introduced the RB gene into chile by developing an Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation system. The integration of the RB gene into the genome of the primary transformants and its subsequent transfer to the F1 generation was confirmed by genomic PCR using primers specific for the RB gene. A 3:1 ratio for the presence and absence of the RB gene was observed in the F1 progeny. In addition to showing resistance to P. capsici in a leaf inoculation experiment, about 30% of the F1 progeny also exhibited resistance to root inoculation. Our data, when taken together, suggests that the RB gene from S. bulbocastanum confers resistance against P. capsici in C. annuum, thereby demonstrating that the RB gene has an even broader host range than reported in the literature-both in terms of the host and the pathogen."

This network shows transitive dynamics among quasi-attractors as its typical dynamics. When the release of acetylcholine onto the network is simulated by attention, the transitive dynamics change into stable dynamics in which the system converges to an attractor. We found that this network can reproduce three experimentally observed properties of attention-dependent response modulation, namely an increase in the firing rate, a decrease in the Fano factor of the firing rate, and a decrease in the correlation coefficients between the firing rates of pairs of neurons. Moreover, we also showed theoretically that the release of acetylcholine increases the sensitivity to bottom-up inputs by changing the response function."

Close-contact relationships at a landscape level can have broad implications for disease epidemiology. From 1995-1999, we captured and radio-collared 41 deer in two suburban forest preserves in Chicago, Illinois. We collected blood to determine if animals were seronegative or seropositive for Jamestown Canyon virus and tracked deer movements within suburban habitats. We developed utilization distributions at the population-level and evaluated resource selection for seronegative and seropositive deer. We used maximum likelihood estimation for model selection via Akaike information criterion and then restricted maximum likelihood estimation to attain unbiased estimates of the parameters in the top-ranking models. The top-ranking model describing the resource selection of seronegative deer received almost the full weight of evidence (Akaike information criterion ωi = 0.93), and included the proportion of wetlands, precipitation in year t, and an interaction of the proportion of wetlands and precipitation in year t. The top-ranking model describing resource selection of seropositive deer received the full weight of evidence (Akaike information criterion ωi = 1.00). The model included distance to nearest populated place, distance to nearest river, length of road in each grid cell, precipitation in year t, and an interaction of the length of road in each grid cell and precipitation in year t. These results are valuable for mapping the spatial configuration of hotspots for Jamestown Canyon virus and could be used to educate local residents and recreationalists to reduce human exposure."

To date, the most common prediction strategies are based upon machine learning or other quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) based approaches. In the present research, we propose and discuss a straightforward strategy not based on any learning modelling but exclusively relying upon the chemical similarity of a query compound to reference compounds with annotated activity against cell lines. We also compare the performance of the proposed method to machine learning predictions on the same problem. A curated database of compounds-cell lines associations derived from ChemBL version 22 was created for algorithm construction and cross-validation. Validation was done using 10-fold cross-validation and testing the models on new data obtained from ChemBL version 25. In terms of accuracy, both methods perform similarly with values around 0.65 across 750 cell lines in 10-fold cross-validation experiments. By combining both methods it is possible to achieve 66% of correct classification rate in more than 26000 newly reported interactions comprising 11000 new compounds.

An RFO utilization locus has been identified in the pneumococcal genome; however, none of the proteins encoded by this locus have been biochemically characterized.

We also demonstrate that the initiating enzyme in this pathway, the α-galactosidase Aga (a family 36 glycoside hydrolase), can cleave α-(1→3)-linked galactose units from a linear blood group antigen.

In terms of virulence, both Aga and RafF have been identified as putative virulence factors in a signature-tagged mutagenesis screen (9Hava D.L. Camilli A.

Deletion mutants of rafK have also been shown to be outcompeted by WT in mouse models of pneumococcal colonization and infection (15Marion C. Aten A.E. Woodiga S.A. King S.J.

The most compelling evidence for the role of the RFO utilization locus in virulence comes from a recent study in which the ability of clinical pneumococcal isolates to utilize raffinose was correlated with their tissue tropism (28Minhas V. Harvey R.M. McAllister L.J. Seemann T. Syme A.E. Baines S.L. Paton J.C. Trappetti C. Capacity to utilize raffinose dictates pneumococcal disease phenotype.MBio. 2019; 10 (30647157): e02518-e02596Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Minhas et al. (28Minhas V. Harvey R.M. McAllister L.J. Seemann T. Syme A.E. Baines S.L. Paton J.C. Trappetti C. Capacity to utilize raffinose dictates pneumococcal disease phenotype.MBio. 2019; 10 (30647157): e02518-e02596Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) compared the genomes of serotype- and sequence type–matched isolates from blood and ear infections and identified SNPs in rafK or rafR among the ear isolates. The ability of these isolates to grow on raffinose was significantly reduced compared with their paired blood isolates, and reversal of the rafR mutation restored full raffinose utilization competency. Expression of genes from each of the transcriptional units within the RFO locus (aga, rafG, and rafK) was also significantly lower in the ear isolates compared with the blood isolates. Finally, in a mouse model of infection, isolates bearing the rafR mutation were less able to persist in the lungs than rafR WT strains; however, the mutant strains exhibited significantly higher bacterial loads in the ear and, to a lesser extent, the brain. Therefore, the authors concluded that the capacity to utilize raffinose determines the ultimate site of infection following nasal challenge (28Minhas V. Harvey R.M. McAllister L.J. Seemann T. Syme A.E. Baines S.L. Paton J.C. Trappetti C. Capacity to utilize raffinose dictates pneumococcal disease phenotype.MBio. 2019; 10 (30647157): e02518-e02596Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Exactly how expression of the RFO utilization locus affects the ability of S. pneumoniae to cause pneumonia or otitis media is not known. Evidence to indicate that the proteins encoded by this locus are involved in RFO processing is 3-fold. First, expression of aga is strongly induced by raffinose (25Rosenow C. Maniar M. Trias J. Regulation of the alpha-galactosidase activity in Streptococcus pneumoniae: characterization of the raffinose utilization system.Genome Res. 1999; 9 (10613841): 1189-119710.1101/gr.9.12.1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Second, the SBP RafE has been crystallized in complex with raffinose (PDB code 2I58), 4N. G. Paterson et al., unpublished data. and insertional inactivation of rafE abolishes raffinose uptake (19Tyx R.E. Roche-Hakansson H. Hakansson A.P. Role of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase in regulation of raffinose transport in Streptococcus pneumoniae.J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193 (21602335): 3512-352410.1128/JB.01410-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Third, deletion of rafG abolishes growth of S. pneumoniae on raffinose and stachyose (14Bidossi A. Mulas L. Decorosi F. Colomba L. Ricci S. Pozzi G. Deutscher J. Viti C. Oggioni M.R. A functional genomics approach to establish the complement of carbohydrate transporters in Streptococcus pneumoniae.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (22428019): e3332010.1371/journal.pone.0033320Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, none of the proteins encoded by the RFO utilization locus have been biochemically characterized to provide direct evidence of activity on RFOs. The relationship between this locus, the processing of RFOs, and pneumococcal virulence is thus enigmatic. We therefore set out to biochemically and structurally characterize the key specificity determinants of the RFO utilization locus. Here we show that RafE binds RFOs, while Aga and GtfA sequentially degrade RFOs into free galactose, fructose, and glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). Overall, however, Aga has relatively poor activity on RFOs, and RafE demonstrates remarkably low affinities for these ligands, suggesting that this locus is not optimized for efficient RFO uptake and degradation. Given the apparent biochemical inefficiency of these proteins and the natural lifestyle of S. pneumoniae, we propose that this locus is a relic of streptococcal evolution that is not utilized by the pneumococcus in vivo. We also speculate that the reported link between the RFO locus and virulence may, in fact, be due to the promiscuous role RafK plays in the import of several human-derived carbohydrates. SBPs are the specificity determinants of ABC transporters and, in turn, they dictate the array of glycans that are made available to downstream processing enzymes. To examine the ligand-binding properties of RafE, the protein lacking the native N-terminal secretion signal sequence and lipid-anchoring motif was produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli, and the binding properties of the purified protein were studied using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC; Table 1). The ligands evaluated included RFOs (raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose), fragments of these glycans (i.e. galactose, melibiose, and sucrose), α-(1→3)-galactobiose, and the glucose trisaccharides isomaltotriose and panose (see Table 1 for chemical descriptions of each). The affinity of RafE for the tested mono- and disaccharides was too low to be detected, and the dissociation constants (Kd) for the trisaccharides and larger RFOs varied from ∼80 μm to ∼500 μm (Table 1). Notably, the measured affinities of RafE are significantly lower than those typically reported for SBPs, which are typically in the Kd range of ∼1 μm (4Robb M. Hobbs J.K. Woodiga S.A. Shapiro-Ward S.

Crystals that provided a diffraction data set to 2.35 Å resolution were initially obtained in the presence of stachyose in the space group P212121. This structure was solved by molecular replacement using the deposited coordinates of RafE in complex with raffinose (PDB code 2I58) as a search model; the final refined model comprised two molecules in the asymmetric unit. One of these monomers was used as a search model to solve the structures of RafE in complex with raffinose (to 2.65 Å resolution) and verbascose (to 2.45 Å resolution). In all three cases the electron density for the carbohydrates was clear, allowing unambiguous modeling of the ligand (Fig. S1). RafE adopts a fold characteristic of the Cluster D-I (oligosaccharide-specific) SBPs (33Berntsson R.P. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Slotboom D.-J Poolman B. A structural classification of substrate-binding proteins.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584 (20412802): 2606-261710.1016/j.febslet.2010.04.043Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), which are composed of two α/β domains joined together by a hinge region (Fig. 2A). Within the two α/β domains is a β-sheet core comprised of four and five β-strands (N and C terminus, respectively) surrounded by α-helices. Like other SBPs, the binding pocket is a deep cavity located in between the two α/β domains (Fig. 2B). The binding pocket is open to solvent, completely exposing the reducing end residue of bound glycans and therefore is consistent with the capacity to bind ligands of various lengths. An overlay of the three RafE complexes reveals a mode of binding whereby the nonreducing end galactose residues of the ligands are oriented toward the base of the binding pocket. In all three cases, the same set of interactions is made between this subsite, which we refer to as subsite 1, and the nonreducing end galactose (Fig. 2C). These comprise seven direct hydrogen bonds involving O2, O3, and O4 of the galactose residue. Trp376 provides a platform that interacts with the plane formed by O5-C1-C2. Although the axial O4 particular to galactose makes several hydrogen bonds with subsite 1, there appears to be nothing legislating against the presence of an equatorial O4, as in glucose, likely explaining the ability of this protein to also accommodate α-glucooligosaccharides as ligands. Similar binding interactions are observed at subsite 2 with a mix of hydrophobic and polar interactions. When"
https://openalex.org/W2979508508,"A common reaction experienced by family members of patients with psychosis is grief for the loss of their healthy relative. Importantly, high levels of perceived loss have been related to the manifestation of high expressed emotion (EE), which includes the negative attitudes expressed by relatives toward an ill family member. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between relatives’ perceived loss and EE attitudes in the early stages of psychosis are still not fully understood. In this regard, attachment theory has been suggested as a useful framework for understanding this link. The current study aimed to examine: (1) whether relatives’ perceived loss was associated with relatives’ EE dimensions (i.e., criticism and emotional over-involvement (EOI)), and (2) whether such associations were mediated by relatives’ attachment dimensions (i.e., anxiety and avoidance). Seventy-eight relatives of patients with early psychosis completed the Mental Illness Version of the Texas Inventory of Grief for the assessment of loss reactions. Attachment dimensions and EE attitudes were assessed by the Psychosis Attachment Measure and the Family Questionnaire, respectively. Findings indicated that relatives’ perceived loss was associated with EE dimensions. Relatives’ attachment anxiety, but not avoidance, mediated the relationship of perceived loss with both criticism and EOI. Findings highlight the importance of examining the role of relatives’ attachment characteristics for understanding how perceptions of loss might impact the manifestation of EE attitudes in the early stages of psychosis. Family interventions aimed at assisting relatives to improve their management of negative emotional reactions to loss are fundamental to prevent impairing loss reactions and the entrenchment of high-EE attitudes."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and referral practices for PrEP among non-prescribing providers, who may play key role. Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey on PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and referral practices among 66 non-prescribing HIV prevention providers (1st August to 31st December, 2016), in Philadelphia, followed by qualitative interviews with 12 of them (5th April to 10th May, 2017). Results Participants had a mean age of 36 years, with 62% females. Majority were HIV case managers and rapid testers. For half of the respondents, PrEP eligibility screening was part of rapid HIV testing at their organization, 40% never had PrEP training and only 27% indicated personally screening clients for eligibility. Qualitative data revealed that participants held positive attitudes about PrEP and perceived organizational support, but had concerns about potential negative impacts and barriers to routine HIV screening. Conclusion Results highlight the importance of training non-prescribing HIV prevention providers about PrEP, addressing their concerns, and incorporating PrEP screening and referral into routine HIV testing."

Geographical factors, in particular location close to borders with mobile populations and migrants, and large populations with sparsely distributed health infrastructure, exacerbated by hilly topography and muddy roads were identified as barriers. Shortages of skilled health providers at the level of district hospitals were cited as contributing to poor maternal health outcomes.There is a need to take into account disparities between districts when allocating staff and financial resources in order to achieve universal coverage for high-quality maternal health services and better outcomes. Local innovations such as the use of SMS and WhatsApp text messages by health workers and financial protection schemes for poor patients improve solidarity and are worth to be scaled up."
https://openalex.org/W2979979113,"We aim to determine whether a game-theoretic model between an insurer and a healthcare practice yields a predictive equilibrium that incentivizes either player to deviate from a fee-for-service to capitation payment system. Using United States data from various primary care surveys, we find that non-extreme equilibria (i.e., shares of patients, or shares of patient visits, seen under a fee-for-service payment system) can be derived from a Stackelberg game if insurers award a non-linear bonus to practices based on performance. Overall, both insurers and practices can be incentivized to embrace capitation payments somewhat, but potentially at the expense of practice performance."
https://openalex.org/W2977973234,"Vehicles can be classified by configuration as either bonnet-type or cab-over type according to engine location. Compared to bonnet-type, the front compartment of cab-over type vehicles is considerably shorter; thus, it may be less likely to absorb the energy generated in a collision, and in turn be unable to prevent deformation of the occupant space and protect occupants from injury. This study was a cohort study involving 943 occupants of mini-vehicles who were injured in frontal collision accidents between 2001 and 2015 and transferred to Ohta Nishinouchi Hospital. The vehicle configuration was divided into bonnet-type and cab-over type (i.e., truck-type and wagon-type). The tested outcomes were anatomical-specific severe injury of the pelvis and extremities, the head and neck, the abdomen, and the chest. To estimate adjusted odds ratios (AOR) for associations between vehicle configuration and anatomical-specific severe injury, we fitted generalized estimating equations for each outcome. Compared with bonnet-type vehicles, a greater risk of serious pelvis and extremities injury was found for both truck (AOR: 2.21; 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI]: 1.22–4.00) and wagon-type vehicles (AOR: 3.43; 95%CI 1.60–7.39). For serious head and neck injury, truck-type vehicles were associated with greater risk (AOR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.10–3.79) than bonnet-type vehicles, whereas wagon-type vehicles were not. Compared with the occupants of bonnet-type vehicles, cab-over type vehicle occupants were more likely to have serious pelvis and extremities injury during frontal collisions. Additionally, truck-type vehicle occupants were more likely to have serious head and neck injury than bonnet-type vehicle occupants. These findings are expected to promote safer behaviors for vehicle occupants and the automobile industry."
https://openalex.org/W2979590072,"Asparagus stem wilt, is a significant and devastating disease, typically leading to extensive economic losses in the asparagus industry. To obtain transgenic plants resistant to stem wilt, the hevein-like gene, providing broad spectrum bacterial resistance was inserted into the asparagus genome through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The optimal genetic transformation system for asparagus was as follows: pre-culture of embryos for 2 days, inoculation using a bacterial titre of OD600 = 0.6, infection time 10 min and co-culturing for 4 days using an Acetosyringone concentration of 200 μmol/L. Highest transformation frequencies reached 21% and ten transgenic asparagus seedlings carrying the hevein-like gene were identified by polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, integration of the hevein-like gene in the T1 generation of transgenic plants was confirmed by southern blot hybridization. Analysis showed that resistance to stem wilt was enhanced significantly in the transgenic plants, in comparison to non- transgenic plants. The results provide additional data for genetic improvement and are of importance for the development of new disease-resistant asparagus varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2979935239,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Genotyping of HCV is crucial for successful therapy. To determine the HCV subgenotypes circulating in Palestine and to study the genetic variability of their core, we collected 84 serum samples which had tested positive for anti-HCV antibodies. Thirty-seven of these samples came from hemodialysis patients. Serum samples were subjected to viral RNA isolation and amplification of the HCV core gene. Thirty-three of the samples (39%) tested positive for HCV RNA. The HCV subgenotypes circulating in Palestine included 1a, 3a, and 4a, detected in 38%, 25%, and 22% of the samples, respectively. Furthermore, subgenotype 1b was present in three samples (9%), while the rare subgenotype 4v was present in two samples (6%). We identified a number of substitutions in the retrieved HCV core sequences, such as HCV 1b substitutions R70Q and M91L, which some studies have associated with hepatocellular carcinoma risk and poor virological response. In contrast to two previous studies reporting that HCV genotype 4 was predominant in the Gaza strip (present in just over 70% of samples), genotype 4 was detected in only 31% of the samples in our current study, whereas genotype 1 and 3 were present in 69% of samples. These differences may relate to the fact that many of our samples came from the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The co-circulation of different HCV genotypes and subgenotypes in Palestine suggests that subgenotyping prior to treatment is crucial in Palestinian patients."
