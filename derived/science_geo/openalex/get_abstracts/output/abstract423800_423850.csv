Timed restricted feeding (RF) provides a time cue and resets the circadian clock, leading to better health. In contrast, a high-fat (HF) diet leads to disrupted circadian expression of metabolic factors and obesity. We tested whether long-term (18 wk) clock resetting by RF can attenuate the disruptive effects of diet-induced obesity. Analyses included liver clock gene expression, locomotor activity, blood glucose, metabolic markers, lipids, and hormones around the circadian cycle for a more accurate assessment. Compared with mice fed the HF diet ad libitum, the timed HF diet restored the expression phase of the clock genes Clock and Cry1 and phase-advanced Per1, Per2, Cry2, Bmal1, Rorα, and Rev-erbα. Although timed HF-diet-fed mice consumed the same amount of calories as ad libitum low-fat diet-fed mice, they showed 12% reduced body weight, 21% reduced cholesterol levels, and 1.4-fold increased insulin sensitivity. Compared with the HF diet ad libitum, the timed HF diet led to 18% lower body weight, 30% decreased cholesterol levels, 10% reduced TNF-α levels, and 3.7-fold improved insulin sensitivity. Timed HF-diet-fed mice exhibited a better satiated and less stressed phenotype of 25% lower ghrelin and 53% lower corticosterone levels compared with mice fed the timed low-fat diet. Taken together, our findings suggest that timing can prevent obesity and rectify the harmful effects of a HF diet.—Sherman, H., Genzer, Y., Cohen, R., Chapnik, N., Madar, Z., Froy, O.

https://openalex.org/W2035310028,"High glycolysis, well known as ""Warburg effect,"" is frequently observed in a variety of cancers. Whether the deregulation of miRNAs contributes to the Warburg effect remains largely unknown. Because miRNA regulates gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels, we constructed a gene functional association network, which allows us to detect the gene activity instead of gene expression, to integratively analyze the microarray data for gene expression and miRNA expression profiling and identify glycolysis-related gene-miRNA pairs deregulated in cancer. Hexokinase 2 (HK2), coding for the first rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, is among the top list of genes predicted and potentially regulated by multiple miRNAs including miR-143. Interestingly, miR-143 expression was inversely associated with HK2 protein level but not mRNA level in human lung cancer samples. miR-143, down-regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin activation, reduces glucose metabolism and inhibits cancer cell proliferation and tumor formation through targeting HK2. Collectively, we have not only established a novel methodology for gene-miRNA pair prediction but also identified miR-143 as an essential regulator of cancer glycolysis via targeting HK2."
https://openalex.org/W2028911325,"Protein substrates of a novel secretion system of Porphyromonas gingivalis contain a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) of ∼70-80 amino acid residues that is essential for their secretion and attachment to the cell surface. The CTD itself has not been detected in mature substrates, suggesting that it may be removed by a novel signal peptidase. More than 10 proteins have been shown to be essential for the proper functioning of the secretion system, and one of these, PG0026, is a predicted cysteine proteinase that also contains a CTD, suggesting that it may be a secreted component of the secretion system and a candidate for being the CTD signal peptidase. A PG0026 deletion mutant was constructed along with a PG0026C690A targeted mutant encoding an altered catalytic Cys residue. Analysis of clarified culture fluid fractions by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry revealed that the CTD was released intact into the surrounding medium in the wild type strain, but not in the PG0026 mutant strains. Western blot experiments revealed that the maturation of a model substrate was stalled at the CTD-removal step specifically in the PG0026 mutants, and whole cell ELISA experiments demonstrated partial secretion of substrates to the cell surface. The CTD was also shown to be accessible at the cell surface in the PG0026 mutants, suggesting that the CTD was secreted but could not be cleaved. The data indicate that PG0026 is responsible for the cleavage of the CTD signal after substrates are secreted across the OM."

Lack of only one Coq polypeptide, as in Δcoq strains, results in the degradation of several Coq proteins.

Q is also important in the mitochondrial inner membrane because it serves as an antioxidant, modulates the function of the mitochondrial membrane transition pore, and is a cofactor of uncoupling proteins (1Bentinger M. Tekle M. Dallner G. Coenzyme Q-biosynthesis and functions.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 396: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Q is composed of a fully substituted benzoquinone ring that is attached to a polyisoprenyl tail of various lengths (6 isoprenyl units in Saccharomyces cerevisiae hence Q6 and 10 units in humans, hence Q10). The eukaryotic Q biosynthetic pathway has been studied most thoroughly in S. cerevisiae where it implicates at least 11 proteins, Coq1–Coq9, Arh1, and Yah1 (2Tran U.C. Clarke C.F.

The yeast Coq4 polypeptide organizes a mitochondrial protein complex essential for coenzyme Q biosynthesis.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The absence of a single Coq polypeptide from the complex causes a drastic diminution of the steady state levels of some Coq proteins. For example, the steady state levels of Coq4, Coq6, Coq7, and Coq9 are decreased in each of the Δcoq1–Δcoq9 null strains (6Hsieh E.J. Gin P. Gulmezian M. Tran U.C. Saiki R. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Coq9 polypeptide is a subunit of the mitochondrial coenzyme Q biosynthetic complex.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 463: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As a result, the same early intermediate 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HHB; Fig. 1, path 1) accumulates in each of the Δcoq3–Δcoq9 strains. Certain point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions seem to have less impact on the integrity of the Q biosynthetic complex than a null mutation; expression of the inactive Coq7-E194K polypeptide in a Δcoq7 strain caused accumulation of the expected intermediate demethoxy-Q6 (DMQ6, Fig. 1) (7Padilla S.

Apart from this example, the absence of accumulation of biosynthetic intermediates downstream of HHB in Δcoq strains has hindered our understanding of the Q biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, the precise order of certain biosynthetic steps is still elusive, and the function of Coq4 and Coq9 is not defined. The yeast COQ8 gene was formerly called ABC1 and was thought to be essential for complex III function (9Bousquet I. Dujardin G. Slonimski P.P. ABC1, a novel yeast nuclear gene has a dual function in mitochondria.

However, it was later shown that COQ8 was required for Q6 biosynthesis, and as such, its deletion only affected complex III activity indirectly (11Do T.Q. Hsu A.Y. Jonassen T. Lee P.T. Clarke C.F.

In addition, several phosphorylated forms of Coq5 and Coq7 disappear in a yeast strain expressing the G130D mutant form of Coq8 (12Xie L.X. Hsieh E.J. Watanabe S. Allan C.M. Chen J.Y. Tran U.C.

Therefore, Coq8 appears to be a kinase essential for the phosphorylation of several conserved Coq polypeptides and some of these phosphorylated forms likely play a role in the assembly or maintenance of the Q6 biosynthetic complex. Recent studies indicate that overexpression of COQ8 can have profound effects on Q6 biosynthesis. Indeed, the overexpression of Coq8 (from now on referred to as Coq8 OE) in a Δcoq7 strain promoted the accumulation of DMQ6 (16Padilla S. Tran U.C. Jiménez-Hidalgo M. López-Martín J.M. Martín-Montalvo A. Clarke C.F. Navas P. Santos-Ocaña C. Hydroxylation of demethoxy-Q6 constitutes a control point in yeast coenzyme Q6 biosynthesis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), implying that all Coq proteins acting upstream of Coq7 in the biosynthetic pathway were stable and active. The effect of Coq8 OE is likely post-transcriptional because COQ4 mRNA levels in the Δcoq7 strain were not dependent on the level of Coq8 OE (16Padilla S. Tran U.C. Jiménez-Hidalgo M. López-Martín J.M. Martín-Montalvo A. Clarke C.F. Navas P. Santos-Ocaña C. Hydroxylation of demethoxy-Q6 constitutes a control point in yeast coenzyme Q6 biosynthesis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, the low steady state level of Coq4 encountered in Δcoq2, Δcoq3, Δcoq5, and Δcoq7 strains was shown to be restored to wild-type levels by Coq8 OE (17Zampol M.A. Busso C. Gomes F. Ferreira-Junior J.R. Tzagoloff A. Barros M.H. Overexpression of COQ10 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibits mitochondrial respiration.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 402: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the case of a Δcoq6 strain, Coq8 OE allowed the specific accumulation of 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxyphenol (4-HP) (Fig. 1), which led us to identify Coq6 as the monooxygenase responsible for the C5-hydroxylation step (18Ozeir M. Mühlenhoff U. Webert H. Lill R. Fontecave M. Pierrel F. Coenzyme Q biosynthesis. Coq6 is required for the C5-hydroxylation reaction and substrate analogues rescue Coq6 deficiency.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This example demonstrates that the accumulation of Q6 biosynthetic intermediates in Δcoq strains and the identification of their chemical structure are important for understanding the function of Coq proteins. In addition to the classic Q biosynthetic pathway emanating from 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HB), S. cerevisiae also makes use of para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) as a ring precursor for Q6 biosynthesis (Fig. 1, path 2) (3Pierrel F. Hamelin O. Douki T. Kieffer-Jaquinod S. Mühlenhoff U. Ozeir M. Lill R. Fontecave M. Involvement of mitochondrial ferredoxin and para-aminobenzoic acid in yeast coenzyme Q biosynthesis.Chem.

Coq2 is able to catalyze the prenylation of 4-HB to yield HHB, as well as the prenylation of pABA to yield 3-hexaprenyl-4-aminobenzoic acid (HAB). We have hypothesized that Coq3–Coq9 enzymes modify both HAB and HHB and that the C4-amino group must be removed from the HAB-derived intermediates to produce Q6 (3Pierrel F. Hamelin O. Douki T.

The deamination reaction likely occurs before the C6-hydroxylation step catalyzed by Coq7 because 4-imino-DMQ6 (IDMQ6) was proposed to be a precursor of DMQ6 (19Marbois B. Xie L.X. Choi S. Hirano K.

Chem. 2010; 285: 27827-27838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ring precursors other than 4-HB and pABA can also be used in vivo by S. cerevisiae to synthesize Q6. Indeed, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and vanillic acid bypass a deficiency in the Coq6-mediated C5-hydroxylation reaction and restore Q6 biosynthesis in coq6 or yah1 mutant strains (18Ozeir M. Mühlenhoff U. Webert H. Lill R. Fontecave M. Pierrel F. Coenzyme Q biosynthesis. Coq6 is required for the C5-hydroxylation reaction and substrate analogues rescue Coq6 deficiency.Chem. Biol. 2011; 18: 1134-1142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that Coq8 OE restores the steady state levels of the Coq proteins in most Δcoq strains. The stabilization of the Coq polypeptides leads to the accumulation of Q6 biosynthetic intermediates that allow the diagnosis of the impaired step. We have used this property to demonstrate that several biosynthetic steps are impaired in the Δcoq4 and Δcoq9 strains and to gain insights into the deamination reaction. Finally, the use of alternate ring precursors promoted the restoration of Q6 biosynthesis and respiratory growth for a Δcoq7 strain. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. S. cerevisiae strains were transformed with lithium acetate as described (20Elble R.

https://openalex.org/W1974954192,"Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) represent an interesting treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, adverse effects such as heart problems and bone fractures have already been reported. Previously, we reported that pioglitazone and rosiglitazone induce osteocyte apoptosis and sclerostin up-regulation; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to such effects are unknown. In this study, we found that TZDs rapidly activated Erk1/2 and p38. These activations were mediated through Ras proteins and GPR40, a receptor expressed on the surface of osteocytes. Activation of this pathway led only to osteocyte apoptosis but not sclerostin up-regulation. On the other hand, TZDs were capable of activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and activation of this signaling pathway led to sclerostin up-regulation but not osteocyte apoptosis. This study demonstrates two distinct signaling pathways activated in osteocytes in response to TZDs that could participate in the observed increase in fractures in TZD-treated patients."
https://openalex.org/W1988233041,"Whether certain Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) strains are associated with pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is still an unresolved question. In the present study, EBV genome contained in a primary NPC tumor biopsy was amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and sequenced using next-generation (Illumina) and conventional dideoxy-DNA sequencing. The EBV genome, designated HKNPC1 (Genbank accession number JQ009376) is a type 1 EBV of approximately 171.5 kb. The virus appears to be a uniform strain in line with accepted monoclonal nature of EBV in NPC but is heterogeneous at 172 nucleotide positions. Phylogenetic analysis with the four published EBV strains, B95-8, AG876, GD1, and GD2, indicated HKNPC1 was more closely related to the Chinese NPC patient-derived strains, GD1 and GD2. HKNPC1 contains 1,589 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 132 insertions or deletions (indels) in comparison to the reference EBV sequence (accession number NC007605). When compared to AG876, a strain derived from Ghanaian Burkitt's lymphoma, we found 322 SNVs, of which 76 were non-synonymous SNVs and were shared amongst the Chinese GD1, GD2 and HKNPC1 isolates. We observed 88 non-synonymous SNVs shared only by HKNPC1 and GD2, the only other NPC tumor-derived strain reported thus far. Non-synonymous SNVs were mainly found in the latent, tegument and glycoprotein genes. The same point mutations were found in glycoprotein (BLLF1 and BALF4) genes of GD1, GD2 and HKNPC1 strains and might affect cell type specific binding. Variations in LMP1 and EBNA3B epitopes and mutations in Cp (11404 C>T) and Qp (50134 G>C) found in GD1, GD2 and HKNPC1 could potentially affect CD8+ T cell recognition and latent gene expression pattern in NPC, respectively. In conclusion, we showed that whole genome sequencing of EBV in NPC may facilitate discovery of previously unknown variations of pathogenic significance."
https://openalex.org/W1998677639,"Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and photon counting histogram (PCH) are techniques with single molecule sensitivity that are well suited for examining the biophysical properties of protein complexes in living cells. In the present study, FCS and PCH were applied to determine the diffusion coefficient and oligomeric size of G-protein-coupled receptors. FCS was used to record fluctuations in fluorescence intensity arising from fluorescence-tagged 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (5-HT(2C)) receptors diffusing within the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells and rat hippocampal neurons. Autocorrelation analysis yielded diffusion coefficients ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 μm(2)/s for fluorescence-tagged receptors. Because the molecular brightness of a fluorescent protein is directly proportional to the number of fluorescent proteins traveling together within a protein complex, it can be used to determine the oligomeric size of the protein complex. FCS and PCH analysis of fluorescence-tagged 5-HT(2C) receptors provided molecular brightness values that were twice that of GFP and YFP monomeric controls, similar to a dimeric GFP control, and unaltered by 5-HT. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation of the N- and C-terminal halves of YFP attached to 5-HT(2C) receptors was observed in endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi and plasma membranes with a brightness equal to monomeric YFP. When GFP-tagged 5-HT(2C) receptors were co-expressed with a large excess of untagged, non-fluorescent 5-HT(2C) receptors, the molecular brightness was reduced by half. PCH analysis of the FCS data were best described by a one-component dimer model without monomers or tetramers. Therefore, it is concluded that 5-HT(2C) receptors freely diffusing within the plasma membrane are dimeric."
https://openalex.org/W2064365183,"The complex tectonic events and climatic oscillations in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), the largest and highest plateau in the world, are thought to have had great effects on the evolutionary history of the native plants. Of great interest is to investigate plant population genetic divergence in the QTP and its correlation with the geologic and climatic changes. We conducted a range-wide phylogeographical analysis of M. integrifolia based on the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) trnL-trnF and trnfM-trnS regions, and defined 26 haplotypes that were phylogenetically divided into six clades dated to the late Tertiary. The six clades correspond, respectively, to highly differentiated population groups that do not overlap in geographic distribution, implying that the mountain ranges acting as corridors or barriers greatly affected the evolutionary history of the QTP plants. The older clade of M. integrifolia only occurs in the southwest of the species' range, whereas the distributions of younger clades extend northeastward in the eastern QTP, suggesting that climatic divergence resulting from the uplift of the QTP triggered the initial divergence of M. integrifolia native to the plateau. Also, the nrDNA ITS region was used to clarify the unexpected phylogenetic relationships of cpDNA haplotypes between M. integrifolia and M. betonicifolia. The topological incongruence between the two phylogenies suggests an ancestral hybridization between the two species. Our study indicates that geographic isolation and hybridization are two important mechanisms responsible for the population differentiation and speciation of Meconopsis, a species-rich genus with complex polyploids."
https://openalex.org/W2096470807,"Secreted Wnt proteins constitute one of the largest families of intercellular signaling molecules in vertebrates with essential roles in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. The functional redundancy of Wnt genes and the many forms of cellular responses they elicit, including some utilizing the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin, has limited the ability of classical genetic strategies to uncover their roles in vivo. We had previously identified a chemical compound class termed Inhibitor of Wnt Production (or IWP) that targets Porcupine (Porcn), an acyltransferase catalyzing the addition of fatty acid adducts onto Wnt proteins. Here we demonstrate that diverse chemical structures are able to inhibit Porcn by targeting its putative active site. When deployed in concert with small molecules that modulate the activity of Tankyrase enzymes and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), additional transducers of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, the IWP compounds reveal an essential role for Wnt protein fatty acylation in eliciting β-catenin-dependent and -independent forms of Wnt signaling during zebrafish development. This collection of small molecules facilitates rapid dissection of Wnt gene function in vivo by limiting the influence of redundant Wnt gene functions on phenotypic outcomes and enables temporal manipulation of Wnt-mediated signaling in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1967420353,"High serum phosphorus levels have been associated with mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease and in the general population. In addition, high phosphorus levels have been shown to induce vascular calcification and endothelial dysfunction in vitro. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation of phosphorus and coronary calcification and atherosclerosis in the setting of normal renal function. This was a cross-sectional study involving 290 patients with suspected coronary artery disease and undergoing elective coronary angiography, with a creatinine clearance >60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Coronary artery obstruction was assessed by the Friesinger score and coronary artery calcification by multislice computed tomography. Serum phosphorus was higher in patients with an Agatston score >10 than in those with an Agatston score ≤10 (3.63±0.55 versus 3.49±0.52 mg/dl; p = 0.02). In the patients with Friesinger scores >4, serum phosphorus was higher (3.6±0.5 versus 3.5±0.6 mg/dl, p = 0.04) and median intact fibroblast growth factor 23 was lower (40.3 pg/ml versus 45.7 pg/ml, p = 0.01). Each 0.1-mg/dl higher serum phosphate was associated with a 7.4% higher odds of having a Friesinger score >4 (p = 0.03) and a 6.1% greater risk of having an Agatston score >10 (p = 0.01). Fibroblast growth factor 23 was a negative predictor of Friesinger score (p = 0.002). In conclusion, phosphorus is positively associated with coronary artery calcification and obstruction in patients with suspected coronary artery disease and preserved renal function."
https://openalex.org/W1989601885,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis by enhancing the degradation of LDL receptor (LDLR) protein. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) has been shown to be atheroprotective. PPARγ can be activated by ligands and/or dephosphorylation with ERK1/2 inhibitors. The effect of PPARγ on PCSK9 and LDLR expression remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of PPARγ on PCSK9 and LDLR expression. At the cellular levels, PPARγ ligands induced PCSK9 mRNA and protein expression in HepG2 cells. PCSK9 expression was induced by inhibition of ERK1/2 activity but inhibited by ERK1/2 activation. The mutagenic study and promoter activity assay suggested that the induction of PCSK9 expression by ERK1/2 inhibitors was tightly linked to PPARγ dephosphorylation. However, PPARγ activation by ligands or ERK1/2 inhibitors induced hepatic LDLR expression. The promoter assay indicated that the induction of LDLR expression by PPARγ was sterol regulatory element-dependent because PPARγ enhanced sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) processing. In vivo, administration of pioglitazone or U0126 alone increased PCSK9 expression in mouse liver but had little effect on PCSK9 secretion. However, the co-treatment of pioglitazone and U0126 enhanced both PCSK9 expression and secretion. Similar to in vitro, the increased PCSK9 expression by pioglitazone and/or U0126 did not result in decreased LDLR expression and function. In contrast, pioglitazone and/or U0126 increased LDLR protein expression and membrane translocation, SREBP2 processing, and CYP7A1 expression in the liver, which led to decreased total and LDL cholesterol levels in serum. Our results indicate that although PPARγ activation increased PCSK9 expression, PPARγ activation induced LDLR and CYP7A1 expression that enhanced LDL cholesterol metabolism.Background: PCSK9 regulates cholesterol homeostasis by enhancing the LDLR protein degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2113214792,"Quality control ubiquitin ligases promote degradation of misfolded proteins by the proteasome. If the capacity of the ubiquitin/proteasome system is exceeded, then misfolded proteins accumulate in aggregates that are cleared by the autophagic system. To identify components of the ubiquitin/proteasome system that protect against aggregation, we analyzed a GFP-tagged protein kinase, Ste11ΔN(K444R)-GFP, in yeast strains deleted for 14 different ubiquitin ligases. We show that deletion of almost all of these ligases affected the proteostatic balance in untreated cells such that Ste11ΔN(K444R)-GFP aggregation was changed significantly compared with the levels found in wild type cells. By contrast, aggregation was increased significantly in only six E3 deletion strains when Ste11ΔN(K444R)-GFP folding was impaired due to inhibition of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 with geldanamycin. The increase in aggregation of Ste11ΔN(K444R)-GFP due to deletion of UBR1 and UFD4 was partially suppressed by deletion of UBR2 due to up-regulation of Rpn4, which controls proteasome activity. Deletion of UBR1 in combination with LTN1, UFD4, or DOA10 led to a marked hypersensitivity to azetidine 2-carboxylic acid, suggesting some redundancy in the networks of quality control ubiquitin ligases. Finally, we show that Ubr1 promotes clearance of protein aggregates when the autophagic system is inactivated. These results provide insight into the mechanics by which ubiquitin ligases cooperate and provide feedback regulation in the clearance of misfolded proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2135508408,"Mechanical ventilation generates biophysical forces, including high transmural pressures, which exacerbate lung inflammation. This study sought to determine whether microRNAs (miRNAs) respond to this mechanical force and play a role in regulating mechanically induced inflammation. Primary human small airway epithelial cells (HSAEpCs) were exposed to 12 h of oscillatory pressure and/or the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. Experiments were also conducted after manipulating miRNA expression and silencing the transcription factor NF-κB or toll-like receptor proteins IRAK1 and TRAF6. NF-κB activation, IL-6/IL-8/IL-1β cytokine secretion, miRNA expression, and IRAK1/TRAF6 protein levels were monitored. A total of 12 h of oscillatory pressure and TNF-α resulted in a 5- to 7-fold increase in IL-6/IL-8 cytokine secretion, and oscillatory pressure also resulted in a time-dependent increase in IL-6/IL-8/IL-1β cytokine secretion. Pressure and TNF-α also resulted in distinct patterns of miRNA expression, with miR-146a being the most deregulated miRNA. Manipulating miR-146a expression altered pressure-induced cytokine secretion. Silencing of IRAK1 or TRAF6, confirmed targets of miR-146a, resulted in a 3-fold decrease in pressure-induced cytokine secretion. Cotransfection experiments demonstrate that miR-146a's regulation of pressure-induced cytokine secretion depends on its targeting of both IRAK1 and TRAF6. MiR-146a is a mechanosensitive miRNA that is rapidly up-regulated by oscillatory pressure and plays an important role in regulating mechanically induced inflammation in lung epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W1996585906,"Tumor cell survival and proliferation is attributable in part to suppression of apoptotic pathways, yet the mechanisms by which cancer cells resist apoptosis are not fully understood. Many cancer cells constitutively express heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which catabolizes heme to generate biliverdin, Fe2+, and carbon monoxide (CO). These breakdown products may play a role in the ability of cancer cells to suppress apoptotic signals. K+ channels also play a crucial role in apoptosis, permitting K+ efflux which is required to initiate caspase activation. Here, we demonstrate that HO-1 is constitutively expressed in human medulloblastoma tissue, and can be induced in the medulloblastoma cell line DAOY either chemically or by hypoxia. Induction of HO-1 markedly increases the resistance of DAOY cells to oxidant-induced apoptosis. This effect was mimicked by exogenous application of the heme degradation product CO. Furthermore we demonstrate the presence of the pro-apoptotic K+ channel, Kv2.1, in both human medulloblastoma tissue and DAOY cells. CO inhibited the voltage-gated K+ currents in DAOY cells, and largely reversed the oxidant-induced increase in K+ channel activity. p38 MAPK inhibition prevented the oxidant-induced increase of K+ channel activity in DAOY cells, and enhanced their resistance to apoptosis. Our findings suggest that CO-mediated inhibition of K+ channels represents an important mechanism by which HO-1 can increase the resistance to apoptosis of medulloblastoma cells, and support the idea that HO-1 inhibition may enhance the effectiveness of current chemo- and radiotherapies.Background: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is constitutively expressed in many cancers which are highly resistant to apoptosis.Results: CO, a product of HO-1, inhibits K+ channels in the medulloblastoma cell line DAOY and protects against apoptosis.Conclusion: HO-1 increases resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells via CO generation.Significance: targeting HO-1 expression may increase the effectiveness of cancer therapies.

https://openalex.org/W2098210659,"Pharmacological manipulation of opioid receptors alters feeding behavior. However, the individual contributions of each opioid receptor subtype on energy balance remain largely unknown. Herein, we investigated whether genetic disruption of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) also controls energy homeostasis. Mice lacking DOR and wild-type mice were fed with standard diet and high-energy diet (HED). Mice were analyzed in vivo with the indirect calorimetry system, and tissues were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. DOR-knockout (KO) mice gained less weight (P<0.01) and had lower fat mass (P<0.01) when compared to WT mice fed an HED. Although DOR-KO mice were hyperphagic, they showed higher energy expenditure (P<0.05), which was the result of an increased activation of the thermogenic program in brown adipose tissue. The increased nonshivering thermogenesis involved the stimulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1; P<0.01), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC1α; P<0.05), and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21; P<0.01). DOR deficiency also led to an attenuation of triglyceride content in the liver (P<0.05) in response to an HED. These findings reveal a novel role of DOR in the control of thermogenic markers and energy expenditure, and they provide a potential new therapeutic approach for the treatment of obesity.—Czyzyk, T.

https://openalex.org/W1974899077,"Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is a novel gasotransmitter that inhibits L-type calcium currents (I (Ca, L)). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. In particular, the targeting site in the L-type calcium channel where H(2)S functions remains unknown. The study was designed to investigate if the sulfhydryl group could be the possible targeting site in the L-type calcium channel in rat cardiomyocytes. Cardiac function was measured in isolated perfused rat hearts. The L-type calcium currents were recorded by using a whole cell voltage clamp technique on the isolated cardiomyocytes. The L-type calcium channel containing free sulfhydryl groups in H9C2 cells were measured by using Western blot. The results showed that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, an H(2)S donor) produced a negative inotropic effect on cardiac function, which could be partly inhibited by the oxidant sulfhydryl modifier diamide (DM). H(2)S donor inhibited the peak amplitude of I( Ca, L) in a concentration-dependent manner. However, dithiothreitol (DTT), a reducing sulfhydryl modifier markedly reversed the H(2)S donor-induced inhibition of I (Ca, L) in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, in the presence of DM, H(2)S donor could not alter cardiac function and L type calcium currents. After the isolated rat heart or the cardiomyocytes were treated with DTT, NaHS could markedly alter cardiac function and L-type calcium currents in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, NaHS could decrease the functional free sulfhydryl group in the L-type Ca(2+) channel, which could be reversed by thiol reductant, either DTT or reduced glutathione. Therefore, our results suggest that H(2)S might inhibit L-type calcium currents depending on the sulfhydryl group in rat cardiomyocytes."

The aim of this study was to examine MS prevalence and its risk factors among women in rural China. Methods and Results The Nantong Metabolic Syndrome Study (NMSS), a population based cross-sectional study, was conducted during 2007–2008 in Nantong, China. In person interviews, blood glucose and lipid measurements were completed for 13,505 female participants aged 18–74 years. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the US Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program, the Adult Treatment Panel (ATPIII) and modified ATPIII for Asian population has determined three criteria of MS. These criteria for MS were used and compared in this study. The prevalence of MS was 22.0%, 16.9% and 23.3% according to IDF, ATPIII and ATPIII-modified criteria, respectively. Levels of agreement of these criteria for MS were above 0.75. We found that vigorous-intensity of occupational physical activity was associated with a low prevalence of MS with OR of 0.76 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63–0.91). Rice wine drinkers (alcohol >12.8 g/day) had about 34% low risks of developing MS with OR of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.48–0.91), compared with non-drinkers. Odds ratio of MS was 1.81 (95% CI: 1.15–2.84) in women who smoked more than 20 pack-years, compared to non-smokers. Odds ratio of MS was 1.56 (95% CI: 1.25–1.95) in women who had familial history of diseases, including hypertension, diabetes and stroke, compared to women without familial history of those diseases. Conclusion MS is highly prevalent among women in rural China. Both physical activity and rice wine consumption play a protective role, while family history and smoking are risk factors in MS development. Educational programs should be established for promoting healthy lifestyles and appropriate interventions in rural China."
https://openalex.org/W2043862117,"The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is a recently emerged pathogen that causes the infectious disease chytridiomycosis and has been implicated as a contributing factor in the global amphibian decline. Since its discovery, research has been focused on developing various methods of mitigating the impact of chytridiomycosis on amphibian hosts but little attention has been given to the role of antifungal agents that could be added to the host's environment. Sodium chloride is a known antifungal agent used routinely in the aquaculture industry and this study investigates its potential for use as a disease management tool in amphibian conservation. The effect of 0-5 ppt NaCl on the growth, motility and survival of the chytrid fungus when grown in culture media and its effect on the growth, infection load and survivorship of infected Peron's tree frogs (Litoria peronii) in captivity, was investigated. The results reveal that these concentrations do not negatively affect the survival of the host or the pathogen. However, concentrations greater than 3 ppt significantly reduced the growth and motility of the chytrid fungus compared to 0 ppt. Concentrations of 1-4 ppt NaCl were also associated with significantly lower host infection loads while infected hosts exposed to 3 and 4 ppt NaCl were found to have significantly higher survival rates. These results support the potential for NaCl to be used as an environmentally distributed antifungal agent for the prevention of chytridiomycosis in susceptible amphibian hosts. However, further research is required to identify any negative effects of salt exposure on both target and non-target organisms prior to implementation."

Uptake of the bacteriocin is required for activity in the periplasm leading to hydrolysis of peptidoglycan. To understand the uptake mechanism and to investigate the function of pesticin, we combined crystal structures of the wild type enzyme, active site mutants, and a chimera protein with in vivo and in vitro activity assays. Wild type pesticin comprises an elongated N-terminal translocation domain, the intermediate receptor binding domain, and a C-terminal activity domain with structural analogy to lysozyme homologs.

The large class of colicins displays a variety of enzymatic functions among which are nucleases for the degradation of DNA, rRNA, or tRNA (1Cascales E. Buchanan S.K. Duché D. Kleanthous C. Lloubès R.

A second class of colicins forms pores in the inner membrane that dissipate the electrochemical potential (1Cascales E. Buchanan S.K. Duché D. Kleanthous C. Lloubès R. Postle K. Riley M. Slatin S. Cavard D. Colicin biology.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Currently, only two bacteriocins are known to develop activity in the periplasm. Colicin M inhibits peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis (2Schaller K. Höltje J.V. Braun V. Colicin M is an inhibitor of murein biosynthesis.J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 994-1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas pesticin is a muramidase that degrades PG (3Hall P.J. Brubaker R.R. Pesticin-dependent generation of somotically stable spheroplast-like structures.J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 786-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Vollmer W. Pilsl H. Hantke K. Höltje J.V. Braun V. Pesticin displays muramidase activity.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1580-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The genetic organization and the principal structural architecture of Pst resemble colicins. The pst operon encodes Pst and the Pim protein, an antagonist to pesticin also known as the immunity protein that confers pesticin resistance to Pst-producing cells. Pim resides in the periplasm where the PG substrate of Pst is located (5Pilsl H. Killmann H. Hantke K. Braun V. Periplasmic location of the pesticin immunity protein suggests inactivation of pesticin in the periplasm.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2431-2435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Colicins are the only proteins actively imported by E. coli cells, which make them particularly attractive for studies of bacterial protein import. Colicin activity requires at least three steps as follows: 1) binding on the cell surface via receptor recognition; 2) energy-dependent uptake into the compartment of activity, and 3) destruction of the cellular target. Colicins denoted as group A colicins are imported across the outer membrane by the Tol system, whereas group B colicins use the Ton system for import. Colicins are typically composed of three domains as follows: the N-terminal translocation domain (T domain) comprising the TonB box segment that is important for binding to TonB and subsequent uptake across the outer membrane. Uptake requires energy that is generated by the protonmotive force of the cytoplasmic membrane. The energy-coupling machinery transforming electrochemical energy into the pulling force for colicin import consists of the TonB, ExbB, and ExbD proteins that are all anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane (1Cascales E. Buchanan S.K. Duché D. Kleanthous C. Lloubès R. Postle K. Riley M. Slatin S. Cavard D. Colicin biology.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 158-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). This complex recognizes via TonB N-terminal TonB box sequences of outer membrane receptor proteins and bacteriocins, which results in import of the receptor-bound ligands into the periplasm. The central receptor binding domain (R domain) is essential for the intimate contact with the outer membrane protein receptor, and the C-terminal activity domain (A domain) includes the deathly activity. Crystal structures of colicin R domains bound to receptors have been solved for colicins E2 and E3 bound to the BtuB receptor (6Kurisu G. Zakharov S.D. Zhalnina M.V. Bano S. Eroukova V.Y.

Binding of the E3 colicin to BtuB induces local unfolding in the R domain, which is believed to be transmitted to the T domain (6Kurisu G. Zakharov S.D. Zhalnina M.V. Bano S. Eroukova V.Y.

Structural changes in both receptors do not open the pore within the β-barrel. After the first intimate contact of colicins E2 and E3 with BtuB, the bacterial porin OmpF is recruited to form a ternary complex through which the colicins are imported (6Kurisu G. Zakharov S.D. Zhalnina M.V. Bano S. Eroukova V.Y. Rokitskaya T.I. Antonenko Y.N. Wiener M.C. Cramer W.A. The structure of BtuB with bound colicin E3 R domain implies a translocon.Nat. Struct.

Structure of colicin I receptor bound to the R-domain of colicin Ia: implications for protein import.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2594-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, colicin Ia first binds to Cir and then to a second Cir for translocation across the outer membrane (9Jakes K.S. Finkelstein A. The colicin Ia receptor, Cir, is also the translocator for colicin Ia.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 75: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite detailed structural and functional information, the translocation mechanism through receptors remains unknown. FyuA is an energy-coupled receptor in the outer membrane of Y. pestis through which the iron siderophore yersiniabactin and Pst are taken up into the periplasm. Some E. coli strains also express FyuA and are killed by Pst (10Rakin A. Boolgakowa E. Heesemann J. Structural and functional organization of the Yersinia pestis bacteriocin pesticin gene cluster.Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After binding to FyuA, Pst uptake proceeds by a direct contact of the FyuA TonB box with TonB with subsequent translocation into the periplasm. In the bacterial periplasm Pst hydrolyzes PG by cleaving the bond between the C1 of N-acetylmuramic acid and C4 of N-acetylglucosamine (lysozyme activity) (4Vollmer W. Pilsl H. Hantke K. Höltje J.V. Braun V. Pesticin displays muramidase activity.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1580-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the absence of an intact PG layer, the cytoplasmic membrane no longer withstands the cytoplasmic osmotic pressure, and cells undergo lysis. Pst slowly hydrolyzes PG, which results in the formation of osmotically stable spheroplast-like forms. The spheroplast-like structures are obtained in the absence of sucrose to adapt the external osmotic pressure to the internal osmotic pressure. Nevertheless, addition of Pst to exponentially growing cells results in immediate dose-dependent loss of the ability to form colonies (3Hall P.J. Brubaker R.R. Pesticin-dependent generation of somotically stable spheroplast-like structures.J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 786-789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Very little is known about the mechanisms by which bacteriocins are translocated across the outer membrane. In particular, the transient steps for successive structural unfolding during translocation lack experimental tracing. To extract geometrical parameters influential for bacteriocin uptake, we chose the PG-degrading enzyme Pst and extended our previous functional studies (4Vollmer W. Pilsl H. Hantke K. Höltje J.V. Braun V. Pesticin displays muramidase activity.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1580-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Pilsl H. Killmann H. Hantke K. Braun V. Periplasmic location of the pesticin immunity protein suggests inactivation of pesticin in the periplasm.J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2431-2435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) toward a mechanistic understanding. To this end, we determined crystal structures of pesticin, Pst mutants, and a pesticin-T4 lysozyme chimera, and these structural studies were supported by functional studies regarding Pst uptake and activity. Together, these experiments allowed us to dissect the role of the R, T, and A domains in uptake and unfolding during translocation. Moreover, by mutational analysis we tested putative active site residues that we found to be overlapping but not identical to related lysozyme proteins. Taken together, these studies provide a structural view of Pst and advance knowledge of the uptake and plasticity of this bacteriocin. Plasmids were manipulated according to the methods of Sambrook and Russell (11Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3 Ed.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). PCRs were performed with a Mastercycler ep gradient S (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and the Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). DNA sequencing was carried out with the BigDye terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples were run on a 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems), a service provided by the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology. The E. coli strains and plasmids used in this work are given in Table 1. For construction of plasmids, overhanging DNA ends were made blunt prior to ligation. Vectors were dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), and PCR products were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas). The ligation products were introduced into E. coli DH5α (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany).

The resulting plasmid pSP130/151 encodes the signal sequence MalE(1–26) (Swissprot P0AEX9), Pst, and the C-terminal His tag LAHHHHHH under control of the araBAD promoter and contains araC. The plasmid encoding the activity domain PstA equipped with a signal sequence was cloned accordingly with the primers TGGTAAATATTGTTGACCACGATATTTTCTC and GTTTTAACAATCCACTATCGATATCTTTTTGCAC resulting in pSP130/152. The gene encoding the T4 lysozyme derivative T4L (C221T and C264A) was amplified by PCR with the primers TGAATATATTTGAAATGTTACGTATAGATGAAGG and ATAGATTTTTATACGCGTCCCAAGTGCC from plasmid T4L, which was kindly provided by Joachim E. Schultz, University of Tübingen, Germany. The PCR product was cloned into the NdeI/XhoI cut expression vector pET22b yielding pSP130/375 and into pPstT7Lys (Trenzyme Biotechnology, Konstanz, Germany) replacing the T7 lysozyme gene yielding pSP130/187. The deletion encoding PstΔ10–15 was generated by PCR amplification of pSP130/70 with the primers ACCATTCACTACCATTGTATCTGACATAAAA and TTTCTCTTTTCCGGAAGTACATTAAGCAG and subsequent ligation, resulting in plasmid pSP130/258. For PstΔ10–20 plasmid pSP130/262 was generated accordingly with the primers ACCATTCACTACCATTGTATCTGACATAAAA and AGTACATTAAGCAGTTACAGACCAAATTTTG. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR with two complementary primers containing the mutation (primer sequences are available upon request) and treatment with DpnI (Fermentas) prior to transformation of DH5α (13Papworth C. Bauer J.C. Braman J. Wright D.A.

The chromosomal tonB mutant SIP1453 was obtained by selecting for Cma-resistant colonies of SIP1332. Sequencing revealed a point mutation resulting in a TonB109Stop mutation. The chromosomal fhuA mutant SIP1461 was gained by selecting for bacteriophage T5-resistant colonies of SIP1332. Sequencing revealed a point mutation resulting in an FhuA253Stop mutation. Pst without His tag was purified using a modified version of a protocol described previously (4Vollmer W. Pilsl H. Hantke K. Höltje J.V. Braun V. Pesticin displays muramidase activity.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1580-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli BL21 (DE3) RIL (Stratagene) was transformed by electroporation with plasmid pUH64 that encodes the pesticin gene pst and the pesticin immunity gene pim downstream of gene 10 promoter of bacteriophage T7. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml). When the A600 value reached 0.8, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 4 h of cultivation, cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.1. Cells were disrupted with a French press, and solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the soluble fraction to 50% saturation at which pesticin precipitated. The precipitate was solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and dialyzed against this buffer. The solution was loaded on a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the Tris-HCl buffer (see above), and Pst eluted by applying a NaCl gradient in Tris-HCl. Fractions containing pesticin were pooled, dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and the protein was concentrated to 41 mg/ml. The SeMet derivative was obtained by the same method with the exception that cells were grown in M9 salt minimal medium supplemented with the amino acids Leu, Ile, Phe, Thr, Lys, and Val (14Hanoulle X.

His tag versions of PstWT, PstE178A, PstP187A, PstT201A, PstD207A, PstQ301A, PstD338A, PstS89C/S285C, PstRT, PstA, PstΔ10–15, and PstΔ10–20 were purified from transformants of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring the recombinant plasmids pSP130/70, pSP130/110, pSP130/88, pSP130/92, pSP130/486, pSP130/73, pSP130/480, pSP130/467, pSP130/64, pSP130/66, pSP130/258, and pSP130/262, respectively, on Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, taking advantage of the C-terminal His tag on the proteins. E. coli BL21(DE3) was not killed by Pst because it does not express the receptor FyuA. For synthesis of PstRT and PstA, cells were grown at 28 °C, because under these conditions approximately half of the protein was found in the soluble fraction, whereas virtually all protein was found in inclusion bodies when grown at 37 °C. Pst and the other Pst derivatives did not form inclusion bodies in significant amounts, and cells were grown at 37 °C. Because Pst-T4L in high amounts is toxic for E. coli strains due to the T4 lysozyme activity, T4L, Pst-T4L, and its derivatives Pst-T4LD294C/R321C, Pst-T4LI176C/R321C, Pst-T4LI176C/L331C, and Pst-T4LS257C/Q289C were overexpressed from pSP130/375, pSP130/187, pSP130/432, pSP130/379, pSP130/441, and pSP130/452, respectively, in E. coli C41 that carries mutations in the lacUV5 promoter controlling the T7 RNA polymerase, which results in reduced T7 RNA polymerase levels. The proteins were purified on Ni-NTA-agarose. Initial sitting-drop crystallization trials of Pst were performed with the Honeybee 961 robot (Genomic solutions) using 13 commercial high throughput screens on 3:1 Corning 3550 96-well plates. Drops mixed from 0.4 μl of protein solution and 0.4 μl of reservoir solution were equilibrated against 75 μl of precipitant solution at 20 °C. Crystals of different shape appeared under a variety of conditions that were further reproduced under hanging-drop conditions. Needle-shaped crystals suitable for the x-ray data collection were obtained with a solution containing 18% PEG 8000, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. The Pst-SeMet construct was crystallized under the same conditions as Pst without the His tag. PstT201A and PstE178A were crystallized in a hanging-drop setup by mixing 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of ground solution, which contained 20% PEG 3350 and 0.2 m NaNO3. Pst-T4L was crystallized in a hanging-drop setup by mixing 1.2 μl of protein solution and 0.8 μl of ground solution, which contained 20% PEG 3350 and 0.15 m K2SO4. For crystallization of PstD207A, the reservoir solution contained 20% PEG 3350 and 0.2 m NaI. The structure of Pst was solved by single anomalous diffraction methods using a SeMet-labeled Pst protein crystal. Protein crystals were flash-frozen in the presence of 15% glycerol for Pst, PstT201A, and Pst-T4L, 17% glycerol for PstE178A, and 20% PEG 400 for PstD207A added to the solution of crystallization conditions mentioned above. All x-ray crystallographic data were collected at beamline PX10 at the Swiss Light Source (SLS, Villigen, Switzerland). The crystals were kept at 100 K during data collection, and a 360° dataset was collected. Data were processed with the XDS/XSCALE (15Kabsch W.

https://openalex.org/W1997123976,"CaV1/CaV2 channels, comprised of pore-forming α1 and auxiliary (β,α2δ) subunits, control diverse biological responses in excitable cells. Molecules blocking CaV1/CaV2 channel currents (ICa) profoundly regulate physiology and have many therapeutic applications. Rad/Rem/Rem2/Gem GTPases (RGKs) strongly inhibit CaV1/CaV2 channels. Understanding how RGKs block ICa is critical for insights into their physiological function, and may provide design principles for developing novel CaV1/CaV2 channel inhibitors. The RGK binding sites within CaV1/CaV2 channel complexes responsible for ICa inhibition are ambiguous, and it is unclear whether there are mechanistic differences among distinct RGKs. All RGKs bind β subunits, but it is unknown if and how this interaction contributes to ICa inhibition. We investigated the role of RGK/β interaction in Rem inhibition of recombinant CaV1.2 channels, using a mutated β (β2aTM) selectively lacking RGK binding. Rem blocked β2aTM-reconstituted channels (74% inhibition) less potently than channels containing wild-type β2a (96% inhibition), suggesting the prevalence of both β-binding-dependent and independent modes of inhibition. Two mechanistic signatures of Rem inhibition of CaV1.2 channels (decreased channel surface density and open probability), but not a third (reduced maximal gating charge), depended on Rem binding to β. We identified a novel Rem binding site in CaV1.2 α1C N-terminus that mediated β-binding-independent inhibition. The CaV2.2 α1B subunit lacks the Rem binding site in the N-terminus and displays a solely β-binding-dependent form of channel inhibition. Finally, we discovered an unexpected functional dichotomy amongst distinct RGKs— while Rem and Rad use both β-binding-dependent and independent mechanisms, Gem and Rem2 use only a β-binding-dependent method to inhibit CaV1.2 channels. The results provide new mechanistic perspectives, and reveal unexpected variations in determinants, underlying inhibition of CaV1.2/CaV2.2 channels by distinct RGK GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2104857626,"Death receptor 3 (DR3, TNFRSF25), the closest family relative to tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, promotes CD4+ T-cell-driven inflammatory disease. We investigated the in vivo role of DR3 and its ligand TL1A in viral infection, by challenging DR3-deficient (DR3KO) mice and their DR3WT littermates with the β-herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus or the poxvirus vaccinia virus. The phenotype and function of splenic T-cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and molecular biological techniques. We report surface expression of DR3 by naive CD8+ T cells, with TCR activation increasing its levels 4-fold and altering the ratio of DR3 splice variants. T-cell responses were reduced up to 90% in DR3KO mice during acute infection. Adoptive transfer experiments indicated this was dependent on T-cell-restricted expression of DR3. DR3-dependent CD8+ T-cell expansion was NK and CD4 independent and due to proliferation, not decreased cell death. Notably, impaired immunity in DR3KO hosts on a C57BL/6 background was associated with 4- to 7-fold increases in viral loads during the acute phase of infection, and in mice with suboptimal NK responses was essential for survival (37.5%). This is the first description of DR3 regulating virus-specific T-cell function in vivo and uncovers a critical role for DR3 in mediating antiviral immunity.—Twohig, J. P., Marsden, M., Cuff, S.

https://openalex.org/W2011641972,"Socioeconomic status (SES) is adversely associated with perinatal outcomes. This association is likely to be mediated by tobacco exposure. However, previous studies were limited to single perinatal outcomes and devoted no attention to environmental tobacco exposure. Therefore, this study aimed firstly to explain the role of maternal smoking in the association between maternal education and preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW) and small for gestational age (SGA), and secondly to explain whether environmental tobacco smoke mediates these associations further.This study was nested in a population-based cohort study in the Netherlands, the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development (ABCD) study. Analyses were done in a sample of 3821 pregnant women of Dutch origin, using logistic regression analysis.Least educated women, who were more often smoking and exposed to environmental tobacco smoke, had a significantly higher risk of PTB (OR 1.95 [95% CI: 1.19-3.20]), LBW (OR 2.41 [95% CI: 1.36-4.27]) and SGA (OR 1.90 [95% CI 1.32-2.74]) than highly educated women. The mediating effect of smoking in the least educated women was 43% for PTB, 55% for LBW and 66% for SGA. Environmental tobacco smoke did not explain these associations further. After adjustment for maternal smoking, the association between lower maternal education and pregnancy outcomes was no longer significant.Smoking explains to a considerable extent the association between lower maternal education and adverse perinatal outcomes. Therefore, tobacco-interventions in lower educated women should be primarily focussed on maternal smoking to reduce PTB, LBW, and SGA. Additional attention to environmental tobacco exposure does not seem to reduce educational inequalities in perinatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2026811262,"CD137/TNFR9/41BB was originally described as a surface molecule present on activated T and NK cells. However, its expression is broader among leukocytes, and it is also detected on hypoxic endothelial cells and inflamed blood vessels, as well as in atherosclerotic lesions. Here, we demonstrate that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) up-regulate CD137 expression from undetectable baseline levels on stimulation with TNF-α, LPS, and IL-1β. CD137 cross-linking with an agonistic mAb results in NF-κB nuclear translocation, followed by up-regulation of VCAM and a 3-fold increase in the production of the chemokine CCL21. Accordingly, there is a 50% increase in CCR7-dependent migration toward conditioned medium from activated LECs on CD137 cross-linking with the agonistic mAb or the natural ligand (CD137L). Such an enhancement of cell migration is also observed with monocyte-derived dendritic cells transmigrating across CD137-activated LEC monolayers. Using explanted human dermal tissue, we found that inflamed skin contains abundant CD137+ lymphatic vessels and that ex vivo incubation of explanted human dermis with TNF-α induces CD137 expression in lymphatic capillaries. More interestingly, treatment with CD137 agonistic antibody induces CCL21 expression and DC accumulation close to lymphatic vessels. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the inflammatory function of lymphatic vessels can be regulated by CD137.—Teijeira, A., Palazón, A., Garasa, S., Marré, D., Aubá, C., Rogel, A., Murillo, O., Martínez-Forero, I., Lang, F., Melero, I., Rouzaut, A.

The catalytic subunits of primase and pol α synthesize composite RNA-DNA primers that initiate the leading and lagging DNA strands at replication forks.

We have identified a short conserved motif at the extreme C terminus of pol α that is critical for interaction of the yeast ortholog pol1 with primase. We show that truncation of the C-terminal residues 1452–1468 of Pol1 abrogates the interaction with the primase, as does mutation to alanine of the invariant amino acid Phe1463. Conversely, a pol1 peptide spanning the last 16 residues binds primase with high affinity, and the equivalent peptide from human Pol α binds primase in an analogous fashion. These in vitro data are mirrored by experiments in yeast cells, as primase does not interact in cell extracts with pol1 that either terminates at residue 1452 or has the F1463A mutation. The ability to disrupt the association between primase and pol α allowed us to assess the physiological significance of primase being tethered to the eukaryotic replisome in this way.

https://openalex.org/W1991313260,"Adhesive interactions between cells are needed to maintain tissue architecture during development, tissue renewal and wound healing. Thrombomodulin (TM) is an integral membrane protein that participates in cell-cell adhesion through its extracellular lectin-like domain. However, the molecular basis of TM-mediated cell-cell adhesion is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that TM is linked to the actin cytoskeleton via ezrin. In vitro binding assays showed that the TM cytoplasmic domain bound directly to the N-terminal domain of ezrin. Mutational analysis of the TM cytoplasmic domain identified (522)RKK(524) as important ezrin-binding residues. In epidermal epithelial A431 cells, TM colocalized with ezrin and actin filaments at cell-cell contacts. Knockdown of endogenous TM expression by RNA interference induced morphological changes and accelerated cell migration in A431 cells. Moreover, epidermal growth factor, upstream of ezrin activation, stimulated the interaction between ezrin and TM. In skin wound healing of mice, TM and ezrin were highly expressed in neoepidermis, implying that both proteins are key molecules in reepithelialization that requires collective cell migration of epithelial cells. Finally, exogenous expression of TM in TM-deficient melanoma A2058 cells promoted collective cell migration. In summary, TM, which associates with ezrin and actin filaments, maintains epithelial morphology and promotes collective cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2094501844,"Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in endothelial cells determines the plasma concentrations of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which may act as vasoactive agents to control vascular tone. We hypothesized that the regulation of sEH activity may have a therapeutic value in preventing acute kidney injury by controlling the concentration of EETs. In this study, we therefore induced ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in C57BL/6 mice and controlled sEH activity by intraperitoneal administration of the sEH inhibitor 12-(3-adamantan-1-ylureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA). The deterioration of kidney function induced by IRI was partially moderated and prevented by AUDA treatment. In addition, AUDA treatment significantly attenuated tubular necrosis induced by IRI. Ischemic injury induced the down-regulation of sEH, and AUDA administration had no effect on the expression pattern of sEH induced by IRI. In vivo sEH activity was assessed by measuring the substrate epoxyoctadecenoic acid (EpOME) and its metabolite dihydroxyoctadec-12-enoic acid (DHOME). Ischemic injury had no effects on the plasma concentrations of EpOME and DHOME, but inhibition of sEH by AUDA significantly increased plasma EpOME and the EpOME/DHOME ratio. The protective effect of the sEH inhibitor was achieved by suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of regulatory cytokines. AUDA treatment prevented the intrarenal infiltration of inflammatory cells, but promoted endothelial cell migration and neovascularization. The results of this study suggest that treatment with sEH inhibitors can reduce acute kidney injury."
https://openalex.org/W2169476457,"Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) is a mitochondrial redox-driven proton pump that couples the production of NADPH to the mitochondrial metabolic rate. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that NNT has a significant effect in the modulation of the immune response and host defense against pathogens. We found that NNT mRNA is enriched in immune system-related tissues and regulated during macrophage activation. Overexpression of NNT in a macrophage cell-line resulted in decreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide upon induction of the macrophage inflammatory responses. These cells failed to fully activate MAPK signaling pathways, resulting in defective secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in response to LPS, and were inefficient in clearance of intracellular bacteria. We have shown that C57BL/6J mice, which have a deletion in the Nnt gene, exhibited greater resistance to acute pulmonary infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Macrophages from these mice generated more ROS and established a stronger inflammatory response to this pathogen. Our results demonstrate a novel role for NNT as a regulator of macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses."

Their integration into cells entailed the development of protein translocons, partially by recycling bacterial proteins. We demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of the translocon component Tic22 between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. Tic22 in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 is essential. The protein is localized in the thylakoids and in the periplasm and can be functionally replaced by a plant orthologue. Tic22 physically interacts with the outer envelope biogenesis factor Omp85 in vitro and in vivo, the latter exemplified by immunoprecipitation after chemical cross-linking. The physical interaction together with the phenotype of a tic22 mutant comparable with the one of the omp85 mutant indicates a concerted function of both proteins. The three-dimensional structure allows the definition of conserved hydrophobic pockets comparable with those of ClpS or BamB. The results presented suggest a function of Tic22 in outer membrane biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056856535,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have an anti-viral role in that they detect viruses, leading to cytokine and IFN induction, and as such are targeted by viruses for immune evasion. TLR4, although best known for its role in recognizing bacterial LPS, is also strongly implicated in the immune response to viruses. We previously showed that the poxviral protein A46 inhibits TLR4 signaling and interacts with Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing proteins of the receptor complex. However the exact molecular mechanism whereby A46 disrupts TLR4 signaling remains to be established, and may yield insight into how the TLR4 complex functions, since viruses often optimally target key residues and motifs on host proteins for maximal efficiency. Here we show that A46 targets the BB loop motif of TIR proteins and thereby disrupts receptor:adaptor (TLR4:Mal and TLR4:TRAM), but not receptor:receptor (TLR4:TLR4) nor adaptor:adaptor (Mal:MyD88, TRAM:TRIF, and Mal:Mal) TIR interactions. The requirement for an intact BB loop for TIR adaptor interactions correlated with the protein:protein interfaces antagonized by A46. We previously discovered a peptide fragment derived from A46 termed VIPER (Viral Inhibitory Peptide of TLR4), which specifically inhibits TLR4 responses. Here we demonstrate that the region of A46 from which VIPER is derived represents the TLR4-specific inhibitory motif of the intact protein, and is essential for A46:TRAM interactions. This study provides the molecular basis for pathogen subversion of TLR4 signaling and clarifies the importance of TIR motif BB loops, which have been selected for viral antagonism, in the formation of the TLR4 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2135258861,"Plant-plant interference is the combined effect of allelopathy, resource competition, and many other factors. Separating allelopathy from resource competition is almost impossible in natural systems but it is important to evaluate the relative contribution of each of the two mechanisms on plant interference. Research on allelopathy in natural and cultivated plant communities has been hindered in the absence of a reliable method that can separate allelopathic effect from resource competition. In this paper, the interactions between allelopathic rice accession PI312777, non-allelopathic rice accession Lemont and barnyardgrass were explored respectively by using a target (rice)-neighbor (barnyardgrass) mixed-culture in hydroponic system. The relative competitive intensity (RCI), the relative neighbor effect (RNE) and the competitive ratio (CR) were used to quantify the intensity of competition between each of the two different potentially allelopathic rice accessions and barnyardgrass. Use of hydroponic culture system enabled us to exclude any uncontrolled factors that might operate in the soil and we were able to separate allelopathy from resource competition between each rice accession and barnyardgrass. The RCI and RNE values showed that the plant-plant interaction was positive (facilitation) for PI312777 but that was negative (competition) for Lemont and barnyardgrass in rice/barnyardgrass mixed-cultures. The CR values showed that one PI312777 plant was more competitive than 2 barnyardgrass plants. The allelopathic effects of PI312777 were much more intense than the resource competition in rice/barnyardgrass mixed cultures. The reverse was true for Lemont. These results demonstrate that the allelopathic effect of PI312777 was predominant in rice/barnyardgrass mixed-cultures. The most significant result of our study is the discovery of an experimental design, target-neighbor mixed-culture in combination with competition indices, can successfully separate allelopathic effects from competition."
https://openalex.org/W2105345404,"Forkhead box N1 (FOXN1) is a transcription factor crucial for thymic epithelium development and prevention of its involution. Investigation of a patient with a rare homozygous FOXN1 mutation (R255X), leading to alopecia universalis and thymus aplasia, unexpectedly revealed non-maternal circulating T-cells, and, strikingly, large numbers of aberrant double-negative αβ T-cells (CD4negCD8neg, DN) and regulatory-like T-cells. These data raise the possibility that a thymic rudiment persisted, allowing T-cell development, albeit with disturbances in positive/negative selection, as suggested by DN and FoxP3+ cell expansions. Although regulatory-like T-cell numbers normalized following HLA-mismatched thymic transplantation, the αβDN subset persisted 5 years post-transplantation. Involution of thymus allograft likely occurred 3 years post-transplantation based on sj/βTREC ratio, which estimates intrathymic precursor T-cell divisions and, consequently, thymic explant output. Nevertheless, functional immune-competence was sustained, providing new insights for the design of immunological reconstitution strategies based on thymic transplantation, with potential applications in other clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2056692227,"Photoperiod is associated to phenotypic plasticity of somatic growth in several teleost species. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are currently unknown but it is likely that epigenetic regulation by methyltransferases is involved. The MLL (mixed-lineage leukaemia) family comprises histone methyltransferases that play a critical role in regulating gene expression during early development in mammals. So far, these genes have received scant attention in teleost fish. In the present study, the mean weight of Atlantic cod juveniles reared under continuous illumination was found to be 13% greater than those kept under natural photoperiod conditions for 120 days. We newly determined cDNA sequences of five mll (mll1, mll2, mll3a, mll4b and mll5) and two setd1 (setd1a and setd1ba) paralogues from Atlantic cod. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the cod genes clustered within the appropriate mll clade and comparative mapping of mll paralogues showed that these genes lie within a region of conserved synteny among teleosts. All mll and setd1 genes were highly expressed in gonads and fast muscle of adult cod, albeit at different levels, and they were differentially regulated with photoperiod in muscle of juvenile fish. Following only one day of exposure to constant light, mll1, mll4b and setd1a were up to 57% lower in these fish compared to the natural photoperiod group. In addition, mRNA expression of myogenic regulatory factors (myog and myf-5) and pax7 in fast muscle was also affected by different photoperiod conditions. Notably, myog was significantly elevated in the continuous illumination group throughout the time course of the experiment. The absence of a day/night cycle is associated with a generalised decrease in mll expression concomitant with an increase in myog transcript levels in fast muscle of Atlantic cod, which may be involved in the observed epigenetic regulation of growth by photoperiod in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2058393910,"Background The ‘two-faced’ character of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an important role in cancer biology by acting both as secondary messengers in intracellular signaling cascades and sustaining the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, while on the other hand, it triggers an oxidative assault that causes a redox imbalance translating into an apoptotic cell death. Principal Findings Using a tetrazolium [{3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl}-2H-tetrazolium] based cell viability assay, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of a plant derived diarylnonanoid, malabaricone-A on leukemic cell lines U937 and MOLT-3. This cytotoxicity hinged on its ability to cause a redox imbalance via its ability to increase ROS, measured by flow cytometry using 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and by decreasing glutathione peroxidase activity. This redox imbalance mediated apoptosis was evident by an increase in cytosolic [Ca2+], externalization of phosphatidyl serine as also depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential as measured by flow cytometry. There was concomitant peroxidation of cardiolipin, release of free cytochrome c to cytosol along with activation of caspases 9, 8 and 3. This led to cleavage of the DNA repair enzyme, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase that caused DNA damage as proved by labeling with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); furthermore, terminal deoxy ribonucleotide transferase catalysed incorporation of deoxy uridine triphosphate confirmed DNA nicking and was accompanied by arrest of cell cycle progression. Conclusions Taken together, compounds like MAL-A having pro-oxidant activity mediate their cytotoxicity in leukemic cells via induction of oxidative stress triggering a caspase dependent apoptosis."

A validated direct observation protocol was used as the criterion measure of physical activity. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analyses were conducted with four semi-structured activities to determine the accelerometer cut-points. To examine classification differences, cut-points were cross-validated with free-play and DVD viewing activities.Cut-points of ≤ 372, >2160 and >4806 counts • min(-1) representing sedentary, moderate and vigorous intensity thresholds, respectively, provided the optimal balance between the related needs for sensitivity (accurately detecting activity) and specificity (limiting misclassification of the activity). Cross-validation data demonstrated that these values yielded the best overall kappa scores (0.97; 0.71; 0.62), and a high classification agreement (98.6%; 89.0%; 87.2%), respectively. Specificity values of 96-97% showed that the developed cut-points accurately detected physical activity, and sensitivity values (89-99%) indicated that minutes of activity were seldom incorrectly classified as inactivity.The development of an inexpensive and replicable field-based protocol to generate behaviourally valid and population-specific accelerometer cut-points may improve the classification of physical activity levels in children, which could enhance subsequent intervention and observational studies."
https://openalex.org/W2044563757,"The surface-exposed β-galactosidase BgaC from Streptococcus pneumoniae was reported to be a virulence factor because of its specific hydrolysis activity toward the β(1,3)-linked galactose and N-acetylglucosamine (Galβ(1,3)NAG) moiety of oligosaccharides on the host molecules. Here we report the crystal structure of BgaC at 1.8 Å and its complex with galactose at 1.95 Å. At pH 5.5-8.0, BgaC exists as a stable homodimer, each subunit of which consists of three distinct domains: a catalytic domain of a classic (β/α)(8) TIM barrel, followed by two all-β domains (ABDs) of unknown function. The side walls of the TIM β-barrel and a loop extended from the first ABD constitute the active site. Superposition of the galactose-complexed structure to the apo-form revealed significant conformational changes of residues Trp-243 and Tyr-455. Simulation of a putative substrate entrance tunnel and modeling of a complex structure with Galβ(1,3)NAG enabled us to assign three key residues to the specific catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis in combination with activity assays further proved that residues Trp-240 and Tyr-455 contribute to stabilizing the N-acetylglucosamine moiety, whereas Trp-243 is critical for fixing the galactose ring. Moreover, we propose that BgaC and other galactosidases in the GH-35 family share a common domain organization and a conserved substrate-determinant aromatic residue protruding from the second domain."
https://openalex.org/W2159753046,"Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) is an enzyme that phosphorylates diacylglycerol to produce phosphatidic acid. DGKβ is one of the subtypes of the DGK family and regulates many intracellular signaling pathways in the central nervous system. Previously, we demonstrated that DGKβ knockout (KO) mice showed various dysfunctions of higher brain function, such as cognitive impairment (with lower spine density), hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and careless behavior. In the present study, we conducted further tests on DGKβ KO mice in order to investigate the function of DGKβ in the central nervous system, especially in the pathophysiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).DGKβ KO mice showed attention-deficit behavior in the object-based attention test and it was ameliorated by methylphenidate (MPH, 30 mg/kg, i.p.). In the open field test, DGKβ KO mice displayed a decreased response to the locomotor stimulating effects of MPH (30 mg/kg, i.p.), but showed a similar response to an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, MK-801 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.), when compared to WT mice. Examination of the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which is involved in regulation of locomotor activity, indicated that ERK1/2 activation induced by MPH treatment was defective in the striatum of DGKβ KO mice.These findings suggest that DGKβ KO mice showed attention-deficit and hyperactive phenotype, similar to ADHD. Furthermore, the hyporesponsiveness of DGKβ KO mice to MPH was due to dysregulation of ERK phosphorylation, and that DGKβ has a pivotal involvement in ERK regulation in the striatum."
https://openalex.org/W2042840607,"Hyperglycemia is associated with abnormal plasma lipoprotein metabolism and with an elevation in circulating nucleotide levels. We evaluated how extracellular nucleotides may act to perturb hepatic lipoprotein secretion. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (>10 µM) acts like a proteasomal inhibitor to stimulate apoB100 secretion and inhibit apoA-I secretion from human liver cells at 4 h and 24 h. ADP blocks apoA-I secretion by stimulating autophagy. The nucleotide increases cellular levels of the autophagosome marker, LC3-II, and increases co-localization of LC3 with apoA-I in punctate autophagosomes. ADP affects autophagy and apoA-I secretion through P2Y13. Overexpression of P2Y13 increases cellular LC3-II levels by ∼50% and blocks induction of apoA-I secretion. Conversely, a siRNA-induced reduction in P2Y13 protein expression of 50% causes a similar reduction in cellular LC3-II levels and a 3-fold stimulation in apoA-I secretion. P2Y13 gene silencing blocks the effects of ADP on autophagy and apoA-I secretion. A reduction in P2Y13 expression suppresses ERK1/2 phosphorylation, increases the phosphorylation of IR-β and protein kinase B (Akt) >3-fold, and blocks the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by TNFα and ADP. Conversely, increasing P2Y13 expression significantly inhibits insulin-induced phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR-β) and Akt, similar to that observed after treatment with ADP. Nucleotides therefore act through P2Y13, ERK1/2 and insulin receptor signaling to stimulate autophagy and affect hepatic lipoprotein secretion."

Recently, we showed that YB-1 is capable of forming elongated fibrils under high ionic strength conditions. Here we report that it is the cold shock domain that is responsible for formation of YB-1 fibrils, while the terminal domains differentially modulate this process depending on salt conditions. We demonstrate that YB-1 fibrils have amyloid-like features, including affinity for specific dyes and a typical X-ray diffraction pattern, and that in contrast to most of amyloids, they disassemble under nearly physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2024210520,"Exogenous attention can be understood as an adaptive tool that permits the detection and processing of biologically salient events even when the individual is engaged in a resource-consuming task. Indirect data suggest that the spatial frequency of stimulation may be a crucial element in this process. Behavioral and neural data (both functional and structural) were analyzed for 36 participants engaged in a digit categorization task in which distracters were presented. Distracters were biologically salient or anodyne images, and had three spatial frequency formats: intact, low spatial frequencies only, and high spatial frequencies only. Behavior confirmed enhanced exogenous attention to biologically salient distracters. The activity in the right and left intraparietal sulci and the right middle frontal gyrus was associated with this behavioral pattern and was greater in response to salient than to neutral distracters, the three areas presenting strong correlations to each other. Importantly, the enhanced response of this network to biologically salient distracters with respect to neutral distracters relied on low spatial frequencies to a significantly greater extent than on high spatial frequencies. Structural analyses suggested the involvement of internal capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus and corpus callosum in this network. Results confirm that exogenous attention is preferentially captured by biologically salient information, and suggest that the architecture and function underlying this process are low spatial frequency-biased."

Their control is an important component of the integrated management of these diseases, and among the techniques available, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is the sole that is efficient at low densities. The government of Burkina Faso has embarked on a tsetse eradication programme in the framework of the PATTEC, where SIT is an important component. The project plans to use flies from a Glossina palpalis gambiensis colony that has been maintained for about 40 years at the Centre International de Recherche-Développement sur l'Elevage en zone Subhumide (CIRDES). It was thus necessary to test the competitiveness of the sterile males originating from this colony.During the period January-February 2010, 16,000 sterile male G. p. gambiensis were released along a tributary of the Mouhoun river. The study revealed that with a mean sterile to wild male ratio of 1.16 (s.d. 0.38), the abortion rate of the wild female flies was significantly higher than before (p = 0.026) and after (p = 0.019) the release period. The estimated competitiveness of the sterile males (Fried index) was 0.07 (s.d. 0.02), indicating that a sterile to wild male ratio of 14.4 would be necessary to obtain nearly complete induced sterility in the female population. The aggregation patterns of sterile and wild male flies were similar. The survival rate of the released sterile male flies was similar to that observed in 1983-1985 for the same colony.We conclude that gamma sterilised male G. p. gambiensis derived from the CIRDES colony have a competitiveness that is comparable to their competitiveness obtained 35 years ago and can still be used for an area-wide integrated pest management campaign with a sterile insect component in Burkina Faso."

Furthermore, ectopic expression of Myo10 with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) labeled Myo10 mutants induced multiple axon-like neurites in a motor-independent way. Mechanism studies demonstrated that the recruitment of Myo10 through its PH domain to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns (3,4,5) P3) was essential for axon formation.

Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The muscle-type nAChR was the first receptor type found to be palmitoylated on both the α and β nAChR subunits (11Olson E.N. Glaser L. Merlie J.P. α and β subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor contain covalently bound lipid.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5364-5367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the neuronal α7 and α4β2 nAChRs have been shown to be palmitoylated (12Drisdel R.C. Manzana E. Green W.N. The role of palmitoylation in functional expression of nicotinic α7 receptors.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10502-10510Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Alexander J.K. Govind A.P. Drisdel R.C. Blanton M.P. Vallejo Y. Lam T.T. Green W.N. Palmitoylation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2010; 40: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but the specific palmitoylation sites have not been identified. We exchanged all of the cysteines with serines in the intracellular loops of the α4 nAChR subunit to determine the role of cysteine modifications, including palmitoylation, on the expression and trafficking of the α4 nAChR subunit. Within the M1-M2 region, there is a single cysteine residue, whereas the M3-M4 loop contains 11 cysteine residues. The cysteine in the M1-M2 loop is palmitoylated and is conserved in the α2, α3, α4, α6, β2, and β4 nAChR subunits. The homologous cysteine previously has been associated with use-dependent inactivation of α3-containing nAChRs in hyperglycemic and oxidative conditions (14Campanucci V. Krishnaswamy A. Cooper E. Diabetes depresses synaptic transmission in sympathetic ganglia by inactivating nAChRs through a conserved intracellular cysteine residue.Neuron. 2010; 66: 827-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When this cysteine is mutated to a serine, creating a depalmitoylated mutant, total protein expression is decreased, whereas cell surface expression increases. The cysteine to serine mutations in the M3-M4 cytoplasmic loop lead to increased total and cell surface protein expression. When all of the cysteines are mutated to serines in both cytoplasmic domains, there is no change in total protein expression, but surface expression is increased. Functional activation, ligand-binding affinity, and targeting to presynaptic terminals of the mutant α4β2 nAChRs do not vary from wild-type (WT) α4 nAChR subunits. Our results suggest that cysteine residues modulate both total and surface protein expression of the α4 nAChR subunit. All constructs were made by PCR using appropriate pairs of forward and reverse synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Invitrogen) and PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The rat α4 nAChR subunit containing an N-terminal FLAG tag and the untagged β2 nAChR subunit cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian cell expression vector, C-terminal p3xFLAG-CMV vector (Sigma). Mutagenesis of the α4 nAChR subunit was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Three mutant constructs were generated in the α4 nAChR: 1) a cysteine to serine mutation within the M1-M2 loop (α4C273S), 2) 11 mutations within the M3-M4 loop (α4ΔC), and 3) mutation of all cysteines within the M1-M2 and M3-M4 loops (α4ΔΔC). For the α4ΔΔC mutant, the α4ΔC plasmid backbone was used with the α4C273S primers to generate a mutant lacking all of the intracellular cysteines (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures” for primer pairs). The following antibodies were used: rat monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the β2 nAChR subunit (mAb 295) (kindly provided by Dr. J. Lindstrom, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA); mouse mAb against FLAG tag (1:1000, F-3165, Sigma); a goat polyclonal Ab against the β2 nAChR subunit (1:100, C-20, sc-1449, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) that binds to denatured β2 subunits on immunoblots; rabbit polyclonal anti-GAPDH Ab (1:5000, G-9545, Sigma), rabbit polyclonal Ab against vesicular stomatitis virus-G (1:2000, Sigma), and a mouse monoclonal Ab against HA (1:2000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Goat anti-rat, anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs were obtained from Pierce. The Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 594-, and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rat, goat anti-rabbit, and goat anti-mouse secondary Abs were obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Human tsA 201 cells, a derivative of the HEK cell line 293, were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, Thermo Scientific, Logan, UT) and 20 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) as described previously (2Ren X.Q. Cheng S.B. Treuil M.W. Mukherjee J. Rao J. Braunewell K.H. Lindstrom J.M. Anand R. Structural determinants of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor trafficking.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6676-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). tsA 201 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For all experiments, tsA 201 cells were plated on day 1 and transfected on day 2, medium was exchanged on day 3, moved to 30 °C to promote assembly of α4β2 nAChRs on day 4, and used for experiments on day 5. Cultures were prepared and maintained as described previously (15Cheng S.B. Amici S.A. Ren X.Q. McKay S.B. Treuil M.W. Lindstrom J.M. Rao J. Anand R.

Neurons were transfected at 7–10 days in vitro (DIV) using the Clontech CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit (BD Biosciences) as described (16Jiang M. Chen G. High Ca2+ phosphate transfection efficiency in low-density neuronal cultures.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed as described previously (15Cheng S.B. Amici S.A. Ren X.Q. McKay S.B. Treuil M.W. Lindstrom J.M. Rao J. Anand R.

After 24 h, transfected tsA 201 cells were coplated at 15,000 cells/well with the neurons, transferred to 30 °C (12–13 DIV), and processed for immunocytochemistry at 14–15 DIV. tsA 201 cells were transfected with α4, α4ΔC, α4ΔΔC, or α4C273S. On the day of the experiment, medium was exchanged for starvation (DMEM containing 1% fatty acid-free BSA), incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and then metabolically labeled in starvation medium containing 1 millicurie/ml [3H]palmitate (PerkinElmer Life Science) for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed in PBS and lysed in solubilization buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2% Triton X-100) with aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (all at 5 μg/ml), 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1× phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 (Sigma), and solubilized for 2 h at 4 °C. The lysates were spun for 15 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. The α4 FLAG-tagged subunits were captured by immunoprecipitation (IP) using the FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) as described previously (2Ren X.Q. Cheng S.B. Treuil M.W. Mukherjee J. Rao J. Braunewell K.H. Lindstrom J.M. Anand R. Structural determinants of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor trafficking.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6676-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the hydroxylamine experiment, FLAG M2 beads were treated with 1 m hydroxylamine (Sigma) or control 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for 1 h. 10% of the IP eluates (5 μl) were run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and blotted with anti-FLAG or anti-C-20 antibodies. The remaining 90% of IP eluates were run on a parallel blot that was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad Laboratories), destained (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid), incubated with Amplify (GE Healthcare) for 30 min, dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 2 h, exposed to film (Kodak BioMax MS) at −80°C for 21 days and then developed. Transfected tsA 201 cells were solubilized in 2% Triton X-100 buffer for 2 h at 4 °C and captured by IP using FLAG M2 beads as described previously (2Ren X.Q. Cheng S.B. Treuil M.W. Mukherjee J.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6676-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Following separation using SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane and incubated with diluted Abs in PBS containing 3% nonfat milk powder. The binding of the primary Abs to proteins was detected using appropriate secondary Abs as described previously (2Ren X.Q. Cheng S.B. Treuil M.W. Mukherjee J. Rao J. Braunewell K.H. Lindstrom J.M. Anand R. Structural determinants of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor trafficking.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6676-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Blots were scanned and analyzed in ImageJ software. α4 nAChR subunit expression was normalized to GAPDH (n = 5). Transfected tsA 201 cells were washed and fixed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) supplemented with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose, pH 7.4 (15 min, room temperature), blocked with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 3% normal goat serum and 3% BSA (for surface immunocytochemistry) or blocked with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 3% normal goat serum, 3% BSA, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (for total immunocytochemistry) (30 min at room temperature), and incubated with the appropriate primary (2 h, 4 °C) and secondary (90 min at room temperature) antibodies. Coverslips were mounted onto slides with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen). For the mixed neuron/tsA 201 cell assays, the cultures were processed as described previously (15Cheng S.B. Amici S.A. Ren X.Q. McKay S.B. Treuil M.W. Lindstrom J.M. Rao J. Anand R. Presynaptic targeting of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is regulated by neurexin-1β.J. Biol.

They were fixed, blocked, and incubated with the appropriate primary (2 h, 4 °C) and secondary (90 min, room temperature) antibodies. Cells and cocultures were visualized as described (15Cheng S.B.

Single-plane fluorescence images were captured using a Hamamatsu EM camera, and images were processed using the Slide Book software (version 4.2). Figures were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA). Transfected tsA 201 cells were plated in 12-well dishes and analyzed for cell surface expression of α4β2 nAChRs using the methodology described previously (2Ren X.Q. Cheng S.B. Treuil M.W. Mukherjee J. Rao J. Braunewell K.H. Lindstrom J.M. Anand R. Structural determinants of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor trafficking.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6676-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Surface expression was detected with a rat mAb against the β2 nAChR subunit (mAb 295) whose epitope is located in the extracellular domains of the subunit. The nonspecific background binding of antibodies to cells was determined by expressing the β2 nAChR subunit alone. To inhibit palmitoylation, medium was replaced with fresh medium containing either 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP, 120 μm, Sigma) or an equivalent volume of DMSO as a vehicle control on day 4. tsA 201 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA for the β2 nAChR subunit and either WT α4, α4ΔC, α4ΔΔC, or α4C273S subunits. After 48 h at 37 °C, the cells were plated onto 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well, and moved to 30 °C overnight. The cells were washed twice with HEPES buffered Krebs-Saline solution (155 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 6 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), loaded with calcium 5 NW dye (Molecular Devices, Sunnydale, CA), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Fluorescence was measured at 0.7-s intervals for 2 min per well using a fluorescence plate reader (FLEXstation, Molecular Devices) at an excitation of 494 nm and an emission of 525 nm. Fluorescence was recorded for 60 s before stimulation and 60 s after stimulation with various concentrations of epibatidine. Functional responses were quantified by first calculating the net fluorescence change (the difference between control, non-stimulated groups, and agonist-treated groups). Results were expressed as a percentage of maximal agonist group responses. Curve fitting was generated using Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). [3H]Epibatidine binding to α4β2 nAChRs was done directly in wells as described previously (2Ren X.Q. Cheng S.B. Treuil M.W. Mukherjee J. Rao J. Braunewell K.H. Lindstrom J.M. Anand R. Structural determinants of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor trafficking.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6676-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For inhibition experiments, cells were incubated with 400 pm [3H]epibatidine in the presence or absence of 10, 30, 100, 300, or 1000 nm nicotine overnight at 4 °C. The bound epibatidine was eluted in 0.5% SDS, 0.5 m NaOH for 1 h. The eluates were mixed with liquid scintillation fluid, and the amount of radioactivity present was measured in a LS6500 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Background binding was determined using untransfected cells and was subtracted from the amount of radioactivity in eluates. The data shown were normalized to the amount bound in the absence of nicotine. For cell surface binding assays and total protein analyses, the difference between groups was analyzed statistically by paired t test in Excel. For calcium accumulation and ligand binding assays, curves were fitted using Prism 5 software. Half-maximal effective (EC50) values were derived from the sigmoidal dose-response equation, Y = 100/(1 + 10((logEC50 − X)·HS)), and half-maximal inhibitory (IC50) values were derived from the sigmoidal dose-response equation, Y = 100/(1 + 10((logIC50 − X)·HS)), where Y is the percentage of the maximal effect at a given concentration (X), and HS is the Hill slope (HS = 1 was used for these calculations). The Ki values were determined using the one site − fit Ki equation in Prism 5, Y = bottom + (top − bottom)/(1 + 10∧(X − logEC50)), where logEC50 = log(10∧logKi·(1 + radioligandNM/HotKdNM) and radioligandNM = 0.40 nm and HotKdNM = 0.015 nm (17Marks M.J. Smith K.W. Collins A.C. Differential agonist inhibition identifies multiple epibatidine binding sites in mouse brain.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 377-386PubMed Google Scholar). The EC50 and Ki values were compared between the groups by one-way ANOVA. All results were expressed as means ± S.E. To determine the functional roles of cysteines within the α4 nAChR subunit, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace the cysteine residues with serine residues in the α4 nAChR cytoplasmic loops. We made three mutant constructs: α4C273S, in which the single cysteine in the M1-M2 loop was replaced with a serine; α4ΔC, in which all 11 cysteines in the M3-M4 loop were replaced with serines; and α4ΔΔC, in which all 12 cysteines in both loops were replaced with serines (Fig. 1A). Our initial hypothesis was that the M3-M4 loop contained one or more palmitoylation sites, so tsA 201 cells were transiently transfected with N-terminally FLAG-tagged WT α4 or the α4ΔC cysteine mutant nAChR subunits in the absence or presence of the untagged β2 nAChR subunit and metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitate, captured by IP with FLAG M2 beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to film (Fig. 1B). Both the α4 and β2 nAChR subunits were labeled metabolically with [3H]palmitate (Fig. 1B, top autoradiograph, lanes 1 and 2), as observed previously (13Alexander J.K. Govind A.P. Drisdel R.C. Blanton M.P. Vallejo Y. Lam T.T. Green W.N. Palmitoylation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2010; 40: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The α4 nAChR subunits are labeled in the absence or presence of the β2 nAChR subunits (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, cells transfected with the α4ΔC did not incorporate a detectably reduced amount of [3H]palmitate compared with the α4 nAChR subunit, suggesting that none of the cysteines in the M3-M4 loop were palmitoylated (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). One-tenth of the IP eluate was run on a parallel SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for IP capture efficiency with anti-FLAG antibody to detect the α4 nAChR subunit and with anti-C20 antibody to detect the β2 nAChR subunit (Fig. 1B, bottom blots). Because [3H]palmitate incorporation was similar between the WT α4 and the α4ΔC mutant nAChR subunit, the α4, α4ΔC, α4ΔΔC, and α4C273S nAChR subunits were transfected and metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitate. The α4 and α4ΔC nAChR subunits were labeled (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 4), but the α4ΔΔC and the α4C273S mutant did not incorporate [3H]palmitate (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3), indicating that Cys273 is the only cysteine in the α4 nAChR subunit that is palmitoylated. To determine whether [3H]palmitate was linked to the α4 and β2 nAChR subunits by hydroxylamine-sensitive thioester bonds, an IP sample from α4β2 lysate was run in parallel with an IP sample that was treated with hydroxylamine (Fig. 1D). The [3H]palmitate was absent from the sample treated with hydroxylamine, indicating that labeling was due to palmitoylation of cysteine residues. To examine whether cysteine modifications altered α4β2 nAChR trafficking to the cell surface, the β2 subunit was coexpressed with either the WT α4, or with each of the α4 mutants (α4ΔC, α4ΔΔC, α4C273S) and processed for enzyme-linked immunoassay to detect protein expression at the cell surface. The absorbance data were normalized, and the WT α4 nAChR subunit was set to 100.0 ± 13.8%. Compared with the WT α4 nAChR subunit, α4ΔC (183 ± 20.9%, p = 0.0006), α4ΔΔC (206 ± 28.4%, p = 0.001), and α4C273S (120 ± 16.4%, p = 0.006) all significantly increased α4β2 nAChR surface expression (Fig. 2A, n = 6). Parallel plates of tsA 201 cells were transiently transfected with β2 and α4, α4ΔC, α4ΔΔC, or α4C273S nAChR subunits. Samples were lysed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against FLAG (to detect α4), β2, or GAPDH to determine total steady-state protein expression levels. α4 nAChR protein levels were quantified by densitometry from five separate experiments and corrected for GAPDH expression. Data were normalized and WT α4 nAChR was set to 100 ± 30.3%. α4ΔC significantly increases total expression levels compared with α4, (202.1 ± 33.9%, p = 0.02), whereas α4ΔΔC increases protein expression but is not significant (200.6 ± 54.4%, p = 0.11). In contrast, α4C273S expression is decreased significantly (19.3 ± 4.1%, p = 0.04) compared with α4 (n = 5). A representative blot is shown (Fig. 2B). Immunocytochemistry further verified the changes in α4β2 nAChR surface and total protein expression. tsA 201 cells were transfected transiently with the same plasmid combinations used in Fig. 2, A and B, and processed for immunocytochemistry. Single plane images were collected using identical settings. Cells were fixed and processed with or without permeabilization to qualitatively examine total or cell surface expression, respectively. The expression patterns observed by immunocytochemistry were comparable with those observed by cell surface and Western assays. All three of the mutants appeared to have increased surface immunostaining intensities when compared with the wt α4β2 nAChR (Fig. 2C, top panels). When cells were fixed and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and imaged to detect total α4β2 nAChR expression, α4ΔC had increased staining intensity, α4ΔΔC had comparable intensity, and α4C273S had decreased total intensity compared with WT α4 (Fig. 2C, bottom panels). Taken together, these data show that mutating the cysteines in the M3-M4 loop increase both total and cell surface expression, whereas mutating the cysteine in the M1-M2 loop decreases total protein expression but increases surface expression compared with WT α4β2 nAChR levels. The α4 nAChR subunit is palmitoylated in the M1-M2 loop, and this mutation decreases total protein expression while increasing surface protein expression. To address whether receptor depalmitoylation could stabilize the α4β2 nAChR at the cell surface, we blocked palmitoylation in cells transiently transfected with the β2 subunit and either the WT α4, α4ΔC, α4ΔΔC, or α4C273S. We examined cell surface expression using the immunoassay described in Fig. 2A in the absence or presence of 2-BP, a general palmitoylation inhibitor (Fig. 3A). The cell surface expression levels of vehicle (DMSO)-treated samples were set to 100%, and expression ratios for the 2-BP-treated samples were determined by dividing the absorbance values of the 2-BP-treated samples by the absorbance values of the DMSO-treated samples (WT α4β2, 23.9 ± 4.5%; α4ΔC, 35.2 ± 3.5%; α4ΔΔC, 54.6 ± 1.4%; α4C273S, 45.4 ± 2.4%, n = 3 (Fig. 3A)). The ratios were subtracted from 100% to determine the percent decrease in surface expression. All of the constructs decreased after treatment with 2-BP. Wild-type α4β2 decreased by 76.1 ± 4.5%, α4ΔC by 64.8 ± 3.5%, α4ΔΔC by 45.4 ± 1.4%, and α4C273S by 54.6 ± 2.4%. If palmitoylation of α4 was the only variable in the experiment with 2-BP and if α4C"
https://openalex.org/W2008112712,"The master circadian clock in mammals is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and is synchronized by several environmental stimuli, mainly the light-dark (LD) cycle. Light pulses in the late subjective night induce phase advances in locomotor circadian rhythms and the expression of clock genes (such as Per1-2). The mechanism responsible for light-induced phase advances involves the activation of guanylyl cyclase (GC), cGMP and its related protein kinase (PKG). Pharmacological manipulation of cGMP by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition (e.g., sildenafil) increases low-intensity light-induced circadian responses, which could reflect the ability of the cGMP-dependent pathway to directly affect the photic sensitivity of the master circadian clock within the SCN. Indeed, sildenafil is also able to increase the phase-shifting effect of saturating (1200 lux) light pulses leading to phase advances of about 9 hours, as well as in C57 a mouse strain that shows reduced phase advances. In addition, sildenafil was effective in both male and female hamsters, as well as after oral administration. Other PDE inhibitors (such as vardenafil and tadalafil) also increased light-induced phase advances of locomotor activity rhythms and accelerated reentrainment after a phase advance in the LD cycle. Pharmacological inhibition of the main downstream target of cGMP, PKG, blocked light-induced expression of Per1. Our results indicate that the cGMP-dependent pathway can directly modulate the light-induced expression of clock-genes within the SCN and the magnitude of light-induced phase advances of overt rhythms, and provide promising tools to design treatments for human circadian disruptions."
https://openalex.org/W2076525877,"Aquaglyceroporins are transmembrane proteins belonging to the family of aquaporins, which facilitate the passage of specific uncharged solutes across membranes of cells. The yeast aquaglyceroporin Fps1 is important for osmoadaptation by regulating intracellular glycerol levels during changes in external osmolarity. Upon high osmolarity conditions, yeast accumulates glycerol by increased production of the osmolyte and by restricting glycerol efflux through Fps1. The extended cytosolic termini of Fps1 contain short domains that are important for regulating glycerol flux through the channel. Here we show that the transmembrane core of the protein plays an equally important role. The evidence is based on results from an intragenic suppressor mutation screen and domain swapping between the regulated variant of Fps1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the hyperactive Fps1 ortholog from Ashbya gossypii. This suggests a novel mechanism for regulation of glycerol flux in yeast, where the termini alone are not sufficient to restrict Fps1 transport. We propose that glycerol flux through the channel is regulated by interplay between the transmembrane helices and the termini. This mechanism enables yeast cells to fine-tune intracellular glycerol levels at a wide range of extracellular osmolarities."
https://openalex.org/W1984798065,"The gamma-secretase complex is involved in the intramembranous proteolysis of a variety of substrates, including the amyloid precursor protein and the Notch receptor. Nicastrin (NCT) is an essential component of the gamma-secretase complex and functions as a receptor for gamma-secretase substrates. In this study, we determined that serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1) markedly reduced the protein stability of NCT. The SGK1 kinase activity was decisive for NCT degradation and endogenous SGK1 inhibited gamma-secretase activity. SGK1 downregulates NCT protein levels via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Furthermore, SGK1 directly bound to and phosphorylated NCT on Ser437, thereby promoting protein degradation. Collectively, our findings indicate that SGK1 is a gamma-secretase regulator presumably effective through phosphorylation and degradation of NCT."
https://openalex.org/W2037461990,"Background Blood vessels in tumors express higher level of aminopeptidase N (APN) than normal tissues. Evidence suggests that the CNGRC motif is an APN ligand which targets tumor vasculature. Increased expression of APN in tumor vascular endothelium, therefore, offers an opportunity for targeted delivery of NGR peptide-linked drugs to tumors. Methods/Principal Findings To determine whether an additional cyclic CNGRC sequence could improve endothelial cell homing and antitumor effect, human plasminogen kringle 5 (hPK5) was modified genetically to introduce a CNGRC motif (NGR-hPK5) and was subsequently expressed in yeast. The biological activity of NGR-hPK5 was assessed and compared with that of wild-type hPK5, in vitro and in vivo. NGR-hPK5 showed more potent antiangiogenic activity than wild-type hPK5: the former had a stronger inhibitory effect on proliferation, migration and cord formation of vascular endothelial cells, and produced a stronger antiangiogenic response in the CAM assay. To evaluate the tumor-targeting ability, both wild-type hPK5 and NGR-hPK5 were 99 mTc-labeled, for tracking biodistribution in the in vivo tumor model. By planar imaging and biodistribution analyses of major organs, NGR-hPK5 was found localized to tumor tissues at a higher level than wild-type hPK5 (approximately 3-fold). Finally, the effects of wild-type hPK5 and NGR-modified hPK5 on tumor growth were investigated in two tumor model systems. NGR modification improved tumor localization and, as a consequence, effectively inhibited the growth of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (Colo 205) cells in tumor-bearing mice.

The IIAChb-HPr complex completes the structure elucidation of representative cytoplasmic complexes for all four sugar branches of the bacterial phosphoryl transfer system (PTS). The active site His-89 of IIAChb was mutated to Glu to mimic the phosphorylated state. IIAChb(H89E) and HPr form a weak complex with a KD of ∼0.7 mm. The interacting binding surfaces, concave for IIAChb and convex for HPr, complement each other in terms of shape, residue type, and charge distribution, with predominantly hydrophobic residues, interspersed by some uncharged polar residues, located centrally, and polar and charged residues at the periphery. The active site histidine of HPr, His-15, is buried within the active site cleft of IIAChb formed at the interface of two adjacent subunits of the IIAChb trimer, thereby coming into close proximity with the active site residue, H89E, of IIAChb. A His89-P-His-15 pentacoordinate phosphoryl transition state can readily be modeled without necessitating any significant conformational changes, thereby facilitating rapid phosphoryl transfer. Comparison of the IIAChb-HPr complex with the IIAChb-IIBChb complex, as well as with other cytoplasmic complexes of the PTS, highlights a unifying mechanism for recognition of structurally diverse partners.

The first component of the PTS, enzyme I, is autophoshorylated by phosphoenolpyruvate and subsequently transfers the phosphoryl group to the histidine phosphocarrier protein (HPr). HPr then transfers the phosphoryl group to the A domain of the sugar-specific enzymes II, which are divided into four structurally distinct families corresponding to the glucose, mannose, mannitol, and lactose/chitobiose branches of the PTS. All enzymes II have similar organizations comprising A and B cytoplasmic domains, and a membrane bound sugar transporter comprising the C domain, and sometimes a D domain as well. In some instances the domains are expressed as a contiguous protein, in others as separate proteins. From IIA, the phosphoryl group is transferred to IIB, and finally onto the incoming sugar molecule bound to the transmembrane IIC domain. Despite the similar domain organization of the enzymes II, the A and B cytoplasmic domains from the different branches of the PTS bear no sequence similarity to one another, and with the exception of IIBMtl (7Legler P.M.

All NMR samples were prepared in a buffer of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm sodium azide, and either 90% H2O/10% D2O or 99.99% D2O. IIAChb* is a symmetric trimer with 3 eq binding sites for HPr. As in the case of the IIAChb*(H89E)-IIBChb(C10S) complex (43Jung Y.S. Cai M. Clore G.M.

NMR spectra were recorded at 20 and 35 °C on Bruker DMX500, DMX600, DRX600, DRX800, and DRX900 spectrometers equipped with z-shielded gradient triple resonance cryoprobes. Spectra were processed with the NMRPipe package (49Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe. A multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J. Biomol.

https://openalex.org/W2144844901,"G-protein-coupled receptors with dissociable agonists for thyrotropin, parathyroid hormone, and sphingosine-1-phosphate were found to signal persistently hours after agonist withdrawal. Here we show that mouse thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors, subtypes 2 and 1(TRH-R2 and TRH-R1), can signal persistently in HEK-EM293 cells under appropriate conditions, but TRH-R2 exhibits higher persistent signaling activity. Both receptors couple primarily to Gα(q/11). To gain insight into the mechanism of persistent signaling, we compared proximal steps of inositolmonophosphate (IP1) signaling by TRH-Rs. Persistent signaling was not caused by slower dissociation of TRH from TRH-R2 (t(1/2)=77 ± 8.1 min) compared with TRH-R1 (t(1/2)=82 ± 12 min) and was independent of internalization, as inhibition of internalization did not affect persistent signaling (115% of control), but required continuously activated receptors, as an inverse agonist decreased persistent signaling by 60%. Gα(q/11) knockdown decreased persistent signaling by TRH-R2 by 82%, and overexpression of Gα(q/11) induced persistent signaling in cells expressing TRH-R1. Lastly, persistent signaling was induced in cells expressing high levels of TRH-R1. We suggest that persistent signaling by TRHRs is exhibited when sufficient levels of agonist/receptor/G-protein complexes are established and maintained and that TRH-R2 forms and maintains these complexes more efficiently than TRH-R1."
