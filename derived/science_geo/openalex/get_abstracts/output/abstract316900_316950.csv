https://openalex.org/W2067885793,"Rarefaction analysis of extinctions in the Late Permian indicates that as many as 96 percent of all marine species may have died out, thus forcing the marine biosphere to pass through a small bottleneck. With such severity of extinction, chance elimination of certain biologic groups would have been probable. Some of the changes in biologic composition observed at the Permo-Triassic boundary may be explained as an evolutionary founder effect that followed the bottleneck."
https://openalex.org/W2037987914,The floor of the Gulf of Elat consists of five distinct deeps. Its structure is controlled by faulting which has produced rhomb-shaped grabens. The gulf is a newly formed plate boundary between Arabia and Sinai.

Some community response to irregular storm events is observed. However, the gross plankton community dynamics on this shelf are dominated by couplings with the local estuaries and shallow nearshore zone."
https://openalex.org/W1987363489,"The magnesium isotopic composition of some extraterrestrial dust particles has been measured. The particles are believed to be samples of interplanetary dust, a significant fraction of which originated from the disaggregation of comets and may contain preserved isotopic anomalies. Improvements in mass spectrometric and sample preparation techniques have made it possible to measure the magnesium isotopic composition of the dust particles, which are typically 10 micrometers in size and contain on the order of 10(-10) gram of magnesium. Of the 13 samples analyzed, nine have the terrestrial magnesium isotopic composition within 2 parts per thousand, and one shows isotopic mass fractionation of 1.1 percent per mass unit. A subset of the particles, described as chondritic aggregates, are very close to normal isotopic composition, but their normalized isotopic ratios appear to show nonlinear effects of 3 to 4 parts per thousand, which is near the present limit of detection for samples of this size. The isotopic composition of calcium was also determined in one particle and found to be normal within 2 percent. It is clear that the isotopic composition of interplanetary dust particles can be determined with good precision. Collection of dust particles during the earth's passage through a comet tail or an intense meteor stream may permit laboratory analysis of material from a known comet."
https://openalex.org/W2019452462,"A new synchrotron radiation laboratory, CHESS, will soon be completed at Cornell University. The facility will operate in a mode parasitic to high energy physics experiments on the new 8-billion-electron-volt electron-positron storage ring (CESR) at Cornell. Electron and positron beams have already been stored and the first photons have been extracted. When completed, the laboratory will be available to the scientific community nationally and will provide the most intense tunable source of high energy x-rays in the country."
https://openalex.org/W2092345970,"Synchrotron radiation sources, providing intense, tunable, polarized, and stable beams of ultraviolet and x-ray photons, are having a great impact on biology, physics, chemistry, materials science, and other areas of research. Synchrotron radiation has revolutionized solid-state photoelectron spectroscopy by enhancing its capabilities for investigating the electronic behavior of solids and solid surfaces. Several fundamental photoemission techniques that rely on synchrotron radiation are discussed in this article. These techniques have an adjustable tunable surface sensitivity and provide the first direct mapping of the electronic band structure. Recent applications of photoelectron spectroscopy for studies of chemisorption geometries and surface structures are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1992123834,"The transmission electron energy-loss spectrum shows characteristic ""edges"" corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of atoms in a thin sample. Analysis of these edges provides detailed chemical, structural, and electronic data from the radiated volume. By combining electron spectroscopy and electron microscopy, this microanalytical technique can be performed in conjunction with highresolution imaging of the sample. It is shown that this approach has advantages of sensitivity, spatial resolution, and convenience over other comparable techniques."
https://openalex.org/W1980516756,"In the last two decades large radars have proved to be powerful instruments for the measurement of the properties of the upper atmosphere. These radars were used initially to measure properties of the ionosphere by the Thomson scattering technique at heights above 100 kilometers. Careful interpretation of the power and spectrum of radar echoes yielded data on electron and ion densities and temperatures as well as on bulk motion of the ionospheric plasma, all as functions of height and time. More recent developments have made it possible to measure wind speeds and the structure of turbulence in the stratosphere and mesosphere at altitudes below 100 kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W4231438259,"Nondestructive evaluation is a technique for determining the presence, type, and size of flaws in mechanical structures without destroying them. A description of various types of nondestructive evaluation methods is given in this article. Particular attention is paid to acoustic wave probing techniques. Major advances have been made in the development of the theory of acoustic wave scattering from flaws and in the development of methods for determining the nature of a flaw from the variation of the scattered acoustic wave amplitude with frequency and angle. Several new types of acoustic imaging methods have been developed; prime examples are the acoustic microscope and electronically focused and scanned acoustic wave imaging systems. New acoustic measurement techniques for determining the fields in materials and predicting their breaking stress are discussed, as is the development of new types of eddy current techniques and electromagnetic transducers."
https://openalex.org/W2015382563,"Increased performance requirements for modern optical systems have necessitated the development of more precise optical testing techniques. The need for accurate and rapid measurements is being met by the use of laser interferometers, microprocessors to gather test data, and computers to analyze the data and remove errors in the test equipment."
