https://openalex.org/W2049370143,"During some 3 months of orbital operations, Seasat collected a unique set of global synoptic data on ocean winds, waves, temperature, and topography. All indications from a preliminary analysis of these data are that most of the mission's proof-of-concept objective-the demonstration of nearly all-weather microwave surveillance of the world's oceans-will be met."
https://openalex.org/W1994248284,"Photosynthetic purple bacteria can grow with dinitrogen gas as the sole nitrogen source under anaerobic conditions with light as the energy source. The bacterium Rhodopseudomonas capsulata can fix nitrogen in darkness with alternative energy conversion systems, namely, anaerobic sugar fermentation and aerobic respiration at low oxygen tension. Although growth on dinitrogen is optimal under photosynthetic conditions, the results show that reduction of dinitrogen is not obligatorily coupled to activity of the photosynthetic apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1967411530,"A preliminary assessment has been made of the capability of the Seasat synthetic aperture radar to detect ocean waves. Comparison with surface and aircraft measurements from five passes of the satellite over the Gulf of Alaska indicates agreement to within about - 15 percent in wavelength and about +/- 25 degrees in wave direction. These results apply to waves 100 to 250 meters in length propagating in a direction predominantly across the satellite track, in sea states with significant wave height (H((1/3))) in a range of 2 to 3.5 meters."
https://openalex.org/W2040788836,"The scanning multichannel microwave radiometer results for the Gulf of Alaska Seasat Experiment Workshop are quite encouraging, especially in view of the immaturity of the data-processing algorithms. For open ocean, rain-free cells of highest-quality surface truth wind determinations exhibit standard deviations of 3 meters per second about a bias of 1.5 meters per second. The sea-surface temperature shows a standard deviation of approximately 1.5 degrees C about a bias of 3 degrees to 5 degrees C under a variety of changing meteorological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1990032197,"The Seasat microwave scatterometer was designed to measure, globally and in nearly all weather, wind speed to an accuracy of ± 2 meters per second and wind direction to ± 20° in two swaths 500 kilometers wide on either side of the spacecraft. For two operating modes in rain-free conditions, a limited number of comparisons to high-quality surface truth indicates that these specifications may have been met."
https://openalex.org/W2040823924,"Preliminary analysis of radar altimeter data indicates that the instrument has met its specifications for measuring spacecraft height above the ocean surface (+/- 10 centimeters) and significant wave height (+/- 0.5 meter). There is ample evidence that the radar altimeter, having undergone development through three earth orbit missions [Skylab, Geodynamics Experimental Ocean Satellite 3 (GEOS-3), and Seasat], has reached a level of precision that now makes possible its use for important quantitative oceanographic investigations and practical applications."
https://openalex.org/W1996704268,"Earth-based radar images at a resolution of 10 kilometers show a diverse surface terrain on Venus, probably produced by both impact events and tectonic activity. Only a small number of craters of apparent impact origin are seen. Large-scale features show lineaments and parallel ridges suggesting tectonic origins."
https://openalex.org/W2058661505,The surface observations used in the initial assessment of Seasat are discussed with emphasis on their ability to describe the synoptic-scale winds over the ocean.

https://openalex.org/W2092764420,"The Seasat low-rate data system is a distributed, nonreal-time, magnetic-tape system for information processing. Its function is to apply the necessary calibrations, corrections, and conversions to yield geophysically meaningful products from raw spacecraft telemetry data. It also provides a remotely accessible catalog of satellite data."
https://openalex.org/W1965078666,"Visual and infrared images produced by the Seasat visible and infrared radiometer (VIRR) are adequate for the identification of cloud, land, and water features. A statistical comparison of VIRR-derived sea-surface temperatures in a cloud-free region with a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration analysis based on various surface measurements taken in the same region showed agreement to +/- 1.7 degrees K root-mean-square."
