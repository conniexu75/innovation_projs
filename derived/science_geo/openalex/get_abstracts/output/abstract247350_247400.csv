https://openalex.org/W2217809488,"Inherited genetic variation has a critical but as yet largely uncharacterized role in human disease. Here we report a public database of common variation in the human genome: more than one million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which accurate and complete genotypes have been obtained in 269 DNA samples from four populations, including ten 500-kilobase regions in which essentially all information about common DNA variation has been extracted. These data document the generality of recombination hotspots, a block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium and low haplotype diversity, leading to substantial correlations of SNPs with many of their neighbours. We show how the HapMap resource can guide the design and analysis of genetic association studies, shed light on structural variation and recombination, and identify loci that may have been subject to natural selection during human evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2121158863,"Recurrent chromosomal rearrangements have not been well characterized in common carcinomas. We used a bioinformatics approach to discover candidate oncogenic chromosomal aberrations on the basis of outlier gene expression. Two ETS transcription factors, ERG and ETV1 , were identified as outliers in prostate cancer. We identified recurrent gene fusions of the 5′ untranslated region of TMPRSS2 to ERG or ETV1 in prostate cancer tissues with outlier expression. By using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we demonstrated that 23 of 29 prostate cancer samples harbor rearrangements in ERG or ETV1 . Cell line experiments suggest that the androgen-responsive promoter elements of TMPRSS2 mediate the overexpression of ETS family members in prostate cancer. These results have implications in the development of carcinomas and the molecular diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2152369329,"Global change will alter the supply of ecosystem services that are vital for human well-being. To investigate ecosystem service supply during the 21st century, we used a range of ecosystem models and scenarios of climate and land-use change to conduct a Europe-wide assessment. Large changes in climate and land use typically resulted in large changes in ecosystem service supply. Some of these trends may be positive (for example, increases in forest area and productivity) or offer opportunities (for example, “surplus land” for agricultural extensification and bioenergy production). However, many changes increase vulnerability as a result of a decreasing supply of ecosystem services (for example, declining soil fertility, declining water availability, increasing risk of forest fires), especially in the Mediterranean and mountain regions."
https://openalex.org/W1981415589,"Hypothalamic neurons that express neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) are thought to be critical regulators of feeding behavior and body weight. To determine whether NPY/AgRP neurons are essential in mice, we targeted the human diphtheria toxin receptor to the Agrp locus, which allows temporally controlled ablation of NPY/AgRP neurons to occur after an injection of diphtheria toxin. Neonatal ablation of NPY/AgRP neurons had minimal effects on feeding, whereas their ablation in adults caused rapid starvation. These results suggest that network-based compensatory mechanisms can develop after the ablation of NPY/AgRP neurons in neonates but do not readily occur when these neurons become essential in adults."

https://openalex.org/W2105785737,"The 26 December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami had major effects on coastal communities and ecosystems. An assessment of coastlines after the tsunami indicates that coastal vegetation such as mangroves and beach forests helped to provide protection and reduce effects on adjacent communities. In recent years, mangroves and other coastal vegetation have been cleared or degraded along many coastlines, increasing their vulnerability to storm and tsunami damage. Establishing or strengthening greenbelts of mangroves and other coastal forests may play a key role in reducing the effect of future extreme events."
https://openalex.org/W2083250868,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) induces weight loss in obese rodents and humans, and for reasons that are not understood, its effects persist after the cessation of treatment. Here we demonstrate that centrally administered CNTF induces cell proliferation in feeding centers of the murine hypothalamus. Many of the newborn cells express neuronal markers and show functional phenotypes relevant for energy-balance control, including a capacity for leptin-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Coadministration of the mitotic blocker cytosine-β- d -arabinofuranoside (Ara-C) eliminates the proliferation of neural cells and abrogates the long-term, but not the short-term, effect of CNTF on body weight. These findings link the sustained effect of CNTF on energy balance to hypothalamic neurogenesis and suggest that regulated hypothalamic neurogenesis in adult mice may play a previously unappreciated role in physiology and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2019228627,"Many pathogenic bacteria use injectisomes to deliver effector proteins into host cells through type III secretion. Injectisomes consist of a basal body embedded in the bacterial membranes and a needle. In Yersinia , translocation of effectors requires the YopB and YopD proteins, which form a pore in the target cell membrane, and the LcrV protein, which assists the assembly of the pore. Here we report that LcrV forms a distinct structure at the tip of the needle, the tip complex. This unique localization of LcrV may explain its crucial role in the translocation process and its efficacy as the main protective antigen against plague."
https://openalex.org/W2042921846,"We found that platelet depletion reduces intrahepatic accumulation of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and organ damage in mouse models of acute viral hepatitis. Transfusion of normal but not activation-blocked platelets in platelet-depleted mice restored accumulation of CTLs and severity of disease. In contrast, anticoagulant treatment that prevented intrahepatic fibrin deposition without reducing platelet counts did not avert liver injury. Thus, activated platelets contribute to CTL-mediated liver immunopathology independently of procoagulant function."

https://openalex.org/W1982018391,"Thiolate-ligated oxoiron(IV) centers are postulated to be the key oxidants in the catalytic cycles of oxygen-activating cytochrome P450 and related enzymes. Despite considerable synthetic efforts, chemists have not succeeded in preparing an appropriate model complex. Here we report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of [Fe IV (O)(TMCS)] + where TMCS is a pentadentate ligand that provides a square pyramidal N 4 (SR) apical , where SR is thiolate, ligand environment about the iron center, which is similar to that of cytochrome P450. The rigidity of the ligand framework stabilizes the thiolate in an oxidizing environment. Reactivity studies suggest that thiolate coordination favors hydrogen-atom abstraction chemistry over oxygen-atom transfer pathways in the presence of reducing substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2122370648,"The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of proteins controls the formation and growth of blood vessels. The most potent and widely expressed isoform, VEGF165, is secreted as a disulfide-linked homodimer with two identical heparin-binding sites. Interactions with heparan sulfate (HS) regulate the diffusion, half-life, and affinity of VEGF165 for its signaling receptors. We have determined a number of key HS structural features that mediate the specific binding of the VEGF165 dimer. Carboxylate groups and 2-O-, 6-O-, and N-sulfation of HS contributed to the strength of the VEGF165 interaction; however, 6-O-sulfates appeared to be particularly important. Cleavage of HS by heparinase, heparitinase, or heparanase severely reduced VEGF165 binding. In contrast, K5 lyase-cleaved HS retained significant VEGF165 affinity, suggesting that binding sites for the growth factor are present within extended stretches of sulfation. Binding studies and molecular modeling demonstrated that an oligosaccharide 6 or 7 residues long was sufficient to fully occupy the heparin-binding site of a VEGF165 monomer. The data presented are consistent with a model whereby the two heparin-binding sites of the VEGF165 dimer interact simultaneously with highly sulfated S-domain regions of the HS chain that can be linked through a stretch of transition sequence.

In the embryo, VEGF directs the differentiation and assembly of endothelial precursor cells into a primitive vascular plexus (vasculogenesis) (1Ruhrberg C. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1052-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Under the influence of VEGF, a process of sprouting growth (angiogenesis) then occurs in which the endothelial cells branch out and are remodeled into a complex network of veins, arteries, and capillaries. In adults, the vasculature is largely quiescent; however, in certain tissues, angiogenesis can be induced by VEGF, e.g. during wound healing and the female reproductive cycle (2Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7868) Google Scholar). VEGF has also been implicated in a number of pathological conditions that are driven by inappropriate or excessive angiogenesis, such as diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, and the growth of solid tumors (3Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7476) Google Scholar). vascular endothelial growth factor heparin-binding domains heparan sulfate heparan sulfate proteoglycans fibroblast growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor receptors glycosaminoglycan degrees of polymerization (number of monosaccharide units) strong anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography filter binding assays NIH 3T3 fibroblast heparan sulfate porcine mucosal heparan sulfate bovine aortic endothelial heparan sulfate. A single VEGF gene gives rise to a number of VEGF isoforms through alternate mRNA splicing (4Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). The VEGF isoforms differ by the presence or absence of short C-terminal heparin-binding domains (HBDs) encoded by exons 6 and 7 of the VEGF gene (4Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, 5Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These domains mediate interactions with heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (HSPGs) and with neuropilin coreceptors (6Robinson C.J. Stringer S.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 853-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the most commonly observed isoforms, VEGF121 is not a heparin-binding protein, whereas VEGF189 is sequestered in the extracellular matrix in an essentially inactive folded state (7Plouet J. Moro F. Bertagnolli S. Coldeboeuf N. Mazarguil H. Clamens S. Bayard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13390-13396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Enzymatic processing of VEGF189 generates an active form (VEGF110) that lacks the HBDs (7Plouet J. Moro F. Bertagnolli S. Coldeboeuf N. Mazarguil H. Clamens S. Bayard F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13390-13396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This leaves VEGF165 as the most widespread and abundantly expressed splice variant that interacts with HSPGs and neuropilins in a biologically active form. HSPGs are expressed throughout the body on the surface of cells and in the extracellular matrix, where they influence a whole range of cellular activities through their widespread protein interactions (8Iozzo R.V. San Antonio J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). HSPGs consist of a protein core upon which several HS polysaccharide chains can be covalently attached. The diffusion, half-life, and bioavailability of protein ligands can all be affected by interactions with the highly sulfated HS chains. However, one of the most intriguing properties of HS is its ability to facilitate protein-protein interactions (9Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). HS chains are synthesized as linear repeating polymers of β-d-glucuronate and α-d-N-acetylglucosamine ((GlcUA-GlcNAc)n), typically 50-200 disaccharides in length (10Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). During chain elongation, N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase enzymes act on discrete regions of this heparan precursor, replacing N-acetyl groups with N-sulfates (11Kjellen L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Regions of N-sulfation then act as the substrate for a variety of enzymes that catalyze additional modification steps, most commonly the epimerization of GlcUA to α-l-iduronate (IdoUA), 2-O-sulfation (2S) of IdoUA residues, and 6-O-sulfation (6S) of GlcNAc/α-D-N-sulfoglucosamine (GlcNS) (12Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). However, each enzyme involved acts upon only a fraction of its available substrate sites, thereby creating a domain structure within HS and a significant degree of heterogeneity between HS chains. The current model for the domain organization of HS suggests that sulfated and unmodified regions of roughly equal length (14-18 disaccharides) alternate in a relatively uniform pattern along the HS chain (13Murphy K.J. Merry C.L. Lyon M. Thompson J.E. Roberts I.S. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Within the sulfated domains are regions of contiguous IdoUA(2S)-GlcNS disaccharides (S-domains, two to eight disaccharides in length) with varying patterns of 6-O-sulfation (14Merry C.L. Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18455-18462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Flanking these S-domains are transition regions that consist of alternating N-sulfated and N-acetylated disaccharides in which the levels and patterns of O-sulfation and epimerization are highly variable (15Winterbourne D.J. Mora P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4310-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The complex structure of HS is the key to its function, as different patterns of sulfation create binding sites for specific protein ligands. Antithrombin III is an example of a protein with very stringent HS binding requirements. The antithrombin III binding site has been identified as a pentasaccharide sequence that encompasses a relatively rare 3-O-sulfate group (17Lindahl U. Thunberg L. Backstrom G. Riesenfeld J. Nordling K. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12368-12376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 binds to short sulfated sequences within HS that are high in N- and 2-O-sulfation (18Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 19Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, activation of FGF2 requires the presence of one or more critically positioned 6-O-sulfate groups (21Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Multimeric proteins such as the chemokine interferon-γ (22Lortat-Jacob H. Turnbull J.E. Grimaud J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) can interact with HS multivalently through several heparin-binding sites. Such interactions are often less dependent on particular primary sequence requirements than on the overall domain organization and conformational aspects of HS structure. Additional studies of HS biosynthesis and structure will help us to appreciate how HS chains from different sources selectively bind protein ligands and control their function. Heparin and HS have profound effects on VEGF165 function; however, the interpretation of these effects is made difficult by the fact that the neuropilins and VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) are also heparin-binding proteins (23Mamluk R. Gechtman Z. Kutcher M.E. Gasiunas N. Gallagher J. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24818-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Park M. Lee S.T. Biochem.

Linhardt R.J. Kaplan J. Terman B.I. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). VEGF165 binding to VEGFR1 is dependent on cellular HSPGs; exogenous heparin/HS cannot fully compensate for the loss of cell-surface HS, suggesting that HSPGs play a role in VEGF165 presentation (26Terman B. Khandke L. Dougher-Vermazan M. Maglione D. Lassam N.J. Gospodarowicz D. Persico M.G. Bohlen P. Eisinger M. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Cohen T.

VEGF165 can bind VEGFR2 in the absence of HS, but this interaction is enhanced by cellular or exogenous heparin/HS (26Terman B. Khandke L. Dougher-Vermazan M. Maglione D. Lassam N.J. Gospodarowicz D. Persico M.G. Bohlen P. Eisinger M. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Gitay-Goren H. Cohen T. Tessler S. Soker S. Gengrinovitch S. Rockwell P. Klagsbrun M. Levi B.Z. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5519-5523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This effect may be due to the formation of VEGF165•VEGFR2•HS ternary complexes because VEGFR2 binding to heparin is promoted by VEGF165 (29Hamma-Kourbali Y. Vassy R. Starzec A. Le Meuth-Metzinger V. Oudar O. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Perret G. Crepin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39748-39754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Heparin/HS also facilitates VEGF165 interactions with the neuropilin coreceptors, which promote activation of VEGFR2 (23Mamluk R. Gechtman Z. Kutcher M.E. Gasiunas N. Gallagher J. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24818-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30Fuh G. Garcia K.C. de Vos A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18040-18045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In addition to their effects on modulating receptor interactions, heparin/HS interactions have wider implications in VEGF function. The different affinities of the VEGF isoforms for HSPGs lead to the establishment of a concentration gradient that guides vascular growth and branching (32Ruhrberg C. Gerhardt H. Golding M. Watson R. Ioannidou S. Fujisawa H. Betsholtz C. Shima D.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2684-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). HS interactions also prolong VEGF activity by sequestration away from natural degradatory pathways and by restoring lost function following damage under oxidative conditions (33Gengrinovitch S. Berman B. David G. Witte L. Neufeld G. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10816-10822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Previous studies on the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding properties of VEGF165 have been biased toward the use of heparin; however, because of its abundance, HS will be the major GAG species encountered by VEGF165 in vivo. Therefore, we studied the VEGF165-HS interaction, with the aim of elucidating the structural features within HS that contribute to the specific recognition of VEGF165. Materials—Recombinant VEGF165 and VEGF121 were kindly provided by the Protein Science Department of ImClone Systems Inc. (New York, NY). Human platelet extract and K5 lyase were provided by Dr. P. Brenchley and Prof. I. Roberts (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK), respectively. Fibroblast HS samples were purified from wild-type and HS2ST-/- mouse embryos by Dr. C. Merry (34Merry C.L.

Porcine mucosal HS was generously donated by Organon (Oss, The Netherlands). N-Desulfated HS, 2-O-desulfated HS, and selectively 6-O-desulfated HS were prepared from the porcine mucosal HS as described previously (35Lyon M. Rushton G. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Gallagher J.T.

Bovine lung heparin, shark cartilage chondroitin sulfate (>90% chondroitin 6-sulfate), bovine mucosal dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin ABC lyase (Proteus vulgaris; EC 4.2.2.4) were from Sigma (Poole, UK). Heparinase I (Flavobacterium heparinum; heparin lyase, EC 4.2.2.7), heparinase II (F. heparinum; no EC number assigned), and heparinase III (F. heparinum; heparin-sulfate lyase, EC 4.2.2.8) were purchased from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK). Chondroitin ACI lyase (F. heparinum; EC 4.2.2.5) was from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Lyophilized Pronase (Streptomyces griseus) was from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). Cell media and donor calf serum were from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). d-[6-3H]Glucosamine hydrochloride (20-45 Ci/mol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Stevenage, UK). Cellulose nitrate filters (25-mm diameter, 0.2-μm pore size) were from Sartorius (Göttingen, Germany). Blue dextran 2000, Sepharose CL-6B, DEAE-Sephacel, and Sepharose PD-10 columns were from Amersham Biosciences (Little Chalfont, Bucking-hamshire, UK). Bio-Gel P-10 (fine grade) was from Bio-Rad (Hemel Hempstead, UK). The ProPac PA1 HPLC column was from Dionex (Camberley, UK). All other reagents were purchased from BDH-Merck Ltd. (Lutterworth, UK). Preparation of Metabolically Radiolabeled HS—Murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. GAGs were radiolabeled by incubating near-confluent cells for 24 h with medium containing 10 μCi/ml d-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride. [3H]HS was purified from these cells as described previously (37Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells and media were pooled and treated with Pronase, and GAGs were recovered by DEAE-Sephacel anion-exchange chromatography. Hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate were removed by chondroitin ABC lyase treatment. To remove residual core protein fragments, HS chains were incubated overnight with 1 m NaBH4 in 50 mm NaOH at room temperature. Samples were then neutralized using acetic acid and desalted on a Sepharose PD-10 column. Filter Binding Assay—A modified version of the technique described by Maccarana and Lindahl (38Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was used to study the affinity of various GAG species for VEGF165 and other proteins. 3H-Radiolabeled GAG samples and growth factors were incubated, along with any nonradioactive competitor GAG species, in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.3) containing 0.13 m NaCl or in the absence of added NaCl. Incubations were typically left for 2 h at room temperature. Following incubation, samples were made up to 300 μl with the incubation buffer and drawn through buffer-equilibrated cellulose nitrate filters held on a 12-well vacuum-assisted manifold filtration apparatus (Millipore Corp.). Proteins and protein•GAG complexes were adsorbed onto the filters. The filters were then washed with 2 × 5 ml of incubation buffer to elute unbound saccharides. The bound fraction either was eluted by washing filters with 2 m NaCl or was step-eluted using Tris buffers of progressively higher salt concentrations. Radiolabeled species were quantified by scintillation counting or desalted on a Sepharose PD-10 column for further analysis. All GAG samples were desalted on a Sepharose PD-10 column prior to use in filter binding assays. Specific Degradation and Modification of HS Samples—Deaminative cleavage of HS by low pH nitrous acid treatment (followed by neutralization with 2 m NaHCO3) was performed as described by Shively and Conrad (39Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Digestion of HS by heparinase I, II, or III was carried out in heparinase buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm CaAc2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.0)). Typically, aliquots of each enzyme were added to a concentration of 100 mIU/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 8 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, second aliquots of each enzyme were added, and the digestion was left for an additional 16 h at room temperature. HS samples were also degraded by K5 lyase (13Murphy K.J. Merry C.L.

Forster M.J. Mulloy B. Bishop C.R. Graham G.J. Gallagher J.T. Blood. 2002; 100: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HS samples were carboxyl-reduced essentially according to the method of Taylor and Conrad (41Taylor R.L. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500-kdpm samples of [3H]HS were incubated with 0.2 g of N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride in 300 μl of distilled H2O (pH 4.75) for 1 h at room temperature. The activated HS samples were then reduced by the addition of 300 μl of 3 m NaBH4 for 2 h at 50°C. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 240 μl of glacial acetic acid, neutralized using 5 m NaOH, and desalted on a Sepharose PD-10 column. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Several gel filtration columns were prepared and used to resolve the products of [3H]HS degradation on the basis of chain length. Fractions were collected and analyzed for 3H content by liquid scintillation counting. The void (V0) and total (Vt) volumes of each column were determined using blue dextran 2000 and sodium dichromate, respectively. The elution volume (Ve) of each fraction could then be used to determine Kav according to the equation Kav = (Ve - Vt)/(V0 - Vt). Intact HS chains and the HS polysaccharide products of heparinase I, K5 lyase, and platelet extract digests were resolved on a Sepharose CL-6B column (1.5 × 100 cm) or a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 fast protein liquid chromatography column. The Sepharose CL-6B column was run at a flow rate of 6 ml/h in 0.25 m (NH4)HCO3, and 1-ml (15 min) fractions were collected. The Kav of the eluted fractions was used with the calibration data of Wasteson (42Wasteson A. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) to derive estimates of chain length. The Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column was run at 0.5 ml/min in 0.2 m (NH4)HCO3, and with 0.25-ml (0.5 min) fractions were collected. This column was calibrated using untreated heparin saccharides (6-26 degrees of polymerization (dp; the number of monosaccharide units)) as well as completely desulfated N-reacetylated heparin saccharides (dp6-24). HS saccharides produced by low pH nitrous acid or heparinase III treatment were resolved on a Bio-Gel P-10 column (1 × 120 cm) at a flow rate of 4 ml/h in 0.25 m (NH4)HCO3, and 1-ml (15 min) fractions were collected. For preparative purposes, heparinase III digests of [3H]HS were resolved using two Bio-Gel P-10 columns connected in series and run at 2 ml/h. Aliquots of each 0.5-ml (15 min) fraction were analyzed for 3H content, and saccharides were pooled according to chain length (dp6-16) and then repeatedly lyophilized (more than five times) to remove (NH4)HCO3. SAX-HPLC of HS Saccharides—A ProPac PA1 SAX column (4.6 × 250 mm) was linked to a Hewlett-Packard 1100 series high performance chromatography system. The column was run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in Milli-Q ultrapure water (Millipore Ltd., Watford, UK) at pH 3.5. Lyophilized samples were resuspended in 1 ml of this buffer and loaded onto the column prior to the application of the NaCl gradient. [3H]HS samples (100 kdpm) were prepared for disaccharide compositional analysis by exhaustive depolymerization with a combination of heparinases I-III as described previously (37Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11216-11223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant disaccharides were resolved on the ProPac PA1 SAX column over a two-step NaCl gradient (0-0.12 m over 90 min, followed by 0.12-1 m over 45 min). Fractions were collected for scintillation counting, and disaccharides were identified by comparison with the elution positions of known standards. Size-defined heparinase III-derived HS fragments (dp6-12) were resolved on the ProPac PA1 column for analytical and preparative purposes. Samples were desalted (Sepharose PD-10) and loaded onto the column prior to the application of the following NaCl gradients: dp6, 0.0-1.0 m over 80 min; dp8, 0.0-1.2 m over 90 min; and dp10, 0.0-1.2 m over 180 min. The 3H content of each 0.5-ml fraction was quantified by scintillation counting, and oligosaccharide peaks were assigned by comparison with the elution positions of standards sequenced by Merry et al. (14Merry C.L. Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Hopwood J.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18455-18462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Samples pooled from the ProPac PA1 column (dp8-10 subspecies) were desalted again (Sepharose PD-10) prior to use in VEGF165 binding assays. Modeling the VEGF165 Heparin-binding Domain in Complex with Heparin/HS—Docking of heparin model ligands to the NMR structure of amino acids 111-165 of VEGF165 (Protein Data Bank code 2VGH) (43Fairbrother W.J.

Goodsell D.S. Huey R. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) as described previously (40Stringer S.E. Forster M.J. Mulloy B. Bishop C.R. Graham G.J. Gallagher J.T. Blood. 2002; 100: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Docking experiments were performed using fully N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfated heparin pentamers (dp5), heptamers (dp7), and endecamers (dp11) with GlcNS(6S) (were 6S is 6-sulfate) residues at the reducing and nonreducing ends. For docking of the dp5 and dp7 saccharides, all sulfate groups were allowed to rotate freely. Iduronates in both the 1C4 and 2S0 conformations were used for the pentasaccharide, whereas just 1C4 was modeled for the heptasaccharide and endecasaccharide. Rotating models for the supplemental material were made using Insight and Weblab Viewer (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) and POV-Ray Version 3.6 (Persistence of Vision Pty. Ltd.; available at www.povray.org/). Specificity of the VEGF165 Interaction with HS—A number of structurally related GAG species are present at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, all of which could potentially interact with VEGF165. To investigate whether VEGF165 binds preferentially to HS, a variety of unlabeled GAGs were tested in filter binding assays (FBAs; see “Experimental Procedures”) for their ability to compete with 3H-labeled NIH 3T3 fibroblast HS (3T3-HS) for VEGF165 (Fig. 1A). Bovine lung heparin was the most effective competitor (IC50 = 36 ng), followed by porcine mucosal HS (PM-HS; IC50 = 1.02 μg). Chondroitin 6-sulfate and dermatan sulfate are sulfated GAGs with some structural similarity to HS, but both were less effective as competitor species (IC50 = 7.33 and 2.46 μg, respectively). The composition of HS can vary significantly depending on its cellular source (45Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the VEGF165 affinities of three different metabolically 3H-labeled HS samples in step-elution FBAs (Fig. 1B). The three HS species all had the same maximum affinity for VEGF165, with just a small proportion (∼1%) of chains retained by VEGF165 at 400 mm NaCl. The samples also contained a similar proportion of HS chains (20-40%) that remained unbound even in the presence of a large excess of VEGF165 (data not shown). Despite these similarities, there were clear differences between the samples in the proportion of HS chains that were retained by VEGF165 following each increase in buffer NaCl concentration. Interestingly, these differences did not correlate with the abundance of a particular disaccharide or with overall levels of HS sulfation (Table 1). Bovine aortic endothelial HS (BAE-HS) had a lower proportion compared with 3T3-HS of all the sulfated disaccharide types, including the trisulfated disaccharide UA(2S)-GlcNS(6S); but in 130 mm NaCl buffer, 69% of the BAE-HS chains were VEGF165-bound compared with 42% of the 3T3-HS chains. In the same assay, heparin bound VEGF165 more strongly than did HS (up to 700 mm NaCl), and our VEGF121 negative control had no affinity for HS or heparin (data not shown). Metabolically radiolabeled NIH 3T3 cell dermatan sulfate was also assayed, but was fully eluted by the 250 mm NaCl buffer step, demonstrating a weaker affinity for VEGF165 compared with HS (data not shown).TABLE 1Disaccharide composition of [3H]HS samples used in this study A"
https://openalex.org/W2167061320,"Mutations in the gene MCOLN1 coding for the TRP (transient receptor potential) family ion channel TRP-ML1 lead to the lipid storage disorder mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV). The function and role of TRP-ML1 are not well understood. We report here that TRPML1 is a lysosomal monovalent cation channel. Both native and recombinant TRP-ML1 are cleaved resulting in two products. Recombinant TRP-ML1 is detected as the full-length form and as short N- and C-terminal forms, whereas in native cells mainly the cleaved N and C termini are detected. The N- and C-terminal fragments of TRP-ML1 were co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and co-eluted from a Ni 2 column. TRP-ML1 undergoes proteolytic cleavage that is inhibited by inhibitors of cathepsin B (CatB) and is altered when TRP-ML1 is expressed in CatB / cells. N-terminal sequencing of purified C-terminal fragment of TRP-ML1 expressed in Sf9 cells indicates a cleavage site at Arg 200 2Pro 201 . Consequently, the conserved R200H mutation changed the cleavage pattern of TRP-ML1. The cleavage inhibited TRP-ML1 channel activity. This work provides the first example of inactivation by cleavage of a TRP channel. The significance of the cleavage to the function of TRP-ML1 is under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2013465778,"Centrins are highly conserved components of the centrosome, which in the parasitic protozoan T. brucei comprises the basal body and nucleates the flagellum used for locomotion. Here, we found TbCentrin2 in an additional bi-lobed structure near to the Golgi apparatus. One lobe was associated with the old Golgi, and the other became associated with the newly forming Golgi as the cell grew. Depletion of TbCentrin1 inhibited duplication of the basal body, whereas depletion of TbCentrin2 also inhibited duplication of the Golgi. Thus, a Centrin2-containing structure distinct from the basal body appears to mark the site for new Golgi assembly."

Binding of ALE-1 to S. aureus cells through its C-terminal 92 residues, known as the targeting domain, is functionally important for staphylolytic activity. The ALE-1-targeting domain belongs to the SH3b domain family, the prokaryotic counterpart of the eukaryotic SH3 domains. The 1.75 Å crystal structure of the targeting domain shows an all-β fold similar to typical SH3s but with unique features. The structure reveals patches of conserved residues among orthologous targeting domains, forming surface regions that can potentially interact with some common features of the Gram-positive cell wall. ALE-1-targeting domain binding studies employing various bacterial peptidoglycans demonstrate that the length of the interpeptide bridge, as well as the amino acid composition of the peptide, confers the maximum binding of the targeting domain to the staphylococcal peptidoglycan. Truncation of the highly conserved first 9 N-terminal residues results in loss of specificity to S. aureus cell wall-targeting, suggesting that these residues confer specificity to S. aureus cell wall.

Lysostaphin, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, is secreted by Staphylococcus simulans biovar staphylolyticus to preferentially lyse the interpeptide bridge of the S. aureus cell wall (1Schindler C.A.

The lysostaphin proenzyme displays a three-domain modular design: an N-terminal domain of tandem repeats, a central zinc-containing metalloprotease catalytic domain, and a C-terminal targeting domain. Upon maturation, the tandem repeats are removed, leaving only the catalytic domain and the targeting domain in the mature lysostaphin (8Recsei P.A. Gruss A.D. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of lysostaphin, consisting of 92 amino acids, is thought to be the targeting domain that directs the interaction of lysostaphin with S. aureus cell walls (9Baba T. Schneewind O. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4789-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A mutant lysostaphin lacking the targeting domain loses both its abilities to bind to staphylococci and to distinguish between host cells and target cells (9Baba T. Schneewind O. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4789-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This kind of targeting domain can be found among other types of peptidoglycan hydrolases, for example, the C terminus of N-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidases and the N terminus of glucosaminidase, both of which are products of the S. aureus autolysin proenzyme Atl (10Oshida T.

These domains have been shown to direct autolysin to the equatorial surface ring of S. aureus (11Baba T. Schneewind O. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4639-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fragments of this consensus sequence can also be mapped to some proteins secreted by other bacterial species, such as zoocin A produced by Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, which is thought to be involved in cell wall recognition and binding (12Lai A.C. Tran S. Simmonds R.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 215: 133-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The targeting domain belongs to the recently identified prokaryotic SH3b domain family, the prokaryotic counterpart of the well characterized SH3 5The abbreviations used are: SH3Src homology 3MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.5The abbreviations used are: SH3Src homology 3MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Eukaryotic SH3s are important modular protein domains that mediate protein-protein interactions upon binding to a proline-rich peptide sequence (14Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar) and are commonly involved in signal transduction and membrane trafficking pathways. A subset of bacterial invasion proteins containing the SH3b domains are thought to bind the receptors of their target cells or utilize the SH3-like modulating pathways to promote their survival in the invaded cells (13Whisstock J.C. Lesk A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 132-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, SH3b domains display low sequence similarity to eukaryotic SH3 domains, indicating that their function may differ from eukaryotic SH3s (15Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Schultz J. Bork P. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 729-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Indeed, another subset of SH3b domains found in the bacterial peptidoglycanlytic enzymes is thought to mediate the binding to bacterial cells (15Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Schultz J. Bork P. Koonin E.V.

Fujiwara T. Akiyama T. Ohara M. Komatsuzawa H. Inoue S. Suginaka H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1193-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and possesses a modular structure similar to lysostaphin. It is composed of an N-terminal 13 amino acid repeat domain followed by a central catalytic domain and a C-terminal targeting domain of 92 amino acids (92AA) that is extremely similar to that of lysostaphin. Unlike lysostaphin, ALE-1 does not undergo post-translational processing of its N-terminal repeats. In this report, we describe the crystal structure of the targeting domain of ALE-1, which represents an SH3b domain, as well as insights into its recognition of the S. aureus peptidoglycan. Materials—Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Staphylococcus was grown in trypticase soy broth. Streptococcus was grown in Berman broth. Bacillus was grown in Nutrient broth. Escherichia coli was grown in Luria-Bertani broth. When necessary, ampicillin was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Protein Expression and Purification—The full ALE-1, ALE-1 truncated for N-terminal repeats (residue 115–362, ΔN-term), ALE-1 truncated for C-terminal targeting domain (residue 36–270, ΔC-term), ALE-1 truncated for both N-terminal repeats and C-terminal targeting domain (ΔN-,C-term), and C-terminal targeting domain (residue 271–362) were expressed as His6 tag fusion proteins (Fig. 1). The corresponding sequences were amplified with PCR using S. capitis EPK1 chromosomal DNA as a template with the primer pairs (supplemental Table S1) and cloned in-frame downstream of pQE30 vector (Qiagen) to generate respective expression plasmids. E. coli M15 cells (pREP4) were transformed, grown to mid-log phase in 500 ml Luria-Bertani broth at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 10 ml of buffer B (8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then disrupted by ultrasonication. After removing undisrupted cells by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 5× bed volumes of buffer C (8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.3), and the protein was eluted with buffer E (8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 4.5). The eluted fraction was stepwise dialyzed against 4 m urea (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) then 0.1 m phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. The selenomethionine enriched C-terminal targeting domain was expressed as a FLAG-tagged fusion protein. The corresponding sequence was amplified with the primers ALEU6 and ALEL2 (supplemental Table S1) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. The insert was cut with HindIII and EcoRI and cloned in-frame downstream of pFLAG MAC expression vector (Sigma) to generate pF92AA. pF92AA was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. The recombinant E. coli was grown in 3 liters of M9 medium to mid-log phase, then supplemented with 150 mg of seleno-l-methionine, 300 mg of lysine hydrochloride, 300 mg of threonine, 300 mg of phenylalanine, 150 mg of leucine, 150 mg of isoleucine, and 150 mg of valine and continued incubation for 15 min at 37 °C. The culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and further incubated for 13 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml sodium azide), and mixed with 3 ml of buffer C (0.1 m CaCl2, 0.1 m MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were then disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was treated with SDS-heat-killed S. aureus FDA209P for 1 h at 4 °C. The S. aureus cells were washed with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, six times, and the bound FLAG-tagged 92AA was eluted with 8 m urea (0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8). The eluted fraction was extensively dialyzed against 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and used for crystallization. Protein Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals of the ALE-1-targeting domain (92AA, residues 271–362) were grown by the hanging drop, in which 4 μl of protein at 12 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.2 was mixed with 4 μl of the reservoir solution. The reservoir solution contained 100 mm sodium acetate, 32–35% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, and 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, or 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, as buffer. The crystals belong to the space group P212121 (a = 45.2 Å, b = 58.5 Å, c = 85.1 Å) with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The successful incorporation of two selenium atoms into a truncated form of the targeting domain was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (data not shown). Crystals of the Se-protein were grown by hanging drop, in which 4 μl of 18 mg/ml protein in water was mixed with 4 μl from the reservoir identical to that used for 92AA. The Se-protein crystals belong to the space group I432 (a = b = c = 105 Å) with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Diffraction data from 92AA and multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data from three crystals of the Se-protein were collected at 17-ID IMCA port at the Advanced Photon Source (Table 1, showing one of the three selenomethionine data sets) and were processed using HKL2000 (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymology. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). Two selenium sites were identified and refined in all three MAD data sets with CNS (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D.

Subsequently, the structure of 92AA was determined by molecular replacement and refined to 1.75 Å resolution. Two copies of 92AA were referred to as molecules A and B. Based on the electron density and protein sequence, a long stretch of residues were built at the N termini, which belong to the FLAG-tag (D260YKDDDDKVKL270; arbitrarily assigned sequence number for model continuity). Molecule A (264–362) consists of 99 residues and molecule B (260–362) of 103 residues, and both models show good geometry. The full coordinates (1R77) of the ALE-1 cell wall-targeting domain have been released in the Protein Data Bank. Preparation of Bacterial Cells for Binding Assay—Several bacterial preparations were used for the binding assay, including intact cells, heat-killed cells, SDS-heat-killed cells, and SDS-trypsinized cells. S. aureus FDA209P was grown in trypticase soy broth to mid-log phase, centrifuged, and then resuspended in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and used as intact cells. Alternatively the cells were suspended in 0.1 m phosphate buffer without or with SDS (final 4%) and incubated in boiling water for 30 min, washed at least 10 times with 0.1 m phosphate buffer. The obtained cells were used as heat-killed cells or SDS-heat-killed cells. The SDS-heat-killed cells were further incubated with trypsin (100 μg/ml) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C for 15 h, washed several times with distilled water containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, suspended in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and used as SDS-trypsin cells. Preparation of Peptidoglycan (PG)—PG was prepared essentially as described by Stranden et al. (21Stranden A.M. Ehlert K. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The cultured cells were washed with PBS, suspended in 10 ml of 1 m NaCl, and mixed with glass beads (6 g/10 ml in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) and homogenized with a cell homogenizer (output level 4/1 min/7 repeats; B. Braun Biotech). Unbroken cells and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 625 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 5625 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The obtained cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5% SDS and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min to remove any non-covalently bound components. The cell walls were isolated by centrifugation and washed six times with water and further washed with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. To remove Protein A, samples were incubation with 0.2 mg/ml trypsin in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, with 10 mm CaCl2 for 24 h at 37 °C. Samples were centrifuged and washed several times with buffer and water. To remove teichoic acids, samples were incubated with 1 ml of 40% (w/v) aqueous hydrofluoric acid for 18 h at 4 °C. Purified peptidoglycan was isolated by centrifugation, washed more than four times with water, and lyophilized. Assay of Staphylolytic Activity—Lytic activity was assayed by following the rate of decrease in the turbidity of the cell suspension as described previously (22Komatsuzawa H. Suzuki J. Sugai M. Miyake Y. Suginaka H. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1994; 34: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, heat-killed S. aureus FDA209P cells were incubated with (+92AA) or without (-92AA) excess amount of the targeting domain for 1 h and extensively washed with PBS. The cells were then suspended in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (1 mg of [dry weight]/ml, pH 6.8). Truncated forms of ALE-1 at appropriate concentrations were mixed with 2 ml of the cell suspension and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C. Specifically, full ALE-1 and ΔN-ALE were added to the cells at 0.05 μm, and the C-terminal truncated forms were at 0.4 μm. The rate of decrease in turbidity was measured at 595 nm (A595) on a spectrophotometer. Binding Assay—Bacterial cells or PGs were suspended in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 100 mm iodoacetic acid (A595 = 1.0). Proteins of interest were incubated with 100 μl of the suspension for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were then washed three times with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 10 mm iodoacetic acid, and the bound proteins were eluted by incubating with 30 μl of 4% SDS. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In some experiments, the amount of protein was estimated by NIH image version 1.52 using scanned protein bands. Detection of Bound Protein to Bacterial PG by ELISA—Polystyrene enzyme immunoassay 96-well plates (Nalge Nunc) were coated with 100 μl per well of sonicated bacterial PG diluted in PBS, pH 7.2, to the concentration of 12.5 μg/ml and left overnight. Sonication was performed to ensure a homogeneous coating suspension of the insoluble PG. After coating, the wells were washed three times with distilled water, then 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 20 μg/ml human IgG was added to the wells and left overnight. After blocking, the wells were washed three times with distilled water, then 7.0 μg/ml protein (100 μl) diluted in PBS was added to the wells and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After incubation with protein, the wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Anti-ALE-1 serum (100 μl) diluted in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After three washes with PBS-Tween 20, 100 μl of diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit immunoglobulin anti-goat IgG antiserum was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Unbound conjugate was removed by washing three times with PBS-Tween 20 and twice with PBS. The substrate (100 μl) was then added (25 mg of o-phenylendiamine dihydrochloride and 5 μl of H2O2 in 10 ml of sodium phosphate-citrate buffer). The enzymatic reaction proceeded for 15 min at room temperature and was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 2 n H2SO4. The optical density was measured at 492 nm on a Titertek Multiscan Spectrophotometer. ALE-1-targeting Domain Belongs to Bacterial Homologue of SH3 (SH3b)—An asymmetric unit consists of two copies (molecules A and B) of the ALE-1-targeting domain, a.k.a. 92AA. At the N termini of these two molecules is a partial sequence of FLAG-tag, which is involved in intermolecular interactions (see “Discussion”). These two molecules are very similar, indicated by an overall root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.43 Å for all main chain atoms (residues 271–362), with the maximal deviations localized in some residues at the N and C termini: Asn274 (1.04 Å), Lys275 (1.41 Å), Tyr276 (1.08 Å), and Lys362 (1.25 Å). In this report, the discussion will refer to molecule B. The ALE-1-targeting domain consists of eight β-strands (Fig. 2A). Two anti-parallel multiple-stranded β-sheets pack at approximately right angles: β5-β7 and the N terminus of β2 in sheet I; β3-β4, β8, and the C terminus of β2 in sheet II. The targeting domain has been classified as SH3b, a prokaryotic homologue of the eukaryotic SH3. Although eukaryotic SH3 and prokaryotic SH3b share little sequence identity (<20%), their tertiary structures are strikingly similar as indicated by DALI (23Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). SH3 domains are modular proteins that mediate protein-protein interactions in signal transduction cascades and membrane-cytoskeleton structures through recognition of proline-rich (PXXP) ligands; the surface of SH3 domains bears a large and relatively flat hydrophobic region to accommodate the special conformation of the proline-rich substrate (reviewed in Ref. 24Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SH3 domains resemble a β-barrel, consisting of five β-strands (βa to βe). SH3 loops are conventionally defined as follows: the RT loop, located between strands βa and βb; the n-Src loop, between βb and βc; and the distal loop, between βc and βd. The RT loop contains conserved residues involved in defining ligand specificity and binding. Structurally, the n-Src loop flanks one end of the substrate binding groove. Between strands βd and βe is a 310 helix, a common feature of SH3s. The ALE-1-targeting domain and SH3 domains share all of the β strands (Fig. 2B): βa and β2, βb and β5, βc and β6, βd and β7, βe and β8. The positional r.m.s.d. for 52 equivalent α-carbons between the ALE-1-targeting domain and the Crk SH3 (1CKA.pdb) (25Wu X. Knudsen B. Feller S.M. Zheng J. Sali A. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Kuriyan J. Structure (Camb.). 1995; 3: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) is 2.4 Å. For convenience, we named the loop regions of the targeting domain after their SH3 counterparts. The targeting domain (271–362) is larger than typical SH3 domains by 30 amino acids and has unique features. The N-terminal 20 residues form β1 and the N terminus of β2, neither of which is present in SH3s. The RT loop is replaced by strands β3 and β4 linked by a nine-residue loop, forming a twisted hairpin that hovers above β-sheet I. This region is stabilized by the extensive hydrogen bonding network and non-covalent interactions between the loop residues and neighboring β-strands. The targeting domain lacks the characteristic 310 helix found in SH3; instead, the extension of strand β7 is joined with the C-terminal strand β8 by a four-residue turn followed by a long stretch of coil. There are also subtle differences between other regions in the targeting domain and the Crk SH3; the distal loop of the targeting domain is slightly tilted away from its original position in Crk; the extension of strands β5 and β6 causes the tip of the n-Src loop to point nearly 180 degrees away compared with Crk, which, in consequence, partially blocks the PXXP binding groove and notably reduces its accessible area (Fig. 2B). Two strictly conserved residues in SH3 domains, a tryptophan and proline pair, are solvent-exposed and directly involved in the substrate binding (26Cesareni G. Panni S. Nardelli G. Castagnoli L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The ALE-1-targeting domain contains this Trp329/Pro343 pair; however, they are completely inaccessible. ALE-1-targeting Domain Binds to S. aureus Cells—ALE-1 and lysostaphin are glycylglycine endopeptidases that specifically lyse S. aureus by digesting the pentaglycine interpeptide bridge of the PG. Their C-terminal 92-amino acid stretches (92AA) share high sequence identity and presumably work as cell wall-targeting domains. To examine whether the targeting domain is involved in the binding of ALE-1 to the substrate S. aureus, we assessed binding activity of several truncated forms of ALE-1 to SDS-heat killed S. aureus cells (Fig. 3A). Full ALE-1 and ΔN-term ALE-1 showed similar binding activity to S. aureus cells, while constructs lacking the targeting domain (ΔC-term and ΔN-,C-term) showed significantly decreased binding activity. In contrast, the targeting domain alone showed high binding activity to S. aureus cells. When SDS-heat-killed S. aureus cells were incubated with various concentrations of the targeting domain, binding increased in a dose-dependent manner and reached a plateau (Fig. 3B). These results clearly indicated that the targeting domain has a strong binding affinity toward S. aureus cells. The catalytic domain of ALE-1, i.e. the zinc-metalloprotease domain, is the performer of the staphylolysis. However, the relationship between the lytic activity and the targeting domain is not clear; hence we investigated whether preincubation of the substrate (heat-killed S. aureus cells) with the targeting domain would interfere with the lytic activity of various forms of ALE-1 (Fig. 4). Full and ΔN-term ALE-1s showed similar lytic activity toward untreated substrate. Preincubation with excess targeting domain considerably inhibited the bacteriolysis by full ALE-1, as well as attenuated the lytic activity of ΔN-term ALE-1, although this was less effective. In contrast, the C-terminal truncated forms (ΔC-term and ΔN-,C-term ALE-1s) showed large reduction in the lytic activity toward untreated substrate. Furthermore, preincubation with the targeting domain hardly affected their lytic activity. Clearly, binding to S. aureus cells through the targeting domain is functionally important for the staphylolytic activity of ALE-1, and truncation of the targeting domain efficiently abolishes enzyme binding to S. aureus cells, confirming that the C-terminal domain of ALE-1 acts as a cell wall-targeting domain. Targeting Domain Specifically Recognizes Interpeptide Bridge—The strong affinity of the ALE-1-targeting domain to S. aureus cells led us to further study the binding mechanism. It has been known that the C-terminal domain of lysostaphin plays an important role in its binding to the S. aureus cell wall; however, the interacting component on the cell wall has not been identi"

Here, the NIR absorption of undoped quantum wells was modulated by strong electric fields with frequencies between 1.5 and 3.9 THz. The THz field coupled two excited states (excitons) of the quantum wells, as manifested by a new THz frequency- and power-dependent NIR absorption line. Nonperturbative theory and experiment indicate that the THz field generated a coherent quantum superposition of an absorbing and a nonabsorbing exciton. This quantum coherence may yield new applications for quantum well modulators in optical communications."

Despite the wide range of studies on the copper binding of PrP, there have been no studies to determine the affinity of the protein on both full-length prion protein and under physiological conditions. We have used two techniques, isothermal titration calorimetry and competitive metal capture analysis, to determine the affinity of copper for wild type mouse PrP and a series of mutants. High affinity copper binding by wild type PrP has been confirmed by the independent techniques indicating the presence of specific tight copper binding sites up to femtomolar affinity. Altogether, four high affinity binding sites of between femto- and nanomolar affinities are located within the octameric repeat region of the protein at physiological pH. A fifth copper binding site of lower affinity than those of the octameric repeat region has been detected in full-length protein. Binding to this site is modulated by the histidine at residue 111. Removal of the octameric repeats leads to the enhancement of affinity of this fifth site and a second binding site outside of the repeat region undetected in the wild type protein. High affinity copper binding allows PrP to compete effectively for copper in the extracellular milieu.

The cellular prion protein PrPc is a cell surface glycoprotein with large α-helical content that is attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. This cellular form of the protein binds copper, and it is argued that this copper binding to PrPc is intimately linked to the normal cellular function of the protein either in copper transport, sequestration, or antioxidant activity (1Brown D.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Brown D.R. Wong B.S. Hafiz F. Clive C. Haswell S. Jones I.M. Biochem.

The native cellular protein may undergo a conformational transformation to a protease-resistant species known as a prion (PrPSc) with high β-sheet content and a tendency to aggregate. This transformed species is the putative proteinaceous infectious agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases (4Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). Prion diseases are characterized by a metal imbalance in the brain that occurs simultaneously to conversion of PrPc to PrPSc. The metal imbalance is associated with the loss of copper binding from PrPc on conversion to PrPSc (5Wong B.-S. Chen S.G. Colucci M. Xie Z. Pan T. Liu T. Li R. Gambetti P. Sy M.-S. Brown D.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1400-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Thackray A.M. Knight R. Haswell S.J. Bujdoso R. Brown D.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This raises important questions concerning the role of copper and other metals in prion diseases. Loss of protein function as a result of impaired copper binding in diseased PrPSc could have serious implications for disease progression. As a result, knowledge of copper binding to PrP is important in considering both the normal function of PrPc and its influence in prion diseases. Although it is accepted that PrPc is a Cu(II) binding protein, there are many facets of the interaction of Cu(II) and PrPc that are disputed. These include the exact number of binding sites and their relative affinity for Cu(II). Initial studies focused on a fragment of the protein termed the octameric repeat region because it contains four repeats of an octamer. This region contains histidine and so was a likely candidate for the binding site. These early studies (7Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 8Hornshaw M.P. McDermott J.R. Candy J.M. Lakey J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) suggested Cu(II) binds to this region with a micromolar affinity that was little more specific than histidine on its own. Further studies with larger fragments also suggested that Cu(II) binds PrPc, but again the affinity seen was similarly a low micromolar association (9Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A study of the effect of PrPc expression on Cu(II) uptake into cells suggested that the affinity must at least be in the nanomolar range (1Brown D.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nanomolar affinities for the octameric repeat region have rarely been suggested (10Whittal R.M. Ball H.L. Cohen F.E. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Baldwin M.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Only one publication has suggested that the affinity of Cu(II) for PrP is in the femtomolar range (11Jackson G.S. Murray I. Hosszu L.L. Gibbs N. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8531-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Although such a high affinity implies that PrP is a very specific Cu(II)-binding protein, this finding has never been reproduced. Therefore, there is currently no consent about the true affinity of Cu(II) for PrPc. Initial studies focusing on the octa-repeat region suggested that there might be as many as four Cu(II) binding sites on PrPc. However, study of a peptide with amino acid residues 23–98 of PrPc suggested that this fragment could bind 5 Cu(II) atoms (9Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although four of these sites were designated as belonging to the octameric repeat region, the location of the so-called fifth site has been difficult to identify. There have been three suggestions, each associated with a histidine at either amino acid residue 96 (9Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A.

A recent study suggests that the fifth site involves both histidines at 96 and 111 (15Jones C.E. Abdelraheim S.R. Brown D.R. Viles J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32018-32027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Also, there is no evidence that five Cu(II) ions bind to PrPc in vivo. The only study to quantify Cu(II) bound to PrPc purified from mouse brain indicated that an average of three Cu(II) ions is bound to each molecule (3Brown D.R. Clive C. Haswell S.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the alternative Cu(II) binding site has higher affinity for Cu(II) than the octameric repeat region (11Jackson G.S. Murray I. Hosszu L.L. Gibbs N. Waltho J.P.

None of these studies has estimated the relative affinity of these sites within full-length PrP and has relied on peptides and fragments. Therefore, resolution of these issues is still waiting for further study. To address these issues, two independent techniques have been used to examine high affinity binding within wild type PrP. First, the thermodynamics of Cu(II) binding has been examined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) 2The abbreviations used are: ITCisothermal titration calorimetryCMCAcompetitive metal capture analysisMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidCDTA1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acidBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. to measure affinity. Second, competitive metal capture analysis (CMCA) has been used to compare Cu(II) binding in PrP to other Cu(II) chelators of know affinity, enabling direct comparisons of Cu(II) affinities to be made. Where possible full-length protein PrP has been utilized to avoid the discrepancies associated with peptides, and Cu(II) has been added in a chelated form to mimic physiological conditions. isothermal titration calorimetry competitive metal capture analysis 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 1,2-cyclohexylenedinitrilotetraacetic acid N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. Recombinant Protein Production—Recombinant mouse PrP protein was produced as described previously (16Cui T. Daniels M. Wong B.-S. Li R. Sy M.S. Sassoon J. Brown D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR-amplified product was cloned in the expression vector pET-23 (Novagen) and transformed into Escherichia coli ad494(DE3) or BL21(DE3) strains. Expressed proteins were solubilized by sonication in 8 m urea and recovered by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Columns were charged with nickel in the case of His-tagged proteins and copper for untagged proteins. The eluted material was treated with 0.5 mm EDTA to ensure the protein was free from leached metal ions. All subsequent steps used double-deionized water treated with Chelex resin (Sigma) to remove residual metal ions. The denatured protein was refolded by a 10-fold dilution of the urea in deionized water, concentration by ultra-filtration, and two rounds of dialysis to remove residual urea, imidazole, and EDTA. Protein concentrations were measured using theoretical extinction coefficients at 280 nm (us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html) and confirmed by BCA assay (Sigma). The protein was adjusted to 20 μm in Chelex-treated water, pH 7, as 3-ml aliquots for immediate use in ITC experiments. Protein purity was checked using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Mutagenesis—Constructs expressing mouse PrP amino acids 23–231 with and without C-terminal His6 and mouse PrP-(23–231) with the octameric repeats deleted (PrP-(Δ51–89)) have previously been described (16Cui T. Daniels M. Wong B.-S. Li R. Sy M.S. Sassoon J. Brown D.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mutations of the histidine residues in the proposed 5th Cu(II) binding site of mouse PrP were prepared using a PCR-based mutagenesis procedure involving paired oligonucleotides to create the single H96A (PrPH96A), H111A (PrPH111A), and double H96A,H111A (PrPH96A,H111A) mutants (residue numbering is based on the human PrP sequence). Mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Measurements—All measurements were made on a Microcal VP-Isothermal Titration Calorimeter instrument. Briefly, a time course of injections of ligand to macromolecule or vice versa is made in an enclosed reaction cell maintained at a constant temperature. The instrument measures the heat generated or absorbed as a ligand-macromolecule reaction occurs. A binding isotherm is fitted to the data, expressed in terms of heat change per mole of ligand against the ligand to macromolecule ratio. From the binding isotherm values for the reaction stoichiometry, association constants Ka, the change in enthalpies ΔH°, and change in entropies ΔS are obtained. All solutions were filtered through a 0.22-μ filter and degassed before use. Weak metal-buffer interactions can cause discrepancies in ITC data (17Zhang Y. Akilesh S. Wilcox D.E. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 39: 3057-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Titration of Cu(Gly)2 into water adjusted to pH 7 resulted in less heat change than use of MES buffer, presumably due to a weak Cu(II)-MES interaction, whereas water only measures a heat of dilution. Direct titration of protein solutions with aqueous Cu(II) salts was avoided because of the tendency of PrP to aggregate under such conditions (18Requena J.R. Groth D. Legname G. Stadtman E.R. Prusiner S.B. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7170-7175Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 19Daniels M. Brown D.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and to prevent the formation of insoluble Cu(II) hydroxide species. These may be avoided by the use of a Cu(II) chelate. The amino acids glycine and histidine have both previously been used as copper chelators in biochemical experiments (1Brown D.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However titration of histidine in the absence of copper into PrP gave an isotherm indicating that a significant histidine-PrP interaction occurs (data not shown). Copper(II) forms a bis-glycine complex, Cu(Gly)2, in the presence of excess glycine. Therefore, a copper:glycine ratio of 1:4 was used by dissolving 3.0 mm copper(II)chloride and 12 mm glycine in Chelex-treated water. The excess glycine ensured that titrated Cu(II) was either chelated to glycine or incorporated into the protein, avoiding aqueous Cu(II) in the reaction cell. It also acted as a competitor to nonspecific protein Cu(II) interactions. In our hands as others (17Zhang Y. Akilesh S. Wilcox D.E. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 39: 3057-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the most reproducible data were obtained from injections of the metal into a solution of protein. Typically an initial injection of 2 μl of Cu(II) chelate solution was followed by a further 29 injections of 4 μl of Cu(II) into the protein in the sample cell stirred at 300 rpm. Injections were separated by 120 s to allow equilibration, and sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Data were analyzed with the Origin 5.0 software package from MicroCal. A base-line correction was applied to each experiment by subtraction of data from a series of injections of Cu(II) chelate solution into a buffer blank correlating to the heat of dilution of the Cu(II) complex. After subtraction of the blank data, a nonlinear least squares method was used to minimize χ2 values and obtain best fit parameters for the association constants, Ka, and the change in enthalpies, ΔH°. In all cases best-fit parameters were obtained from the sequential binding sites model, whereby the user defines the number of binding sites to be fitted in a sequential manner. All sequential binding site models between 1 and 10 were assessed to ensure that the optimal data fit was obtained. Attempts to fit data to one or two identical site models gave unsatisfactory results. The affinity of Cu(II) to glycine was measured in water, pH 7, identical conditions to the protein experiments. The best fit model for the coordination of two glycine molecules to Cu(II), corresponding to the Cu(Gly)2 complex, results in K1 = 4.0 × 105 m–1 and K2 = 1.7 × 104 m–1, with β2 = 6.8 × 109 m–1 (data not shown), in agreement with the pH-adjusted literature values of K1 = 3.0 × 105 m–1 and β2 = 8.7 × 109 m–1 (20Dawson R.M.C Elliot D.C. Elliot D.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1986: 409Google Scholar). Affinities recorded for PrP were obtained in competition with Cu2+ chelated by glycine; therefore, this must be factored into the reported affinities. This process is complicated from a lack of knowledge of the mechanism of copper binding. There is precedent for the use of the β2 value as the correct factor (11Jackson G.S. Murray I. Hosszu L.L. Gibbs N. Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8531-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, an important prerequisite is that no mixed ligand complexes form (21Xiao Z. Loughlin F. George G.N. Howlett G.J. Wedd A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and generally assumes K2 approximates or is larger than K1, not the case for Cu(Gly)2. Although it cannot be discounted that the initial interaction produces a PrP-Cu-Gly complex, requiring only the K2 value to be factored in, this awaits further investigation. In the case of K1 > K2, there is precedent for the K1 value to be used as the correction factor assuming the dissociation of ligand (L) from ML1 to be the competing event. Such an assumption is made in the subsequent CMCA assay for chelators able to form bis adducts (22Atwood C.S. Scarpa R.C. Huang X. Moir R.D. Jones W.D. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1219-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) and has, therefore, been applied to the ITC data. Such a prudent approach also avoids the risk of overstating the affinity. Therefore, data reported in TABLE ONE are the product of the measured Cu-PrP interaction and 4.0 × 105 m–1 (K1 of Cu(Gly)2); however, some mention is made in the text to values obtained from a correction using β2 = 6.8 × 109 m–1 were a concerted mechanism to be invoked.TABLE ONEBinding affinity (log K) for copper binding to PrP as determined by ITC at pH 7PrP-(23-231)aData fits for both four and five copper binding sites are shown, but five sites most commonly show best (minimum χ2) fit.PrP-(23-171)aData fits for both four and five copper binding sites are shown, but five sites most commonly show best (minimum χ2) fit.PrP-(Δ51-89)PrPH96APrPH111APrPH96A,H111A45452544Octa repeats112.6611.8211.5511.0111.8111.1112.19210.7910.719.639.7110.889.8610.67310.0910.457.489.5510.6210.8810.5749.9510.8311.9211.1110.958.6310.07Additional58.789.8010.538.3168.67log βnbWhere βn = K1 × K2...× Kn-1 × Kn.43.552.640.651.219.252.640.543.5a Data fits for both four and five copper binding sites are shown, but five sites most commonly show best (minimum χ2) fit.b Where βn = K1 × K2...× Kn-1 × Kn. Open table in a new tab CMCA—This technique was performed as previously described (22Atwood C.S. Scarpa R.C. Huang X. Moir R.D. Jones W.D. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1219-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). It involved mixing one of a series of chelators (TABLE TWO) with Cu(II) at a ratio of 1:2 (metal:chelator). The Cu(II) binding affinities of the chelators have been published previously (20Dawson R.M.C Elliot D.C. Elliot D.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1986: 409Google Scholar, 22Atwood C.S. Scarpa R.C. Huang X. Moir R.D. Jones W.D. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1219-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The metal-chelator mixture was then mixed with the recombinant protein for 24 h at 37 °C before being separated from the Cu(II) chelator solution by filtration. Filtration was carried out using concentration filters with a cut off of 3 kDa. The use of a copper-glycine blank and negative control protein, lysozyme, with Cu(II)-glycine has confirmed that three washes are sufficient to remove all of the Cu-ligand complex. The Cu(II) present in the protein and filtrate was assessed using a spectrophotometric assay (19Daniels M. Brown D.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that this assay provides accurate measurements of bound Cu(II) by comparing results from this assay to results from inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Cu(II) used in these experiments was prepared by mixing pure copper at 10 mg/ml (National Institute of Standards and Technology, no. 3114) in 10% HNO3. All solutions were prepared in double-deionized water treated with the Chelex reagent to remove any trace of residual metals. Solutions were also filtered using a 0.22-μm filter before the experiments. The reaction was carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl. The pH of the buffer was adjusted to either pH 6.6 or 7.4. The reaction volume (1 ml) contained Cu(II) at 50 μm, chelator at 100 μm, and protein at 2 μm. The proteins tested were wild type mouse PrP (PrP-(23–231)), PrP with the octameric repeat region deleted (PrP-(Δ51–89)) and a truncated PrP (PrP-(90–231)). These proteins were prepared in an untagged form. Samples of the proteins reacted only in buffer were tested for Cu(II) content in parallel to ensure that no Cu(II) bound the protein as a result of the buffer conditions. Determination of the affinity constants (Kapp) for each potential binding site was determined as previously described (22Atwood C.S. Scarpa R.C. Huang X. Moir R.D. Jones W.D. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J.

The addition of Cu(Gly)2 to all of the PrP isoforms used in this study resulted in an overall evolution of heat, indicated by negative peaks in the plots of raw ITC data (Fig. 1a). In contrast, titration of glycine alone into PrP showed no evidence of an amino acid-protein interaction (Fig. 1b) nor did Cu(II) chelate addition to protein where the Cu(II) binding sites had been saturated by refolding the protein in the presence of 5 mm Cu(II) (Fig. 1c). Binding affinities of Cu(II) to PrP species without His6 tags studied are summarized in TABLE ONE. In all cases data have been analyzed by sequential binding sites models. ITC data from the wild type protein PrP-(23–231) measured at pH 7 can be fitted to either 4 or 5 binding site model isotherms. By comparison, the minimized χ2 values for fits of 1, 2, 3, and 6 binding sites were 52, 47, 2.7, and 9.2 times greater than the optimal fit, respectively. The highest binding affinity is observed for the first ion of Cu(II) to coordinate to PrP regardless of of fit. When a 4-site fit is the stoichiometry adopted, an affinity of 1012.7 m– is measured, whereas a 5-site fit suggests an affinity of 1011.8 m–1 for the first binding atom. These are affinities in the high femtomolar to low picomolar range. These values rise to 1016.9 and 1016.1, respectively, if competition from both the K1 and K2 of the Cu(Gly)2 complex are factored in (see “Materials and Methods”). This would place the affinity at the sub-femtomolar level. Three further Cu(II) ions proceed to bind in the 10s to 100s pm range (1010 to 1010.8 m–1). In contrast, the fifth site has a lower affinity 108.8 m–1. Interestingly, the PrP-(23–171) fragment largely mirrors the wild type protein with four or five binding sites measured; Fig. 2. This protein lacks the final 60 amino acids of the C terminus, including one of the candidate histidines for the fifth Cu(II) binding site. The affinities of this fragment to Cu(II) are approximately an order of magnitude lower than those measured for the wild type protein. Two exceptions are the fourth sequential binding site, which has the largest affinity in this fragment, and the fifth site, which has a similar order of magnitude to that in the wild type protein. Removal of the octa-repeat region (PrP(Δ51–89)) causes a significant reduction in the heat evolved on Cu(II) binding, suggesting a major disruption to the pattern of Cu(II) binding; Fig. 3. The data fit a binding isotherm of two sequentially filled sites with affinities of 1010.5 to 108.7 m–1. The associated errors of data fitted to 1, 3, and 4 binding site models were 13, 7, and 2.5 times greater than the 2-site model obtained. Significantly, Cu(II) binding capacity is lost on removal of the octarepeats. It is also apparent that the higher affinity binding sites require the presence of the octa-repeat region. The measured affinities are comparable with the two lowest affinity sites of the five-site wild type protein. The contribution to Cu(II) binding of the putative fifth site, based around histidine residues at positions 96 and 111, were also investigated. Mutants with histidine to alanine substitutions were produced. Alanine is considered innocent in metal binding. Titration of (PrPH96A,H111A) in which both histidines are substituted results in best fit isotherms for a four-binding-site model; Fig. 3. Surprisingly the χ2 value for a five-site fit to the data was >30 times that of the four-site model, the next closest fit being three sites with a four times greater χ2. Again, the first Cu(II) binds with the highest affinity to 1012.2 m–1 (fm) and the subsequent three sites from 1010.7 to 1010.1 m–1. To probe the contributions of the individual histidine residues, the individual mutants PrPH96A and PrPH111A were produced. ITC data show that Cu(II) binding to the two histidine residues is not equivalent. The mutant PrPH96A fits a binding isotherm largely similar to the wild type protein; however, a five-site model always produces the best fit (lowest χ2). Comparison of the log β5 values shows the combined affinities of the wild type and PrPH96A species to be identical. The PrPH111A mutant, however, consistently fits a four-site model and in this respect more closely resembles the double mutant species. Curiously, however, this single mutant species shows a trend to lower affinity Cu(II) binding than even the double mutant PrPH96A,H111A, with the first Cu(II) binding at 1011.1 m–1 and a log β4 value of 40.5 (versus PrPH96A,H111A log β4 = 43.5) Verification Using Competitive Metal Capture Analysis—The results from ITC analysis present a range of affinities for the wild type PrP protein suggestive of high affinity. Previous studies of Cu(II) affinity for PrP have been repeatedly unable to provide values that could be reproduced using different methods. It was, therefore, essential that we demonstrate the values obtained using ITC are not simply a result of the chosen technique. We used a second technique to assess the affinity of Cu(II) for PrP. This technique involved competing PrP with a range of chelators of known affinity listed in TABLE TWO and assessing the amount of Cu(II) bound to the protein. This technique differs markedly from ITC in that it assesses the ability of PrP to compete with a range of other molecules but maintains Cu(II) in a chelated form. The assessment of Cu(II) binding is retention of Cu(II) by the protein and not energy release. In this way PrP could be ranked with other Cu(II) binding molecules by direct observation. For this study three non-tagged forms of PrP were used: the wild type protein (PrP-(23–231)), the octameric repeat deletion (PrP-(Δ51–89)), and a tr"

Here we present evidence that the K+ channel Kv4.2, which is a major regulator of dendritic excitability, is transported to dendrites by the kinesin isoform Kif17. We show that a dominant negative construct against Kif17 dramatically inhibits localization to dendrites of both introduced and endogenous Kv4.2, but those against other kinesins found in dendrites do not.

The interaction between Kif17 and Kv4.2 appears to occur through the extreme C terminus of Kv4.2 and not through the dileucine motif. Thus, the dileucine motif does not determine the localization of Kv4.2 by causing the channel to interact with a specific motor protein. In support of this conclusion, we found that the dileucine motif mediates dendritic targeting of CD8 independent of Kif17.

The electrophysiological properties of neurons arise from an intricate spatial distribution of ion channels and receptors on the plasma membranes of these cells. The complexity of this distribution is illustrated by experiments showing that nearly 500 distinct proteins reside at the postsynaptic density (1Yoshimura Y. Yamauchi Y. Shinkawa T. Taoka M. Donai H. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Yamauchi T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), each of which must be regulated at over 10,000 postsynaptic sites in a typical cortical pyramidal neuron (2White E.L. Cortical Circuits. Birkhauser, Boston1989Crossref Google Scholar). The fidelity of this distribution is critical, since mislocalization of ion channels and receptors can lead to the breakdown of signal transduction cascades that are essential for physiological functioning of neurons (3Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). These and many other observations suggest that neurons can create and maintain complex subcellular distributions of proteins. However, little is known about how this is accomplished at the molecular level. Progress toward elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying subcellular localization of neuronal proteins has been made by identifying targeting motifs within the primary structure of transmembrane proteins that are localized in distinct subcellular compartments (4Garrido J.J.

Quick M.W. Liman E.R. Arnold D.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is a major regulator of excitability in the dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells in the CA1 region, and its presence in dendrites but not axons is thought to account for the propagation of action potentials exclusively in the latter compartment (11Johnston D. Hoffman D.A. Colbert C.M. Magee J.C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We previously identified a 16-amino acid dileucine-containing motif, located in the C terminus of Kv4.2 (10Rivera J.F. Ahmad S. Quick M.W. Liman E.R. Arnold D.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), that is both necessary for dendritic targeting of the channel and sufficient to induce nonspecifically localized transmembrane proteins to target to dendrites. Recent experiments suggest that some transmembrane proteins are localized in dendrites as a result of directed vesicular transport (12Burack M.A. Silverman M.A. Banker G. Neuron. 2000; 26: 465-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and that transport of proteins from the cell body to dendrites is mediated by kinesins (13Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 14Setou M. Seog D.H. Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Takei Y. Kawagishi M. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2002; 417: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, we sought to identify the kinesin isoform responsible for transporting Kv4.2 and to examine a possible role for this kinesin in dendritic targeting of the channel. By screening a series of dominant negative constructs directed against specific kinesins, we identified Kif17 as being necessary for localization of Kv4.2. We established that Kif17 and Kv4.2 probably interact by showing that native forms of the two proteins colocalize in dissociated neurons and coimmunoprecipitate from brain lysate. Introduced forms of the two proteins coimmunoprecipitate when coexpressed in COS cells. The interaction between Kv4.2 and Kif17, which may be direct or indirect, is mediated by the extreme C terminus of the channel and not by the dileucine motif. Together, our results indicate that Kv4.2 is probably transported to the dendrites by Kif17. DNA Constructions—Kif17 was amplified from mouse cDNA using PCR. The dominant negative kinesin constructs were generated by replacing the motor domains of the respective kinesin molecules with GFP 3The abbreviations used are: GFPgreen fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininPBSphosphate-buffered salineDNKifdominant negative kinesinADRaxon/dendrite ratioERendoplasmic reticulum. or YFP and placing the resulting constructs in the mammalian expression vector GW. For DNKif21B, amino acids 2-530 were deleted; for DNKif5B, amino acids 2-366 were deleted; for DNKif5A, amino acids 2-373 were deleted; and for DNKif17, amino acids 2-323 were deleted. Because KifC2 has its motor region on the C terminus, amino acids 370-792 were deleted and replaced with YFP. Two tagged constructs were made for wild-type kinesins, one with GFP or YFP and the other with a double HA epitope tag. All of the tags were on the N terminus except those for KifC2, which was tagged on the C terminus. Kv4.2 was tagged with GFP on the N terminus to give GFP-Kv4.2. GFP-Kv4.2ΔC was made from GFP-Kv4.2 by deleting 30 amino acids at the extreme C terminus. GFP-Kv4.2C consists of the last 30 amino acids (positions 601-630) of Kv4.2 tagged at the N terminus with GFP. GFP-Kv4.2ΔLL consists of a GFP-tagged version of Kv4.2 with amino acids 474-489 deleted. GFP-Kv4.2TΔLLΔC consists of a GFP-tagged version of the cytoplasmic tail of Kv4.2 with amino acids 474-489 and 601-630 deleted. YFP-LL was made by tagging the amino acids 474-489 of Kv4.2 with YFP at the N terminus. The construct Kv4.2ΔN was made by deleting amino acids 2-31 of Kv4.2. The inducible Kv4.2, CD8, and CD8-LL constructs were generated by inserting Kv4.2-MYC, CD8, and CD8-LL (10Rivera J.F. Ahmad S. Quick M.W. Liman E.R. Arnold D.B. Nat.

Preparation of Dissociated Cell Cultures—Briefly, cortices from either embryonic day 18 Sprague-Dawley rats or embryonic day 18 CD1 mice were dissected in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). Cortices were dissociated by incubating in papain enzyme solution (100 mm CaCl2, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (ICN), 100 units of papain (Sigma)) in Earle's balanced salt solution (final pH 7.4) for 30 min. Dissociated cortical neurons were plated on polylysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 1 × 105 neurons/well in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 ml/liter GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 1 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen), 20 ml/liter B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), and 50 ml/liter fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The medium was changed after 1 h to neurobasal medium without serum and changed every 4 days thereafter. Dissociated cell cultures at 11-15 days in vitro, and COS-7 cells were transfected with DNA constructs using either the Calphos transfection system (BD Biosciences) or Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen), respectively, using procedures suggested by the respective manufacturers. Immunocytochemisty of Dissociated Neuronal Cultures—The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). This was followed by a permeabilization step and a blocking step with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). After blocking, primary antibody was diluted in blocking solution and added for 30-120 min. Secondary antibody was diluted in blocking solution and added for 30 min in the dark. Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: rabbit anti-GFP 1:2000 (BD Biosciences), mouse anti-MYC 1:1000 (Covance), mouse anti-HA 1:1000 (Covance), rabbit anti-Kv4.2 1:2000 (Alomone Labs), rabbit anti-GluR2 1:200 (Chemicon), and rabbit anti-Kif17 (Abcam). Antibody labeling was then visualized by incubating cells with Alexa 488-, Alexa 594-, and Alexa 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Slice Immunocytochemistry—Culturing of slices was previously described (15Arnold D.B. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Following incubation for 4 h, the slices were transfected using the Helios gene gun (Bio-Rad). Slices were then stained for total protein after incubation for 3 days. Slices were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose for 30 min, incubated in blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin, 10% normal goat serum, 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antibody for 1 h. Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-GFP, 1:2000 (BD Biosciences); chicken anti-β-galactosidase 1:1000 (ICL), mouse anti-MYC 1:500 (Covance), and mouse anti-CD8 1:50 (Dako). They were then incubated in secondary antibody for 1 h. Antibody labeling was visualized by Alexa 594-, Alexa 488-, and Alexa 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Slices were then cleared with xylene and mounted. Induction of Expression—Constructs driven by the pIND promoter (Invitrogen) were cotransfected into neurons in cortical slices with the pVgRXR vector and incubated for 24 h. They were subsequently induced using ponasterone A (Invitrogen), which was added to a final concentration of 5 μm in the slice culture medium. Immunocytochemistry was performed after an additional 48 h of incubation. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—COS cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes to about 80% confluent and transfected with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) using 0.5 μg of each expression plasmid according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then washed twice with PBS 48 h after transfection and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors (0.12 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The following steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. After cell lysates were incubated for 1 h, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants normalized for protein content were precleared with protein A-agarose (ImmunoPure immobilized protein A; Pierce) for 1 h. Rabbit anti-GFP antibody or normal rabbit IgG (BD Biosciences) was added to precleared supernatants and incubated with inversion overnight. Protein A-agarose was added to the immune complexes, and the mixtures were further incubated with inversion for 3 h followed by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 5 min. The precipitates were washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and eluted in SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 80 mm EDTA, 4% SDS, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue). For immunoprecipitation of endogenous Kv4.2 from brain lysate, the preparation of postnuclear supernatant and the immunoprecipitation reaction were performed as previously described (16Cavalli V. Kujala P. Klumperman J. Goldstein L.S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly, adult mouse brains were homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (8% sucrose, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors. The brain postnuclear supernatant was collected by removing pellets under centrifugation of 1,000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was further diluted in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with protease inhibitors) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Extracts were then clarified twice by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble material. Following preclearing with protein A-agarose for 1 h, the resulting brain lysate was incubated with rabbit anti-Kv4.2 polyclonal antibody (Alomone Labs) or normal rabbit IgG with inversion for overnight. Protein A-agarose was added to the immunocomplexes, and the mixtures were further incubated with inversion for 3 h followed by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 5 min. The precipitates were washed five times with PBS and eluted in SDS sample buffer. For Western blotting, protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The resulting blots were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST; 500 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The blots were incubated with specific primary antibodies mouse anti-HA (1:1,000; Covance), mouse anti-GFP (1:500; Molecular Probes), rabbit anti-Kif17 (1:1000; Abcam), or rabbit anti-Kv4.2 (1:2,000; Alomone Labs) at 4 °C overnight and washed three times in TBST, followed by incubation with corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) or donkey anti-rabbit (1:5,000; Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature. After washing three times in TBST, the blots were visualized using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Regent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by exposure to BioMax Light films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Image Capture and Analysis—All imaging was done on a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope. Each cell was imaged as a stack of optical sections, 1 μm in depth apart. All calculations were performed on compressed images. For each cell, images of expressed constructs were taken using the 488-, 568-, and 647-nm laser lines at the same settings. Each construct was imaged in cells that were taken from at least three different slices. For neurons in a slice, the axon was identified as a single process that (i) projected in a direction opposite to that of the cortical surface and the apical dendrite and (ii) was clearly longer than any dendrite (15Arnold D.B. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To quantify the degree of polarization in the distribution of a particular protein, we calculated the axon/dendrite ratio (ADR). ADR was defined as the ratio of the amount of protein in the axon versus that in the dendrites normalized by the ratio of the volume of the axon versus that of the dendrite (10Rivera J.F. Ahmad S. Quick M.W. Liman E.R. Arnold D.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This normalization was used because the axonal compartments tended to be much smaller than the dendritic compartments and could vary greatly in size. Expression levels were determined by calculating the total amount of fluorescence associated with a given protein in the entire cell. Only expression levels of proteins detected by the same antibodies were compared. The ratio of the expression level of Kv4.2 in the dendrites versus the cell body was calculated as follows. The average intensity of fluorescence associated with Kv4.2 staining was measured in the cell body and at points 25 μm from the cell body on three dendrites for cells in dissociated culture and on the apical dendrite alone for cells in slices. The ratio of the dendritic value to that of the cell body was calculated for individual neurons. All analyses were performed by blinded observers. Identification of a Kinesin Isoform Necessary for Localization of Kv4.2—In order to understand the contribution of kinesin motors to dendritic targeting of Kv4.2, we sought to identify the kinesin isoform responsible for transporting this channel. We created dominant negative variants of five different kinesin family members, Kif5A, Kif5B, Kif17, Kif21B, and KifC2, by replacing their motor domains with GFP (Fig. 1A). We chose Kif17 and Kif5B, because they have already been shown to transport the dendritic ion channels, NR2B and GluR2, respectively (13Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 14Setou M. Seog D.H. Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Takei Y. Kawagishi M. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2002; 417: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 17Guillaud L. Setou M. Hirokawa N. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 131-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, dominant negative variants of Kif17 and Kif5B were shown to block transport of the two channels (14Setou M. Seog D.H. Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Takei Y. Kawagishi M. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2002; 417: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 17Guillaud L. Setou M. Hirokawa N. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 131-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kif5A, Kif21B, and KifC2 were chosen, because they are found in dendrites (18Hanlon D.W. Yang Z. Goldstein L.S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 439-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Saito N. Okada Y. Noda Y. Kinoshita Y. Kondo S. Hirokawa N. Neuron. 1997; 18: 425-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Niclas J. Navone F. Hom-Booher N. Vale R.D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1059-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We assayed the effectiveness of dominant negative kinesins (DNKifs) by assessing whether any of them blocked dendritic localization of introduced Kv4.2 in neurons in cortical slices. The effects of DNKifs could be assessed accurately only if they were expressed at levels sufficient to block endogenous kinesin prior to expression of Kv4.2-MYC. To accomplish this, DNKifs under the control of a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter were expressed in cortical neurons, and 24 h subsequently, Kv4.2-MYC was expressed in the same cells using an inducible ecdysone promoter (Fig. 1B). Examination of the expression patterns of Kv4.2 in cells in which DNKifs had been expressed revealed a striking pattern; in cells where a dominant negative variant of the Kif17 molecule (GFP-DNKif17) was expressed, Kv4.2-MYC was almost completely confined to the cell body, whereas in cells where GFP-DNKif5A, GFP-DNKif5B, YFP-DNKifC2, or GFP-DNKif21B was expressed, Kv4.2-MYC was present throughout the dendrites at distances over 150 μm from the cell body (Fig. 1C, data not shown). In order to quantify the effect of particular DNKifs on localization of Kv4.2, we calculated the ratio of the expression level of the tagged channel in the dendrites versus that in the cell body. Lower ratios indicate that a protein is localized preferentially to the cell body, consistent with blocking of transport to the dendrites of that protein. The quantified results corroborated our qualitative observations. In cells expressing GFP-DNKif17, the dendrite/cell body ratio of Kv4.2-MYC was 0.06 ± 0.003 (n = 25; Fig. 1D), indicating that the channel was highly concentrated in the cell body (Fig. 1D). In cells expressing dominant negative variants of four other kinesins found in dendrites, Kv4.2-MYC had average dendrite/cell body ratios that were significantly larger than the average for Kv4.2-MYC in GFP-DNKif17-expressing cells (p < 0.001), indicating that in the former cells, the channel was localized to the dendrites to a much greater extent than in the latter (Fig. 1D). Relatively high dendrite/cell body ratios were also obtained for Kv4.2-MYC in cells expressing introduced, full-length Kif17 (0.45 ± 0.06, n = 33; Fig. 1D). This latter control is particularly important, because it indicates that GFP-DNKif17 is probably not blocking localization of Kv4.2 by merely sequestering other proteins and preventing them from participating in localization. The mean expression levels of Kv4.2-MYC in each case were not dramatically different, which indicates that lack of transport was not due to inhibition of Kv4.2-MYC expression (Fig. 1D). In order to determine whether GFP-DNKif17 was blocking protein transport nonspecifically, we examined its effect on transport of CD8. We found that in cells expressing GFP-DNKif17, CD8 was localized throughout the axons and dendrites with a dendrite/cell body ratio of 0.64 ± 0.07 (Fig. 1D), indicating that protein transport was not blocked nonspecifically. We also confirmed that GFP-DNKif17 effectively blocked localization of introduced NR2B in slices (data not shown), and GFP-DNKif5B blocked localization of endogenous GluR2 in dissociated neuronal cultures (Fig. 1E), as reported previously (14Setou M. Seog D.H. Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Takei Y. Kawagishi M. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2002; 417: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 17Guillaud L. Setou M. Hirokawa N. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 131-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, to ensure that GFP-DNKif17 did not block localization of dendritically targeted proteins nonspecifically, we demonstrated that it did not block localization of endogenous GluR2 in culture (Fig. S1). To further demonstrate that Kif17 plays an important role in localization of Kv4.2, we expressed GFP-DNKif17 in cortical neurons in dissociated culture and examined its effect on the localization pattern of the endogenous channel. We found that 48 h after expression of GFP-DNKif17, endogenous Kv4.2 was localized in the cell body and almost absent from dendrites, consistent with transport of the channel being blocked (Fig. 2A). CD8, which was coexpressed with GFP-DNKif17, was localized throughout the cell, indicating that protein transport was not blocked nonspecifically. As controls, we examined the localization of endogenous Kv4.2 either following expression of GFP-DNKif5B or in untransfected cells. In both cases, endogenous Kv4.2 was localized throughout the dendrites, indicating that transport was not affected (Fig. 2B, data not shown). We found that in cells expressing GFP-DNKif17, the dendrite/cell body ratio of endogenous Kv4.2 was 0.06 ± 0.01 (Fig. 2C), which is significantly lower than the ratio for either cells expressing GFP-DNKif5B (0.4 ± 0.05, p < 0.0001) or for untransfected cells (0.5 ± 0.2, p < 0.0001). From these results, we conclude that Kif17 is essential for localization to dendrites of both introduced Kv4.2-MYC and the endogenous channel and that Kv4.2 is probably transported by Kif17. To further test the hypothesis that Kif17 transports Kv4.2 to dendrites, we examined whether the two proteins colocalize in neurons. We expressed a tagged version of the kinesin (HA-Kif17) in neurons in dissociated cultures and found that the expression pattern of HA-Kif17 overlapped with that of endogenous Kv4.2 (Fig. 3A). To further confirm that Kv4.2 colocalizes specifically with Kif17, we introduced a tagged version of the channel along with tagged versions of various kinesin isoforms into neurons in dissociated cultures. We found that introduced Kv4.2ΔN-MYC colocalized with YFP-Kif17 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, Kv4.2ΔN-MYC did not colocalize with either YFP-Kif5A, YFP-Kif5B, YFP-Kif21B, or YFP-KifC2 (Fig. S2). Characterization of the Interaction between Kv4.2 and Kif17—To determine whether Kif17 associates with Kv4.2, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using lysate from homogenized mouse brains. We found that anti-Kv4.2 antibody coimmunoprecipitated Kif17, indicating that Kv4.2 and Kif17 probably are part of a complex in vivo (Fig. 4A). To further explore the interaction between these two proteins, we expressed tagged versions of both proteins in COS-7 cells and performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. GFP-labeled, full-length Kv4.2 and similarly labeled Kv4.2 deletion constructs were each immunoprecipitated, and the immunocomplex was probed for HA-tagged kinesins. We found that, as with the endogenous proteins, introduced HA-Kif17 coprecipitated with expressed Kv4.2 (Fig. 4B). Identifying the region on Kv4.2 that mediates attachment to the kinesin-containing complex could have important implications for mechanisms of dendritic targeting of the channel. In particular, we were interested in knowing whether the dileucine motif of Kv4.2 mediates this attachment. A precedent for a binding scheme of this nature comes from the man-nose 6-phosphate receptor, which attaches to the adaptor protein AP-1 via a tyrosine-containing targeting motif. AP-1, in turn, binds to the kinesin Kif13A (21Nakagawa T. Setou M. Seog D. Ogasawara K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hirokawa N. Cell. 2000; 103: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that Kv4.2 binds to the kinesin-containing complex through its extreme C terminus, in a manner similar to GluR2 and NR2B (13Setou M. Nakagawa T. Seog D.H. Hirokawa N. Science. 2000; 288: 1796-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 14Setou M. Seog D.H. Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Takei Y. Kawagishi M. Hirokawa N. Nature. 2002; 417: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we coexpressed the 30 amino acids at the extreme C terminus of Kv4.2 (Kv4.2C, amino acids 601-630), tagged with GFP, with HA-tagged Kif17 in COS cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody and immunoblotting with anti-HA confirmed that the HA-Kif17 coprecipitates with GFP-Kv4.2C, indicating that Kv4.2C is sufficient to bind, either directly or indirectly, to Kif17 (Fig. 4B). The extreme C-terminal region appears to also be necessary for binding of Kv4.2 to Kif17, since a recombinant protein consisting of Kv4.2 lacking these 30 amino acids, GFP-Kv4.2ΔC, does not coprecipitate with HA-Kif17 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the 16-amino acid dileucine-containing motif from the C terminus of Kv4.2 (amino acids 474-489) tagged with YFP (YFP-LL) does not coprecipitate with HA-Kif17, indicating that Kif17 does not have a strong interaction with Kv4.2 through the dileucine motif. Moreover, a Kv4.2 mutant protein that lacks the dileucine motif, GFP-Kv4.2ΔLL, coimmunoprecipitates with HA-Kif17, indicating that the motif is not necessary for interaction with Kif17. Additional experiments showed that Kv4.2 lacking the 30 amino acids at the extreme N terminus (GFP-Kv4.2ΔN) coprecipitated with HA-Kif17, indicating that this region is not necessary for interaction with the kinesin-containing comp"

The disease is characterized by hypercholesterolemia, tendon xanthomas, and premature coronary heart disease. FH is one of the most common genetic disorders with a prevalence of heterozygotes of about one in 500 in most western countries. On a worldwide basis it has been estimated that more than 10 million people have FH, of which as many as 200,000 die of premature coronary heart disease each year (2Williams R.R. Hamilton-Craig W.R.

The LDLR is a cell surface glycoprotein composed of several structural domains that mediates the specific binding and uptake of apoB- and apoE-containing lipoproteins by receptor-mediated endocytosis (1Goldstein J.L.

LDLR is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a partially glycosylated precursor with an apparent molecular mass of 120 kDa (3Tolleshaug H. Goldstein J.L. Schneider W.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1982; 30: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Within 30–45 min the receptor is transported to the Golgi where the oligosaccarides are modified and the apparent molecular mass of the receptor is increased to 160 kDa. The 160-kDa form is transported to the cell surface, where it mediates the uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Different mutations in the LDLR gene have different effects on the receptor protein function. This has led to a classification of mutations into five functional classes: 1) null alleles that fail to produce receptor protein, 2) transport-defective alleles that encode receptors that are completely (class 2a) or partially (class 2b) blocked in the transport from ER to Golgi, 3) binding defective alleles that fail to bind LDL, 4) internalization-defective alleles that fail to internalize LDL by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and 5) recycling-deficient alleles that fail to release the ligand in the endosomes and thus do not recycle to the cell surface (4Hobbs H.H.

Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, many mutant LDLR alleles produce receptors that fall into more than one of these classes. Class 2 mutations are the most predominant class of mutations and account for more than 50% of the mutations causing FH (4Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). These mutations might not necessarily affect the ability of the receptor to bind LDL, but abnormal folding prevents it from reaching the cell surface. FH has therefore been classified as a protein conformation disease (6Aridor M. Balch W.E. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) or an ER storage disease (7Rutishauser J. Spiess M. Swiss Med. Wkly. 2004; 132: 211-222Google Scholar, 8Kim P.S. Arvan P. Endocr.

On one hand, properly folded proteins must be guided from the ER to their final destination within the cell, and on the other hand, misfolded proteins that may be toxic to the cell must be disposed of without compromising normal cell function. This quality control system is based on common structural and biophysical features that distinguish native from non-native protein conformations. Folding is assisted by a variety of folding enzymes and chaperones with different properties and functions (9Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). The main role of these components is to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation, which could cause cellular dysfunction (10Barral J.M. Broadley S.A. Schaffar G. Hartl F.U. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 11Sitia R. Braakman I. Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER has been shown to cause ER stress and activation of a protective response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (12Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The UPR is mediated by three ER-resident transmembrane proteins that act as proximal sensors of ER stress: the type I transmembrane protein kinase and endoribonuclease (IRE1), the RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) ((14Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). UPR increases the folding capacity of the secretory pathway through transcriptional up-regulation of an array of genes required for protein folding, ER expansion, ER-Golgi trafficking, and ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which together act to relieve stress within the ER (15Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Although FH is a monogenic disease, the phenotypic expression, in terms of onset and severity of atherosclerotic disease, varies considerably. The phenotype differs substantially even among individuals who have the same genetic defect (16van Aalst Cohen E. Jansen A.C. de Jongh S. de Sauvage N.P.R Kastelein J.J. Semin. Vasc. Med. 2004; 4: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Leren T.P. Tonstad S. Gundersen K.E. Bakken K.S. Rodningen O.K. Sundvold H. Ose L. Berg K. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 241: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to risk factors of environmental and metabolic origin, other genetic factors are suggested to contribute to the phenotypic variation of FH (16van Aalst Cohen E. Jansen A.C. de Jongh S. de Sauvage N.P.R Kastelein J.J. Semin. Vasc. Med. 2004; 4: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Jansen A.C.M Aalst-Cohen E.S. Tanck M.W.T Cheng S. Fontecha M.R. Li J. Defesche J.C. Kastelein J.J.P Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1475-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is possible that differences in the quality control systems within the ER, as well as differences in the ERAD (19McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 868-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), could explain some of the phenotypic variation. To test this hypothesis there is a need to understand how class 2 mutants interact with the ER quality control components. To identify chaperones/folding enzymes interacting with the LDLR, we have used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with either wild-type LDLR or a class 2a mutant LDLR where glycine in codon 544 has been substituted with valine (20Tolleshaug H. Hobgood K.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1983; 32: 941-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Esser V. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13276-13281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified three chaperones and one folding enzyme interacting with the mutant LDLR. In addition, we show for the first time that the retention of misfolded LDLR in ER leads to ER stress and activation of UPR. To obtain regulated expression of LDLR, we used pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen). This plasmid contains a hybrid promoter consisting of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and two tetracycline operator 2 sites for tetracycline-regulated expression in mammalian cells transfected with the tetracycline repressor. The plasmid pcDNA4-LDLR was constructed by transferring the LDLR cDNA from the plasmid pGEM 3zf+ containing the LDLR cDNA (kindly provided by Niels Gregersen, Aarhus University, Denmark) to pcDNA4/TO. To facilitate sorting of transfected cells and to visualize the LDLR expression in living cells, an enhanced yellow-green fluorescence protein (EYFP) tag was inserted at the carboxyl terminus of the LDLR separated by a 10-amino acid linker. This linker contained repetitive sequences of serine, threonine, and glycine (22Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Science. 2002; 297: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar) and was prepared by synthesizing a double-stranded DNA from the oligonucleotide 5′-TCGTGAAGCTACGGTACCAGGCTCCACCGGCTCCACCGGCTCCACCGGCGCGGATCCTCGACGTACGAT-3′ (containing the restriction sites for KpnI and BamHI, indicated in bold type) using the primer 5′-ATC GTA CGT CGA GGA TCC GC-3′ and the DNA polymerase Klenow. This linker was digested with KpnI and BamHI and ligated into the similarly digested pEYFP-N1 (Clontech). The LDLR cDNA was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-CTCAAGCTTGGGCTGCAGGTCGA-3′ containing a HindIII site (bold type) and the reverse primer 5′-GATGGTACCGCCACGTCATC CTCCA-3′ containing a KpnI site (bold type), which mutate the termination codon tga to gta (bold and underlined, complementary strand). The plasmid pGEM 3zf+ with LDLR cDNA was used as a template. Following digestion with HindIII and KpnI, the amplified LDLR cDNA was ligated upstream of the linker in pEYFP-N1 generating pLDLR-linker-EYFP-N1. Finally, the pLDLR-linker-EYFP-N1 was digested with HindIII and NotI to isolate the fragment containing LDLR, linker, and EYFP, and this fragment was ligated into a similarly digested pcDNA4/TO to generate pcDNA4-LDLR-EYFP. The G544V mutant LDLR with or without EYFP was generated from pcDNA4-LDLR-EYFP and pcDNA4-LDLR, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotide: 5′-ATTCAGTGGCCCAATGTCATCACCCTAGAT-3′ (mutated nucleotide in bold type) was used to change codon 544 from GGC encoding glycine to GTC encoding valine. The integrity of all of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The T-Rex-CHO cell line stably expressing the tetracycline repressor (Invitrogen) was maintained in complete medium: Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Euroclone), 50 units/ml penicillin (Euroclone, UK), 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Euroclone), and 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). T-Rex-CHO were transfected with pcDNA4-LDLR, pcDNA4-LDLR-G544V, pcDNA4-LDLR-EYFP, or pcDNA4-G544V-LDLR-EYFP using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The Zeocin resistance gene in pcDNA4 allows selection of cell lines with stable expression of wild-type LDLR or G544V mutant LDLR. The transfected cells were grown in complete medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). After 3–4 weeks the cells expressing LDLR with an EYFP tag were given 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Invitrogen) and sorted in a FACS-Diva (BD Biosciences). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to determine the cellular localization of the LDLR-EYFP and to analyze the LDLR activity by measuring internalization of LDL in transfected CHO cells. The cells were plated on fibronectin-coated glass slides (BD Biosciences) and allowed to adhere overnight. The expression of LDLR was induced by adding tetracycline (1 μg/ml). LDLR Localization—The cells were fixed and permeabilized by incubation in 70% ethanol for 10 min and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For staining of LDLR without EYFP tag, the cells were incubated with IgG-C7 mouse monoclonal antibody (Progen Biotechnik). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells in blocking solution (PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 1 h at room temperature, before incubating with IgG-C7 (1:20 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature and washing three times in blocking solution. IgG-C7 was detected by incubating with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. To visualize ER the cells were incubated with concanavalin A tetramethylrhodamine conjugate (1:100, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times in PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich). LDLR Activity—Transfected cells were incubated in complete medium containing 20 μg/ml fluorescent LDL (LDL conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555; Molecular Probes) for 4 h at 37 °C. Following the incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS with 0.5% BSA before fixation in a 4% methanol-free formaldehyde solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature. The slides were mounted with SlowFade Antifade solution including 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole nuclear counterstain (Molecular Probes) to prevent photo bleaching. The slides were examined by a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) using the 100× oil objective. Image processing was carried out using Photoshop version 5.5 (Adobe Systems). Transfected CHO cells stimulated with tetracycline (1 μg/ml) for 24 h were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml blasticidin, 100 μg/ml zeocin, and 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 30 min to deplete intracellular pools of methionine and cysteine. 20 μl of 0.1 mCi/ml Promix ([35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine; Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the cells were labeled for 10 min. The chase periode was initiated with two washes with PBS followed by incubation in complete medium for 5–45 min. The cells were lysed at 4 °C for 30 min using lysis buffer A: 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science number 1,697,498) and harvested by scraping. The lysates were sonicated for 5–10 s and centrifuged to remove cell debris. The cell lysates were incubated with 25 μl of sheep anti-rabbit conjugated Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech) for 1 h at 4°C with end-over-end mixing to remove nonspecific binding to the beads. LDLRs were then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using 1 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-LDLR antibody (antibody 61099; Progen Biotechnik). To capture the immunocomplexes, the samples were incubated with sheep anti-rabbit IgG Dynabeads for 1 h at 4°C. The beads with captured immunocomplexes were washed three times in lysis buffer A and three times in PBS with 0.1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 and eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (1% SDS, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12.5% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 2.5% mercapto-ethanol). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7%). The gel was dried and exposed in a Phosphorous screen, and the signal was analyzed using a PhosphorImager. The cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C using lysis buffer A and harvested by scraping. After thoroughly vortexing for 30 min, the lysates were centrifuged to remove the Triton-insoluble fraction. For cross-linking of proteins, the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 mm dithiobis succinimidyl propionate (DSP) (Sigma-Aldrich) and quenched with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) for 20 min before lysis in lysis buffer A. Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described, except that increased amounts of sheep anti-rabbit conjugated Dynabeads (100 μl) and rabbit polyclonal anti-LDLR antibody (4 μg) or normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) were used. The captured immunocomplexes were washed three times in lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were run on 4–20% Tris-HCl gradient gel at 200 V for 1 h. The proteins were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. To omit detection of heavy and light chain of rabbit IgG, the blots were cut at approximately 60 kDa. The blots were probed with primary antibodies polyclonal rabbit anti-LDLR (Progen Biotechnik) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Grp78, rat monoclonal anti-Grp94, rabbit polyclonal anti-ERp72, and rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin (all four obtained from StressGen Bio-technologies) and incubated with appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), before the proteins were visualized using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad) was used to detect the signals. Protein concentrations in cell lysates were determined using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 20 μg of cell protein diluted to 20 μl in PBS was added 10 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described above. The Triton-insoluble fraction was solved by adding 50 μl of Laemmli buffer, sonicated for 30 s, and boiled with 5% mercaptoethanol for 10 min. The samples were diluted 1:1 before subjected to SDS-PAGE. The primary antibodies used were: mouse monoclonal anti-KDEL (recognizes Grp78), rat monoclonal anti-Grp94, rabbit polyclonal anti-ERp72, rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin (all four obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies), and polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-PERK (Cell Signaling). The Quantity One software in the ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad) was used for quantification of band intensity. The concentrations of all of the antibodies were optimized to achieve detection with low background and dose-dependent increase in signal intensity. mRNA was isolated by using Dynabeads oligo(dT)25 (Dynal Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. mRNA was eluted in 0.05 m MOPS (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 5.6% formaldehyde, and 40% formamide. Loading buffer (2 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 1% Ficoll 400, and 0.025% bromphenol blue) was added, and the mRNA was separated on 1% agarose gels containing 6.7% formaldehyde. RNA was blotted onto nylon membranes (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences), and hybridization was carried out according to Church and Gilbert (23Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). For detection of Grp78, Grp94, and ERp72 mRNA, cDNA clones obtained from ATCC were used (human Grp78, ATCC number 6933965; mouse Grp94, ATCC number 5748980; and human ERp72, ATCC number 5297113). For the detection of β-actin mRNA, the mouse β-actin cDNA probe (A9715; Sigma-Aldrich) was used. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—CHO cells stably transfected with wild-type or G544V mutant LDLR were transiently transfected with the firefly luciferase reporter constructs: pGrp78-GL3 or p5xUPRE-GL3 (both were kindly provided by Ron Prywes, Dept. of Biological Science at Columbia University) and pRL-SV40 (Promega) encoding Renilla luciferase, using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). Each transfection mixture for a 3.5-cm2 well contained 2 ml of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen), 4 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen), 1 μg of the expression constructs, and 0.1 μg pRL-SV40 (internal control). The CHO cells were transfected for 5 h before the medium was exchanged with fresh complete medium. Following 24 h of incubation, tetracycline was added, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. The transfected cells were lysed, and the firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase kit (Promega). The results were normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity of the pRL-SV40 internal control. The transfection efficacy was analyzed by flow cytometry of cells transfected with 1 μg of pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) and found to be about 50%. Total RNA was isolated from CHO cells expressing wild-type or G544V mutant LDLR using QIAamp RNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed using a Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit and the primers 5′-AGTGGCCGGGTCTGCTGAGT-3′ and 5′-AATCCATGGGGAGATGTTCTGG-3′. The conditions used for the RT-PCR were: reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min, initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 3.5% MetaPhor gel (Cambrex Bio Science), which was stained with ethidium bromide. RNA isolated from CHO cells treated with 5 mm dithiothreitol for 24 h was used as a positive control for XBP-1 mRNA splicing. T-Rex CHO cells were stably transfected with wild-type LDLR or G544V mutant LDLR. To enable induced expression of LDLR, we used a cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter containing two tetracycline operator 2 elements. T-Rex CHO cells express a tetracycline repressor, which interacts with the tetracycline operator 2 elements, prevents expression in the absence of tetracycline, and enables induced expression by adding tetracycline. To facilitate sorting of transfected cells and to visualize the LDLR expression in living cells, an EYFP tag was added at the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. The EYFP tag introduced an ∼30-kDa increase in the molecular size of the synthesized LDLR. To study whether the EYFP interfered with the biosynthesis of the LDLR, we performed [35S]methionine/cysteine pulse-chase experiments in CHO cells transfected with wild-type LDLR after incubation with tetracycline for 24 h. The maturation of wild-type LDLR from precursor to mature form occurred within 45 min, irrespective of whether the receptor had an EYFP tag (Fig. 1A). This indicates that the EYFP tag does not affect the normal transport of LDLR from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The G544V mutant receptor has previously been shown to be completely retained in the ER (21Esser V. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13276-13281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the G544V mutant LDLR behaved like a class 2a receptor in our model system, Western blot analysis of cell lysates from transfected CHO cells stimulated with tetracycline for 24 h was performed (Fig. 1B). Whereas all of the wild-type receptors were in the mature form, all of the mutant receptors with or without EYFP tags were in the precursor form. Thus, the G544V mutant LDLR was retained in ER and behaved like a class 2a mutant receptor. As shown, the EYFP tag did not alter the biosynthesis of the LDLR. To confirm that the cellular localization of the LDLR was unaffected, we performed confocal fluorescence microscopy. The wild-type LDLR, with or without EYFP tag showed a membrane-associated expression pattern (Fig. 1C). To analyze whether the biological activity of the LDLR was affected by the EYFP tag, the cells ability to internalize fluorescence labeled LDL was tested. As shown in Fig. 1C, CHO cells expressing wild-type LDLR with or without EYFP tag could efficiently internalize LDL. On the other hand, the G544V mutant LDLR exhibited an intracellular distribution with no active receptor on the cell surface. To study whether the intracellular localization was restricted to the ER, co-localization with the lectin concanavalin A was analyzed. Concanavalin A specifically binds to the mannose-rich glycans in the ER (24Virtanen I. Ekblom P. Laurila P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The G544V mutant LDLR was found to co-localize with concanavalin A (Fig. 1D), indicating as shown previously that the G544V mutation give rise to a class 2a transport-deficient LDLR, which is retained in the ER (21Esser V. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13276-13281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all of the following experiments, we used CHO cells stably transfected with wild-type or G544V mutant LDLR containing the EYFP tag. The ER contains a number of folding enzymes and chaperones that facilitate the folding and export of newly synthesized proteins. These enzymes and chaperones also recognize misfolded proteins and prevent their transport from the ER to the Golgi. Previous studies have identified one classical ER chaperone, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78, also designed Bip), interacting with LDLR in the ER and involved in the retention of W556S and C646Y mutant LDLRs in the ER (25Jorgensen M.M. Jensen O.N. Holst H.U. Hansen J.J. Corydon T.J. Bross P. Bolund L. Gregersen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33861-33868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Chaperones in ER have been demonstrated to operate in multiprotein complexes, and we therefore sought to determine whether Grp78 and other chaperones could be found associated with G544V mutant LDLR. The interactions between chaperones and folding polypeptides are transient in nature. To prevent the release of chaperones from the substrates, cross-linking was therefore performed by adding DSP before the cells were solubilized in lysis buffer The Triton-soluble fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the LDLR, and the immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by Western blot analysis. The amount of immunoprecipitated LDLR from the Triton-soluble fraction was reduced in cells treated with DSP (Fig. 2A). Thorough analysis of the Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions prior to immunoprecipitation confirmed that upon cross-linking with DSP a large fraction of the LDLR become Triton-insoluble. We were unable to solve the Triton-insoluble fraction of DSP-treated cells without boiling the fraction with mercaptoethanol. This treatment cleaves the disulfide bond in DSP and split the cross-linked complexes and thus makes the Triton-insoluble fraction unsuitable for further analysis by immunoprecipitation. The Triton-soluble fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation and analyzed for co-immunoprecipitated chaperones. A small but detectable amount of Grp78 co-immunoprecipitated with the wild-type LDLR after cross-linking (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, Grp78 co-immunoprecipitated with the G544V mutant LDLR from cells treated with or without cross-linker. The chaperones Grp94, ERp72, and calnexin were only co-immunoprecipitated with G544V mutant LDLR in cells pretreated with cross-linker. These results indicate that the ER-resident chaperones Grp78, Grp94, ERp72, and calnexin are involved in the retention of the G544V mutant LDLR in ER. Expression of mutant, misfolded proteins has been shown to induce ER stress and activation of UPR. Accumulation of misfolded protei"
https://openalex.org/W2066044406,"mRNA degradation predominantly proceeds through two alternative routes: the 5′→3′ pathway, which requires deadenylation followed by decapping and 5′→3′ hydrolysis; and the 3′→5′ pathway, which involves deadenylation followed by 3′→5′ hydrolysis and finally decapping. The mechanisms and relative contributions of each pathway are not fully understood. We investigated the effects of different cap structure (Gp3G, m7Gp3G, or m27,3′-O Gp3G) and 3′ termini (A31,A60, or G16) on both translation and mRNA degradation in mammalian cells. The results indicated that cap structures that bind eIF4E with higher affinity stabilize mRNA to degradation in vivo. mRNA stability depends on the ability of the 5′ terminus to bind eIF4E, not merely the presence of a blocking group at the 5′-end. Introducing a stem-loop in the 5′-UTR that dramatically reduces translation, but keeping the cap structure the same, does not alter the rate of mRNA degradation. To test the relative contributions of the 5′→3′ versus 3′→5′ pathways, we designed and synthesized two new cap analogs, in which a methylene group was substituted between the α- and β-phosphate moieties, m27,3′-OGppCH2pG and m27,3′-OGpCH2ppG, that are predicted to be resistant to cleavage by Dcp1/Dcp2 and DcpS, respectively. These cap analogs were recognized by eIF4E and conferred cap-dependent translation to mRNA both in vitro and in vivo. Oligonucleotides capped with m27,3′-OGppCH2pG were resistant to hydrolysis by recombinant human Dcp2 in vitro. mRNAs capped with m27,3′-OGppCH2pG, but not m27,3′-OGpCH2ppG, were more stable in vivo, indicating that the 5′→3′ pathway makes a major contribution to overall degradation. Luciferase mRNA containing a 5′-terminal m27,3′-OGppCH2pG and 3′-terminal poly(G) had the greatest stability of all mRNAs tested. mRNA degradation predominantly proceeds through two alternative routes: the 5′→3′ pathway, which requires deadenylation followed by decapping and 5′→3′ hydrolysis; and the 3′→5′ pathway, which involves deadenylation followed by 3′→5′ hydrolysis and finally decapping.

Luciferase mRNA containing a 5′-terminal m27,3′-OGppCH2pG and 3′-terminal poly(G) had the greatest stability of all mRNAs tested. The 5′ terminus of all eukaryotic cellular mRNAs is modified with a 5′–5′ m7GTP-containing cap (1Muthukrishnan S. Both G.W. Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Nature. 1975; 255: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Caps fulfill a variety of functions in the synthesis, translation, and degradation of mRNA. The presence of the 5′ cap structure increases both the accuracy and efficiency of pre-mRNA splicing (2Konarska M.M. Padgett R.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1984; 38: 731-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 3Edery I. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7590-7594Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The cap on pre-mRNA interacts with the nuclear cap-binding complex, which remains bound and plays an active role during RNA processing and export (4Visa N. Izaurralde E. Ferreira J. Daneholt B. Mattaj I. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, the cap structure is required for efficient translation of mRNA. The cap is specifically recognized by the translational initiation factor eIF4E (5Sonenberg N. Rupprecht K.M. Hecht S.M. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Binding of eIF4E to the cap occurs during formation of the 48 S initiation complex, which is rate limiting for translation initiation under normal conditions (7Darnbrough C. Legon S. Hunt T. Jackson R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 379-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 8Safer B. Kemper W. Jagus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3384-3386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the cap serves as one determinant of mRNA degradation. Capped mRNAs are more stable than their uncapped counterparts (9Furuichi Y. LaFiandra A. Shatkin A. Nature. 1977; 266: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The cap structure helps to protect RNA from degradation by 5′→3′-exonucleases located in the cytosol and nucleus, as demonstrated in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae (10Hsu C. Stevens A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4826-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (11Walther T.N. Wittop Koning T.H. Schumperli D. Muller B. RNA (N.

Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar).A second stability element in mRNA is the 3′-terminal poly(A) tract. PABP 2The abbreviations used are: PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; UTR, untranslated region; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ARCAs, anti-reverse cap analogs; pGp*, [3′-32P]guanosine-3′,5′-diphosphate; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate. 2The abbreviations used are: PABP, poly(A)-binding protein; UTR, untranslated region; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ARCAs, anti-reverse cap analogs; pGp*, [3′-32P]guanosine-3′,5′-diphosphate; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate., 3The cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein is referred to as either Pab1 or Pab1p in yeast systems and as either PABP or PABPC in mammalian systems.

Trifillis P. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). PABP also binds to the N terminus of eIF4G (16Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and stabilizes the eIF4G·eIF4E complex, enhancing translational reinitiation (17Wu L. Wells D. Tay J. Mendis D.

Sonenberg N. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1147-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The stimulation conferred by the cap and poly(A) tract are synergistic rather than additive (19Gallie D.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 20Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, for both translation and degradation of mRNA, elements binding to the 5′ and 3′ termini act cooperatively and in close proximity.There are two major pathways by which polyadenylated mRNA is degraded in eukaryotic cells, a 5′→3′ pathway and a 3′→5′ pathway, as well as two specialized routes for aberrant mRNA degradation (21Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In both the 5′→3′ and 3′→5′pathways, shortening of the poly(A) tract initiates mRNA decay. There are several mechanism of deadenylation (21Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), but one of them involves a poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (22Korner C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), an enzyme that has affinity for the cap structure (23Dehlin E. Wormington M. Korner C.G. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Gao M. Fritz D. Ford L. Wilusz J. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27923-27929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This provides another link between events at the 5′- and 3′-ends of mRNA. In the 5′→3′ pathway, removal of the cap structure occurs rapidly after poly(A) tract shortening (26Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This process is facilitated by the decapping enzyme Dcp1/Dcp2, which in turn exposes the transcripts to digestion by a highly processive 5′→3′-exonuclease Xrn1 (10Hsu C. Stevens A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4826-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Dcp2 plays a catalytic role, whereas Dcp1 stimulates Dcp2 activity (27Wang Z. Jiao X. Carr-Schmid A. Kiledjian M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12663-12668Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 28van Dijk E. Cougot N. Meyer S. Babajko S. Wahle E. Seraphin B.

Both the cap and an oligonucleotide chain of at least 25 nucleotides are required for recognition by the Dcp1/Dcp2 complex (27Wang Z. Jiao X. Carr-Schmid A. Kiledjian M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12663-12668Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 30Piccirillo C. Khanna R. Kiledjian M. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1138-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 31Steiger M. Carr-Schmid A. Schwartz D.C. Kiledjian M. Parker R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis by either the Dcp1/Dcp2 complex or Dcp2 alone releases m7GDP, suggesting that the site of cleavage is between the α- and β-phosphate moieties of the cap but not between the β and γ moieties. In the 3′→5′ pathway, deadenylated mRNA is degraded by the exosome in a 3′→5′ direction, as demonstrated both in vitro (32Chen C. Gherzi R. Ong S. Chan E. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 33Mukherjee D. Gao M. O'Connor J.P. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G. Lutz C.S. Wilusz J.

Cell. 2001; 107: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and in vivo (35Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Cell. 2001; 107: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The products are capped oligonucleotides, which are then decapped by a scavenger-decapping enzyme, DcpS (36Liu H. Rodgers N.D. Jiao X. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). DcpS releases m7GMP, suggesting that cleavage occurs between the β- and γ-phosphate moieties.In mammalian cells it was initially thought that the 3′→5′ pathway predominates. This conclusion was partially based on the observation of m7GMP but not m7GDP production (35Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Cell. 2001; 107: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The use of probes against 5′ and 3′ sequences also indicated that 3′→5′ degradation was predominant (35Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Cell. 2001; 107: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, the discovery of Dcp2 in mammalian cells opened the possibility that 5′→3′ degradation can also play a significant role. Additionally, it was shown that DcpS can efficiently convert m7GDP to m7GMP in extracts of both yeast and human cells, suggesting that m7GMP production does not allow one to distinguish between the two pathways (37van Dijk E. Le Hir H. Seraphin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12081-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At present, the relative contributions of 3′→5′ and 5′→3′ pathways in mammalian mRNA degradation are unclear.Several lines of evidence suggest that the presence of a poly(A) tract inhibits decapping. First, deadenylation precedes decapping regardless of whether the rate of deadenylation is increased or decreased (38Decker C. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 39LaGrandeur T. Parker R. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 420-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Second, products of the decapping reaction appear only when at least some of the mRNAs have undergone deadenylation (26Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 38Decker C. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 40Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Third, mRNAs with poly(A) tracts are resistant to decapping in cell-free extracts, and this effect requires the presence of PABP (41Wilusz C.J. Gao M. Jones C.L. Wilusz J. Peltz S.W. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1416-1424PubMed Google Scholar). PABP was also shown to inhibit decapping in yeast (14Coller J.M. Gray N.K. Wickens M.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3226-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 40Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 42Caponigro G. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Diminished decapping may be due to increased occupancy of the cap by eIF4E, because PABP and eIF4E both bind eIF4G at nearby sites (16Tarun S.Z. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 43Tarun S.Z. Wells S.E. Deardorff J.A. Sachs A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9046-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 44Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.C. Browning K. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16247-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and PABP increases the affinity of eIF4E for the cap (45Wei C.C. Balasta M.L. Ren J.H. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PABP may inhibit decapping through a direct and specific association with the 5′-end of capped mRNA (46Khanna R. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1968-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PABP also stimulates translation of capped mRNAs (18Wakiyama M. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1147-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 47Grossi de Sa M.F. Standart N. Martins de Sa C. Akhayat O. Huesca M. Scherrer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 48Otero L.J. Ashe M.P. Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3153-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).The dual role of PABP in stimulating translation and inhibiting mRNA decay suggests that translation initiation and mRNA decay are linked. This connection is further supported by several observations. Addition of eIF4E inhibits Dcp1/Dcp2 activity in vitro, and this inhibition is thought to be due to eIF4E binding to the cap because m7GTP restores decapping, at least in yeast (49Schwartz D.C. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 50Vilela C. Velasco C. Ptushkina M. McCarthy J.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of translational initiation by inserting strong secondary structure in the 5′-UTR of mRNA leads to faster decapping (26Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), but inhibition of translation elongation by cycloheximide stabilizes mRNA (51Beelman C. Parker R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9687-9692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains that are defective in several translation initiation factors (eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, and eIF3) show an increase in decapping rate as well as the rate of deadenylation, suggesting that deadenylation may be controlled primarily by the translational status of mRNAs (52Schwartz D.C. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5247-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Dcp1 binds to both eIF4G and PABP as free proteins as well as to the complex of eIF4E·eIF4G·PABP (50Vilela C. Velasco C. Ptushkina M. McCarthy J.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a temperature-sensitive allele of eIF4E suppresses the decapping defect of a dcp1-1 mutant, which argues that dissociation of eIF4E from the cap is required before decapping (49Schwartz D.C. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).In this study, we set out to test directly, by the use of modified mRNA structures, the hypothesis that cap binding by eIF4E inhibits mRNA degradation in mammalian cells. We used cap analogs that differ in binding affinity for eIF4E to determine whether mRNA stability can be affected. Other cap analogs were used to test the relative contribution of the 5′→3′ versus 3′→5′ pathways. If mRNA is degraded by both pathways, selective blockage of one of them should stabilize mRNA. The available evidence suggests that Dcp1/Dcp2 and DcpS hydrolyze the cap at different sites. To achieve selective resistance to these two enzymes, we developed novel cap analogs in which each of two bridging pyrophosphate oxygens was separately replaced by a methylene group, one in the α-β position (m27,3′-OGppCH2pG) and one in the β-γ position (m27,3′-OGpCH2ppG). The first but not the second of these analogs stabilized mRNA in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The mouse mammary epithelial cell line MM3MG (American Type Culture Collection) was grown as a monolayer at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acid solution, and antibiotics (Invitrogen). Before electroporation, 70% confluent cells were detached using 1× PBS supplemented with 2.5 mm EDTA.Cap Analogs—Synthesis of the cap analogs Gp3G, m7Gp3G, b7Gp3G, and m27,3′-OGp3G has been described previously (53Stepinski J.

Their synthesis and chemical characterization are described elsewhere (57Kalek M. Jemielity J. Grudzien E. Zuberek J. Bojarska E. Cohen L. Stepinski J. Stolarski R. Davis R.E. Rhoads R.E.

All of them contained the entire firefly luciferase mRNA coding sequence in pGEM4, but they differed in the 3′-end, producing upon cell-free transcription mRNAs either with no A residues, with 31 A residues (plucA+ (58Jemielity J. Fowler T. Zuberek J. Stepinski J. Lewdorowicz M. Niedzwiecka A. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. RNA (N.

For construction of pluc-A60, two oligonucleotides, 5′-CCC(A)60CCGAATTGTT-3′ and 5′-AACAATTCGG(T)60GGGAGCT-3′, were annealed and inserted into the HpaI and SacI restriction sites of pluc-A+. For construction of pluc-G16, an insert containing G16 was obtained by PCR amplification using linear pluc-A+ and two oligonucleotides, 5′-AAACCC(G)16CC-GAAT-TGTTAACATTCTATAGTGTC-3′ and 5′-AGTGCTCATCATTGGAAAACGTTCTTCGGGGCG-3′. The incubation conditions were as follows: 2 min at 95 °C for polymerase activation; 5 cycles for 45 s each at 95 °C, 1 min at 51 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C; 30 cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 65 °C, and 1 min 45 s at 72 °C; and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting product was digested with SmaI and XmnI and inserted into pluc-A+. Plasmids pT7-luc-A50 and pT7-SL13-luc-A50 (59Niepel M. Ling J. Gallie D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Daniel Gallie (University of California, Riverside, CA).In Vitro Synthesis of mRNAs—RNAs containing different cap structures were synthesized by in vitro transcription of luciferase-encoding plasmids (pluc-A+, pluc-A60, pluc-G16, pT7-luc-A50, or pT7-SL13-luc-A50) with T7 polymerase in the presence of all four nucleoside triphosphates and various cap dinucleotides (58Jemielity J. Fowler T. Zuberek J. Stepinski J. Lewdorowicz M. Niedzwiecka A. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. RNA (N.

After incubation, 200-μl reaction mixtures were treated with 3 units of DNase RQ1 (Promega) for 20 min at 37 °C, extracted with phenol and chloroform, and the RNA precipitated with ethanol. In some cases, RNA was purified with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) using the manufacturer's protocol. The concentrations of RNAs were determined spectrophotometrically. mRNAs derived from pGEM®-luc, pluc-A+, pT7-luc-A50, pT7-SL13-luc-A50, pluc-A60, and pluc-G16 contained 3′-terminal tracts of 0A, 31 A, 50 A, 50 A, 60 A, or 16 G residues and are referred to as Luc-A0, Luc-A31, Luc-A50,SL13-Luc-A50, Luc-A60, and Luc-G16 mRNA, respectively. 32P-Labeled mRNAs were transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]GTP and cap analog as described above.Preparation of Polysomes—To separate ribosomal subunits and initiation complexes, 4 ×106 MM3MG cells were incubated with medium containing 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide for 5 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and the cells were treated for 2 min with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide, washed twice with the same medium, and lysed in 700 μl of 0.3 m NaCl, 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 15 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml heparin, and 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was layered on a 15–50% sucrose gradient in the same buffer but lacking Triton X-100 and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41Ti rotor at 38,000 rpm at 4 °C for 2 h. Gradients were fractionated with continuous monitoring of absorbance at 260 nm. RNA from each fraction (1 ml) was isolated and analyzed by real time PCR.In Vivo Measurement of Translational Efficiency and mRNA Decay— RNA (5 μg) was introduced into 107 MM3MG cells by electroporation in a total volume of 400 μl of serum-reduced Opti-MEM® I medium (Invitrogen) in a Gene Pulser cuvette (4 mm gap) by use of a Bio-Rad Genepulser™ set at 0.22 kV and 960 microfarads. All reagents were kept on ice prior to electroporation. Following discharge, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS, centrifuged for 2 min 300 × g at room temperature, resuspended in prewarmed complete medium, and placed at 37 °C. When translational efficiency was to be measured, cells were divided into several Eppendorf tubes, placed in a water bath at 37 °C, and shaken. When mRNA stability was to be measured, cells were distributed into 35-mm cell culture dishes and placed at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were harvested at various times and washed twice with PBS. For cytoplasmic RNA extraction, 2 × 105 cells were lysed in 175 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Igepal (Sigma), and 1 mm dithiothreitol). RNAs were further purified using the RNeasy mini kit. For protein extraction, 2 × 105 cells were lysed in 200 μl of Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity of cell extracts was measured according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega).Real Time PCR—Approximately 2 μg of each total RNA sample isolated from MM3MG cells were treated with DNase RQ1 (Promega) as described above. Reverse transcription was performed on 400 ng of RNA in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 5.5 mm MgCl2, 500 μm of each dNTP, 2.5 μm random hexamers, 0.2 units of RNase inhibitor, and 0.8 units of MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C for 30 min, and 95 °C for 5 min. Quantitative real time PCR was performed with specific primers designed for each mRNA with the Bacon Designer tool (Bio-Rad). For detecting sequences at the 5′-end of luciferase mRNA, the primers were 5′-CGTTCGGTTGGCAGAAGCTA-3′ and 5′-ACTGTTGAGCAATTCACGTTCATT-3′. For the 3′-end, they were 5′-TTGAAGCGAAGGTTGTGGATCT-3′ and 5′-ACATAATCATAGGTCCTCTGACACAT-3′. Luciferase mRNA from the cap structure to the beginning of the 3′-terminal homopolymer tract consisted of 1714 nucleotides. These primers amplified nucleotides 226–398 and 1093–1183, respectively. Mouse GAPDH mRNA levels were measured by the same method and in the same RNA samples with the use of the primers 5′-CAATGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCT-3′ and 5′-GAAGAGTGGGAGTTGCTGTTGA-3′. Amplification and detection were performed with the iCycler IQ real time PCR detection system in 25-μl reaction mixtures containing 5 μl of the transcription reaction mixture (50 ng of cDNA), 12.5 μl of IQ SYBRgreen Supermix, and 0.3 mm primers (Bio-Rad). The incubation conditions consisted of 3 min at 95 °C for polymerase activation and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Luciferase mRNA levels were calculated using the absolute standard curve method as described in User Bulletin No. 2 for the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System. After the amount of luciferase mRNA was calculated from a standard curve, it was normalized for the amount of mouse GAPDH mRNA in each sample. Finally, luciferase mRNA remaining at each time point was converted to a percent of the RNA present at zero time, and the results were plotted as log10([RNA]) versus time to determine t½. For analysis of RNA from polysome gradients, in vitro synthesized green fluorescent protein mRNA was added to each fraction before RNA isolation as an internal standard to control variation in RNA yield. The level of green fluorescent protein mRNA was used to normalize the levels of luciferase and GAPDH mRNA.Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was performed by using a riboprobe for luciferase mRNA, made by in vitro transcription by SP6 polymerase (Promega) of NcoI-digested pluc-A60. Plasmid was transcribed in a total volume 20 μl in the presence of 5 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (ICN Biochemicals). The membrane was pre-hybridized for 2 h and than hybridized with the probe overnight at 65 °C.In Vitro Translation—A micrococcal nuclease-treated RRL system was used for in vitro translation as described previously (60Cai A.

Optimal cap-dependent translation was achieved at 100 mm potassium acetate and 1.4 mm magnesium chloride. For measurement of translational inhibition, the added mRNA was natural rabbit globin mRNA, and protein synthesis was measured by incorporation of [3H]Leu.

Versican/PG-M, a large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, is one of the major molecules expressed in the extracellular matrix during condensation. However, its role, especially as an environment for cells being condensed, has not been elucidated. Here we showed several lines of evidence for essential roles of versican/PG-M in chondrogenic condensation using a new chondrocytic cell line, N1511. Chondrogenic stimuli (treatment with parathyroid hormone, dexamethasone, 10% serum) induced a marked increase in the transcription and protein synthesis of versican/PG-M. Stable antisense clones for versican/PG-M, depending on suppression of the expression of versican/PG-M, showed different capacities for chondrogenesis, as indicated by the expression and deposition of aggrecan, a major chondrocytic cell product. The cells in the early stages of the culture only expressed V0 and V1 forms, having more chondroitin sulfate chains among the four variants of versican/PG-M, and treatment of those cells with chondroitinase ABC suppressed subsequent chondrogenesis. Furthermore, treatment with β-xyloside, an artificial chain initiator of chondroitin sulfate synthesis to consequently inhibit the synthesis on the core proteins, suppressed chondrogenesis. In addition, forced expression of the variant V3, which has no chondroitin sulfate chain, disrupted the deposition and organization of native versican/PG-M (V0/V1) and other extracellular matrix molecules known to be expressed during the mesenchymal condensation and resulted in the inhibition of subsequent chondrogenesis. These results suggest that versican/PG-M is involved in positively regulating the formation of the mesenchymal matrix and the onset of chondrocyte differentiation through the attached chondroitin sulfate chains.

Mesenchymal cell condensation is the first step of organogenesis in many tissues. Cartilage formation in limb buds, one of the most typical examples of organogenesis, starts with the condensation of chondrogenic mesenchymal cells (1Fell H.B. J. Morphol. 1925; 40: 417-451Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This step is thought to be essential for subsequent skeletal development in vertebrates (2Jurand A. Proc. R. Soc.

Versican/PG-M was originally isolated as PG-M (medium-sized chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan) from the core (the mesenchymal cell condensation area) of chick embryonic limb bud at stage 23 (10Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Shinomura T. Yamagata M. Uritani M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13517-13525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA of versican/PG-M was cloned as versican, a fibroblast proteoglycan (14Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), and also as one of the alternatively spliced forms of the PG-M core protein (15Ito K. Shinomura T. Zako M. Ujita M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 958-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Versican/PG-M has a molecular mass of more than 1,000 kDa and consists of two globular domains at the N and C termini (G1 and G3 domain, respectively) and the two chondroitin sulfate-attachment domains (CS-α and CS-β) (16, also see Fig. 4A). The G1 and G3 domains are commonly found in proteoglycans belonging to the aggrecan family and are binding sites for hyaluronan and oligosaccharides, respectively (17LeBaron R.G. Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10003-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ujita M. Shinomura T. Ito K. Kitagawa Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27603-27609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CS-α and CS-β domains give unique properties to this proteoglycan in that multiple alternative splicing yields the following four variant forms with different numbers of the attached chondroitin sulfate chains: V0 having CS-α and CS-β, V1 having CS-β, V2 having CS-α, and V3 having neither of the two (19 in chicken; 15, 16, and 20 in mouse; 14 and 21 in human). An important role for versican/PG-M in the condensation process has been suggested by its unique properties as follows: 1) high transient expression in the mesenchymal cell condensation area during development of cartilage (10Kimata K.

Versican/PG-M interacts with cell surface annexin VI and inhibits the subsequent cell-spreading step that needs the rearrangement of cytoskeletal elements (33Takagi H. Asano Y. Yamakawa N. Matsumoto I. Kimata K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3309-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exogenous treatment with versican/PG-M of mesenchymal cells isolated from chick embryonic limb buds at stage 22/23 inhibited their spreading onto the substrates and enhanced their aggregation and further differentiation into chondrocytes (34Shinomura T. Nshida Y. Kimata K. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1991: 35-44Google Scholar). Previous studies reported that chondrocyte shape influences the differentiation via changes in cytoskeletal elements (35Solursh M. Jensen K.L. Zanetti N.C. Linsenmayer T.F. Reiter R.S. Dev. Biol. 1984; 105: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and it can be regulated by interactions between matrix substrate molecules and receptors on the cell surface under the optimum condition of high cell density. Versican/PG-M also modulates embryonic chondrocyte morphology (36Zhang Y.W.Y. Cao L. Lee V. Chen L. Lin Z. Kiani C. Adams M.E. Yang B.B. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that versican/PG-M is greatly involved in the mesenchymal cell condensation and subsequent chondrogenesis by modifying cell-extracellular matrix molecule interactions so as to influence the cell shape. To address this hypothesis, null mutation of the versican/PG-M gene in murine was supposed to provide direct results. However, this mutation resulted in embryonic death at 10.5 days post-coitum because of a heart abnormality before the onset of the chondrogenic mensenchymal cell condensation (37Mjaatvedt C.H. Yamamura H. Capehart A.A. Turner D. Markwald R.R. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and so no direct evidence has been obtained for the above hypothesis. The transfection of mesenchymal cells in culture with sense or antisense cDNA in expression vectors might also have provided some evidence. However, primary cell cultures are not ideal systems to pursue such experiments because of the limited number of mesenchymal cells at the same stage as well as the instability of their phenotype. We have recently established a chondrocytic cell line, N1511 without transformation (38Kamiya N. Jikko A. Kimata K. Damsky C. Shimizu K. Watanabe H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In N1511 cells, the entire process of chondrogenic differentiation, including mesenchymal cell condensation, can be reproduced by treatment with natural growth factors and cytokines, as characterized by changes in cell morphology and the onset of the expression of cartilage-specific genes such as type I, II, IX, and X collagen and aggrecan. These properties reflect well the in vivo chondrogenesis and further chondrocyte differentiation, suggesting that N1511 cells could provide an in vitro model system to study cartilage development from the step of a mensenchymal condensation as a process of groundwork for further differentiation. In this study, we first demonstrate that, immediately after induction, N1511 cells expressed versican/PG-M (V0 and V1 forms) at a high level, resembling the in vivo phenotype of condensing mesenchymal cells in the early phase, and then differentiated into chondrocytes. We next examined the effect of abrogation of versican/PG-M expression and interruption of versican/PG-M deposition into the matrix during the multiple steps of the chondrogenesis of N1511 cells. The inhibition by antisense of the synthesis of versican/PG-M suppressed chondrogenesis assessed by the gene expression and deposition in the matrix of aggrecan. In addition, overexpressed V3, which is the smallest spliced variant form of versican/PG-M without both chondroitin sulfate attachment domains, affected the deposition of native (endogenously produced) versican/PG-M in the ECM and also resulted in the suppression of chondrogenic differentiation. Furthermore, reduction of chondroitin sulfate chains in the ECM by chondroitinase ABC digestion and inhibition of native synthesis of chondroitin sulfate chains on the core proteins by β-xyloside treatment suppressed chondrogenesis. These results indicate that V0 and V1 forms of versican/PG-M expressed in the early phase of chondrogenesis serve as ECM molecules involved in mesenchymal cell condensation and promote further chondrocyte differentiation. Evidence is also provided that chondroitin sulfate chains of those proteoglycans are functional sites for the modification of cell-matrix interactions during mesenchymal condensation and the subsequent steps of chondrogenesis. Cell Line and Culture Conditions—N1511 cells, a cell line established from chondrocytic cells in the rib cage of a 4-week-old male p53-null mouse, reproduce each step of chondrogenesis (38Kamiya N. Jikko A. Kimata K. Damsky C. Shimizu K. Watanabe H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in minimum essential medium α (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until 80% confluent. The cells were then plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/35-mm dish, and after 24 h (defined as day 0), chondrogenesis was induced by combined treatment with 1 × 10-6 m dexamethasone (Calbiochem) and 1 × 10-7 m rat PTH-(1–34) (Sigma) in the presence of 10% FCS. The medium was changed every other day. Transfection—The cells at 40% confluency in 100-mm dishes were cotransfected with 3 μg of vector containing antisense strand, vector containing sense strand, or vector alone (mock) and 0.1 μg of PurR plasmid vector, using 12 μl of TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) and 500 μl of Opti-MEM™ (Invitrogen) in 10 ml of α-MEM containing 10% FCS. The transfectants were screened with 5 μg/ml puromycin for 3 days, and a pool of stable transfectants was again screened for 2 days using 5 μg/ml puromycin. We also transfected the cells with vector containing the smallest spliced form (V3) of versican/PG-M to examine the effect of a transient overexpression. To improve the transfection efficiency and to remove the effect of the untransfected cell debris on the cell adhesion, the transfection was performed at 40% confluency in 100-mm dishes. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were trypsinized and re-plated in the 35-mm dishes at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/dish. Antibodies, Immunofluorescent Staining, and Alcian Blue Staining— For rabbit antibodies against the alternatively spliced domain, CS-β, the cDNA fragment encoding this region was inserted into the protein A gene fusion vector, pRIT-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein produced in transfected Escherichia coli N4830-1 was purified from cell lysate using IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow and used for immunization. The antibodies obtained were designated anti-mouse CS-β domain antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against rat aggrecan also proven to be specific for mouse aggrecan (38Kamiya N. Jikko A. Kimata K. Damsky C. Shimizu K. Watanabe H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. Yada in this laboratory. 2B1, a mouse monoclonal antibody against versican/PG-M purified from human yolk sac tumor (39Sobue M.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3609-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) were purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). A polyclonal antibody against mouse fibronectin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For immunostaining, whole-mount cultures at appropriate time points were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 10% formalin/PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and then incubated for 1 h with the following primary antibodies at the indicated dilution, respectively: anti-mouse CS-β domain antibodies (dilution, 1:1000), anti-mouse aggrecan antibodies (1:100), monoclonal antibody for human versican/PG-M, 2B1 (1:100), and anti-fibronectin antibody (1:100). For the fluorescent staining, Alexa Fluor™ 488 and 596 of goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies, respectively (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), were used for 1 h as secondary antibodies (1:1000). For the immunochemical staining, Histofine kits using biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies as secondary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine-HCl (DAB) as color-developing reagents (Nitirei, Tokyo, Japan) were used. Biotinylated HA-binding protein (1:500) (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and FITC-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used for HA staining as described previously (40Itano N. Atsumi F. Sawai T. Yamada Y. Miyaishi O. Senga T. Hamaguchi M. Kimata K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3609-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For Alcian blue staining, the cultures were stained with 0.5% Alcian blue 8GX (Sigma) in 0.1 m HCl, pH 2.0, overnight and destained with 0.1 m HCl for 10 min as described previously (38Kamiya N. Jikko A. Kimata K. Damsky C. Shimizu K. Watanabe H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Photographs of stained cultures were taken using a CCD camera under the same conditions. Immunostained and Alcian blue-positive areas (at least 50 areas that were obtained by three independent experiments performed in triplicate) were quantitatively measured with NIH IMAGE software (version 1.57). Treatment with Chondroitinase ABC—Five units/ml protease-free chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was treated in the culture medium (2 ml of media/35-mm dish) up to day 4 every other day, and the cells were then rinsed with PBS several times and cultured in the regular induction medium for a further 2 weeks. For the digestion of the chondroitin sulfate chains, protein samples in the extracts with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3.6 mm pepstatin A) were treated with 5 units of chondroitinase ABC in the presence of protease inhibitors (41Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 45 min. After being boiled for 2 min at 100 °C, samples containing 50 mg of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE with a stacking gel of 3.75% (w/v) and a separation gel of 5% (w/v) acrylamide and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (23Yamagata M. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 187: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The core protein derivatives of versican/PG-M were detected immunochemically by using the anti-mouse CS-β domain antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and blots were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Treatment with β-Xyloside—β-Xyloside, xyloside-S-(CH2)6-CH3 (42Sobue M. Habuchi H. Ito K. Yonekura H. Oguri K. Sakurai K. Kamohara S. Ueno Y. Noyori R. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), was dissolved in ethanol and stored at -20 °C (0.2 m). The cultures (35-mm dish) were treated with up to 2.0 mm of β-xyloside from day 0 to day 5, rinsed with PBS several times, and cultured in the regular induction medium for a further 2 weeks. The cell layer and medium were harvested at the indicated days. α-Xyloside was used for a negative control. The cultured medium was combined from day 1 to day 5 and precipitated with 3 volumes of cold ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate. These precipitates and cell layers were suspended in 2 or 1 ml of 0.2 m NaOH, respectively, incubated for 16 h at room temperature, neutralized with 4 m acetic acid added to a final concentration of 10 mm MgCl2, and then treated with DNase (100 μg) and RNase (100 μg) at 37 °C for 2 h. Proteinase K (100 μg) was added, and incubation was continued for 16 h at 37 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were diluted with 1 volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.2 m NaCl and subsequently washed with 10 column volumes of 0.2 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2. The fractions eluted with 2.0 m NaCl in the same buffer were collected. Three volumes of cold ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate were added to these fractions, and the glycosaminoglycans were recovered as precipitates by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitates were dissolved in water, and portions of the solutions were digested with chondroitinase ABC as described previously (43Nogami K. Suzuki H. Habuchi H. Ishiguro N. Iwata H. Kimata K.

Constructions of Vectors for Antisense Inhibition and for Expression of V3—The versican/PG-M antisense vector was constructed using the -99 to +359 portion of the cDNA region as described previously (32Yamagata M. Kimata K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fragment containing this region was amplified by PCR using primers (sense, 5′-GCTTCCTATGTGATCTTCCG-3′, and antisense, 5′-AGTTTGACCATGGTGAGGGA-3′), purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligated into a SmaI site of the expression vector pKCR with the SV40 promoter. To confirm the direction of the inserted fragment, the plasmid was digested with PstI and sequenced. A plasmid containing full-length mouse V3 cDNA was a gift from Dr. Zako in this laboratory (20Zako M. Shinomura T. Ujita M. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3914-3918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment was excised with HindIII and EcoRI and subcloned into pSP72 cloning vector (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR was performed with 5′-GTGCGCCACCCTGTGACTGTG-3′ and 5′-ATCTTGCTCACAGAGTGCACCAAC-3′ as primers and human V3 cDNA (44Isogai Z. Shinomura T. Yamakawa N. Takeuchi J. Tsuji T. Heinegard D. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3902-3908PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The PCR fragment (340 bp) was digested with DraIII and ligated into pSP72, which was digested with DraIII and subsequently with HindIII and EcoRI, and the fragment was subcloned into an expression vector pKCR. This plasmid, designated mhV3/pKCR, expresses mouse V3 with a human-specific epitope of 2B1. The epitope of 2B1 was in the human G3 domain. 5M. Imagawa, T. Shinomura, and K. Kimata, unpublished observations. Northern Blotting, Quantitative Real Time PCR, and RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared by using an RNeasy™ total RNA system (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a Duralon-UV membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Filters were hybridized with mouse versican/PG-M or rat aggrecan probe. Mouse versican/PG-M probe and rat aggrecan cDNA were gifts from Dr. Zako and Dr. Yada in this laboratory, respectively. Each probe was 32P-radiolabeled using a Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). To normalize mRNA levels, 28 S ribosomal RNA was used. At various time points, mRNA was isolated from N1511 cells using a Micro-FastTrack™ 2.0 kit (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized with the SuperScript™ preamplification system (Invitrogen). The mouse versican/PG-M primers, mouse aggrecan primers, and their TaqMan probes were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The TaqMan probe contained a reporter dye at the 5′ end and a quencher dye at the 3′ end. The sequences of the primers and the probes for mouse versican/PG-M are as follows: forward primer, 5′-CCAGTGTGAACTTGATTTTGATGAA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AACATAACTTGGGAGACAGAGACATCT-3′; TaqMan probe, 5′-CACTCTAACCCTTGTCGGAATGGT-3′. Those for mouse aggrecan are as described previously (45Watanabe H. de Caestecker M.P. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These sequences are based on data in GenBank™, and the accession numbers for mouse versican/PG-M and mouse aggrecan are D28599 and U22901, respectively. As this primer-probe set was designed using the G3 domain of versican/PG-M, it can detect all the variants except mhV3. The RT-PCR was carried out with an ABI PRISM 7700. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 40 ng of total RNA, 200 μm of the primers, and 600 μm of probe in 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Rosh, Branchburg, NJ). TaqMan rodent GAPDH control reagents were used as the internal controls. The reverse transcription reaction was run, according to the manufacturer's recommended program. Data quantification and analysis were also performed according to the manufacturer's directions (PE Biosystems). Amplified fragments (108 and 80 bp, versican/PG-M and aggrecan) were sequenced for confirmation. Values represent levels relative to the control. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate to obtain the values. For detection of splicing variants of versican/PG-M, PCR amplification was performed using ExTaq™ (Takara Biomedicals, Kyoto, Japan) for 25 cycles under the following conditions: 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Forward primer 1, 5′-AGGTCAGAGAAAACAAGACAG-3′ (nucleotide 4080–4100 of mouse versican/PG-M cDNA), and forward primer 2, 5′-GCAGATTTGATGCCTACTGC-3′ (1194 to 1123), were used for V0 and V1–V3, respectively. Reverse primer 1, 5′-ACGGAGTAGTTGTTACATCCG-3′ (4316 to 4296), reverse primer 2, 5′-CTAATCTGCCTGTGATAGCC-3"

Wild-type (WT) eNOS is localized to the plasma membrane and perinuclear/Golgi region by virtue of N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation. Acylation-deficient mutants (G2AeNOS) remain cytosolic and release less NO in response to Ca2+-elevating agonists; a disparity that we hypothesized was attributed to the greater distance between G2AeNOS and plasma membrane Ca2+ influx channels. The reduced activity of G2AeNOS versus WT was reversed upon disruption of cellular integrity with detergents or sonication. NO production from both constructs relied almost exclusively on the influx of extracellular Ca2+, and elevating intracellular Ca2+ to saturating levels with 10 μm ionomycin in the presence of 10 mm extracellular Ca2+ equalized NO production. To identify the contribution of calcium to the differences in activity between these enzymes, we created Ca2+/CaM-independent eNOS mutants by deleting the two putative autoinhibitory domains of eNOS. There was no difference in NO production between WT and G2A-targeted Ca2+-independent eNOS, suggesting that Ca2+ was the factor responsible. When eNOS constructs were fused in-frame to the bioluminescent probe aequorin, membrane-bound probes were exposed to higher [Ca2+] in unstimulated cells but upon ionomycin stimulation, the probes experienced equal amounts of Ca2+. The WT and G2A enzymes displayed significant differences in the phosphorylation state of Ser617, Ser635, and Ser1179, and mutating all three sites to alanine or restoring phosphorylation with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin abolished the differences in activity. We therefore conclude that the disparity in NO production between WTeNOS and G2AeNOS is not caused by different localized [Ca2+] upon stimulation with ionomycin, but rather differences in phosphorylation state between the two constructs.

Loss of endothelial function, and particularly disturbance of eNOS-derived NO production, has been implicated in a number of cardiovascular diseases, and represents a promising therapeutic target (2Panza J.A.

Finally, eNOS activity can also be affected by the intracellular localization of the enzyme (10Fulton D. Babbitt R. Zoellner S. Fontana J. Acevedo L. McCabe T.J. Iwakiri Y. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

The subcellular localization of wild-type eNOS (WTeNOS) is dictated by post-translational fatty acylation, specifically myristylation of the glycine at position 2, which then leads to palmitoylation of the cysteines at positions 15 and 26 (11Sessa W.C. Harrison J.K. Barber C.M. Zeng D. Durieux M.E. D'Angelo D.D. Lynch K.R. Peach M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15274-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This fatty acylation has been reported to target eNOS to both the plasma membrane and the perinuclear/Golgi region (12Liu J. Hughes T.E. Sessa W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13Garcia-Cardena G. Oh P. Liu J. Schnitzer J.E. Sessa W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6448-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Mutant eNOS constructs, in which the glycine at position 2 is mutated to alanine (G2AeNOS), fail to undergo fatty acylation, and as a consequence remain cytosolic (14Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This mistargeting has profound consequences for NO production, as both basal and stimulated NO production by G2AeNOS is markedly reduced compared with WTeNOS (14Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Sakoda T. Hirata K. Kuroda R. Miki N. Suematsu M. Kawashima S. Yokoyama M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 152: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, when the WTeNOS and G2AeNOS constructs are purified and examined in vitro with maximal substrate and cofactors, no differences in catalytic activity are observed (14Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the difference in catalytic activity in distinct intracellular environments remain unclear. When inducible NOS (iNOS) is expressed with the targeting sequences for both WTeNOS and G2AeNOS, the production of NO is completely unaffected by intracellular location (16Jagnandan D. Sessa W.C. Fulton D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 25: 25Google Scholar). As iNOS and eNOS require similar amounts of l-arginine, BH4, and NADPH for activity, it seems unlikely that local variations in these cofactors are responsible for the altered activity of targeted eNOS constructs. In contrast, iNOS and eNOS are diametrically opposed in their dependence on Ca2+/CaM-eNOS is highly dependent on increases in intracellular Ca2+ for activity, whereas iNOS is already maximally activated by Ca2+/CaM even at basal levels of intracellular Ca2+, and is thus to all practical purposes Ca2+-independent (17Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Therefore, intracellular [Ca2+] represents a plausible candidate that mediates the differences in NO production observed between WTeNOS and G2AeNOS. One of the major sources of Ca2+ entry into non-excitable cells is the opening of non-selective cation channels in the plasma membrane in response to the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, a phenomenon known as capacitative calcium entry (CCE) (18Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). CCE is the predominate source of agonist-regulated Ca2+ entry into endothelial cells and is also believed to play a major role in shear stress-stimulated Ca2+ entry (19Tran Q.K. Ohashi K. Watanabe H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 48: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Dolor R.J. Hurwitz L.M. Mirza Z. Strauss H.C. Whorton A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C171-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Schilling W.P. Cabello O.A. Rajan L. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is now widely accepted that the influx of external Ca2+, specifically that provided by CCE, is also the predominate source of the Ca2+ required by eNOS for sustained activation and NO production (22Lin S. Fagan K.A. Li K.X. Shaul P.W. Cooper D.M. Rodman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17979-17985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Elevations in intracellular Ca2+, particularly in response to Ca2+ influx, are rarely homogeneous throughout the cell. For instance, invoking CCE in A7r5 cells produces a rather modest increase in cytosolic Ca2+, while producing localized [Ca2+] up to 300 times greater at the plasma membrane (23Marsault R. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has previously been demonstrated that the peak Ca2+ transient response reported upon invoking of CCE is higher for WTeNOS than a myristylation-deficient eNOS expressed in COS cells (22Lin S. Fagan K.A. Li K.X. Shaul P.W. Cooper D.M. Rodman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17979-17985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, whether this disparity in local [Ca2+] is sufficient to explain the large differences in NO production between WTe-NOS and G2AeNOS over sustained periods of time remains to be elucidated. Indeed, NO production and calcium elevation are elevated above baseline several minutes beyond the initial influx of CCE-driven calcium (24Harris M.B. Blackstone M.A. Sood S.G. Li C. Goolsby J.M. Venema V.J. Kemp B.E. Venema R.C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2004; 287: H560-H566Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Yi F.X. Zhang A.Y. Campbell W.B. Zou A.P. Van Breemen C. Li P.L. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H2725-H2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether proximity to plasma membrane Ca2+ entry channels and the subsequent differences in localized [Ca2+] experienced by the plasma membrane and the cytosol, were the sole determinant of the disparity between the NO production by membrane-bound or cytosolic eNOS constructs. Cell Culture and Transfection—Both COS-7 cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). BAECs were transduced with constructs (WTeNOS, G2AeNOS, or aequorin constructs) that had been inserted into the pDEST adenoviral vector (Invitrogen). Generation of eNOS Constructs—A cytosolic bovine eNOS construct (G2AeNOS) was constructed by mutating the alanine at position 2 of wild-type bovine eNOS (WTeNOS) to a glycine, preventing fatty acylation of the enzyme, as previously described (14Sessa W.C. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The eNOS constructs with reduced Ca2+/CaM dependence were based on a Ca2+/CaM-independent construct (Δ45/Δ14eNOS) of human eNOS first characterized by Chen and Wu (26Chen P.F. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52392-52400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two significant portions of the sequence of human eNOS that were not shared by the Ca2+-insensitive NOS isoform iNOS, specifically the residues of the two putative autoinhibitory control elements: 594–606/614–645 (Δ45) and 1165–1178 (Δ14) were deleted. The constructs for the present study were created by deleting the corresponding residues in bovine eNOS, specifically 596–608/616–647 (Δ45) and 1167–1180 (Δ14). cDNA fragments containing the mutated regions were generated by PCR using WTeNOS cDNA as a template, and a pair of primers were used for each region: 5′-GAAGCGGATCTTGTAACTCTTCATCTCCATCAG-GGCAG-3′ and 5′-GAGTTACAAGATCCGCTTCAGGTTCTGTGTGTTCGGACTGGGC-3′ for the Δ45 mutation, 5′-GATGCCGCTCCTGCAGGGAAAACGTGAGGCCGAAAATGTC-3′ and 5′-CCTCACGTTTTCCCTGCAGGAGCGGCATCTG-3′ for the Δ14 mutation. Each fragment was then sequentially subcloned into WTeNOS or G2AeNOS cDNA. Phospho-null eNOS mutants were generated by mutating serines 617, 635, and 1179 to alanine on bovine eNOS using sequential PCR mutagenesis with the primers previously described (5Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar, 27Bauer P.M. Fulton D. Boo Y.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14841-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and then subcloning the various fragments into the WT and G2A targeting sequence construct. The sequences of the phospho-null eNOS and the Ca2+-independent eNOS constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Genomics Core Facility of the Medical College of Georgia. NO Release from Intact Cells—Cells were transfected with the constructs of interest, and 48 h later were stimulated with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (1 μm) for 30 min. Medium containing NO (primarily NO–2) was ethanol-precipitated to remove proteins and was refluxed in sodium iodide/glacial acetic acid to convert NO–2 to NO. NO was then quantified via specific chemiluminescence following reaction with ozone (Sievers). All NO measurements were corrected by subtracting the signal detected from cells transfected with empty vector (pCDNA3). NO Production in Disrupted Cell Preparations—COS-7 cells transfected with either WTeNOS or G2AeNOS were scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, pelleted, and resuspended at a density of ∼1 × 107 cells/ml in fresh serum-free DMEM supplemented with NADPH (100 μm). Cells undergoing sonication were then subjected to 3 × 1-s bursts with a sonic dismembrator (Fisher Model 100, setting: 3), after which the lysates were aliquoted and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Detergent-treated samples were treated with 1% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by mixing samples with 2× volume of cold absolute ethanol before analysis for NO content (see above). Generation of Aequorin (AEQ) Constructs—Four AEQ constructs were created; an HA-tagged aequorin for measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ (CYT-AEQ), an AEQ fused in-frame to the transmembrane domain of the T-cell surface glycoprotein CD8 (accession NM_001768) for measurement of Ca2+ at the plasma membrane (PM-AEQ), and AEQ fused in-frame to either WTeNOS (WTeNOS-AEQ) or G2AeNOS (G2AeNOS-AEQ) for measurement of the Ca2+ experienced by each construct (28Padua R.A. Baron K.T. Thyagarajan B. Campbell C. Thayer S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C615-C622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calibration of Aequorin Constructs to [Ca2+]—COS-7 cells were transfected with the AEQ fusion proteins, and 48 h later, the cells were homogenized by sonication in medium of the following composition: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysates were then exposed to EGTA-buffered solutions of known Ca2+ concentrations, followed by total discharge of the AEQ with 10 mm CaCl2. The ratio of luminescence in the one second immediately after exposure to the Ca2+ solution was calculated as a proportion of the total luminescence emitted over the duration of the experiment (L/Lmax) and plotted against each known concentration of Ca2+ to obtain a calibration curve. Ca2+ Measurements Using Aequorin in COS Cells—COS-7 cells were transfected with one of the four aequorin constructs, and 48 h later, the aequorin was activated by incubating the cells in Ca2+-free DMEM (BIOSOURCE) containing 5 μm coelenterazine (Sigma) for 1 h. Following this, loading medium was replaced with Ca2+-free DMEM without coelenterazine. The cells were then exposed to Ca2+-free DMEM, Ca2+-DMEM (DMEM containing 1.5 mm free Ca2+), or Ca2+-DMEM with 1 μm ionomycin. Cells were placed in a luminescence plate reader (Lumistar Galaxy) and after the appropriate treatment time the remaining luminescence (Lmax) was discharged by exposing the cells to a lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Ca2+ and 0.3% Triton X-100 in dH2O, and then expressed as a ratio of the total luminescence obtained from untreated cells (t = 0). AEQ and its cofactor coelenterazine react in the presence of Ca2+ to emit a photon. This reaction results in the permanent oxidation of coelenterazine to coelenteramide, and therefore the emission of light in response to Ca2+ is a once-only reaction. The size of the available pool of luminescence therefore decreases constantly over time in direct proportion to the amount of Ca2+ present. We, therefore, interpreted the decrease in Lmax as being indicative of exposure to Ca2+ over time, with a greater degree of burnout indicating that the AEQ probe had been exposed to more Ca2+. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in homogenization buffer of the following composition: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholic acid. Lysates were homogenized and cleared by centrifugation. After determining protein concentration (DC protein assay kit, Pierce), equal amounts of protein were incubated with an excess of eNOS monoclonal antibody for 2 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose was then added, and the mixture incubated for another 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (5 min), and then size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Blots were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in standard transfer buffer for 18 h at 4 °C and 40 V, and then blocked in nonfat milk for 1 h. After blocking, membranes were incubated with phosphospecific antibodies raised to the individual phosphorylation sites (phospho-116 and phospho-Ser617, Upstate; phospho-Thr497, Cell Signaling Technologies; phospho-Ser635 and phospho-Ser1179, BD Transduction Laboratories) or with anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody (9D10, Zymed Laboratories) for 2 h, washed, incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (anti-mouse, Amersham Biosciences), washed again, and then developed using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose Isolation of eNOS Constructs—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized as for the AEQ calibration experiments (see above). When required, membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 90 min; Beckman ultracentrifuge), and the membrane fraction was resuspended in homogenization buffer supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40. 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were then added to the fractions and rotated at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were then washed three times in homogenization buffer before being prepared for Western blotting (see above). Concentration-Response Curves to Ca2+/CaM with Isolated eNOS Constructs—COS-7 cells expressing WT and G2A eNOS constructs were homogenized and eNOS affinity-purified with 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose beads (as above). Following the 3-h rotation at 4 °C, beads were washed twice in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 135 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11.6 mm HEPES, 11.5 mm glucose, pH 7.3) then twice in HBS supplemented with EGTA (2 mm) to remove all Ca2+/CaM from the sample, then washed twice again in HBS. Beads were then resuspended in treatment solutions consisting of HBS supplemented with NADPH (3 mm), BH4 (30 μm), l-arginine (100 μm), CaCl2 (1 mm), and varying concentrations of calmodulin (bovine heart calmodulin, Sigma). Reactions were terminated after 30 min by addition of 2× volume of ice-cold EtOH. The relative production of NO was determined by chemiluminescence as described above. Confocal Imaging—To visualize the subcellular location of WT and G2A eNOS and eNOS-aequorin fusion protein within cells, we constructed additional fusion proteins encoding WT and G2A eNOS-GFP and WT and G2A-RFP-AEQ. COS-7 cells were then transfected with cDNAs encoding the eNOS fusion proteins of EGFP and monomeric RFP. 24–48 h later, cells were replated onto glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek). All imaging was performed using the LSM 510 Meta 3.2 Confocal Microscope (Zeiss). Magnification power was set at ×40 with oil. Statistical Analysis—NO release data were expressed as mean ± S.E. AEQ burnout data were individually normalized to the Lmax obtained for each AEQ fusion construct in Ca2+-free DMEM, then expressed as mean ± S.E. Overall differences between groups were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Student-Newman-Keuls posthoc analysis for determining differences between the means when more than two groups were compared. An independent Student's t test was used when only two groups were compared. Comparisons between the Ca2+ calibration curves of each AEQ fusion construct were made using 2-way ANOVA. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. The Disparity in NO Production between WTeNOS and G2AeNOS Is Abolished by Cellular Disruption—When COS-7 cells were transfected with equal amounts of WTeNOS or G2AeNOS (Fig. 1a) and stimulated for 30 min with three Ca2+-mobilizing compounds: the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (1 μm), the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin (100 nm), or extracellular ATP (100 μm), G2AeNOS produced significantly less NO than the WTeNOS (Fig. 1b). However, when cells expressing both constructs were disrupted either by sonication (3 × 1-s bursts, setting 3) or detergent (Triton X-100, 1%) in medium supplemented with NADPH (100 μm), G2AeNOS actually produced more NO than the WTeNOS construct (Fig. 1c), suggesting that the disparity in NO production between the constructs was reliant on intracellular localization. NO Production by Both WTeNOS and G2AeNOS Is Ca2+-dependent, and Raising Intracellular Ca2+ to Saturating Levels Equalizes NO Production—Previous studies have suggested that a contributing factor to the disparity in NO production between membrane-bound WTeNOS and the myristylation-deficient, cytosolic G2AeNOS may be the proximity of each construct to store-operated Ca2+-entry channels (22Lin S. Fagan K.A. Li K.X. Shaul P.W. Cooper D.M. Rodman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17979-17985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar); a hypothesis supported by our finding that disruption of cellular integrity abolished the differences in NO production. To further investigate this hypothesis, it was first necessary to confirm that the entry of extracellular Ca2+ was the dominant stimulus for NO production by both constructs. Cells transfected with either WTeNOS or G2AeNOS were stimulated with 1 μm ionomycin (a concentration that is reported to increase intracellular Ca2+ via activation of CCE and not direct opening of plasma membrane channels, Ref. 29Morgan A.J. Jacob R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) in serum-free DMEM (1.5 mm free Ca2+), in serum-free DMEM after preincubation with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (10 μm, 20 min), or in serum-free and Ca2+-free DMEM supplemented with 1 mm EGTA. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, G2AeNOS produced approximately half the amount of NO produced by WTeNOS (Fig. 2a). Preincubation with BAPTA-AM significantly decreased NO production by both constructs, but decreased NO production by G2AeNOS to a greater extent than that of WTeNOS (54% reduction in G2AeNOS activity versus only 20% reduction in WTeNOS activity). In contrast, the removal of extracellular Ca2+ reduced the ionomycin-induced NO production by both constructs by greater than 90% (Fig. 2a), demonstrating that both constructs rely almost entirely on the influx of external Ca2+ for sustained NO production. If the differences in NO production were due solely to differences in Ca2+ interaction with the two constructs and not caused by inferior catalytic activity of the G2AeNOS construct, then elevating cytosolic [Ca2+] to saturating levels would be expected to fully activate both constructs and equalize NO production. When cells expressing WTe-NOS or G2AeNOS were stimulated with 1 μm ionomycin in the presence of increasing concentrations of external Ca2+, the NO production by G2AeNOS increased as a proportion of the NO production by WTe-NOS (38% at 1.5 mm Ca2+ and 56% at 10 mm, Fig. 2b) but did not equalize. When the higher concentration of 10 μm ionomycin was used to stimulate cells, NO production by G2AeNOS again increased in proportion to that of WTeNOS, and elevating extracellular [Ca2+] to 10 mm equalized NO production (58% at 1.5 mm Ca2+ and 97% at 10 mm; Fig. 2c). The ability of saturating concentrations of Ca2+ to equalize the NO production by the two constructs again suggested that differences in [Ca2+] handling, and not an inability of the G2A construct to produce NO per se, might be the key regulatory factor mediating the differences in activity. Additionally, treatment of cells with the superoxide scavenger Tiron (10 mm, 30 min) had absolutely no effect on the NO production by either construct, suggesting that the disparity in NO production was not caused by aberrant production of superoxide (data not shown). The Activity of Ca2+/CaM-insensitive Constructs Is Unaffected by Subcellular Localization—Once we had confirmed the dependence of both constructs on extracellular Ca2+ entry, and that NO production could be equalized simply by increasing intracellular Ca2+ to saturating levels, we attempted to demonstrate a direct link between intracellular Ca2+ and the altered NO production by the two constructs. To achieve this we created Ca2+/CaM-independent deletion mutants of the WTe-NOS and G2AeNOS constructs based on the constructs of Chen and Wu (26Chen P.F. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52392-52400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both deletion mutants were found to be almost entirely Ca2+/ CaM-independent as, in contrast to the native constructs, they displayed extremely high basal NO production. This was unaffected by chelation of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3a) and only a slight (although significant) increase in NO production in response to ionomycin stimulation, which was sensitive to rem"

Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), integrase specifically recognizes the terminal sequences of each long terminal repeat (LTR) and cleaves the 3′-end terminal dinucleotide 5′-GT.

We propose that strand transfer requires a conformational change of the integrase-viral (donor) DNA complex with formation of an H-bond between the N-3 of the 5′-C and the amine group of Gln-148.

DNA into a host chromosome is required to complete viral infection. Integration is also required for retroviral gene transfer. HIV-1 integrase (integrase) catalyzes integration in two steps (1Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 2Katz R.A.

First, an endonucleolytic cleavage reaction releases a terminal 5′-GT dinucleotide from the end of each viral long terminal repeat (LTR) in a reaction called 3′-processing (3′-P). Subsequently, the viral and host DNAs are joined by insertion of each exposed viral DNA 3′-hydroxyl end into a host chromosome (strand transfer, ST). The integrase-DNA complex during ST consists of several integrase monomers, the two ends of the viral DNA, and the target DNA. Although the arrangement of the integrase dimers has been elucidated by x-ray diffraction of the structures of various integrase domains (4Greenwald J. Le V. Butler S.L. Bushman F.D. Choe S.

HIV-1 integrase binds to the tips (“att” sites) of each viral LTR. The roles of several bases at the extremities of the viral DNA have been examined. The release of the 5′-GT dinucleotide during 3′-P leaves a complementary 5′-AC overhang (see Fig. 1A for the sequence of the terminal 21 bp of the HIV-1 U5 LTR). The 5′-AC overhang is required for ST (11Bushman F.D. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3458-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to stabilize the viral DNA end in the proper position for ST (11Bushman F.D. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3458-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Ellison V. Brown P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7316-7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Yet the roles of these individual nucleotides, as well as their functional association with an integrase amino acid during ST have not been established. A flexible loop consisting of amino acids 140-149 resides over the integrase active site. The conformational flexibility of this loop is suggested to be important for the catalytic step following DNA binding (4Greenwald J. Le V. Butler S.L. Bushman F.D. Choe S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8892-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Amino acids Gln-148 and Tyr-143 have been identified through photocross-linking as possible contacts for the 5′-adenine of the 5′-AC overhang (13Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Additionally, a Q148L integrase mutation reduces the stability of the integrase-viral DNA complex as well as ST activity (14Gerton J.L. Ohgi S. Olsen M. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5046-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that integrase Gln-148 resides in the region of the 5′-AC overhang and plays a role in the ST reaction. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the molecular interactions between integrase and the viral LTR DNA ends. We find the cytosine in the 5′-AC overhang (hereafter referred to as the “5′-C”, Fig. 1A) and integrase Gln-148 to be critical for ST especially in the presence of magnesium, the probable biological metal cofactor. We demonstrate the proximity of the 5′-C and Gln-148 through disulfide cross-linking, and propose that ST requires the formation of a hydrogen bond between the cytosine N-3 and the glutamine amine group. These results directly relate to the mechanism and structure of the ST reaction as well as to the mechanism of action of integrase inhibitors that block 3′-P and ST. Oligonucleotide Synthesis—Oligonucleotides, except those used for disulfide cross-linking, were commercially synthesized by (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). O-4-Triazolyl-dU-CE phosphoramidite was purchased from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). Oligonucleotides containing convertible nucleosides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA synthesizer. The two carbon tether (cystamine) was added post-synthetically using the convertible nucleoside approach (15Ferentz A.E. Verdine G.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4000-4002Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), reduced with excess dithiothreitol, and purified using a NAP-5 column. Incubation of the DNA with a 10-fold molar excess of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Sigma) using pH 8.5 phosphate buffer and subsequent ethanol precipitation provided the activated DNA (16Wolfe S.A. Ferentz A.E. Grantcharova V. Churchill M.E. Verdine G.L. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 213-221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The activated DNA was annealed with the complementary strand before cross-linking experiments were performed. Mutagenesis—Integrase mutants were created using the Stratagene QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Primers containing mutations were as follows: for C56S, 5′-CAAGTAGACAGTAGCCCAGGA-3′; for C65S, 5′-GGCAGCTAGATTCTACACATTTAG-3′; for C280S, 5′-GGCAGGTGATGATAGTGTGGCAAGTAG-3′; for Q148N, 5′-CCCCAAAGTAACGGGGTAATAG-3′; for Q148C, 5′-CCCCAAAGTTGCGGGGTAATAG-3′. A complementary primer was used for each mutant. The presence of desired mutations and the integrity of the remainder of the integrase sequence were verified by DNA sequencing. Integrase Purification—Recombinant wild-type or mutant integrase was purified from Escherichia coli as described (17Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9285-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with the addition of 10% glycerol to all buffers. Reducing agents were omitted from the elution and dialysis steps of proteins used in disulfide cross-linking reactions. Integrase Reactions—Integrase reactions contained 400 nm integrase, 20 nm DNA, 7.5 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2, 7.5 mm NaCl, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Mops, pH 7.2. Magnesium was used as the divalent metal, unless otherwise noted. Reactions were at 37 °C for 1 h and were quenched by addition of an equal volume of gel loading dye (formamide containing 0.25% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). Products were separated on 20% polyacrylamide denaturing sequencing gels. Dried gels were visualized using a 445 SI PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry analyses were performed using ImageQuant software from Amersham Biosciences. Disulfide Cross-linking—Integrase (10 μm) was incubated with DNA duplexes (10 μm) containing tethered thiols in the presence of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol for 20 min (unless otherwise noted) at 37 °C. Reactions were capped by the addition of 20 mm methyl methanethiosulfonate. Nonreducing gel loading buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) was added, and samples were heated at 95 °C prior to loading onto 16% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Gels were stained with Microwave Blue according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Protiga, Gaithersburg, MD). Alternatively, 500 nm integrase was incubated with 5CITEP in the presence of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol for 20 min. DNA (20 nm) containing a 5′-32P label on one strand and a thiolmodified cytosine on the other strand was added, and reactions were capped with methyl methanethiosulfonate at 0.016, 0.33, 0.66, 1, 2, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 min or at 1 min (see Fig. 6). Following capping, nonreducing gel loading buffer was added, and samples were directly loaded on 16% polyacrylamide gels. Schiff Base Cross-linking—Inhibition of DNA binding by 5CITEP was examined by using 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing an abasic site (X) substitution for adenine of the conserved 5′-CA, 5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCXGT annealed to the thiol-modified DNA. Q148C/SSS integrase (500 nm) was incubated with 111 μm 5CITEP for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 50 mm Mops, pH 7.2, 143 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 7.5 mm MgCl2. Schiff base DNA (20 nm) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. 100 mm NaHB4 was added to stabilize the Schiff base cross-link, followed by an equal volume of SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 3 min and electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE. For a more detailed description of the assay see Ref. 18Mazumder A. Neamati N. Pilon A. Sunder S. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27330-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. The 5′-C Is Required for ST—Integrase 3′-P and ST activities can be measured by using a duplex DNA derived from the terminal 21 bp of the HIV-1 U5 LTR (Fig. 1A). The base pair on the 3′-side of the integrase 3′-P site, which normally is guanine/cytosine, was replaced by each of the other 15 possible base pair combinations at the X/Y position (Fig. 1B) to examine the importance of the base pair sequence for the 3′-P and ST reactions. By using a full-length substrate, the 3′-P reaction must occur prior to ST. Only two combinations fully inhibited 3′-P (T/A and T/T) and therefore also inhibited subsequent ST in magnesium-containing reactions (Fig. 1C). The presence of an upper strand guanine (X = G) or a lower strand cytosine (Y = C), both corresponding to the natural sequence, led to the most efficient 3′-P in the presence of magnesium. Notably, cytosine as the lower strand base (Y = C) was strongly preferred for ST, regardless of the identity of the upper strand base. When reactions were performed with manganese, the DNA base requirements for 3′-P and ST were less stringent (Fig. 1D). The identity of the base pair had no effect on 3′-P, and all of the base combinations yielded some level of ST. Yet, even with manganese, the 5′-C on the lower strand was preferred for ST. Removal of the terminal 5′-nucleotide (dA; see Fig. 1A) had no effect on ST (Fig. 2). By contrast, when the 5′-C was removed, integrase failed to produce ST products but retained a normal level of 3′-P (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate the selective requirement of the 5′-C for ST. To examine which portion of the 5′-C confers efficient ST, exocyclic substitutions were introduced sequentially to convert the base from cytosine (preferred) to thymine (nonpermissive) (Fig. 3A). Addition of a 5-methyl group had no effect on ST (Fig. 3B). Conversion of the 4-amine to an O-4-methyl group resulted in a slight enhancement of the ST reaction. The O-4-methyl group can be a weak hydrogen bond acceptor compared with the hydrogen bond donating amine group of cytosine. ST remained effective without any substitution at position 4 (zebularine), indicating this position does not play a role in ST. Most critically, ST was lost when the N-3 group was changed to NH, as in thymine, which reverses the direction of hydrogen bonding at this position. Also, the ST in the presence of the O-4-methyl group indicates the thymine carbonyl is not inhibitory to ST (Fig. 3). These results suggest the N-3 group, as a hydrogen bond acceptor, makes a critical contact with integrase or the target DNA for ST. Glutamine 148 of Integrase Promotes ST—We next looked for a potential integrase hydrogen bond donor residue. An alignment of the retroviral flexible loop residues through the adjacent catalytic glutamate residue and the DNA base corresponding to the 5′-C are shown in Table 1. Of the potential hydrogen bond donating residues, only Asn-144 and Gln-148 are conserved and required for viral replication (19Lu R. Limon A. Ghory H.Z. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2493-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 20Neamati N. Expert Opin. Ther. Patents. 2002; 12: 709-724Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We chose those residues as potential hydrogen bond donors, as well as Tyr-143 because of published results indicating this amino acid cross-linked the 5′-A of the LTR tip (13Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Additionally, residues Thr-122 and Lys-127 were selected from modeling studies of integrase and viral DNA. 3R. Karki and M. Nicklaus, personal communication. Mutating Thr-122 (to Ala or Cys) or Tyr-143 (to Ser, Phe, or Ile) had no effect on ST. Mutating Asn-144 (to Lys, Ala, or Cys) had a minimal effect on ST. Mutation of Lys-127 (to Ala or Cys) blocked 3′-P and ST (data not shown). Therefore, positions 122, 127, 144, and 143 were not investigated further.TABLE 1Alignment of flexible loop residues for selected retroviruses The base refers to the identity of the base corresponding to the 5′-C in the HIV LTR (see Fig. 1A).

Guilloteau J.P. Zhou-Liu Q. Clement-Mella C. Mikol V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar)). We created the mutants Q148N and Q148A to examine the efficiency of ST when the amino acid 148 side chain is shortened by one methylene group or changed to a methyl group (Fig. 4B). Q148N completed 3′-P at a level similar to wild-type integrase but had a 40% reduction in ST activity (Fig. 4B and data not shown). Q148A had a slight decrease in 3′-P and lacked ST. Other Gln-148 mutants (Glu and Lys) were also deficient for ST (data not shown). The 5′-C requirement was tested with the Q148N mutant, and the results were similar to wild-type integrase (see Fig. 1) for both 3′-P and ST, except for the globally lower ST efficiency (data not shown). Direct Cross-linking of Integrase Gln-148 to the 5′-C—Because changes to either the 5′-C and Gln-148 diminished ST, and both the 5′-C and Gln-148 are plausible partners for hydrogen bonding, we tested their potential direct interaction using disulfide cross-linking. Disulfide cross-linking between proteins and DNA has been accomplished for several protein-DNA complexes, including HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and DNA repair proteins (for review see Ref. 22Verdine G.L. Norman D.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 337-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Additionally, the integrase mutant E246C has been cross-linked previously with viral DNA substrate at the seventh base (adenine) from the 5′-end of the lower DNA strand by using a similar method (23Gao K. Butler S.L. Bushman F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Three surface cysteine residues of integrase were mutated to serine to eliminate background cross-linking. Therefore, in cross-linking experiments the control protein had the mutations C56S/C65S/C280S (“SSS”). Sequential mutations indicated Cys-56 was responsible for background cross-linking, in contrast to a previous study where Cys-65 and Cys-280 provided background cross-linking to the 5′-adenine of the lower DNA strand (23Gao K. Butler S.L. Bushman F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The mutation Q148C was added to the triple serine mutant integrase to place a reactive sulfur at residue 148 (“Q148C/SSS”). The activity of these mutants is shown in Fig. 4B. The triple serine (SSS) retains wild-type activity for both 3′-P and ST. The Q148C/SSS mutant exhibits no ST and altered 3′-P specificity. 3′-P was reduced at the canonical cleavage site (CA↓GT-3′ generating the 19-mer) and enhanced at the adjacent site CAG↓T-3′, resulting in the formation of a 20-mer product and a similar level of total 3′-P. Altered 3′-P has also been reported for a Q148L mutant of HIV-2 integrase with enhanced generation of circular dinucleotide products (24van Gent D.C. Groeneger A.M.O Plasterk R.H.A Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3373-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Gln-148 helps position the 3′-P reactants, allowing dinucleotide release, and the role of Gln-148 in ST becomes important only once the 5′-C is unpaired. Activity of the Q148C/SSS mutant was tested with precleaved DNA in the presence of manganese. These conditions permitted a partial “rescue” (19%) of ST. Presumably cysteine can interact with manganese, and not magnesium, because of the ability of manganese to bind cysteine (25Gao K. Wong S. Bushman F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6715-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cross-linking components and reaction are shown schematically in Fig. 5A. DNA was synthesized with an alkanethiol tether at the 5′-C position. The tether was activated by 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) to yield the substrate shown before reaction with integrase in Fig. 5A. The DNA substrates used to examine position-specific cross-linking are shown in Fig. 5B. Cross-linking of the Q148C/SSS integrase to the thiol-modified 5′-C-containing DNA (DNA X-1) was observed as the band migrating between the monomer and dimer species of integrase (highlighted by horizontal arrow in Fig. 5C). Cross-linking efficiency was between 30 and 50% relative to the monomer concentration. The cross-link band was not observed when unmodified DNA was used (Fig. 5, C and D). As expected, dithiothreitol reduced the level of protein-DNA cross-link, and no cross-link was observed with the SSS integrase lacking Q148C (Fig. 5C). Thus, the core domain surface residue Cys-130 does not cross-link with the thiol-containing DNA. Cross-linking was not observed when the reactive thiol group was placed distal from the 5′-end of the duplex (DNA X-2), which rules out nonspecific cross-linking (Fig. 5D). Finally, cross-linking was observed in the presence of manganese and magnesium, precleaved or full-length DNA (Fig. 5, E and F) in agreement with the previous observation of DNA binding in the absence and presence of metal (26Yi J. Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8458-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Neamati N. Hong H. Sunder S. Milne G.W. Pommier Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 1041-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The recently reported flexibility of the viral DNA end may allow cross-linking of nonprocessed substrate (28Renisio J.G. Cosquer S. Cherrak I. El Antri S. Mauffret O. Fermandjian S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1970-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Together, these experiments indicate that the integrase residue 148 is in the vicinity of the cytosine of the 5′-overhang and that catalysis is not required for DNA cross-linking. Cross-linking Interference by Integrase Inhibitors—Diketo acid derivatives have emerged recently as specific ST inhibitors with antiviral activity (29Hazuda D.J. Young S.D. Guare J.P. Anthony N.J.

Interaction between 5CITEP and Gln-148 was observed crystallographically (25Gao K. Wong S. Bushman F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6715-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cross-linking by the integrase inhibitor 5CITEP was examined at concentrations of integrase and DNA used in standard catalytic experiments in the presence of magnesium. The DNA was radioactively labeled to permit visualization of integrase-DNA complexes. A time course experiment indicated cross-linking was complete in less than 2 min (Fig. 6, A and B). Addition of 5CITEP decreased the rate of cross-link formation. A 1-min cross-linking time was chosen to examine the inhibition of cross-linking at different 5CITEP concentrations (Fig. 6C). The IC50 of cross-link inhibition was 29 μm.At111 μm, 5CITEP had no effect on overall binding of integrase to DNA, as measured by Schiff base assay (Fig. 6, D and E), suggesting inhibition of disulfide cross-linking reflects the 5CITEP-binding site. The present study demonstrates that efficient ST requires both the presence of a 5′-C at the end of the donor (viral) DNA and Gln-148 in the flexible loop of HIV-1 integrase. The 5′-C is conserved in the LTR sequences of HIV-1, HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus (Table 1). In contrast, avian sarcoma virus and Rous sarcoma virus LTRs contain an adenine at that position, where the nitrogen at the first ring position could contribute to a similar interaction in an appropriately structured active site. Gln-148 is conserved among retroviral integrases, including HIV-1, simian immunodeficiency virus, avian sarcoma virus, Rous sarcoma virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus (32Engelman A. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6361-6369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gln-148 resides in a flexible loop disordered in most integrase crystal structures or crystallized in a conformation that is unsuitable for catalysis (4Greenwald J. Le V. Butler S.L. Bushman F.D. Choe S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8892-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R.

Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8233-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the loop becomes ordered upon DNA binding and acts to stabilize the 5′-end of the viral DNA (5Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Craigie R. Davies D.R. Science. 1994; 266: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 13Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Mutations that reduce the flexibility of the loop containing Gln-148 impair catalysis without affecting DNA binding (4Greenwald J. Le V. Butler S.L. Bushman F.D. Choe S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8892-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A conformational change following 3′-P has been observed (23Gao K. Butler S.L. Bushman F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This flexibility might allow Gln-148 and the 5′-C to interact following the 3′-P reaction, allowing efficient ST. This structural change could involve movement of the flexible loop, rotation of the 5′-C base out of the DNA duplex, or both, as illustrated in Fig. 7. In our model, release of the 5′-GT dinucleotide provides the rotational freedom to the lower strand 5′-C, leaving the area near the catalytic 3′-hydroxyl available for subsequent ST. The 5′-AC overhang is then anchored away from the catalytic 3′-hydroxyl by a hydrogen bond between the Gln-148 side chain amine and the cytosine N-3 group. Note that integrase is active as a multimer, and our model does not confine the active site performing catalysis and the Gln-148 facilitating ST to the same subunit. A precedent for a similar glutamine-cytosine N-3 hydrogen-bonding interaction exists for human deoxycytidine kinase (33Sabini E. Ort S. Monnerjahn C. Konrad M. Lavie A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Deoxycytidine kinase efficiently phosphorylates deoxycytidine but also deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine by interaction with Gln-97. The bound base dictates rotation of the glutamine side chain into an appropriate hydrogen-bonding position. Discrimination of deoxycytidine by deoxycytidine kinase is achieved through H-bonding of the cytosine N-3 with the amino groups to the Gln-97 (33Sabini E. Ort S. Monnerjahn C. Konrad M. Lavie A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The use of magnesium in the integrase active site is an important component of our model. Divalent metals influence the effectiveness of integrase inhibitors (34Grobler J.A. Stillmock K. Hu B. Witmer M. Felock P. Espeseth A.S. Wolfe A. Egbertson M. Bourgeois M. Melamed J. Wai J.S.

Integrase undergoes a divalent metal-induced protein conformational change (39Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which may enhance specific recognition of the viral DNA end (26Yi J. Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8458-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The strict coordination requirements of magnesium (40Martin R.B. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1990: 1-13Google Scholar) and the base specificity we observed in the presence of magnesium in vitro may point to the importance of the cytosine base requirement during ST in vivo. This specificity may be reduced in our in vitro studies done in the presence of manganese because of altered metal coordination (40Martin R.B. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1990: 1-13Google Scholar). Magnesium, a hard metal, prefers coordination to hard atoms such as oxygen (reviewed in Ref. 41Verma S. Eckstein F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 99-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Coordination of magnesium may dictate that the Gln-148 carbonyl group supplies a direct- or water-mediated contact to magnesium (Mg specific contact in Fig. 7). This contact restricts rotation of the Gln-148 side chain and pulls electrons from the glutamine amino group, facilitating H-bond formation (Fig. 7). As a result, the side chain amine is directed to specifically contact and stabilize the 5′-C during ST. In contrast, the Gln-148 carbonyl group may not be needed in the same capacity in the presence of manganese, a soft metal. An altered metal coordination could allow the conformation of both of the glutamine side chain functional groups to accommodate any of the four DNA bases; hence, a loss of stringency for the base that stabilizes the viral DNA during ST in the presence of manganese (may be biologically irrelevant). Because of the flexibility of the loop containing Gln-148 and the single-stranded nature of the 5′-C following 3′-P, other loop residues may contact the 5′-C. The loop contains residues 140GIPYNPQSQG149, with the underlined residues capable of acting as H-bond donors. The functional relevance of Tyr-143 and Gln-146 can be excluded because mutants have no effect on viral replication (19Lu R. Limon A. Ghory H.Z. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2493-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and Ser-147 is not conserved among retroviruses. We tested N144C in the disulfide cross-linking assay. Only a small amount of cross-linking was observed, and furthermore, aggregation of the protein, presumably from protein self-cross-linking precluded accurate assessment of integrase-DNA cross-link specificity (data not shown). Gln-148 may form part of the binding pocket for diketo acid integrase inhibitors, which are selective against the integrase ST reaction (for review see Ref. 3Pommier Y. Johnson A.A. Marchand C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). A co-crystal between integrase and 5CITEP revealed a hydrogen bond between Gln-148 and the nitrogen of the indole ring of 5CITEP (42Goldgur Y. Craigie R. Cohen G.H. Fujiwara T. Yoshinaga T.

A. 1999; 96: 13040-13043Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and docking studies suggest the participation of Gln-148 in the drug-binding pocket for several other integrase inhibitors (35Marchand C. Johnson A.A. Karki R.G. Pais G.C.G Zhang X. Cowansage K. Patel T.A. Nicklaus M.C. Burke Jr., T.R. Pommier Y. Mol.

A drug-resistant mutation Q148K developed after exposure to S-1360, a diketo acid integrase inhibitor in clinical trial, and this mutant exhibited poor viral replication lending support to the important role of Gln-148 (20Neamati N. Expert Opin. Ther. Patents. 2002; 12: 709-724Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Diketo acids have been proposed to bind the integrase-DNA complex and block ST by interacting with the 5′-AC overhang (45Marchand C. Zhang X. Pais G.C. Cowansage K. Neamati N. Burke Jr., T.R. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12596-12603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We observed that cross-link between the LTR 5′-C and residue 148 of integrase was inhibited by 5CITEP at an IC50 of 29 μm (Fig. 6, C and D). 5CITEP inhibits 3′-P and ST at IC50 values of 35 and 0.65 μm, respectively (45Marchand C.

Inhibition of Q148C/5′-C cross-linking by 5CITEP suggests the binding site for this inhibitor overlaps the region of the Gln-148/5′-C interaction. This is supported by the lack of inhibition of Schiff base formation between integrase and an abasic site substitution for the conserved adenine at the 3′-P site (Fig. 6, D and E). The cross-linking approach could be used to scan the molecular contacts between integrase and its DNA substrates, as well as inhibitor-binding sites. Stabilization of integrase-DNA complexes may also enable co-crystal structure determination."
https://openalex.org/W2024121074,"pRb, p107, and p130 are related proteins that play a central role in the regulation of cell cycle progression and terminal differentiation in mammalian cells. Nevertheless, it is still largely unclear how these proteins achieve this regulation in vivo. The intestinal epithelium is an ideal in vivo system in which to study the molecular pathways that regulate proliferation and differentiation because it exists in a constant state of development throughout an animal's lifetime. We studied the phenotypic effects on the intestinal epithelium of mutating Rb and p107 or p130. Although mutating these genes singly had little or no effect, loss of pRb and p107 or p130 together produced chronic hyperplasia and dysplasia of the small intestinal and colonic epithelium. In Rb/p130 double mutants this hyperplasia was associated with defects in terminal differentiation of specific cell types and was dependent on the increased proliferation seen in the epithelium of mutant animals. At the molecular level, dysregulation of the Rb pathway led to an increase in the expression of Math1, Cdx1, Cdx2, transcription factors that regulate proliferation and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium. The absence of Cdx1 function in Rb/p130 double mutant mice partially reverted the histologic phenotype by suppressing ectopic mitosis in the epithelium. These studies implicate the Rb pathway as a regulator of epithelial homeostasis in the intestine. pRb, p107, and p130 are related proteins that play a central role in the regulation of cell cycle progression and terminal differentiation in mammalian cells.

These studies implicate the Rb pathway as a regulator of epithelial homeostasis in the intestine. Normal adult tissues maintain a constant cell number by regulating the relative amounts of proliferation and apoptosis. The intestinal epithelium is a highly proliferative tissue; the human small intestinal epithelium undergoes ∼1011 mitoses per day (1Potten C.S. Morris R.J. J. Cell Sci. 1988; : 45-62Crossref Google Scholar). In this tissue homeostasis is preserved through strict regulation of proliferation, differentiation, migration, and exfoliation. The position of a cell within the crypt/villus axis directly reflects its cell cycle and differentiation states. Cell proliferation normally occurs in the undifferentiated cells near the base of the crypts of Lieberkühn. The progeny of these undifferentiated cells migrate out of the crypt and into the villus and in the process exit the cell cycle and become terminally differentiated. Differentiation of the intestinal epithelium is controlled by several transcription factors including hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), atonal 1 (Atoh1/Math1), and E74-like factor 3 (Elf3/Ese1) (2Sancho E. Batlle E. Clevers H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The spatial orientation of cells within the crypt/villus axis and the high rate of cell turnover within the tissue provide a unique opportunity to study the development of the intestinal epithelium throughout an organism's lifetime. pRb, p107, and p130 comprise a family of cell cycle regulators known as the “pocket proteins.” The predominant function of the pocket proteins is to control the G1/S transition through negative regulation of the E2F family of transcription factors (3Classon M. Harlow E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In addition, this protein family plays an important role in regulating other cellular processes, such as terminal differentiation and senescence (4Liu H. Dibling B. Spike B. Dirlam A. Macleod K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The regulation of differentiation by pRb appears to occur independently of E2Fs (5Sellers W.R. Novitch B.G. Miyake S. Heith A. Otterson G.A. Kaye F.J. Lassar A.B. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar); instead, pRb promotes differentiation through interaction with tissue-specific transcription factors. For example, pRb interacts with CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α to promote adipocyte differentiation and core binding factor α1 to promote osteoblast differentiation (6Classon M. Kennedy B.K. Mulloy R. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 7Thomas D.M. Carty S.A. Piscopo D.M. Lee J.S. Wang W.F. Forrester W.C. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 303-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The pRb-related proteins p107 and p130 also appear to play a role in differentiation. Mice mutant for p107 and p130 have cartilage and bone differentiation defects and fail to develop terminally differentiated keratinocytes (8Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Hannon G. Mulligan G. Bronson R.T. Dyson N. Harlow E. Beach D. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 9Ruiz S. Segrelles C. Bravo A. Santos M. Perez P. Leis H. Jorcano J.L. Paramio J.M. Development. 2003; 130: 2341-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the pocket proteins directly interact with histone deacetylases and regulate their ability to alter chromatin structure around specific promoters (10Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 11Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). In adipocytes a complex consisting of pRb and histone deacetylase 3 prevents differentiation by inhibiting the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (12Fajas L. Egler V. Reiter R. Hansen J. Kristiansen K. Debril M.B. Miard S. Auwerx J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 903-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Given the importance of the pocket proteins in regulating cell cycle progression and differentiation, it is not surprising that mutations in the RB gene are frequent in many human tumor types (3Classon M. Harlow E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). RB mutations are common is tumors such as retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, and small cell lung cancer. In contrast to RB, it is unclear whether P107 or P130 act as tumor suppressor genes. Although P130 expression is lost in a subset of ovarian carcinomas and non-small cell lung cancers, a causal relationship between P130 mutations and these types of cancer has not been established (13D'Andrilli G. Masciullo V. Bagella L. Tonini T. Minimo C. Zannoni G.F. Giuntoli 2nd, R.L. Carlson Jr., J.A. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Scambia G. Giordano A. Clin.

Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3850-3856PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of mice with targeted alleles of the genes encoding Rb, p107, and p130 have uncovered functional relationships between the pocket proteins. Although p107-/- and p130-/- mice are viable and fertile, mutation of p107 and p130 in combination is embryonic lethal (8Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Hannon G. Mulligan G. Bronson R.T. Dyson N. Harlow E. Beach D. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In addition to displaying functional redundancy, the pocket proteins exhibit striking functional compensation. For example, in the absence of p130, p107 expression is up-regulated in peripheral T lymphocytes, and this up-regulation results in increased association of p107 with E2F4 (15Mulligan G.J. Wong J.

Clearly, the pocket proteins function in a complex, multi-tiered molecular pathway to protect cells from inappropriate cell cycle progression. The functions of pRb, p107, and p130 in the intestinal epithelium remain largely uncharacterized. However, studies of the laboratory mouse have provided some insight into the function of the pocket proteins in this tissue. Enterocytes expressing SV40 large T antigen, which binds to and inactivates all of the pocket proteins, reenter the cell cycle and display an increase in p53-independent apoptosis (16Hauft S.M.

Interestingly, the expression of large T antigen did not appear to induce the de-differentiation of enterocytes (16Hauft S.M. Kim S.H. Schmidt G.H. Pease S. Rees S. Harris S. Roth K.A. Hansbrough J.R. Cohn S.M. Ahnen D.J. Wright N.A. Goodlad R.A. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 825-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these studies were limited to assessing the function of the pocket proteins in differentiated enterocytes and not any of the other cell types in the epithelium, thereby preventing a broad study of cell cycle exit and differentiation. In addition, large T antigen has multiple cellular targets and may not fully inactivate the three pocket proteins. Additional studies are required to appreciate the function of the pocket proteins in the intestinal epithelium. Homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium is achieved in part through regulation of proliferation and differentiation, making it an ideal system for studying the molecular pathways that control these processes in vivo. By using mice with conditional and germ-line null mutations in the pocket protein genes, we have evaluated their role in regulating homeostasis in this tissue. We found that mutation of the pocket protein genes alters the development of the small intestinal and colonic epithelium. This study implicates the pocket proteins as regulators of both proliferation and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium. Mouse Strains—Cdx1 knock-out mice (18Subramanian V. Meyer B.I. Gruss P.

Rb2lox and p130 mutant mice have been described previously (8Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Hannon G. Mulligan G. Bronson R.T. Dyson N. Harlow E. Beach D. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T.

For each animal, the entire intestinal tract was removed, flushed with 1× PBS, 4The abbreviations used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salineBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridine. and fixed overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Tissue for histologic analysis was removed from the identical location in all animals. For colonic sections, tissue was taken from the medial colon, ∼4 cm proximal to the rectum. For small intestinal sections, tissue was taken within 1 cm of the ileo-cecal junction. In our experience with Fabpl-Cre mice, nearly 100% of the crypts in this region of the small intestine are Cre-positive. For cell cycle analysis, animals were injected with 30 mg/kg 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) 1 h before sacrifice. phosphate-buffered saline bromodeoxyuridine. Immunohistochemistry—Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was performed using a modified citric acid unmasking protocol. Briefly, slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through ethanol. Slides were microwaved for 25 min in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and then cooled in running tap water. After incubation in 1× PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min, slides were blocked in 10% native donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody (diluted 1:100 in 1× PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) was added, and slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following day slides were washed three times in 1× PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20. Secondary antibody (diluted 1:200 in 1× PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) was added, and slides were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Slides were again washed, counterstained with propidium iodide or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and mounted in 1× PBS. For BrdUrd immunohistochemistry, samples were deparaffinized and microwaved in citrate followed by standard detection with 3,3-diaminobenzidine using a kit from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Samples stained for BrdUrd were counterstained with hematoxylin. Primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit α-Rb C15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit α-p107 C18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit α-p130 C20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat α-l-FABP N20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit α-mucin2 H300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit α-lysozyme (ICN), rabbit α-chromogranin A (Abcam), rabbit α-Ki67 (Novocastra), goat α-Mcm6 C20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit α-phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit α-cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse α-BrdUrd (BD Biosciences). Specificity of Rb, p107, p130, and Cdx1 antibodies was confirmed by hybridizing to tissue sections from intestine lacking the relevant protein (data not shown). In all cases each antibody detected specific nuclear staining. In some instances, nonspecific background staining was detected in the cytoplasm. Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were raised in donkey and labeled either with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594. Western Blotting—Western blots were performed on purified intestinal epithelium. The purification was performed with a protocol modified from Whitehead et al. (21Whitehead R.H. Demmler K. Rockman S.P. Watson N.K. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 858-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, intestines were removed, flushed with ice-cold 1× PBS, and opened lengthwise. Tissues were then incubated in 3 mm EDTA, 50 μm dithiothreitol for 1 h on ice at 4 °C. Tissues were gently washed in ice-cold 1× PBS then transferred to new 1× PBS. Intestinal epithelium was dislodged by vigorous shaking. Epithelial cells were isolated by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min. After decanting of supernatant, cells were resuspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer (100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Samples were then centrifuged to remove insoluble matter and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Polyacrylamide gels (8 or 12%) were loaded with 25 or 40 μg of purified epithelial protein. Western blots were detected with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Primary antibodies were as follows: mouse α-Rb (BD Pharmingen) at 1:400 dilution, rabbit α-p107 C18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000 dilution, rabbit α-p130 C20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000 dilution, mouse α-actin C4 (Abcam) at 1:3000 dilution, rabbit α-Cdx1 CPSP (22Silberg D.G.

Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 478-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) at 1:4000 dilution, and mouse α-Cdx2 (BioGenex) at 1:1000 dilution. RNA Isolation and Taqman Analysis—Before RNA isolation, intestinal epithelium was purified using the modified EDTA protocol (see “Western blotting” above). RNA was isolated using Trizol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total epithelial RNA using Superscript™ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitation of p107 and Cdx1 expression was performed using a Taqman® gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR reactions were run and scored on an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence detection system. For each genotypic class, RNA from at least 2 animals was analyzed. All reactions were done in quadruplicate. To normalize p107 and Cdx1 expression levels between samples, its expression relative to TATA box-binding protein (Tbp) was assessed. For the control group, Rb2lox/2lox, the average expression level relative to Tbp was determined. Then, for each of the experimental groups, each single reaction was compared with the average of the control to generate a mean relative expression level for that group. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mstat computer program (mcardle.oncology.wisc.edu/mstat). Quantitative Analysis of Tissue Kinetics—The heights of the Ki67- and BrdUrd-positive zones were determined by counting the number of cell positions from the bottom of the crypt that the highest-staining cell occupied. For phospho-histone H3 staining, entopic cell positions were defined (based on staining in wild-type colon) as the bottom 10 cell positions of the crypt. Ectopic cell positions were defined as any positive staining above the tenth position. For each assay, at least 50 crypts, originating from tissue sections of 2–3 different mice, were scored for each genotype. Only crypts for which a good longitudinal section was obtained were scored. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mstat computer program. Little is known about the role of the pocket proteins in regulating homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium. To understand the function of the pocket proteins in this context, we first analyzed the pattern of expression within the crypts and villi of pRb, p107, and p130. In the colon, nuclear pRb was found in all epithelial cells, with higher expression in cells toward the bottom of the crypt (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of pRb, p107 was expressed predominantly in the lower half of the crypt, whereas p130 is expressed in the upper portion of the crypt and the epithelium lining the lumen (Fig. 1, B and C). The expression patterns of pRb, p107, and p130 were similar in the small intestinal epithelium. The undifferentiated cells in the small intestinal crypt expressed pRb and p107 (Fig. 1, D and E), whereas the differentiated cells in the villi expressed Rb and p130 (Fig. 1, D and F). Although immunohistochemistry allowed us to assess the localization of pocket proteins within the epithelium, it did not give us an indication of the relative expression levels of these proteins. We analyzed by Western blot the expression of pRb, p107, and p130 in purified intestinal epithelium to determine whether/how functional compensation occurs in this tissue. Because loss of Rb function is lethal during embryogenesis (23Clarke A.R. Maandag E.R. van Roon M. van der Lugt N.M. van der Valk M. Hooper M.L. Berns A. te Riele H.

Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar), we utilized a conditional allele of Rb (Rb2lox) (20Sage J. Miller A.L. Perez-Mancera P.A. Wysocki J.M. Jacks T. Nature. 2003; 424: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and a transgenic mouse strain that expresses Cre recombinase in the intestinal epithelium (Fabpl-Cre) (19Saam J.R. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38071-38082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this strain of mice, Cre is expressed mosaically within the intestinal epithelium, with little or no expression in the proximal small intestine and relatively high expression in the distal small intestine and colon. It is this mosaic Cre expression that may account for the ability to detect pRb, albeit at reduced levels, in “Rb-mutant” intestinal epithelium (Fig. 1G). We found that pRb and p130 levels remained constant, even when one or another pocket protein was mutated (Fig. 1G). By contrast, the levels of p107 increased dramatically upon mutation of Rb or p130 (Fig. 1G). In Rb/p130 double mutant intestine, the levels of p107 were even higher (Fig. 1G). This increase p107 expression was evident not only at the protein level but also in RNA isolated from mutant intestinal epithelium (Fig. 1H). These data indicate that in the intestinal epithelium, loss of Rb and/or p130 function is associated with compensatory up-regulation of p107 and that this compensation most likely occurs at the level of p107 transcription. We went on to examine the intestinal phenotype of mice with mutations in Rb and/or p107 and p130. Fabpl-Cre;Rb2lox/2lox mice exhibited a histologically normal intestinal epithelium (Fig. 2, C and D). Given the mosaic nature of the Cre expression in Fabpl-Cre mice, we confirmed by immunohistochemistry that the histologically normal crypts were indeed deficient for pRb (data not shown). We also confirmed that loss of Rb function produces histologically normal crypts by injecting Rb-/-;Rosa26/+ embryonic stem cells into wild-type blastocysts to generate chimeric mice (Fig. 2C, inset). In these chimeric animals the lacZ+, Rb-mutant crypts are histologically normal. The failure of Rb-mutant intestinal epithelium to exhibit even a subtle histological phenotype may be due to functional overlap with p107 and/or p130. The intestinal epithelium in mice singly mutant for p107 or p130 was not markedly different from wild type at the histologic level. In the small intestinal epithelium there was no apparent phenotype due to mutation of p107 or p130 (Fig. 2, F and J). The colonic epithelium from p107- and p130-mutant mice displayed focal hyperplasias that manifested as a minor increase in the depth of otherwise normal crypts (Fig. 2, E and I). Nevertheless, these hyperplasias were extremely mild and did not progress to neoplasia, even in animals greater than 18 months of age. Mice double mutant for Rb and p107 or p130 developed significant hyperplasia in the small intestine and colon. This hyperplasia was present throughout the regions of the intestinal epithelium in which Cre was expressed and did not develop as focal lesions. In the small intestine the dysplasia was associated with severe dysmorphogenesis of the crypt/villus axis (Fig. 2, H and L). In the colon the crypts were elongated, and the surface epithelium often displayed a serrated border. In both the small intestine and colon, the orientation of the crypts relative to the muscularis was skewed such that it was often difficult to obtain perfectly longitudinal sections (see Fig. 2L). Age of onset was extremely variable in both classes of double mutant animals. This is probably due to the mixed genetic background of the animals. In general, the hyperplasia was detectable by 6 months of age. Interestingly, the hyperplasia did not appear to significantly affect the health of the animals, which routinely lived 18–24 months. In no cases did the hyperplasia progress to neoplasia. The presence of chronic hyperplasia in Rb/p130 double mutant mice indicates that these pocket proteins play an important role in regulating development and homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium. This observation led us to analyze the cellular and molecular bases for the phenotype of the mutant animals. We chose to focus our efforts on characterizing the phenotype of Rb/p130 double mutant animals because their phenotype was significantly more robust than that of Rb/p107 mutant animals. Mutation of the pocket proteins has been found to affect the proliferative and apoptotic indices of many different tissues, for example in the retina (26MacPherson D. Sage J. Kim T. Ho D. McLaughlin M.E. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1681-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We used immunohistochemistry to analyze cell cycle kinetics in the intestinal epithelium of our mutant mice. Ki67 is expressed by cells that remain active in the cell cycle. In wild-type mice, Ki67-positive cells were restricted to the bottom 7 cell positions in the colonic crypt (Fig. 3A). The Ki67-positive zone was expanded to 11 cell positions in Rb and p130 mutant colon and 18 cell positions in double mutant colon (Fig. 3A). Thus, as reported for a variety of other cell types, mutation of the Rb pathway caused a delay in the ability of colonic epithelial cells to exit the cell cycle and enter G0. Loss of Rb function enhances apoptosis in a cell autonomous manner in the peripheral nervous system, lens, and retina (26MacPherson D. Sage J. Kim T. Ho D. McLaughlin M.E. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1681-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 27MacPherson D. Sage J. Crowley D. Trumpp A. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inactivation of the entire Rb family by expression of large T antigen in the intestinal epithelium leads to an increase in apoptosis (17Chandrasekaran C. Coopersmith C.M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28414-28421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found no difference in the apoptotic indices between wild-type, Rb mutant, p130 mutant, or double-mutant colons by staining for activated caspase 3 (CC3) (data not shown). It appears, therefore, that the induction of apoptosis in response to pRb loss is a tissue-specific phenomenon. A common consequence of Rb inactivation is ectopic entry into S-phase (24Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). Inactivation of all pocket proteins through expression of large T antigen in differentiated enterocytes leads to ectopic S-phase entry in small intestinal villi (16Hauft S.M. Kim S.H. Schmidt G.H. Pease S. Rees S. Harris S. Roth K.A. Hansbrough J.R. Cohn S.M. Ahnen D.J. Wright N.A. Goodlad R.A. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 825-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To test for ectopic S-phase entry in mutant colons, we assayed for incorporation of BrdUrd. In wild-type colons, BrdUrd-positive cells were found only within the bottom nine cell positions of the crypt (Fig. 3B). In all of the mutant colons (both single and double mutants), however, BrdUrd-positive cells extended to ∼15 cell positions from the bottom of the crypt (Fig. 3B). Cells that enter S-phase at ectopic positions within the crypt might also progress to mitosis. To determine whether the ectopic BrdUrd staining in mutant colons leads to ectopic cell cycling, we measured the mitotic index by immunostaining for phosphorylated histone H3. As with BrdUrd, phosphorylated histone H3-positive cells could be found at higher cell positions in mutant colons compared with wild-type colons (Fig. 3, C and D).

All these mycobacteria possess a cell envelope structure based on long-chain mycolic acids esterified to an arabinogalactan polysaccharide, which is attached to a peptidoglycan backbone.

Four major PIMs are usually expressed, mono- and diacyldimannosides (AcPIM2 and Ac2PIM2) and mono- and diacylhexamannosides (AcPIM6 and Ac2PIM6) (6Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). In addition, a minor PIM4 lipid has been shown to be a natural antigen for CD1d-restricted T cells (17Fischer K. Scotet E. Niemeyer M. Koebernick H. Zerrahn J. Maillet S. Hurwitz R. Kursar M. Bonneville M. Kaufmann S.H. Schaible U.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, the characteristic mycobacterial lipoglycans, lipoarabinomannan and lipomannan are both multiglycosylated versions of PIMs. We initially proposed the following biosynthetic pathway phosphatidylinositol → PIM → lipomannan → lipoarabinomannan (18Besra G.S.

PimB is responsible for the addition of a second Manp to the 6-position to yield PIM2 (19Schaeffer M.L. Khoo K.H. Besra G.S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. Belisle J.T. Inamine J.M. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that this is the direct precursor of lipomannan, characterized by a linear α(1→6)-linked mannan backbone linked with α(1→2) mannopyranose side chains and that lipomannan is further glycosylated with arabinan to produce lipoarabinomannan (22Gurcha S.S.

Recently, Alexander and co-workers (23Alexander D.C. Jones J.R. Tan T. Chen J.M. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18824-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported that, in M. marinum, a glycosyltransferase, termed “PimF,” was involved in the biosynthesis of higher molecular weight PIMs, specifically PIM7 from PIM5. However, the thin layer chromatographic (TLC) behavior of the putative PIM7 was reminiscent of a highly antigenic polar phosphorus-free glycolipid isolated previously from M. marinum (24Minnikin D.E. Ridell M. Wallerstrom G. Besra G.S. Parlett J.H. Bolton R.C. Magnusson M. Acta Leprol. 1989; 7: 51-54PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have reinvestigated the PIMs and other highly polar glycolipids of M. marinum and show that the proposed PIM5 and PIM7 (23Alexander D.C. Jones J.R. Tan T. Chen J.M. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18824-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) are in fact members of a novel family of LOSs. In addition, analyses based on M. marinum strains with a reported genetic disruption of Rv1500 and subsequent complementation with a plasmid expressing Rv1500, allows us to draw the conclusion that the product of this open reading frame, which we have termed LosA, is involved in the final assembly of the M. marinum LOS-IV glycolipid. Strains and Culture Conditions—The type strain of M. marinum 1218R (ATCC 927, MS425, GA 411) and strain MRS2521 (Rv1500::ϕMycoMar) generated by transposon mutagenesis of 1218R (23Alexander D.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18824-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were grown at 30 °C both on Sauton agar and Middlebrook 7H11 agar, supplemented with 10% oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase (Difco). Escherichia coli DH5α was used for standard manipulations and propagation of plasmid DNA. E. coli DH5α λpir116 was used for isolation of transposon-containing plasmid. Antibiotics were added as required: kanamycin, 50 μg/ml for E. coli and 25 μg/ml for M. marinum 1218R; hygromycin B, 150 μg/ml for E. coli and 75 μg/ml for M. marinum 1218R. Generation and Screening of M. marinum ϕ MycoMar Insertion Library—Propagation of the ϕ MycoMar transposon phage and preparation of phage lysates were carried out as previously described (25Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12712-12717Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). For phage infection, M. marinum 1218R cells were washed and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, and 2 mm CaCl2. Phage were added at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow infection to occur. Bacteria were then plated on Middlebrook 7H11 agar supplemented with kanamycin and incubated at 30 °C. Kanamycin-resistant (i.e. transposon-containing) M. marinum colonies were patched onto Middlebrook 7H11 agar to obtain a library of 7680 (i.e. 80 plates × 96 colonies/plate) clones. Colonies with unusual morphology were identified by visual inspection as reported previously (23Alexander D.C. Jones J.R. Tan T. Chen J.M. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18824-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One colony, M. marinum MRS2521, was chosen for further characterization. Localization of M. marinum MRS2521 ϕ MycoMar Insertion— M. marinum MRS2521 chromosomal DNA was isolated as described previously (23Alexander D.C. Jones J.R. Tan T. Chen J.M. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18824-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). BamHI, a restriction endonuclease, which does not cut within the MycoMar element, was used to cleave total chromosomal DNA. Such digestion generates a restriction fragment containing the kanamycin resistance cassette and R6K γ ori of the MycoMar element plus flanking chromosomal DNA. Self-ligation of this restriction fragment generates a plasmid that can replicate in E. coli strains containing the pir gene. Digested DNA was self-ligated with T4 DNA ligase and transformed into competent E. coli DH5α λpir116 and plasmid DNA was isolated (23Alexander D.C. Jones J.R. Tan T. Chen J.M. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18824-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers MAR1 (5′-CCCGAAAAGTGCCACCGTGAAAAGCCC-3′) and MAR2 (5′-CGCTTCCTCGTGCTTTACGGTATCG-3′) were used to determine the position of the transposon, which was inserted at a TA dinucleotide, 412 bp downstream, from the ATG start codon of an open reading frame previously termed pimF (23Alexander D.C.

The DNA sequence was compared with the genome sequences of M. marinum and M. tuberculosis at the Sanger Institute and analyzed with NTI Suite software (Informax) revealing that the predicted protein was homologous to the Rv1500 of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Molecular Cloning—The complementing pPMT1-Rv1500 plasmid was generated as described previously (23Alexander D.C. Jones J.R. Tan T. Chen J.M. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18824-18833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by cloning DNA fragments containing the homologous Rv1500 gene from a M. tuberculosis H37Rv BAC library (obtained from S. Cole, Institut Pasteur, Paris) (26Brosch R. Gordon S.V. Billault A. Garnier T. Eiglmeier K. Soravito C. Barrell B.G. Cole S.T. Infect.

Bishai W.R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 166: 181-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Lipid Extraction and Analysis—Polar lipids and apolar lipids were extracted from freeze-dried M. marinum cells grown either on Sauton or Middlebrook 7H11 agar according to the procedures of Dobson et al. (28Dobson G. Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Parlett M. Goodfellow M. Ridell M. Magnusson M. Goodfellow M. Minnikin D.E. Chemical Methods in Bacterial Systematics. Academic Press, London1985: 237-265Google Scholar) by stirring in 220 ml of methanolic saline (20 ml of 0.3% NaCl and 200 ml of CH3OH) and 220 ml of petroleum ether for 2 h. The cells were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. The resulting biphasic solution was separated and the upper layer containing apolar lipids was recovered. An additional 220 ml of petroleum ether was added, mixed, and harvested as described above. The two upper petroleum ether fractions were combined and dried under reduced pressure. To extract polar lipids, 260 ml of chloroform, methanol, 0.3% NaCl (9:10:3, v/v/v), were added to the lower aqueous methanol layer and the solution stirred for 4 h. This mixture was filtered and the filter cake re-extracted twice with 85 ml of chloroform, methanol, 0.3% NaCl (5:10:4, v/v/v). Chloroform (145 ml) and 0.3% NaCl (145 ml) were added to the combined filtrates. This mixture was stirred for 1 h, allowed to settle, and the lower layer containing the polar lipids recovered and dried under reduced pressure. The polar lipid extract was examined by two-dimensional TLC on aluminum backed plates of Silica Gel 60 F254 (Merck 5554), using chloroform/methanol/water (60:30:6, v/v/v) in the first direction and chloroform/acetic acid/methanol/water (40:25:3:6, v/v/v) in the second direction (28Dobson G. Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Parlett M. Goodfellow M. Ridell M. Magnusson M. Goodfellow M. Minnikin D.E. Chemical Methods in Bacterial Systematics. Academic Press, London1985: 237-265Google Scholar). Glycolipids were visualized by either spraying plates with α-naphthol/sulfuric acid followed by gentle charring of the plates, or visualized using the Dittmer and Lester reagent that is specific for phospholipids and glycophospholipids. Purification of Glycolipids—The crude polar lipid extract (250 mg) was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and applied to a DEAE cellulose column (2 × 15 cm) for purification. The column was eluted with chloroform/methanol (100 ml; 2:1, v/v) and increasing concentrations of ammonium acetate (5-500 mm) in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The purification process was monitored by TLC using either chloroform/methanol/water (60:30:6, v/v/v) or chloroform/acetic acid/methanol/water (40:25:3:6, v/v/v) (28Dobson G. Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Parlett M. Goodfellow M. Ridell M. Magnusson M. Goodfellow M. Minnikin D.E. Chemical Methods in Bacterial Systematics. Academic Press, London1985: 237-265Google Scholar). Glycolipids were visualized by spraying plates with α-naphthol/sulfuric acid followed by gentle charring of the plates. Phospholipids and glycophospholipids were stained and visualized using the Dittmer and Lester reagent. Glycolipids were further purified into individual species by preparative TLC on 10 × 20-cm plastic backed TLC plates of Silica Gel 60 F254 (Merck 5735, Darmstadt, Germany), run in chloroform/methanol/water (60:30:6, v/v/v). The plates were then sprayed with 0.01% 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene dissolved in petroleum ether/acetone (9:1, v/v) and the glycolipids visualized under UV light. Following detection the plates were re-developed in toluene to remove diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene and the corresponding glycolipid bands were scraped from the plates and extracted from the silica gel using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Sugar Compositional Analysis—Samples were hydrolyzed in 1 m methanolic hydrogen chloride at 80 °C for 16 h and the reagent was removed under a stream of nitrogen. Hexosamines were re-N-acetylated in 500 μl of methanol/pyridine/acetic anhydride (500:1:5, v/v/v) for 15 min at room temperature, then dried under nitrogen. Trimethylsilyl derivatization was performed in 200 μl of Tri-Sil “Z” (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min, after which the reagent was removed under nitrogen. Derivatized monosaccharides were resuspended in 1 ml of hexanes, centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred and dried under nitrogen for analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Samples were analyzed by GC-MS using temperature program A (see below). Fatty Acid Methyl Ester Analysis—Samples were hydrolyzed in 200 μl of methanolic hydrogen chloride at 80 °C for 16 h and the reagent was removed under a stream of nitrogen. The products were dissolved in CHCl3 and washed several times with water before drying under a stream of nitrogen, and analyzing by GC-MS using temperature program B (see below). Sugar Derivatization—Per-O-methylation was performed as described previously (29Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 203: 108-132Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of a dimethyl sulfoxide/NaOH slurry was added followed by 0.5 ml of iodomethane (trideuterioiodomethane for per-O-deuterio-methylation). The reaction mixture was vigorously shaken for 10 min at room temperature and the reaction quenched with ∼1 ml of water. Per-O-methylated samples were then extracted into chloroform (1 ml) and washed several times with water before drying under a stream of nitrogen. After derivatization, the reaction products were purified on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters), as described previously (29Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 203: 108-132Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and eluted successively with 35, 50, 75, and 100% acetonitrile in water and finally chloroform. To establish the location of acyl functions on the oligosaccharide backbone, the native samples were subjected to the neutral alkylating conditions of Prehm (30Prehm P. Carbohydr. Res. 1980; 78: 372-374Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar), followed by de-O-acylation, then per-O-ethylation using the sodium hydroxide procedure. Samples were dissolved in 100 μl of trimethyl phosphate, then 100 μl of 2,6-di-(tert)-butylpyridine and 50 μl of methyltrifluoromethanesulfonate were added. The mixture was stirred and incubated at 50 °C for 2 h, following which 1 ml of water was added. The mixture was loaded onto a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge and the sample eluted as described above. After analysis, the relevant Sep-Pak fractions were dried and the samples de-O-acylated in 200 μl of methanol, 35% aqueous NH3 (1:1, v/v) solution at 37 °C for 16 h and then dried. The samples were then per-O-ethylated and purified on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge as described above. Characterization of the trehalose core was performed by first de-O-acylating samples as described above. Dried samples were then reduced with 200 μl of 10 mg/ml sodium borodeuteride in 2 m aqueous ammonium hydroxide at room temperature for 2 h, and the reaction was terminated with a few drops of acetic acid. Excess borates were removed by loading directly onto Dowex columns (Merck) and samples were eluted with 2 column volumes of 5% acetic acid (∼2 × 2 ml). Samples were dried and per-O-methylated using the sodium hydroxide procedure and purified on a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge as described above. Linkage Analysis—Per-O-methylated (or per-O-deuteriomethylated) samples were hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 121 °C, reduced with 10 mg/ml sodium borodeuteride in 2 m aqueous ammonium hydroxide at room temperature for 2 h, and the reaction terminated with a few drops of acetic acid. Samples were dried and then acetylated with acetic anhydride at 100 °C for 1 h. The reagent was removed under a stream of nitrogen, then the samples were dissolved in chloroform and washed several times with water before drying under nitrogen. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS using temperature program C (see below). Order of Linkages—Samples were incubated in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium periodate in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, for 48 h at 4 °C in the dark. The reaction was terminated by adding 4 μl of ethylene glycol and incubating for a further 60 min in the dark and the reaction mixtures were freeze-dried. Samples were reduced with 10 mg/ml sodium borohydride in 2 m aqueous ammonium hydroxide at room temperature for 2 h, then the reaction was terminated with a few drops of acetic acid. Excess borates were removed by loading directly onto Dowex columns (Merck) and samples were eluted with 2 column volumes of 5% acetic acid (∼2 × 2 ml). Samples were dried and per-O-methylated using the sodium hydroxide procedure described above. Absolute Configuration of Sugars—Samples were prepared as described for trimethylsilyl derivatives, except hydrolysis was performed in 1 m (S)-(+)-2-butanolic-HCl prior to re-N-acetylation and trimethylsilyl derivatization. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS using temperature program D (see below). GC-MS Analysis—This was carried out using a PerkinElmer Clarus 500 instrument, fitted with a RTX-5 (30 m × 0.25-mm internal diameter, Restek Corp.) for sugar analysis or a Stabilwax (30 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter, Restek Corp.) for lipid analysis. For temperature program A the oven was held at 65 °C for 1 min before being increased to 140 °C at a rate of 25 °C/min, then to 200 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, and finally to a temperature of 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. For temperature program B the oven was held at 90 °C for 1 min before being increased to 150 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min, then to 250 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. For temperature program C the oven was held at 60 °C for 1 min before being increased to 300 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min. For temperature program D the oven was held at 65 °C for 1 min before being increased to 160 °C at a rate of 25 °C/min, then to 250 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min, finally to a temperature of 300 °C at a rate of 25 °C/min. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) Analysis—MALDI-MS was performed using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE® STR mass spectrometer in the reflectron mode with Delayed Extraction. Per-O-methylated samples were dissolved in methanol and 1-μl aliquots were loaded onto a metal plate with 1 μl of the matrix 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Native glycolipids were analyzed using the matrix 2-(4-hydroxphenylazo)benzoic acid. Sequazyme peptide mass standards were used as external calibrants (Applied Biosystems). Electrospray Ionization-MS Analysis—Per-O-methylated samples were dissolved in methanol and sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, UK). MS and MS/MS spectra were collected in the positive ion mode. Collision energies typically were 50-90 eV. Data were acquired and processed using Masslynx software (Micromass, UK). The instrument was pre-calibrated using a 1-pmol/μl solution of [Glu1]fibrinopeptide B in acetonitrile, 5% aqueous acetic acid (1:3, v/v). Effect of Growth Conditions on TLC Patterns of M. marinum Glycolipids—Polar lipids were extracted from M. marinum 1218R bacilli grown on both Sauton or Middlebrook 7H11 agar and glycolipid profiles were recorded by two-dimensional TLC (Fig. 1). It is clearly evident that the growth condi"
https://openalex.org/W2060111479,"Vascular smooth muscle cell contraction and relaxation are directly related to the phosphorylation state of the regulatory myosin light chain. Myosin light chains are dephosphorylated by myosin phosphatase, leading to vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Myosin phosphatase is localized not only at actin-myosin stress fibers where it dephosphorylates myosin light chains, but also in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane. The mechanisms by which myosin phosphatase is targeted to these loci are incompletely understood. We recently identified myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein as a member of the myosin phosphatase complex that directly binds both the myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase and RhoA and is localized to actin-myosin stress fibers. We hypothesized that myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein targets myosin phosphatase to the contractile apparatus to dephosphorylate myosin light chains. We used RNA interference to silence the expression of myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein in human vascular smooth muscle cells. Myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein silencing reduced the localization of the myosin binding subunit to stress fibers. This reduction in stress fiber myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein and myosin binding subunit increased basal and lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated myosin light chain phosphorylation. Neither cellular myosin phosphatase, myosin light chain kinase, nor RhoA activities were changed by myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein silencing. Furthermore, myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein silencing resulted in marked phenotypic changes in vascular smooth muscle cells, including increased numbers of stress fibers, increased cell area, and reduced stress fiber inhibition in response to a Rho-kinase inhibitor. These data support the importance of myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein-dependent targeting of myosin phosphatase to stress fibers for regulating myosin light chain phosphorylation state and morphology in human vascular smooth muscle cells.

Neither cellular myosin phosphatase, myosin light chain kinase, nor RhoA activities were changed by myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein silencing. Furthermore, myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein silencing resulted in marked phenotypic changes in vascular smooth muscle cells, including increased numbers of stress fibers, increased cell area, and reduced stress fiber inhibition in response to a Rho-kinase inhibitor. These data support the importance of myosin phosphatase-Rho interacting protein-dependent targeting of myosin phosphatase to stress fibers for regulating myosin light chain phosphorylation state and morphology in human vascular smooth muscle cells. Blood vessel tone is important in the regulation of blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Disorders of blood vessel tone play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, vascular spasm, and acute coronary syndromes (1Goldberg I.D. Stemerman M.B. Schnipper L.E. Ransil B.J.

VSMC contraction is determined by the phosphorylation state of the regulatory myosin light chain (MLC) (6Hartshorne D.J. Johnson D.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven, New York1987: 423-482Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of MLC at serine 19 leads to actin-activated myosin ATPase activity, cross-bridge cycling, and contraction (7Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J.

MLC is phosphorylated by the calcium/calmodulin-regulated myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which phosphorylates MLC leading to VSMC contraction (9Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Taylor D.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14456-14462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) dephosphorylates MLC causing VSMC relaxation (11Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The counter regulatory activities of MLCK and MLCP control MLC phosphorylation state in response to contractile agonists and vasodilators. MLCP is a heterotrimer consisting of the 37-kDa PP1 catalytic subunit, a 130-kDa myosin binding subunit (MBS), and a 20-kDa subunit of uncertain function (11Alessi D. MacDougall L.K. Sola M.M.

J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and contains protein interaction domains, including amino-terminal ankyrin repeats, and a carboxylterminal leucine zipper domain. MLCP activity is highly regulated by both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator signaling pathways. Vasoconstrictors such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), thromboxane A2, and angiotensin II, inhibit MLCP via a RhoA/Rho-kinase-dependent mechanism (15Seko T. Ito M. Kureishi Y. Okamoto R. Moriki N.

Physiol. 2001; 281: C571-C578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, nitrovasodilators, such as endogenous nitric oxide and organic nitrates, activate MLCP via cGMP production and activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1α (17Lee M.R. Li L. Kitazawa T.

We and others have shown that MLCP activation by cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1α is dependent upon a leucine zipper-mediated interaction between MBS and cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1α (20Surks H.K.

Recent data suggest that phosphorylation of MBS may play a role in the regulation of MLCP localization within the cell (33Velasco G. Armstrong C. Morrice N. Frame S. Cohen P.

Studies have shown that MBS can bind to actin-myosin stress fibers, supporting a potential role for MBS in the cellular localization of the heterotrimeric phosphatase (20Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 31Murata K. Hirano K. Villa-Moruzzi E. Hartshorne D.J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The regulation and intracellular targeting of MLCP is, however, complex and incompletely understood. We recently identified a new member of the MLCP complex, myosin phosphatase-rho interacting protein (M-RIP) (36Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the human homolog of murine p116RIP3 (37Gebbink M.F.B.G. Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P.G Houssa B. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1603-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We found that M-RIP can directly bind both RhoA and MLCP at adjacent sites and can form a complex of all three proteins (36Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In VSMCs, M-RIP colocalized with actin filaments. We hypothesized that M-RIP, by virtue of these protein-protein interactions, targets MLCP to actin-myosin contractile filaments. Here we report that M-RIP silencing using RNA interference (RNAi) prevents MBS localization to stress fibers. This leads to increased MLC phosphorylation without a change in cellular MLCP, MLCK, or RhoA activity. M-RIP silencing also caused marked VSMC phenotypic changes, including increases in stress fiber number and cell area, and reduced stress fiber inhibition from a Rho-kinase inhibitor. Materials—1-Oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-3-glycerol-3-phosphate sodium (LPA) was from Sigma, Y27632 was from Tocris, and bovine brain calmodulin was from Biomol. Rhotekin-RBD GST beads were purchased from Cytoskeleton. Antibodies were as follows: anti-M-RIP and anti-p-MLC (Thr18/Ser19) were from BD Transduction Laboratories, anti-MBS was from Covance, monoclonal anti-PP1 and polyclonal anti-RhoA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and monoclonal anti-MLC and anti-MLCK were from Sigma. Cell Culture—Human aortic smooth muscle cells (Ao184) were cultured by the explant method as described before (36Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ao184 cells were immortalized using adenovirus-expressing E6 and E7 and selection for G418 resistance and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation Assay—Human aortic smooth muscle cells (Ao184) were grown to near confluence in 12-well dishes, then were serum-deprived overnight. After changing the media, cells were treated with 1 μm LPA for 10 min with or without pretreatment with 10 μm Y27632 for 30 min. Following stimulation, cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) were added to the cells on ice. The cell pellet was then microcentrifuged and washed three times with cold acetone containing 2 mm DTT. The washed pellet was solubilized in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels, and immunoblotted for M-RIP, P-MLC, MLC, and MBS. RNA Interference—M-RIP-specific oligonucleotides were predicted using oligoengine and Dharmacon programs. A 21-bp oligonucleotide corresponding to bp 3259–3278 of the M-RIP cDNA was synthesized by Dharmacon. Nonspecific control X (Dharmacon) was used as the control scrambled dsRNA and contained similar GC content to the M-RIP dsRNA. Cells were transfected in 6- or 12-well dishes at 30–60% confluence with 100 nm dsRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were studied 96 h after transfection. For determination of silencing efficiency in Fig. 1, cell lysates were prepared as described in Ref. 36Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, and protein assays were performed using the MicroBCA kit (Pierce). Twenty micrograms of each lysate was loaded on 7.5 and 10% protein gels, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were performed with the indicated antibodies. Preparation of Regulatory Myosin Light Chains—The 32P-labeled myosin light chain (MLC) was used as the substrate for MLCP assays, and unlabeled MLC was used as the substrate in MLCK assays. Chicken gizzard MLC cDNA was a gift from Dr. Kathy Trybus (University of Vermont). MLC cDNA was cloned into vector pQE (Qiagen) and verified by sequencing. HIS6MLC was expressed and purified from bacteria using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) as described (36Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For MLCK assays, HIS6MLC was eluted from beads with 250 mm imidazole. For MLCP assays, HIS6MLC was phosphorylated with GST-ZIPkinase. GST-ZIPkinase was expressed and purified from bacteria as described before (38Endo A. Surks H.K. Mochizuki S. Mochizuki N. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42055-42061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HIS6MLC (40 μm) was phosphorylated by ZIPK in phosphorylation buffer (30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) with 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated HIS6MLC was released from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads with 250 mm imidazole. [32P]HIS6MLC was then dialyzed in three changes of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 m KCl, 0.5 mm DTT) and two changes of buffer B (30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl). Myosin Phosphatase Activity Assay—Subconfluent Ao184 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were serum-deprived overnight. Cells were treated with vehicle or LPA for 10 min, with and without pretreatment with Y27632 for 30 min. The cells were then rinsed with cold PBS on ice and lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. The lysates were homogenized by passage through a 26-gauge needle five times and were microcentrifuged for 20 min. Each lysate was then split in two for immunoprecipitation with nonimmune IgG, and anti-MBS. The samples were incubated at 4 °C, rocking for 3 h, then protein A beads were added for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed twice in phosphatase assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT), then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 10 μm [32P]MLC. The assay was terminated, and the protein precipitated by the addition of bovine serum albumin and trichloroacetic acid to 0.1 and 10% final concentration, respectively, incubation on ice for 10 min, and centrifugation for 15 min. The liberated free 32P in the supernatant was measured by Cerenkov counting. Similar amounts of MBS were recovered in the immunopellets of scrambled and M-RIP RNAi Ao184 cells (data not shown). Phosphatase activity was normalized to the amount of MBS immunoprecipitated. MLCK Activity Assay—The assay was based on the method published by Poperechnaya et al. (39Poperechnaya A. Varlamova O. Lin P. Stull J.T. Bresnick A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Subconfluent Ao184 cells with and without transfection with dsRNA were grown in 100-mm dishes and deprived of serum overnight. In control experiments, cells were treated with or without 10% serum. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS, then lysed in 0.35 ml of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm MgCl2, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. The cell lysates were collected and microfuged for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 1:4 with 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and protease inhibitors as above and added to anti-MLCK precoupled to protein G beads. Following incubation for 2 h at 4°C, the immunopellets were washed three times with cold 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm DTT. The immunopellets were resuspended in 40 μl of reaction buffer consisting of 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 μm calmodulin, and 0.1 mm ATP. The reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 20 min (39Poperechnaya A. Varlamova O. Lin P. Stull J.T. Bresnick A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) then stopped by the addition of protein sample buffer and boiling. Aliquots of each reaction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-p-MLC, as described above, and anti-MLCK. MLC phosphorylation was normalized to the amount of immunoprecipitated MLCK. Control samples were assigned a value of 1. RhoA Activity Assay—The assay was based on the method of Ren et al. (40Ren X-D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the manufacturer's instructions for Rhotekin-RBD GST beads. Subconfluent Ao184 cells with and without transfection with dsRNA were grown in 150-mm dishes and deprived of serum overnight. In control experiments, cells were treated with or without 10% serum or 1 μm LPA for 10 min. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS, then lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Igepal, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. The lysate was microcentrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cleared supernatant was added to 120 μg of Rhotekin-RBD GST beads. After incubation for 45 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, and 30 mm MgCl2 and boiled in protein sample buffer. The RhoA bound to Rhotekin-RBD beads and the input RhoA were detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Rhotekin-bound RhoA was normalized to the input RhoA. Purification of Stress Fibers—Purified stress fibers were prepared from Ao184 cells by glycerol extraction as described (35Katoh K. Kano Y. Amano M. Onishi H. Kaibuchi K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 36Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on 100-mm dishes to near confluence, washed with cold PBS, then extracted with 10 ml of triethanolamine extraction buffer (2.5 mm triethanolamine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min, shaking, with replacement of extraction buffer every 2–3 min. Remaining cell components were then further extracted using 10 ml of glycerol buffer (50% glycerol, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml aprotinin in PBS) for 5 min while shaking, with replacement of extraction buffer twice. The glycerol was then removed by washing with 10 ml of aprotinin-PBS (20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin and pepstatin A in PBS) for 8 min while shaking with one replacement of wash buffer. The remaining insoluble material was scraped in aprotinin-PBS and homogenized with a Z-shaped 21 gauge needle. The insoluble debris was pelleted at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and stress fibers were isolated by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The stress fiber pellet was boiled in protein sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. For immunostaining of purified stress fibers, cells were grown on coverslips and glycerol-extracted as described above. Stress fibers were then fixed and immunostained as described below. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Ao184 smooth muscle cells were plated on coverslips as described (36Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Antibodies used include 1:400 anti-RIP (BD Transduction Laboratories) followed by 1:500 donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Cells were washed in PBS and mounted on glass slides with SlowFade (Molecular Probes). For immunofluorescence of purified stress fibers, Ao184 cells were extracted on coverslips as described (36Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and immunostained with anti-MRIP (1:400), anti-MBS (1:1000), and Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin. All images were captured after a 10-s exposure on a Spot charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.). Assessment of Stress Fiber Number and Cell Area and Stress Fiber Response to Y27632—Ao184 cells were transfected with control or M-RIP oligonucleotides, incubated for 48 h, and then plated at 20% confluence on coverslips in 12-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Seventy-two hours after transfection, the cells were fixed and permeabilized as described (36Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or treated with 10 μm Y27632 for 30 min prior to fixation. The cells were immunostained with M-RIP antibody, Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to stain nuclei. The fluorescent images were captured on a Spot charge-coupled device camera as above. For assessment of stress fiber number, all stress fibers were counted in 20 consecutive single cells on both control and M-RIP RNAi coverslips for three independent experiments. Cell area was measured in 20 consecutive single cells on both control and M-RIP RNAi coverslips using the Image-Pro Plus software for three independent experiments. For Y27632-treated cells, 50 individual cells were analyzed for both control and M-RIP RNAi. Stress fibers were counted and M-RIP immunofluorescence was scored as: 1) trace M-RIP, 2) low M-RIP expression, 3) moderate M-RIP expression, and 4) high M-RIP expression at levels similar to control transfected cells. Data Analysis—All data were plotted and analyzed using SigmaPlot 5.0 software, and p value was determined using Student's t test. Specific Inhibition of M-RIP Expression Using RNAi—To test the function of M-RIP in VSMCs, M-RIP expression was inhibited using RNAi. Compared with control transfected VSMCs, M-RIP RNAi reduced M-RIP expression by a mean of 72% (data not shown) without affecting the expression level of MLC, the MLCP subunits MBS and PP1, RhoA, ROCK, or MLCK (Fig. 1).

However, although mitochondria consume almost all of the O2 available to the cells, little is known about how O2 tension influences the expression of the mitochondrial genome. We show in O2-sensitive excitable rat PC12 cells that, among the mtDNA-encoded genes, hypoxia produced a specific down-regulation of the transcripts encoding mitochondrial complex I NADH dehydrogenase (ND) subunits, particularly ND4 and ND5 mRNAs and a stable mRNA precursor containing the ND5 and cytochrome b genes. This unprecedented effect of hypoxia was fast (developed in <30 min) and fairly reversible and occurred at moderate levels of hypoxia (O2 tensions in the range of 20–70 mm Hg). Hypoxic down-regulation of the mitochondrial complex I genes was paralleled by the reduction of complex I activity and was retarded by iron chelation, suggesting that an iron-dependent post-transcriptional mechanism could regulate mitochondrial mRNA stability. It is known that cell respiration is under tight control by the amount of proteins in mitochondrial complexes of the electron transport chain. Therefore, regulation of the expression of the mitochondrial (mtDNA)-encoded complex I subunits could be part of an adaptive mechanism to adjust respiration rate to the availability of O2 and to induce fast adaptive changes in hypoxic cells.

Oxygen (O2) is absolutely required for cell survival due to its fundamental role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Decreases in O2 tension (PO2) trigger acute and chronic adaptive cellular responses to increase O2 delivery to the tissues and to minimize the deleterious effects of hypoxia. In mammals, acute hypoxia (occurring over a time scale of seconds to minutes) regulates the activity of ion channels existing in specific O2-sensitive cells, which mediate fast respiratory and cardiovascular counterregulatory adjustments (for review, see Refs. 1López-Barneo J.

Despite the progress in the understanding of the signaling pathway responsible for the regulation of nuclear gene expression by O2, little is known about how the mitochondrial genome responds to hypoxia and in which way the O2-sensitive mitochondrial and extramitochondrial processes interact. This is rather surprising if one considers that mitochondria consume almost all of the O2 available to the cells and that they have been classically postulated as O2 sensors. Mitochondrial respiration is known to be depressed even during moderate hypoxia (17Chavez J.C. Pichiule P. Boero J. Arregui A. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 193: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R. Choe S.H. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol.

Among the little information available, there is a study reporting that extreme hypoxia (<1mmHg) produces transcriptional down-regulation of some nuclear and mitochondrial genes encoding complex IV proteins (20Vijayasarathy C. Damle S. Prabu S.K. Otto C.M. Avadhani N.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This study was designed to perform a systematic analysis of the effect of hypoxia on the expression of the mitochondrial genome. Mammalian mitochondrial (mtDNA) is a circular molecule of ∼16.6 kb, present in several copies per mitochondria. The mtDNA contains genes for two rRNAs (12 S and 16 S), 22 tRNAs, and 13 mRNAs encoding proteins in mitochondrial complexes I and III–V (21Taanman J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 103-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In most of the experiments, we used the oxygen-sensitive rat pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cell line (22Zhu W.H. Conforti L.

In addition, confirmatory experiments were done on non-excitable Buffalo rat liver (BRL) cells. Among all of the mtDNA-encoded genes, hypoxia induced a specific down-regulation of the mRNAs encoding complex I proteins. This regulation was fast and reversible and occurred at physiologic O2 tensions. The hypoxia-induced decrease in these transcripts was paralleled by a reduction of the NADH dehydrogenase activity of complex I. In contrast, hypoxia did not alter the transcripts of the genes encoding the complex III–V subunits. Our data suggest that regulation of the mtDNA-encoded complex I subunits participates in mitochondrial O2 sensing. This could be part of an adaptive mechanism evolved to tune respiration rate during hypoxia and to optimize mitochondrial oxygen consumption and energy production by the cells. Cell Cultures and Hypoxic Treatments—Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 and BRL cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 4.5 g/liter d-glucose, l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. PC12 cultures were supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 10% (v/v) horse serum and maintained under “normoxic” conditions at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 21% O2. BRL cultures were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 21% O2 for normoxic conditions. For hypoxic treatments, cells were grown at 1, 3, 6, or 10% O2 (7, 21, 42, and 70 mm Hg, respectively) in a hypoxic incubator (ThermoForma). Chemical reagents were added to the culture medium at the following final concentrations: 100 μm Deferoxamine mesylate (DFX; Sigma), 100 μm cobalt chloride, 1 mm dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), and 2 mm glutathione ethyl ester (reduced form; Sigma). To test the effect of iron chelation during hypoxia, DFX was added to the culture medium 18 h before incubation under hypoxic conditions. To test the effect of glutathione ethyl ester during hypoxia, the reducing agent was added 30 min before incubation under hypoxic conditions. To study the effect of hypoxia in the absence of extracellular calcium, cells were incubated in calcium-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen catalog no. 21068) supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin without serum added. For these experiments, cells were first preincubated under normoxic conditions for 30 min and then transferred to hypoxic conditions. For all experiments, exponentially growing cells under normoxic conditions (60–80% confluence) cultured in 60-mm Petri dishes were transferred to an incubator set for hypoxic conditions. After different time intervals (typically 0.5, 2, 6, and 24 h), dishes were withdrawn for total RNA preparation. As a control (0 h of hypoxia), cultures kept in normoxia were used. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from cells using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the recommended protocol. For Northern blotting, 10–15 μg of RNA/sample was loaded onto formaldehyde-agarose gel. Electrophoresis and transfer to Hybond-N nylon membranes were performed following standard procedures. RNA-DNA hybridization was performed at 42 °C in ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer (Ambion, Inc.). Gel-purified DNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Biosciences). Riboprobes were labeled with [α-32P]dUTP by in vivo transcription of the corresponding genes following standard procedures. After each hybridization experiment, probes were stripped off in boiling 0.5% SDS solution before hybridization with the cyclophilin probe (Ppia gene) for a loading control. Northern RNA band intensity was quantified with the Fujifilm FLA-3000 system. Probes—Probes hybridizing with mitochondrial mRNAs (see Fig. 1A) were synthesized by PCR as follows: probe 1 (to hybridize with the ND1, ND2, COI, and COII genes; nucleotides 2773–7605 of the rat mitochondrial chromosome, GenBank™ accession number AJ428514), primers Rmit1 (5′-TGCCATGGCCTTCCTCA-3′) and Rmit2 (5′-GCCGCAAATTTCAGAGC-3′); probe 2 (to hybridize with the ATP6 and ATP8 genes; nucleotides 7755–8562), primers Rmit5 (5′-ATGCCACAACTAGACACATC-3′) and Rmit6 (5′-AGGGTGAATACATAGGCTTG-3′); probe 3 (to hybridize with the COIII, ND4, ND4/4L, ND5, and ND6 genes; nucleotides 8600–14160), primers Rmit3 (5′-CCCACCAAACCCATGCA-3′) and Rmit4 (5′-GGGGGTGAGATTTTCGG-3′); probe 4 (to hybridize with the cytochrome b (Cyt-b) gene; nucleotides 14145–15227), primers Rmit7 (5′-CGAAAATCTACCCCCTATT-3′) and Rmit8 (5′-GTGTTCTACTGGTTGGCCTC-3′); probe COIII (nucleotides 8600–9219), primers Rmit3 and Rmit15 (5′-TACGTGGAGGCCATGA-3′); probe ND4 (to hybridize with the ND4/4L gene; nucleotides 10335–10725), primers Rmit16 (5′-CATTATCCACCCCACTA-3′) and Rmit17 (5′-CATGTTGAGGGTAGGGG-3′); probe ND5-5p (to hybridize with the 5′-region of ND5; nucleotides 11784–12263), primers Rmit11 (5′-CCAATCATCATTTCCAT-3′) and Rmit12 (5′-GACTCGGTTGTAGAGGAT-3′); probe ND5-3p (to hybridize with the 3′-region of ND5; nucleotides 12883–13560), primers Rmit13 (5′-TCCTCACAGGATTCTATTCA-3′) and Rmit14 (5′-TTGAAATCACTCGGGATTAA-3′); and probe ND6 (nucleotides 13540–14029), primers Rmit9 (5′-TTAATCCCGAGTGATTTC-3′) and Rmit10 (5′-ACTGTTTTTGACTGGTTG-3′). For riboprobes rND5 and rND6, the PCR-generated ND5-5p and ND6 probes were cloned in the pGEM-T Easy® vector (Promega Corp.). The rat cyclophilin cDNA probe (Ppia) was obtained as a 743-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment from plasmid p1B15 as described (26Danielson P.E. Forss-Petter S. Brow M.A. Calavetta L. Douglass J. Milner R.J. Sutcliffe J.G. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Isolation—PC12 cells were grown on four to six 15-mm Petri dishes per sample and incubated either under normoxic or hypoxic conditions as described above. Mitochondrial isolation was carried out at 4 °C with samples kept on ice. About 108 cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, spun for 5 min at 1000 rpm, washed once with ice-cold buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm Hepes, and 0.1 mm EGTA), and resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer A. Cells were broken by 10–15 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a motor-driven pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 6 min in microcentrifuge, and the supernatant containing mitochondria was collected. Mitochondria were spun down by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm, washed twice with buffer A, and resuspended in a final volume of ∼250 μl of buffer A. The mitochondrial suspension was aliquoted (40 μl), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at –80 °C until used. The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad colorimetric assay, diluting samples in 0.05% SDS. Measurement of Activities of Mitochondrial Complexes—Mitochondrial complex activities were determined in a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer according to Birch-Machin and Turnbull (27Birch-Machin M.A. Turnbull D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 97-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. For mitochondrial complex I and II activities, 30–50 μg of protein were assayed at 30 °C. Samples were diluted 1:4 in assay reaction buffer (25 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm potassium cyanide, and 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and liquid nitrogen frozen/thawed three times before the assay. For mitochondrial complex I activity, rotenone-sensitive ND activity was measured as the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (referred to 425 nm) due to oxidation of 130 μm NADH (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of 3.6 μm antimycin and 130 μm ubiquinone-1. Absorbance was measured for 2 min before and after addition of 5 μm rotenone to the reaction. Differences between rates were considered for determination of activity due to mitochondrial complex I. To evaluate mitochondrial complex II activity, succinate dehydrogenase activity was measured for a period of 2 min as the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm due to the reduction of 50 μm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol coupled with reduction of 130 μm ubiquinone-1. The reaction was carried out in the presence of 3.6 μm antimycin, 5 μm rotenone, and 10 mm succinate. The activities of complexes I and II were normalized to the mitochondrial matrix citrate synthase activity of the same samples. For citrate synthase activity, the formation of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) anion coupled with oxidation of oxalacetate was measured as the increase in absorbance at 412 nm after addition of acetyl-CoA for 1 min. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E., and statistical significance was estimated with a parametric Student's t test. Statistical significance is given in the figure legends. Down-regulation of Complex I Mitochondrial mRNA by Hypoxia—A transcriptional analysis of the mitochondrial genome was performed using several probes that hybridize with all of the genes. The rat mitochondrial genome and the probes used in our study are schematically depicted in Fig. 1A. Transcription of mtDNA is initiated mainly at the D-loop region by the mitochondrial transcription factor A (mETFA) and occurs bidirectionally from two divergent promoters (PH and PL) that regulate the heavy (H-strand) and light (L-strand) strands, respectively. The H-strand encodes the two ribosomal RNAs, most of the mRNAs and 15 tRNAs; the L-strand encodes the ND6 gene and the remaining seven tRNAs. Thus, the H- and L-strands are synthesized as polycistronic RNA molecules that must be subsequently processed (21Taanman J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 103-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The tRNAs scattered through the circular mtDNA act as a punctuation system for cleavage of precursors. Stabilization of mature RNA species and some precursors is achieved mainly through polyadenylation of their 3′-ends (28Gagliardi D. Stepien P.P. Temperley R.J. Lightowlers R.N. Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 260-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Rat PC12 cells were incubated either under normoxic (21% O2; PO2 = 147 mm Hg) or hypoxic (3% O2; PO2 = 21 mm Hg) conditions for different time periods, after which total RNA was prepared and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Among the six complex I subunits encoded by the H-strand, we analyzed the mRNAs of the ND1, ND2, ND5, ND4, and ND4/4L genes, with the last two appearing on the same transcript (29Amalric F. Merkel C. Gelfand R. Attardi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 118: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The transcript encoding the ND3 subunit was not studied because its steady-state expression was below the level of reproducible detection of the Northern blot technique. We also analyzed the mRNAs of the Cyt-b (complex III); COI, COII, and COIII (complex IV); and ATP6 and ATP8 (complex V) genes. Hypoxia induced a decrease in mRNAs corresponding to ND1 + ND2 (which were detected at the same location in the blot), ND4/4L, and ND5 (Fig. 1B). The ND6 transcript was not detected with these probes, as the steady-state level of the L-strand is much lower than that of the H-strand (30Tullo A. Tanzariello F. D'Erchia A.M. Nardelli M. Papeo P.A. Sbisa E. Saccone C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The ND6 mRNA, as evidenced with a specific riboprobe, was not regulated by hypoxia (see below). In contrast with the H-strand-encoded complex I subunits, the transcripts encoding the rest of the mitochondrial complexes (complexes III–V) were unaffected by hypoxia (Fig. 1B). For quantification purposes, the mRNA levels of the ND subunits were normalized to the mRNA levels of either COIII (detected with probe 3) (Fig. 1C, upper panel) or COII (detected with probe 1) (lower panel). This eliminates the variability in different cultures due to unnoticed changes in the amount of mtDNA relative to nuclear DNA. The decrease in the mRNA of the complex I ND subunits occurred within the first 2 h of hypoxic exposure, reaching a maximum plateau level after 6–24 h of culture (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D illustrates quantitatively that the mRNA levels of Cyt-b (complex III); COI, COII, and COIII (complex IV); and ATP6 and ATP8 (complex V) normalized to those of the nuclear encoded cyclophilin transcript (Ppia gene) were not significantly altered by hypoxia. In addition to ND4 and ND5 mRNAs, we also detected with probe 3 a 3.6-kb precursor molecule containing the ND5 and Cyt-b genes (30Tullo A. Tanzariello F. D'Erchia A.M. Nardelli M. Papeo P.A. Sbisa E. Saccone C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 31Bhat K.S. Bhat N.K. Kulkarni G.R. Iyengar A. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5818-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32van Itallie C.M. Van Why S. Thulin G. Kashgarian M. Siegel N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C712-C719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This precursor (ND5 + Cyt-b), processed more slowly probably due to the lack of tRNA between the various genes, becomes polyadenylated and remains as a stable RNA species (30Tullo A. Tanzariello F. D'Erchia A.M. Nardelli M. Papeo P.A. Sbisa E. Saccone C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32van Itallie C.M. Van Why S. Thulin G. Kashgarian M. Siegel N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C712-C719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ND5 + Cyt-b mRNA was the one most affected by hypoxia (Fig. 1, B and C). The ratio of ND5 + Cyt-b mRNA to the COIII transcript reached a minimum of ∼25% of the normoxic value after 24 h of hypoxia (3% O2; PO2 = 21 mm Hg). It is noteworthy that, despite the effect on the precursor, hypoxia did not alter mature Cyt-b, which strengthens the view that PO2 regulates specifically the H-strand-encoded ND transcripts. Other precursor mRNA species of larger molecular weight appearing at more proximal parts of the blots were not significantly modified by hypoxia. In addition to PC12 cells, which belong to the class of acutely responding neurosecretory cells that release transmitters upon exposure to hypoxia (1López-Barneo J. Pardal R. Ortega-Sáenz P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 259-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), we also examined the mitochondrial response to hypoxia in non-excitable BRL cells. Qualitatively, the effect of hypoxia (3% O2) on mtDNA expression in BRL cells was identical to that reported in PC12 cells. After 24 h of hypoxia, the ND4, ND5, and ND5 + Cyt-b transcripts were down-regulated to 54, 90, and 32%, respectively, of their values under normoxic conditions. This suggests that down-regulation of the steadystate levels of mRNAs encoding the ND proteins is a general phenomenon that probably occurs in all eukaryotic cells. Identification of the mRNAs from the ND5/ND6/Cyt-b Region—Because the transcripts more sensitive to hypoxia (ND5 + Cyt-b, ND4, and ND5) were those detected with probe 3, we confirmed their identity by performing Northern hybridizations using individual DNA probes for each of the genes as well as riboprobes for the two overlapping ND5 and ND6 genes (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 1B, after hybridization with DNA probe 3, the ND5 + Cyt-b precursor appeared in the upper part of the blot. This precursor, although clearly visible, was less abundant than the mature transcripts detected with the same probe (with the exception of ND3) (Fig. 2B, lane 1) (30Tullo A. Tanzariello F. D'Erchia A.M. Nardelli M. Papeo P.A. Sbisa E. Saccone C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32van Itallie C.M. Van Why S. Thulin G. Kashgarian M. Siegel N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C712-C719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precursor was also detected in hybridizations with DNA probes for ND5, both for the 5′-region (ND5-5p DNA probe) (Fig. 2B, lane 5) and the 3′-region (ND5-3p DNA probe) (lane 6), as well as with DNA probes for ND6 (lane 7) and Cyt-b (DNA probe 4) (lane 4). As expected, the ND5-5p, ND5-3p, and ND6 DNA probes also detected the mature ND5 mRNA (Fig. 2A). The fact that a DNA probe for ND6 detected mature ND5 (Fig. 2B, lane 7) is not surprising because it is known that the ND5 transcript has a trailer of ∼600 bp corresponding to antisense ND6. Hybridization with a riboprobe for ND5 (rND5) showed both the ND5 + Cyt-b precursor and the mature ND5 transcript (Fig. 2B, lane 8), whereas a riboprobe for ND6 (rND6) detected only the mature ND6 transcript (lane 9). The mature ND6 transcript was also detected with the ND5-3p and ND6 DNA probes (Fig. 2B, lanes 6 and 7, respectively), but not with the ND5-5p DNA probe (lane 5). This was expected because the mature ND6 transcript has a region of ∼600 bp of antisense ND5 as a trailer that does not cover the region recognized by the ND5-5p DNA probe (Fig. 2A) (30Tullo A. Tanzariello F. D'Erchia A.M. Nardelli M. Papeo P.A. Sbisa E. Saccone C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2B (lanes 6 and 7), the ND6 transcript appeared with low intensity because the processed transcripts from the L-strand are intrinsically less stable than those from the H-strand (30Tullo A. Tanzariello F. D'Erchia A.M. Nardelli M. Papeo P.A. Sbisa E. Saccone C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Attardi G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1985; 93: 93-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Finally, the transcript corresponding to the ND5 + Cyt-b precursor was not present in hybridizations with DNA probes specific for ND4/4L (Fig. 2B, lane 3) and COIII (lane 2). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that, in our preparations, the 3.6-kb precursor contains only the ND5 (with its antisense ND6 trailer of ∼600 bp)- and Cyt-b-encoding regions; the other more intense bands detected with DNA probe 3 correspond to the ND5, ND4, and COIII genes. Therefore, all subsequent studies on the hypoxic regulation of complex I mRNAs were done using probe 3. Hypoxic Regulation of mtDNA Expression Is Rapid and Reversible and Occurs at Physiologic O2 Levels—We studied in detail the time course and reversibility as well as the dose dependence of the hypoxic down-regulation of ND5 + Cyt-b, ND5, and ND4/4L mRNAs. The levels of these mRNA species markedly decreased during the first 6 h of exposure to hypoxia (3% O2; PO2 = 21 mm Hg) (Fig. 3A). A significant decrease in ND5 + Cyt-b mRNA (to ∼75% of the control value) was already observed after 30 min of incubation. At the end of the 6-h incubation under hypoxic conditions, the levels of ND5 + Cyt-b, ND5, and ND4/4L mRNAs were 35, 85, and 65% of their respective control values (Fig. 3C). Upon re-exposure of the cells to normoxia (21% O2; PO2 = 147 mm Hg), recovery of the mRNAs was almost complete in only 30 min. Full recovery (100%) was observed within the first 2 h of normoxia (Fig. 3, B and C). Therefore, the effect of hypoxia on the ND mRNA levels is fast and fully reversible, suggesting a rapid turnover of the transcripts. Regulation of ND mRNAs by hypoxia is a graded phenomenon. ND5 + Cyt-b precursor mRNA levels relative to COIII mRNA levels decreased gradually with the intensity of hypoxia. With 6 h of incubation, the decrease in ND5 + Cyt-b mRNA levels was appreciable with exposures to O2 tensions ≤70 mm Hg (Fig. 4A). Qualitatively, a similar dose dependence was observed for the hypoxic down-regulation of ND5 and ND4/4L mRNAs (Fig. 4, B and C). These data demonstrate that regulation of mitochondrial complex I gene expression by O2 is concentration-dependent and occurs at relatively moderate PO2 values. Hypoxia Decreases Mitochondrial Complex I Activity—The seven complex I proteins encoded by mtDNA are conserved in all organisms from prokaryotes to the most complex eukaryotes. They are part of the “core” of the complex and are the"

Among many phosphorylated sites in tau, Ser-262 is the major site for abnormal phosphorylation of tau in AD brain. The kinase known to phosphorylate this particular site is MARK2, whose activation mechanism is yet to be studied. Our first finding that treatment of cells with LiCl, a selective inhibitor of another major tau kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), inhibits phosphorylation of Ser-262 of tau led us to investigate the possible involvement of GSK-3β in MARK2 activation. In vitro kinase reaction revealed that recombinant GSK-3β indeed phosphorylates MARK2, whereas it failed to phosphorylate Ser-262 of tau. Our further findings led us to conclude that GSK-3β phosphorylates MARK2 on Ser-212, one of the two reported phosphorylation sites (Thr-208 and Ser-212) found in the activation loop of MARK2. Down-regulation of either GSK-3β or MARK2 by small interfering RNAs suppressed the level of phosphorylation on Ser-262. These results, respectively, indicated that GSK-3β is responsible for phosphorylating Ser-262 of tau through phosphorylation and activation of MARK2 and that the phosphorylation of tau at this particular site is predominantly mediated by a GSK-3β-MARK2 pathway.

The major component of NFTs is the microtubule-associated protein tau. It has been reported that β-amyloid, a peptide observed as an aggregated form in senile plaques of AD (5Yamada M. Tsukagoshi H.

Tau is functionally modulated by phosphorylation (8Gustke N. Steiner B. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Meyer H.E. Goedert M. Mandelkow E.

Tau can be phosphorylated at specific Ser and Thr residues by two types of protein kinase: Ser/Thr-Pro motif kinase and KXGS motif kinase (12Drewes G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 548-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Ser/Thr-Pro motif kinases, including GSK-3β, Cdk5, and c-Jun aminoterminal kinase, phosphorylate tau in domains containing Ser-Pro or Thr-Pro motifs. Among Ser/Thr-Pro motif tau kinases, GSK-3β, ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, is thought important for tau toxicity as it phosphorylates several disease-associated phosphoepitopes such as Ser-199, Thr-212, Thr-214, and Ser-404 (13Jope R.S.

Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The role of GSK-3β in the pathogenesis of AD has been suggested by other findings as well. Expression of familial AD mutation-bearing amyloid precursor protein (APP) or Presenilin 1 (PS1) results in elevated GSK-3β activity (15Kim H.S. Kim E.M. Lee J.P. Park C.H. Kim S. Seo J.H. Chang K.A.

Furthermore, overexpression of Drosophila GSK-3 can promote the pathology of NFTs in fly models of tauopathy (20Jackson G.R. Wiedau-Pazos M. Sang T.K. Wagle N. Brown C.A. Massachi S. Geschwind D.H.

Although these findings taken together hint at a crucial role for GSK-3β in AD pathogenesis, this role is still a matter of controversy. neurofibrillary tangle microtubule affinity regulating kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3β Alzheimer disease glutathione S-transferase human embryonic kidney small interfering RNA mitogen-activated protein kinase. The latter type of tau kinase, KXGS motif kinase, phosphorylates Ser-262 and Ser-356 in KXGS motifs within the microtubule binding region of tau. Phosphorylation at Ser-262, and to a lesser extent Ser-356, dramatically reduces the microtubule binding capacity of tau (21Biernat J. Gustke N. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Microtubules are known to be essential in synaptic vesicle transport during neurotransmission and in the formation and maintenance of synaptic structures. Recent study suggests that synaptic dysfunction may be one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of AD (22Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 298: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3438) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 leading to the detachment of tau from microtubules affects microtubule dynamics and disrupts synaptic function. Indeed, the level of phosphorylation of Ser-262 was reported to be elevated in tau protein isolated from brains of AD patients (11Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One KXGS motif kinase hypothesized to be important for tau-induced toxicity is the mitogen-activated protein/microtubules affinity-regulating kinase (MARK). MARK was originally purified from porcine brain as a KXGS motif tau kinase and has been suggested to be the most effective kinase of Ser-262 (23Drewes G. Trinczek B. Illenberger S. Biernat J.

Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MARK in Chinese hamster ovary cells results in increased phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins in the KXGS motif and disruption of the microtubule array. Moreover, Nishimura et al. (25Nishimura I. Yang Y. Lu B. Cell. 2004; 116: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of Drosophila PAR-1, a fly orthologue of mammalian MARK, led to elevated tau phosphorylation and enhanced toxicity in a transgenic fly model, indicating that MARK/PAR-1 plays a central role in conferring tau-induced toxicity in vivo. However, little is known about the upstream events that act through MARK to regulate tau phosphorylation in disease progression. On the basis that the phosphorylation of tau is an essential event in the pathogenesis of AD, the explicit role of GSK-3β in the pathogenesis and the activation mechanism of MARK are two enticing areas of study. In this study, we initially found that GSK-3β inhibition resulted in suppression of Ser-262 phosphorylation of tau in neurohybridoma F11 cells, indicating that GSK-3β is involved in the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. Because GSK-3β cannot phosphorylate this site directly, our finding suggested that GSK-3β and MARK cooperated in inducing the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. Here, we have shown that GSK-3β acts as a physiological phosphorylating and activating factor of MARK2 and that the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 in cultured cells is predominantly mediated by the GSK-3β-MARK2 pathway.

Purification of Recombinant Proteins and in Vitro Kinase Assay—For purification of GST-fused MARK2 or GSK-3β, 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-stimulated Escherichia coli was extracted in IP buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)) by sonication. After centrifugation, the E. coli extracts were input into glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences), and GST-MARK2 or GSK-3β were eluted with elution buffer (phosphate-buffered saline– containing 20 mm GSH). For purification of tau, 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosidestimulated E. coli was extracted in MT-phosphate-buffered saline buffer (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, and 4 mm NaH2PO4) by sonication. After centrifugation, the E. coli extracts were heat treated at 100 °C for 5 min and centrifuged again to remove the denatured protein debris. For the kinase assays, the purified proteins were mixed in a reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm EGTA) with 1.6 mm ATP or 1.6 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi). After incubating the reaction mixtures at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 3× SDS sample buffer (84 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 4.6% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 3 min. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described (29Tashiro E. Maruki H. Minato Y. Doki Y. Weinstein I.B. Imoto M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 424-431PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were: anti-tau (TAU5), anti-pS199-tau, anti-pS262-tau, and anti-pS404-tau antibodies from BioSource (Sunnyvale, CA); anti-Myc (9E10), anti-GST (B14), and anti-GSK-3α/β (0011-A) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-FLAG (M2) antibody from Sigma; and anti-MARK2 antibody generated by Sigma using a synthetic peptide with the sequence CNKRPEEETGRK as an antigen. RNA Interference—The small interfering RNA duplex (siRNA) for GSK-3α/β was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). MARK2 siRNA was synthesized by Dharmacon (Chicago). The target sequence of MARK2 siRNA was 5′-AACGCAGAAAAUAAGCGGCCU-3′ (nucleotide 1282–1302 of MARK2). The nonspecific siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon. GSK-3β or MARK2 siRNA was transfected with the plasmid pcDNA3.1-tau into HEK293T and F11 cells, respectively, by using Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection. Inhibition of GSK-3β Abrogates Phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-262—To investigate the mechanism regulating the phosphorylation of tau, tau was transiently expressed in F11 cells, a neurohybrid cell line (26Pollard C.E. Brain Res. 1993; 614: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Cho J.H. Kwon I.S. Kim S. Ghil S.H. Tsai M.J. Kim Y.S. Lee Y.D. Suh-Kim H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 103-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fan S.F. Shen K.F. Crain S.M. Brain Res. 1993; 605: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and its state was examined. As shown in Fig. 1A, many Ser residues in the Ser/Thr-Pro (S/T-P) motif, such as Ser-199, -212, -214, and -404, and Ser-262 in the KXGS motif, were found to be phosphorylated, indicating that the tau-phosphorylating kinases to be investigated are present in F11 cells. When the F11 cells expressing tau were treated with LiCl, a selective GSK-3β inhibitor (30Williams R. Ryves W.J. Dalton E.C. Eickholt B. Shaltiel G. Agam G. Harwood A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 31Jope R.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 441-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of several GSK-3β-targeted S/T-P residues in tau, such as Ser-199 and Ser-404, was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. Interestingly, when GSK-3β activity was inhibited by LiCl treatment, we found that phosphorylation of Ser-262 in the KXGS motif also decreased without a change in the expression level of either GSK-3β or total tau (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when HEK293T cells were used (data not shown). The decrease in phosphorylation of Ser-262 on inhibition of GSK-3β suggested the involvement of GSK-3β in the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. We then examined whether overexpression of GSK-3β could increase the phosphorylation of tau in F11 cells. N-terminal Myc-tagged GSK-3β was co-expressed with tau in F11 cells, and the phosphorylation level of tau-Ser-262 was determined by Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, not only the phosphorylation of GSK-3β-targeted Ser-199 but also that of non-GSK-3β-targeted Ser-262 increased in proportion to the amount of Myc-GSK-3β. In contrast, the kinase-negative Myc-GSK-3β (K85R) mutant, which was reportedly unable to associate with ATP (32Dominguez I. Itoh K. Sokol S.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8498-8502Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), could not induce phosphorylation at either Ser-199 or Ser-262 in tau. Similar results were obtained when HEK293T cells were used (data not shown). Because GSK-3β was reported to be unable to phosphorylate Ser-262 of tau directly (33Godemann R. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), our finding raised the possibility that GSK-3β phosphorylates and activates a KXGS motif kinase, leading to phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. To confirm this possibility, first we conducted an in vitro kinase assay to examine whether GSK-3β actually fails to directly phosphorylate the Ser-262 of recombinant tau. Recombinant GST-GSK-3β was incubated with recombinant tau in the presence of 1.6 mm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min, and the kinase reaction products were analyzed by Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1C, although both the anti-phospho-Ser-199-tau and anti-phospho-Ser-404-tau antibody-reactive bands intensified in the presence of GST-GSK-3β, the anti-phospho-Ser-262-tau antibody-reactive band was not affected. These results confirmed that GSK-3β is unable to directly phosphorylate Ser-262 of tau as reported; rather, it might induce it through activation of a KXGS motif kinase. GSK-3β Directly Phosphorylates MARK2 in Vitro—The major KXGS motif kinase is MARK, which was originally purified from brain. In humans, four MARK isoforms (MARK1, 2, 3, and 4) have been identified (12Drewes G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 548-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Among them, MARK2 is the best characterized and expressed throughout various tissues. Phosphorylation of MARK2 is reported to be required for its activation (24Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). However, the factor phosphorylating and activating MARK2 is not fully understood. Therefore, we hypothesized that GSK-3β phosphorylates and simultaneously activates MARK2, thereby inducing the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 in F11 cells. We initiated our investigation by conducting an in vitro kinase assay using [γ-32P]ATP to examine whether GSK-3β could phosphorylate MARK2 directly. Myc-MARK2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody from Myc-MARK2-expressing HEK293T cell extracts and was incubated with recombinant GST-GSK-3β. As shown in Fig. 2A, slight autophosphorylation was observed when Myc-MARK2 alone was incubated, whereas the incorporation of phosphate into Myc-MARK2 was dramatically increased in the presence of GST-GSK-3β. Similar results were obtained when bacterially expressing GST-MARK2 was used as the substrate of GST-GSK-3β (Fig. 2B). In contrast, GST-GSK-3β (K85R) mutant did not induce phosphorylation of GST-MARK2 (Fig. 2B). These results strongly implied the direct phosphorylation of MARK2 by GSK-3β in vitro. Ser-212 in the Activation Loop of MARK2 Is Phosphorylated by GSK-3β—Next, we investigated which amino acid residue of MARK2 was phosphorylated by GSK-3β. Because it was reported that Thr-208 and Ser-212 in the activation loop of MARK2 are phosphorylated residues important for the activation of the kinase (24Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), we designed partially unphosphorylatable mutants by substituting each phosphorylation site in MARK2 with Ala and examined whether they could still be phosphorylated by GSK-3β. As shown in Fig. 3A, the in vitro kinase assay revealed that both GST-MARK2 (wild type) and GST-MARK2 (T208A) were phosphorylated in proportion to the amount of GST-GSK-3β, whereas GST-MARK2 (S212A) was not capable of being phosphorylated by GST-GSK-3β. Similar results were obtained when kinase-negative MARK2 (K82R) (24Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), or its derived double mutated MARK2 (K82R/T208) or MARK2 (K82R/S212), was used as the substrate (Fig. 3B). These results verified that GSK-3β phosphorylates MARK2 at Ser-212 in vitro, and the phosphorylation is not affected by Ala at Thr-208. Requirement of Phosphorylation at Ser-212 of MARK2 for Kinase Activity—Our finding that MARK2 was phosphorylated at Ser-212 in its activation loop by GSK-3β in vitro led us to examine whether phosphorylation at Ser-212 is essential for the activation of MARK2 in cultured cells. When Myc-MARK2 was expressed in tau-expressing F11 cells, the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 was substantially increased (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, phosphorylation of Ser-199 remained unchanged, suggesting that Myc-MARK2 and the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-199 are irrelevant. Expression of Myc-MARK2 (T208A) resulted in the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 almost to the level induced by wild type Myc-MARK2, which implies that mutating Thr-208 of MARK2 does not affect the activation. However, Myc-MARK2 (S212A) could not induce the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 (Fig. 4B). These results strongly imply that the phosphorylation of MARK2 at Ser-212 is necessary for its kinase activity leading to the phosphorylation of tau-Ser-262. To examine whether the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 seen in F11 cells is actually regulated by MARK2, the expression of endogenous MARK2 was suppressed by its siRNA and the level of phosphorylation of tau-Ser-262 was assessed. As shown in Fig. 4C, knockdown of endogenous MARK2 by its siRNA induced a significant decrease in the level of phosphorylation of tau-Ser-262 without affecting the overall expression of tau protein, indicating that phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 is predominantly regulated by MARK2 in F11 cells. GSK-3β Phosphorylates MARK2 in Cultured Cells—We have shown so far that MARK2 is responsible for the phosphorylation of tau-Ser-262 in F11 cells, and it is phosphorylated and activated by GSK-3β in vitro. To further confirm that MARK2 is activated by GSK-3β, we next examined whether GSK-3β could phosphorylate MARK2 in cultured cells. HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with Myc-MARK2 and FLAG-GSK-3β, which would later be metabolically labeled with [32P]phosphate 3 h before harvesting. Myc-MARK2 was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts by using anti-Myc antibody, and then the precipitate was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 5A, the 32P-labeled phosphate was incorporated into Myc-MARK2 in a manner dependent on the amount of FLAG-GSK-3β. The result suggested that increased expression of GSK-3β caused enhancement of the phosphorylation of MARK2 in HEK293T cells. Suppression of Endogenous MARK2 Inhibits GSK-3β-induced Phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-262—To exclude the possibility that MARK2 is phosphorylated and activated by kinases other than GSK-3β, HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with GSK-3β siRNA and tau plasmid, and phosphorylation levels of tau-Ser-262 were examined. As demonstrated in Fig. 5B, the endogenous expression of GSK-3β was successfully suppressed by GSK-3β siRNA in a dose-dependent manner. The intensity of the phospho-Ser-199-tau and phospho-Ser-262-tau antibody-immunoreactive band abated in correlation to the GSK-3β expression level without affecting the expression levels of total tau protein. These results indicated that GSK-3β acts as a physiological phosphorylating and activating factor of MARK2 in cultured cells. Furthermore, when MARK2 siRNA was co-transfected with GSK-3β plasmid together with tau plasmid, the level of GSK-3β-induced phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Collectively our results strongly indicate a novel pathway toward the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262, where GSK-3β phosphorylates Ser-212 of MARK2 in its activation loop and activated MARK2 phosphorylates tau at Ser-262. In AD it is generally argued that aberrant phosphorylation of tau reflects an imbalance of cellular signal transduction and is a prelude to neuronal degeneration. Although at least 24 amino acid residues are known as phosphorylation sites of tau in NFTs, the role of phosphorylation at each site in the toxicity of tau and the signal transduction mechanism are not fully understood. In the present study, we have focused on the mechanism regulating the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 for tau-Ser-262 phosphorylation, exclusively found in paired helical filament-tau, has a severe effect on its ability to bind to microtubules, which presumably results in neurodegeneration through microtubule disruption and/or tau aggregation. From our observations that the treatment of cells with a GSK-3β inhibitor caused a decrease in the phosphorylation level of tau-Ser-262, and alternatively overexpression of GSK-3β caused an increase in the phosphorylation level of tau-Ser-262 (Fig. 1, A and B), we have demonstrated the involvement of GSK-3β in the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 in tau-expressing neurohybrid cells. However, GSK-3β is known as an S/T-P motif kinase, and we confirmed that GSK-3β itself fails to phosphorylate Ser-262 within the KXGS motif of tau directly (Ref. 33Godemann R. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and Fig. 1C). Therefore, we proposed that GSK-3β induces phosphorylation at the site through activation of a KXGS motif kinase. One candidate for such a kinase is MARK, which was originally purified from brain. Indeed, GSK-3β directly phosphorylates MARK2 in vitro (Fig. 2, A and B), and GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of MARK2 was also observed in cultured cells (Fig. 5A). Active MARK2 is a phosphoprotein and its kinase activity is lost after treatment with phosphatase 2A, indicating that phosphorylation of MARK2 is required for its kinase activity (24Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Peptide sequencing data showed that MARK2 contained two phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues (Thr-208 and Ser-212) in the activation loop (24Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Our site-directed mutational analysis revealed that MARK2 bearing the mutation T208A could still be phosphorylated by GSK-3β, whereas MARK2 bearing S212A could not, indicating that GSK-3β phosphorylates Ser-212 of MARK2 (Fig. 3, A and B). This finding is likely because Ser-212 of MARK2 is followed by a Pro (206LDTFCFSPPYAA217), which comprises a GSK-3β consensus sequence of the S/T-P motif. This amino acid sequence (LDTFCFSPPYAA) is also observed in other MARK isoforms, MARK1, MARK3, and MARK4 in their activation loops; therefore, it is likely that GSK-3β might phosphorylate MARKs 1, 3, and 4 at Ser residues corresponding to Ser-212 of MARK2. Previously, LKB1 and TAO-1/Ste20-like kinase (MARKK) have been reported as protein kinases that phosphorylate the activating loop of MARK2 (34Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 35Timm T. Li X.Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, both kinases selectively phosphorylate Thr-208 of MARK2. Therefore, this is the first report to identify the kinase that phosphorylates Ser-212 of MARK2. However, this is not direct evidence that phosphorylation of Ser-212 by GSK-3β is required for the activation of MARK2, because Timm et al. (35Timm T. Li X.Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) demonstrated that phosphorylation of Ser-212 is actually inhibitory, although Ser-212 must be present for basal activity. Nevertheless, the importance of the phosphorylation of Ser-212 by GSK-3β for the activation of MARK2 is logically suggested by our findings. 1) Overexpression of the wild type or T208A mutant of MARK2 in cells increased the phosphorylation level of tau-Ser-262, but overexpression of the S212A mutant of MARK2 did not have any effect (Fig. 4, A and B). 2) MARK2 acted as a master protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 in the cells, because knockdown of endogenous MARK2 significantly reduced the phosphorylation levels of tau-Ser-262 (Fig. 4C). 3) Knockdown of GSK-3β completely diminished the MARK2-induced phosphorylation of tau-Ser-262 (Fig. 5, B and C), indicating that the activation of MARK2 is regulated by GSK-3β. 4) Kinase-negative GSK-3β (K85R) did not induce the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262, indicating that the kinase activity of GSK-3β is required for the activation of MARK2 (Fig. 1B). Thus, taken together, we propose that GSK-3β phosphorylates Ser-212 of MARK2 and that this phosphorylation causes the activation of MARK2 leading to tau-Ser-262 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the findings obtained from our knockdown experiments indicated that GSK-3β and MARK2 are prominent physiological protein kinases that phosphorylate Ser-212 of MARK2 and Ser-262 of tau, respectively. Therefore, although we cannot exclude the possibility that other tau-Ser-262 kinases such as SAD kinases (36Kishi M. Pan Y.A. Crump J.G. Sanes J.R. Science. 2005; 307: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) might be involved in the phosphorylation mechanism of Ser-262 of tau, the GSK-3β-MARK2 pathway mainly operates the mechanism of phosphorylation at Ser-262 of tau under physiological conditions. Recently, Nishimura et al. (25Nishimura I. Yang Y. Lu B. Cell. 2004; 116: 671-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262 (and Ser-356) by MARK/PAR-1 is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation by the downstream kinase GSK-3β to generate toxic tau species in vivo. Considering our findings, GSK-3β may act both upstream and downstream of MARK2, and this positive feedback loop could regulate tau functions such as microtubule dynamics and neuronal toxicity. MARK2 has been reported to be activated through phosphorylation at Thr-208 by LKB-1 or TAO-1/Ste20-like kinase (MARKK) in vitro (34Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 35Timm T. Li X.Y. Biernat J. Jiao J. Mandelkow E. Vandekerckhove J. Mandelkow E.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5090-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These reports are inconsistent with our finding that the mutation of Thr-208 to Ala in MARK2 did not reduce tau-Ser-262 phosphorylation in F11 or in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4B), indicating that phosphorylation of Thr-208 did not significantly activate MARK2. At present, we are still in search of the exact reason for this discrepancy. However, Lizcano et al. (34Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the ability of LKB-1 to activate MARK2 is much greater than that of TAO-1, and LKB-1, a tumor suppressor kinase (37Hemminki A. Markie D. Tomlinson I. Avizienyte E. Roth S. Loukola A. Bignell G. Warren W. Aminoff M. Hoglund P. Jarvinen H. Kristo P. Pelin K. Ridanpaa M. Salovaara R. Toro T. Bodmer W. Olschwang S. Olsen A.S.

Zimmer M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), has been reported to be mutated and inactivated in a variety of carcinomas (39Sanchez-Cespedes M. Parrella P.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1777-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that LKB-1 is mutated and inactivated in F11 cells and HEK293T cells. If this were the case, full activation of MARK2 would be required for not only the phosphorylation of Ser-212 by GSK-3β but also the phosphorylation of Thr-208 by LKB-1 or TAO-1. In addition, MARKs are AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related kinases. The consensus motif for substrate recognition by AMPK and related kinases including MARK2 can be represented as ΦXβXXS/TXXXΦ where Φ indicates a hydrophobic residue and β a basic residue (42Dale S. Wilson W.A. Edelman A.M. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Indeed, the kinase activity of MARK2 phosphorylated at Thr-208 by LKB-1 was measured employing AMARA peptide (AMARAASAAALARRR) as a substrate, which does not contain a KXGS motif (34Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Therefore, another possible explanation is that Thr-208-phosphorylated MARK2 and Ser-212-phosphorylated MARK2 differ in substrate specificity, with Thr-208-phosphorylated MARK2 phosphorylating a Ser/Thr residue within the ΦXβXXS/TXXXΦ motif, but not a Ser/Thr residue within the KXGS motif, and vice versa. If that were the case, the target protein of Ser-212-phosphorylated MARK2 would be different from that of Thr-208-phosphorylated MARK2. MARK/PAR-1 has been reported to play important roles not only in microtubule dynamics and tau-dependent neuronal toxicity but also in epithelial cell polarity, neuronal differentiation, and Wnt signaling (43Biernat J. Wu Y.Z. Timm T. Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Mandelkow E. Meijer L. Mandelkow E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4013-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 44Mandelkow E.M. Thies E. Trinczek B.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that each of these cellular events is controlled by the state of MARK2, whether Ser-212 is phosphorylated, Thr-208 is phosphorylated, or both are phosphorylated. In summary, we have shown that GSK-3β phosphorylates Ser-212 in the activation loop of MARK2, thereby inducing the activation of MARK2 and resulting in the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-262. Ser-262 is known as a major site for abnormal phosphorylation of PHF-tau in AD brain (47Ikura Y. Kudo T. Tanaka T. Tanii H. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Takeda M. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, our finding would provide a new insight into the functional significance of the GSK-3β-MARK2 pathway in the pathogenesis of AD. We thank Dr. K.

https://openalex.org/W2072786589,"EBNA-3 is one of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear antigens that is indispensable for immunoblastic transformation and sustained proliferation of B-lymphocytes. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the function of EBNA-3 are poorly understood. We previously found that EBNA-3 interacts with an immunophilin-like protein XAP2/ARA9/AIP, which in mammalian cells is known to interact with the latent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that mediates cellular responses to environmental pollutants, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). In this study, we show that EBNA-3 interacts specifically with AhR. The stability of this interaction is determined by the activation state of AhR and its association with XAP2. We and others have demonstrated that XAP2 retains the nonactivated AhR in the cell cytoplasm. However, in the presence of TCDD, the effect of XAP2 on the intracellular localization of AhR was counter-acted by EBNA-3, resulting in nuclear translocation of the AhR. In addition, EBNA-3 enhanced transactivation function by the ligand-activated AhR in cells, as assessed by reporter gene assays. Our data suggested that EBNA-3 plays a role in facilitating the ligand-dependent AhR activation process. Following activation of the AhR, we also observed that EBNA-3 counteracted the inhibitory effect of TCDD on the growth of EBV-carrying lymphoblasts. Taken together, our studies revealed a novel interaction between EBV- and AhR-dependent cellular pathways that control cell proliferation and survival.

It is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and of lymphoproliferative disease in immunosuppressed hosts. In vitro infected B-cells are transformed into continuously proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) that express nine EBV-encoded proteins as follows: six nuclear antigens (EBNA1-6), three membrane proteins (LMP1, LMP2A, and -2B), and two small nonpolyadenylated RNAs (EBER1-2). The same pattern of protein expression is found in the B-blasts that proliferate in infectious mononucleosis and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Six of the nine proteins are required for the efficient transformation of B-lymphocytes by EBV: EBNA-1, EBNA-2, EBNA-3 (EBNA-3A), EBNA-5 (EBNA-LP), EBNA-6 (EBNA-3C), and LMP1 (for review see Refs. 1Kieff E.

EBNA-3 is not only indispensable for B-cell transformation but is also implicated in the maintenance of LCL proliferation. It was recently shown that 3-5-fold overexpression of EBNA-3 leads to the down-regulation of c-myc, CD21, and CD23 and induces G0/G1 arrest in LCLs (3Cooper A. Johannsen E. Maruo S.

In another study, LCLs were established by infecting primary B-lymphocytes with the recombinant EBV that expresses EBNA-3 fused to the hormone-binding domain of a 4-hydroxytamoxifen-dependent mutant estrogen receptor (EBNA-3AHT). Withdrawal of 4-hydroxytamoxifen from cell culture medium results in cell death, despite the fact that the expression levels of c-myc remain high (4Maruo S. Johannsen E. Illanes D. Cooper A. Kieff E.

Biol. 1998; 18: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), we have also suggested that EBNA-3 may be involved in the regulation of xenobiotic signal transduction pathways. AhR is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that mediates cellular response to xenobiotic compounds such as environmental pollutants, e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated dioxins, most notably 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The receptor belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/Per-ARNT-Sim domain (PAS) family of transcription factors (for review see Ref. 14Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Two conserved domains characterize these proteins, the N-terminal bHLH DNA binding domain and the PAS domain, which spans two hydrophobic repeats termed PAS-A and PAS-B. AhR is unique among bHLH/PAS proteins, because it contains a ligand-binding region located in the C-terminal part of the PAS domain, including the PAS-B motif. In the absence of ligand, the latent receptor is associated with the molecular chaperone Hsp90 and two Hsp90-binding proteins, the co-chaperone p23 and XAP2 (11Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Hsp90 maintains a high affinity ligand-binding conformation of the receptor, whereas p23 is thought to stabilize the latent receptor-Hsp90 heterocomplex. XAP2, in turn, stabilizes the AhR protein (16Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and participates in the regulation of the intracellular localization of the receptor by an uncharacterized cytoplasmic retention mechanism (15Kazlauskas A. Sundström S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, AhR accumulates in the nucleus where it forms a transcriptionally active complex with the bHLH/PAS transcription factor ARNT. Dimerization with ARNT induces the release of the Hsp90 complex from the receptor (17McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The AhR-ARNT heterodimer activates the transcription of target genes by specific binding to xenobiotic-inducible transcriptional control elements, XREs. They are located in the regulatory regions of a gene network encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P4501A1 (for review, see Ref. 14Gu Y.Z. Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Activation of the AhR-mediated signaling pathway by xenobiotic compounds in animal model systems (mainly in rodents) has numerous toxic consequences, including carcinogenesis, immunosuppression, thymic involution, severe wasting, and death (for review, see Ref. 18Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active mutant AhR develop tumors in the glandular part of the stomach (19Andersson P. McGuire J. Rubio C. Gradin K. Whitelaw M.L. Petterson S. Hanberg A. Poellinger L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9990-9995Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), consistent with an oncogenic function of the activated receptor. Given the common interaction with XAP2, it is possible EBNA-3 may modulate the AhR signal transduction pathway. Here we demonstrate that EBNA-3 specifically interacts with the AhR protein. The stability of this interaction depended on the activation state of the receptor and on the presence of XAP2. EBNA-3 expression increases the activation of transcription by AhR in reporter gene assays. Because both AhR and EBNA-3 are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, we have also examined the effects of TCDD on the growth of EBV-transformed and control B-lymphocytes in the presence and absence of EBNA-3, and we found that EBNA-3 counteracted the inhibitory effect of TCDD on the growth of virally transformed immunoblasts. Recombinant Plasmids—pBC vectors (encoding the GST tag), pBC/DR construct (encoding GST-AhR), pSG5/XAP2 (15Kazlauskas A. Sundström S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), pCMX/DR-GFP (encoding AhR-GFP), pCMV2/FLAG (encoding the FLAG peptide (Eastman Kodak Co.)), pCMV2/FLAG-XAP2 (16Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), pGFP-XAP2 (10Kashuba E. Kashuba V. Pokrovskaja K. Klein G. Szekely L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1801-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), pGEM7/ARNT (20Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Wilhelmsson A. Gustafsson J.-A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2504-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and pTXIXI (21Berghard A. Gradin K. Pongratz I. Whitelaw M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have been described previously. pBabe-EBNA-3, encoding the N-terminal deletion mutant of EBNA-3-(Δ1-127), was constructed by inserting a BamHI-XhoI fragment of EBNA-3 cDNA from pZIP-EBNA-3 (kind gift of E. Kieff) into the BamHI-EcoRI-digested pBabe-puro vector by using an EcoRI/XhoI adaptor. pBabe-EBNA-3 encodes residues 128-912 of the EBNA-3 protein. To generate pCMV2/FLAG-EBNA-3, first the 2463-bp PCR fragment was created using pBabe-EBNA-3 as a template. 3PCR primer sequence information and cloning details are available upon request. Subsequently, the PCR product was digested by HindIII-XbaI and ligated in-frame with the FLAG epitope into pCMV2-FLAG vector digested with HindIII-XbaI. Cell Lines—Cell lines used in this study were as follows: MCF7 (human breast adenocarcinoma cells), COS7 (African green monkey kidney fibroblasts, transformants of CV-1 cells by an origin-defective mutant of SV40 virus, expressing SV40 large T antigen), DG75, EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma, DG75 sub-lines that express EBNA-3 or EBNA-5 constitutively (both transfectants were the kind gifts of Lars Rymo); LCL cells were freshly established from tonsil B-cells as described previously (22Kashuba E. Mattsson K. Klein G. Szekely L. Mol. Cancer. 2003; 2: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Lymphoid cell lines were grown in Iscove's culture medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. COS7 and MCF7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Protein Expression in Vitro—In vitro translation of GST-AhR and [35S]methionine-labeled EBNA-3 was carried out using coupled transcription/translation reactions in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Immunostainings—Cells, grown on 2 × 2-cm glass coverslips, were fixed by submerging them into a mixture of methanol and acetone (1:1) at -20 °C for at least 1 h. Immunostaining was carried out as described previously (23Pokrovskaja K. Mattsson K. Kashuba E. Klein G. Szekely L. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies, used for immunostaining, were as follows: mouse monoclonal antibody against FLAG epitope (Sigma), mouse antibodies against EBNA-3 T2.78-19 (kind gift of M. Rowe), rabbit serum against XAP2 (described below), and rabbit serum against EBNA-3 (ASLA Ltd.). Conjugated secondary antibodies were as follows: Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse Ig (Vector Laboratories), TRITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit serum (DAKO), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit serum (DAKO), AMKA-streptavidin (Vector Laboratories), and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit serum (DAKO). For DNA staining, 0.4 μg/ml bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258 from Sigma) was added together with the secondary antibody. Microscopy, Photo and Image Analyses—For routine documentation, the images were captured using a DAS microscope Leitz DM RB with a Hamamatsu dual mode cooled charged coupled device camera C4880 as described elsewhere (23Pokrovskaja K. Mattsson K. Kashuba E. Klein G. Szekely L. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cell Extracts and Immunoblotting—For in vivo immunoprecipitation experiments, COS7 cells were grown in 10-cm diameter dishes. Expression vectors encoding recombinant proteins were transiently transfected by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturers' protocols. Infection with recombinant vaccinia virus was carried out for 24 h as described (24Kashuba E. Pokrovskaja K. Klein G. Szekely L. J. Hum. Virol. 1999; 2: 33-37PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare whole cell extracts (WCEs), cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Tween 20) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (“Complete-Mini”, Roche Applied Science). Cell suspensions were sonicated by two 4-s bursts. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. WCE protein (600-800 μg) was incubated at 4 °C for 12-18 h with either anti-FLAG or anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences) antibodies, as indicated in the figure legends. Immune complexes were precipitated by adding 25 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), followed by incubation at 4 °C under slow rotation for 90 min. After rapid centrifugation, the resulting pellets were washed four times with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins and whole cell extracts were analyzed by 7.5 or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immobilized proteins were incubated for 2 h at 25°C with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-XAP2 (dilution 1:2000), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (1:2000), mouse monoclonal anti-EBNA-3 (1:500), mouse monoclonal anti-Hsp90 (25Denis M. Cuthill S. Wikström A.-C. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 801-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), or rabbit polyclonal anti-AhR antibodies (Biomol, 1:500) in blocking solution (5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Dako) or anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) immunoglobulins were used as secondary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20, immunocomplexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Reporter Assays—MCF7 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at about 60% confluency before transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the XRE-thymidine kinase-luciferase reporter plasmid pTXIXI and different amounts (from 100 to 1250 ng) of the EBNA-3 encoding pCMV2/FLAG-EBNA-3 construct or empty pCMV2/FLAG vector in control cells by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and serum-free DMEM according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 6 h of transfection, the medium was replaced with 10% fetal calf serum containing DMEM and grown in the presence of 10 nm 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; Chemsyn, Lenexa, Kans.) or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, Me2SO) alone for 24 h. Cells were collected in PBS by scraping, and extracts were analyzed in the presence of ATP and luciferin reagents for luciferase activity by using a luminometer. Production of Rabbit Anti-XAP2 Serum—A 42-mer oligopeptide corresponding to residues 289-330 of the human XAP2 protein sequence was synthesized by ThermoHybaid (Thermo Biosciences GmbH, Ulm, Germany). Chinchilla female rabbits (2.5-2.8 kg, 8-10 weeks old) were primed by two subcutaneous injections of 100 μg of the XAP2 peptide dissolved in 400 μl of PBS mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) (1:1 v/v) at weeks 0 and 1. Boosts were done intravenously with 50 μg of XAP2 peptide in 200 μl of PBS mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (1:1, v/v) at weeks 4 and 8. Blood was collected 12 days after the second boost. Serum reactivity and specificity was tested by indirect ELISA on 96-well plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Denmark) coated with XAP2 peptide or unrelated antigens using a protocol described previously (26Isaguliants M.G. Gudima S.O. Ivanova O.V. Levi M. Hinkula J. Garaev M.M. Kochetkov S.N. Wahren B. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). EBNA-3 Interacts with AhR in Vitro and in Vivo—In initial experiments, we examined whether EBNA-3 and AhR proteins could physically interact with each other. We used a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based in vitro transcription/translation system to produce GST-fused AhR and [35S]methionine-labeled EBNA-3. A mixture of both proteins was incubated at room temperature for 1 h in parallel with a control reaction mixture containing EBNA-3 and mock-translated material (Fig. 1A). Proteins interacting with GST-AhR were subsequently co-immunoprecipitated using anti-GST antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, EBNA-3 was specifically recovered in a complex formed by GST-AhR (lanes 1 and 2). The interaction between EBNA-3 and AhR proteins was also investigated in living cells. EBNA-3 was overexpressed in COS7 cells using recombinant vaccinia virus, whereas the GST-AhR fusion protein, as well as its co-chaperone XAP2, were transiently introduced into cells by lipofection (Fig. 1C). GST-AhR was precipitated from WCEs with anti-GST antibodies. Consistent with the above results, EBNA-3 specifically interacted with GST-tagged AhR (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). Protein levels of GST-AhR were higher in the presence of XAP2, which is known to stabilize protein levels of the receptor (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 2 and 4). It is also noteworthy that the recovery of EBNA-3 from the XAP2-containing lysate was less efficient compared with control reactions lacking overexpressed XAP2 (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 2 and 4). These results show that EBNA-3 interacted specifically with the recombinant AhR protein and that the stability of this interaction can be influenced by XAP2, a common binding protein for both AhR and EBNA-3. AhR, EBNA-3, and XAP2 Affect the Intracellular Localization of Each Other—It was recently shown that XAP2 regulates the intracellular localization of AhR by distributing it throughout the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell (15Kazlauskas A. Sundström S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When co-expressed with EBNA-3, the localization of XAP2 changed from diffuse and exclusively cytoplasmic to spot-like nuclear conglomerates with extensive co-localization with EBNA-3 (10Kashuba E. Kashuba V. Pokrovskaja K. Klein G. Szekely L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1801-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the intracellular distribution pattern of the AhR and the AhR-XAP2 complex were influenced by the presence of EBNA-3, we co-expressed recombinant AhR-GFP fusion protein and FLAG tagged and nontagged EBNA-3 and XAP2 proteins in various combinations in MCF7 cells. Intracellular localization of these proteins was determined by combining immunostaining with fluorescent microscopy as indicated in legends of Figs. 2, 3, and 4 (see also “Materials and Methods” for experimental details).FIGURE 3Intracellular localization of co-expressed AhR, EBNA-3, and XAP2 (double transfectants). AhR-GFP (1 μg), EBNA-3 (1 μg), GFP-XAP2 (0.5 μg), and FLAG-XAP2 (0.5 μg) were expressed in pairs in MCF7 cells and subsequently incubated with TCDD or vehicle (Me2SO) alone for 20 h. Cells were then fixed and incubated with appropriate antibodies as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” For detection of EBNA-3, mouse monoclonal anti-EBNA-3 antibody was used as a primary antibody, whereas the Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was applied as a secondary antibody. For detection of FLAG-XAP2, rabbit anti-XAP2 antibodies were used as primary antibodies, whereas anti-rabbit TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were applied as secondary antibody. In order to visualize cell nuclei/DNA, cells were stained with the Hoechst reagent. The 3rd and 4th row of panels show AhR-GFP (green, panels m and n) co-expression with EBNA-3 (red, panels s and t), AhR-GFP (green, panels o and p) co-expression with XAP2 (red, panels u and v), and GFP-XAP2 (green, panels q and r) co-expression with EBNA-3 (red, panels w and x) EBNA-3. Hoechst staining is demonstrated in panels g-l. The merged picture of Hoechst staining with green-stained protein is shown in the 1st row of panels (panels a-f). The merged picture of the co-expressed proteins is shown in the bottom row of panels (panels y, z, and z1-4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Co-expression of AhR, EBNA-3, and XAP2 (triple transfectants). AhR-GFP (1 μg), EBNA-3 (1 μg), and FLAG-XAP2 (0.5 μg) were expressed together in MCF7 cells. For detection of EBNA-3, mouse monoclonal anti-EBNA-3 antibody was used as a primary antibody, whereas the Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was applied as a secondary antibody. For detection of FLAG-XAP2, rabbit anti-XAP2 antibodies were used as primary antibody; subsequently, the cells were treated with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody and with AMKA streptavidin. Note that two different fields are shown for each cell treatment; in the 1st two columns of panels, the cells were treated with Me2SO, and in the 3rd and 4th columns of panels, the cells were treated with TCDD. The first 3 rows of panels show immunostaining of EBNA-3 (red, panels a and d), AhR-GFP (green, panels e and h), and XAP2 (blue, panels i and l). Merged pictures of XAP2 and AhR-GFP, XAP2 and EBNA-3, and AhR-GFP and EBNA-3 are shown in rows of the panels m-p, q-t, and u and x, respectively. Phase-contrast images of examined cells are presented in the bottom panels fc1-4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In single protein expression studies (Fig. 2), GFP-tagged AhR was evenly distributed in both the cell cytoplasm and the nucleus (panel g); EBNA-3 displayed spot-like nuclear conglomerates (panel i) similar to those observed earlier in COS1 cells (10Kashuba E. Kashuba V. Pokrovskaja K. Klein G. Szekely L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1801-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas XAP2 was localized mainly in the cell cytoplasm (panel k). Upon exposure to TCDD, AhR was redistributed into the cell nucleus (Fig. 2, panel h), but no detectable changes were observed in the subcellular distribution of EBNA-3 and XAP2 (panels j and l, respectively). In cells transiently expressing AhR-GFP together with EBNA-3, the intracellular localization of the AhR-GFP construct was similar to what was observed in the absence of over-expressed EBNA-3 (Fig. 2, panel g, and Fig. 3, panel m). At the same time, EBNA-3 was more diffusely distributed in the presence of AhR (Fig. 3, panels s and t) compared with EBNA-3 expression alone (Fig. 2, panels i and j). In line with earlier published observations (15Kazlauskas A. Sundström S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), co-expression of XAP2 led to re-distribution of the nonactivated AhR-GFP to the cell cytoplasm as well as a very low nuclear accumulation rate of the receptor in the presence of TCDD (Fig. 3, panels o and p). In the case of XAP2 co-expression with EBNA-3, part of XAP2 remained in the cell cytoplasm, but it also formed spot-like nuclear conglomerates where it co-localized with EBNA-3 (Fig. 3, panels q and r; a similar result has also been observed in COS1 cells (10Kashuba E. Kashuba V. Pokrovskaja K. Klein G. Szekely L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1801-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). This suggests that XAP2 follows the nuclear localization pattern of EBNA-3, once it has entered the nucleus. Fig. 4 shows the co-expression of the following three examined proteins: AhR-GFP, EBNA-3, and XAP2. Similarly to what was observed in Fig. 3, the intracellular localization of nonactivated AhR-GFP was determined by XAP2, regardless of the presence of EBNA-3; most of the AhR-GFP fusion construct was localized in the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 4, panels e and f). However, upon treatment of the cells with TCDD, AhR-GFP efficiently migrated to the cell nucleus (Fig. 4, panels g and h), although the process of AhR-GFP nuclear translocation was somewhat less effective, compared with cells that expressed only AhR (see panel h in Fig. 2). This indicates that during the process of ligand-dependent activation of AhR, the effect of cytoplasmic retention of AhR by XAP2 is ove"

Although the direct antibacterial properties of these peptides have been widely characterized, their multiple effects on host cells are only beginning to surface. Here we investigated the mechanistic and functional aspects of the interaction of the proline-rich antimicrobial peptide Bac7(1-35) with mammalian cells, as compared with a truncated analog, Bac7(5-35), lacking four critical N-terminal residues (RRIR) of the Bac7(1-35) sequence. By using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we showed that although the truncated analog Bac7(5-35) remains on the cell surface, Bac7(1-35) is rapidly taken up into 3T3 and U937 cells through a nontoxic energy- and temperature-dependent process. Cell biology-based assays using selective endocytosis inhibitors and spectroscopic and surface plasmon resonance studies of the interaction of Bac7(1-35) with phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol model membranes collectively suggest the concurrent contribution of macropinocytosis and direct membrane translocation. Structural studies with model membranes indicated that membrane-bound Bac7(5-35) is significantly more aggregated than Bac7(1-35) due to the absence of the N-terminal cationic cluster, thus providing an explanation for hampered cellular internalization of the truncated form. Further investigations aimed to reveal functional implications of intracellular uptake of Bac7(1-35) demonstrated that it correlates with enhanced S phase entry of 3T3 cells, indicating a novel function for this proline-rich peptide.

Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The latter finding has led to a re-evaluation of the role of AMPs in immunity, suggesting their involvement in recruitment, activation, and/or maturation of inflammatory and immune cells and/or tissue repair (5Zanetti M.

Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 77: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The multiple activities of AMPs underscore their capacity to interact with host cells by binding to cell surface receptor(s), as exemplified by binding of the α-helical peptide LL-37 to the formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (7De Y.

Among the mammalian AMPs, PR-39 and other proline-rich cathelicidin AMPs, such as the 59-residue Bac7 and the Bac7(1-35) fragment, are peculiar because they kill bacteria without inducing gross destabilization of the bacterial membranes (11Gennaro R. Zanetti M. Benincasa M. Podda E. Miani M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition to affecting bacterial viability, PR-39 also appears to do the following: up-regulate the expression of cell surface proteoglycans that are required for cellular responses to heparin-binding growth factors and extracellular matrix components (12Gallo R.L. Ono M. Povsic T. Page C. Eriksson E. Klagsbrun M. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The pleiotropic effects of this peptide suggest it may protect the host by influencing selected cellular functions in connection with specific pathophysiological settings. Despite a wealth of information on the effects of PR-39 on host cells, little is known about the role(s) of other proline-rich AMPs besides their direct antimicrobial activity. We addressed this issue and explored the cell interaction properties of Bac7(1-35) to increase our understanding of the mechanisms of peptide-cell interaction and their functional implications in mediating the diverse roles of AMPs in immunity, and how these peptides globally impact on host defense. This information is vital to the potential development of these peptides or derivatives as therapeutic molecules. The sequence of Bac7(1-35) (16 prolines out of 35 amino acid residues) comprises an N-terminal cationic cluster (RRIR) followed by regular Pro/Arg repeats interrupted by highly hydrophobic residues. Bac7(1-35) has been shown to kill Gram-negative bacteria (16Benincasa M. Scocchi M. Podda E. Skerlavaj B. Dolzani L. Gennaro R. Peptides (N. Y.). 2004; 25: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and to evoke selected transcriptional responses in Escherichia coli (17Tomasinsig L. Scocchi M. Mettulio R. Zanetti M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3260-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Previous structure/activity relationship studies of this peptide demonstrated that removal of the N-terminal (RRIR) residues from the sequence of Bac7(1-35) dramatically reduced (16Benincasa M. Scocchi M. Podda E. Skerlavaj B. Dolzani L. Gennaro R. Peptides (N. Y.). 2004; 25: 2055-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or abolished (17Tomasinsig L. Scocchi M. Mettulio R. Zanetti M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 3260-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) these effects. Here we investigated the potential of Bac7(1-35) to interact with cultured mammalian cells and to affect cellular functions. The truncated analog Bac7(5-35) lacking the 1-4 N-terminal residues was examined in parallel to determine the role of the cationic N-terminal cluster in this interaction. By using three independent methods, i.e. confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and quantitative spectrofluorometric measurements of cells treated with fluorescein-labeled peptides, we found that although the N-terminally truncated analog Bac7(5-35) accumulated on the cell surface and was poorly internalized, Bac7(1-35) was rapidly taken up by cells and was localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus. The use of various drugs that affect endocytic pathways suggested the involvement of macropinocytosis in the internalization process. Further studies of the membrane interaction properties of the two peptides using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and SPR with model PC/cholesterol membranes provided a physical explanation for the poor cellular incorporation of Bac7(5-35) and revealed a strong tendency of Bac7(1-35) to insert into lipid membranes, suggesting the concurrence of direct membrane translocation besides macropinocytosis. Finally, functional implications of intracellular Bac7(1-35) were inferred from the ability of Bac7(1-35), but not Bac7(5-35), to enhance S phase entry in fibroblasts. Materials—Derivatized PEG-PS resins, coupling reagents for peptide synthesis, and Fmoc amino acids were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City) and ChemImpex (Wood Dale, IL). All other reagents and solvents were of synthesis grade. Lucifer yellow, 5(and 6-)-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (mixed isomers), N-(3-triethylammoniopropyl)-4-(6-(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)hexatrienyl)pyridinium dibromide (FM 4-64), and 3,3′-diethylthiodicarbocyanine iodide (diS-C3-5) were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Peptide Synthesis and Fluorescein Labeling—Bac7(1-35) (RRIRPRPPRLPRPRPRPLPFPRPGPRPIPRPLPFP), Bac7(5-35) (PRPPRLPRPRPRPLPFPRPGPRPIPRPLPFP), and LL-37 (LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES) were chemically synthesized by Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis on a Milligen 9050 automated synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City) (18Ghiselli R. Giacometti A. Cirioni O. Circo R. Mocchegiani F. Skerlavaj B. D'Amato G. Scalise G. Zanetti M. Saba V. Shock. 2003; 19: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The difficult coupling steps predicted in the synthesis of LL-37 were carried out as described (19Giacometti A. Cirioni O. Del Prete M.S. Skerlavaj B. Circo R. Zanetti M. Scalise G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2003; 51: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An extra lysine residue was added at the C terminus of Bac7(1-35) and Bac7(5-35) to attach the fluorescein moiety. Fluorescein labeling was conducted according to Rapaport and Shai (20Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6502-6509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The completion of the reaction was monitored by the ninhydrin assay (21Kaiser E. Colescott R.L. Bossinger C.D. Cook P.I. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar). After removal of the N-terminal Fmoc protection, peptides were cleaved from the resin and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography as reported previously (18Ghiselli R. Giacometti A. Cirioni O. Circo R. Mocchegiani F. Skerlavaj B. D'Amato G. Scalise G. Zanetti M. Saba V. Shock. 2003; 19: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Giacometti A. Cirioni O. Del Prete M.S. Skerlavaj B. Circo R. Zanetti M. Scalise G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2003; 51: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The identity of the peptides was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, using an API I instrument (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The concentration of fluorescein-conjugated peptides was determined by measuring the fluorescein absorbance at 495 nm and using an extinction coefficient of 74,000 according to the manufacturer. The concentration of unlabeled peptides was determined by measuring the absorbance of Phe residues at 257 nm as described previously (18Ghiselli R. Giacometti A. Cirioni O. Circo R. Mocchegiani F. Skerlavaj B. D'Amato G. Scalise G. Zanetti M. Saba V. Shock. 2003; 19: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Antibacterial Assay—The in vitro antibacterial activity was determined as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by a microdilution susceptibility test in 96-well microtiter plates, according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The activity was measured in Mueller-Hinton broth (Difco) using logarithmic phase microorganisms as reported previously (22Skerlavaj B. Romeo D. Gennaro R. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3724-3730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells and Cell Cultures—NIH 3T3 murine fibroblastic cells were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C as exponentially growing subconfluent monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2 mm glutamine. U937 human monocytic cells were cultured in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 2 mm glutamine. DNA Synthesis Assay—NIH 3T3 cells (1 × 104/cm2) were seeded on coverslips (Nunc Inc.) in 35-mm-diameter dishes and incubated at 37 °C in complete DMEM. After 24 h, the cell culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% FCS, and the incubation was prolonged for 48 h. After this time, addition of 50 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 60 min resulted in less than 5% of BrdUrd-positive nuclei. Growth-arrested cells were incubated in DMEM containing 2% FCS and 50 μm BrdUrd, in the absence or presence of the selected peptide. After 18 h cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and processed for immunofluorescence as described (23Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4442-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was assessed by counts of BrdUrd-positive cell nuclei over total cell nuclei after BrdUrd incorporation. Confocal Laser Microscopy—NIH 3T3 cells were seeded on coverslips or on glass bottom dishes (WillCo Wells BV) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in complete DMEM. The cell culture medium was then replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 5 μm fluorescein-labeled peptide, with or without 10 μm FM 4-64, and incubation continued for the appropriate time. U937 cells were grown at 37 °C in complete RPMI 1640, incubated for the appropriate times at 1.6 × 106 cells/ml with Opti-MEM containing 5 μm fluorescein-labeled peptide, washed, and transferred to slides by cytocentrifugation. After washing with Opti-MEM, cells were either examined directly by confocal microscopy or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min or with acetone/methanol (1:1) at 4 °C for 3 min. After fixation, cells were mounted on coverslips for fluorescence microscopic examination. Data were obtained using a Leica TCS laser scan microscope equipped with 488 nm argon ion laser and with 543 nm helium-neon ions laser. Optical sections collected at different levels perpendicular to the optical axis are presented. Photomultiplier gain and laser power were identical within each experiment. Flow Cytometry—Cells were incubated in Opti-MEM in the presence of 5 μm fluorescein-tagged Bac7(1-35) or 4 μm fluorescein-tagged LL-37 at 37 °C for 60 min, washed twice with PBS, and treated with 1 mg/ml trypsin at 37 °C for 5 min to remove surface-bound peptide. This treatment did not affect cell viability, as determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay, while effectively reducing the fluorescein signal, as indicated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis in the absence and presence of trypsin treatment. Cells were then washed and resuspended in PBS for analysis. For energy depletion studies, cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in Opti-MEM containing 10 μm oligomycin B and 50 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose before incubation with the peptide at 37 °C for 60 min in the same medium. This procedure resulted in a 90-95% reduction in the cellular ATP pool as determined by using the luciferin-luciferase assay kit from Molecular Probes. The viability of ATP-depleted cells as determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay was never lower than 93%. To study the effect of low temperature, cells were pre-cooled at 4 °C for 30 min and then incubated with the peptide at 4 °C for 60 min in the same medium. To address the effect of endocytosis inhibitors, cells were preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) or 10 mm amiloride or 0.1 mm cytochalasin D or 20 μm nocodazole. Cells were then incubated with the peptide in the presence of each drug for 60 min. Samples were analyzed with a flow cytometer equipped with the Cell Quest software by using a 488-nm argon ion laser (FACScan, BD Biosciences). A minimum of 10,000 events per sample was analyzed. Fluorescence Quantification—U937 cells (5 × 106/ml) were incubated with 5 μm fluorescein-tagged peptide in Opti-MEM at 37 °C for 10, 30 and 60 min, washed twice with the same solution and once with PBS, incubated with trypsin at 1 mg/ml for 5 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS, resuspended in the same buffer, and processed by sonication for fluorescence measurements. To obtain the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, cells were subjected to hypotonic lysis by a 45-min swelling in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain and pepstatin A) on ice, followed by three freeze-thaw cycles. Nuclei were separated from the cytoplasmic fraction by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, washed once, and resuspended in PBS. The cytoplasmic extract was added with 1:10 v/v cytoplasmic extract buffer (0.3 m Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.4 m KCl, 0.03 m MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A). Fluorescence was quantified in duplicate with excitation set at 488 nm, emission at 525 nm, and cut off at 515 nm. Protein was measured with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Results are expressed as picomoles of peptide/mg of cellular protein. Cytotoxicity—Cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in Opti-MEM in the absence or presence of each peptide. The LDH activity of cell-free media and cell lysates (obtained by treating cell pellets for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100) was determined by measuring the decrease in the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm (24Leclerc M. Cosson G. Vagner D. Ann. Biol. Clin. (Paris). 1967; 25: 469-474PubMed Google Scholar). LDH activity in the culture media was expressed as percent of total cellular LDH activity. Membrane Permeability Assay on Small Unilamellar Vesicles (SUVs)—SUVs were prepared by sonication of PC/cholesterol (10:1, w/w) dispersions as described previously (25Gazit E. Lee W.J. Brey P.T. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10681-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Vesicles were unilamellar with an average diameter of 20-50 nm, as confirmed by electron microscopy (JEOL JEM 100B instrument, Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Tokyo, Japan). Peptide-induced membrane destabilization of SUVs, which results in the collapse of the diffusion potential, was detected as an increase in fluorescence of the potential sensitive dye diS-C3-5 (26Sims P.J. Waggoner A.S. Wang C.H. Hoffmann J.R. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3315-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 27Loew L.M. Rosenberg I. Bridge M. Gitler C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Shai Y. Bach D. Yanovsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20202-20209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATR-FTIR Measurements and Data Analysis—Spectra were obtained with a Bruker Equinox 55 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a deuterated triglyceride sulfate detector and coupled to an ATR device as described in detail previously (29Oren Z. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6103-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture of lipids (0.5 mg) alone or with peptide (∼20 μg) was deposited on a ZnSe horizontal ATR prism (80 × 7 mm). Prior to sample preparation, the trifluoroacetate counterions were replaced with chloride ions to eliminate an absorption band near 1673 cm-1 (30Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Lipid/peptide mixtures were prepared by dissolving them together in a 1:2 CH3OH/CH2Cl2 mixture and drying under a stream of dry nitrogen. Spectra were recorded, and the respective pure phospholipid spectra were subtracted to yield the difference spectra. Hydration of the sample was achieved by incubating in D2O for 2 h before acquisition of the spectra. H/D exchange was considered complete after a total shift of the amide II band. Prior to curve fitting, a straight base line passing through the ordinates at 1700 and 1600 cm-1 was subtracted. The spectra were processed using PEAK-FIT™ software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Second-derivative spectra accompanied by 13-data point Savitsky-Golay smoothing were calculated to identify the positions of the component bands in the spectra. These wave numbers were used as initial parameters for curve fitting with gaussian component peaks. Position, bandwidths, and amplitudes of the peaks were varied as follows: (i) until the resulting bands shifted by no more than 2 cm-1 from the initial parameters; (ii) until all the peaks had reasonable half-widths (<20-25 cm-1), and (iii) until good agreement between the calculated sum of all the components and the experimental spectra was achieved (r2 >0.99). The relative contents of different secondary structure elements were estimated by dividing the areas of individual peaks, assigned to a specific secondary structure, by the whole area of the resulting amide I band. The results of four independent experiments were averaged. The ATR electric fields of incident light were calculated as described previously (31Harrick N.J. Internal Reflection Spectroscopy. Interscience, New York1967Google Scholar, 32Ishiguro R. Kimura N. Takahashi S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9792-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Lipid order parameters were obtained from the symmetric (νsym(CH2) ∼2853 cm-1) and the antisymmetric (νantisym(CH2) ∼2922 cm-1) lipid stretching mode (32Ishiguro R. Kimura N. Takahashi S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9792-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Binding Analysis by Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor—Biosensor experiments were carried out with a BIAcore 3000 analytical system (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) using L1 sensor chip (BIAcore), which allows the formation of a lipid bilayer (33Mozsolits H. Wirth H.J. Werkmeister J. Aguilar M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1512: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). All solutions were freshly prepared, degassed, and filtered through 0.22-μm pores. Experiments were done at 25 °C. After cleaning the chip by an injection of 40 mm N-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (25 μl), at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, PC/cholesterol (10:1 w/w) SUVs (80 μl, 0.5 mm) were applied to the chip surface at a low flow rate of 2 μl/min, which then was increased to 50 μl/min, resulting in a stable base line. Bovine serum albumin was then injected (25 μl, 0.1 mg/μl in PBS) to cover nonspecific binding sites. Peptide solutions (a 50-μl PBS solution of 0.78-100 μm peptide) were injected on the lipid surface at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. PBS alone was then replaced by the peptide solution for 30 min to allow peptide dissociation. SPR detects changes in the reflective index of the surface layer of peptides and lipids in contact with the sensor chip. A sensogram was obtained by plotting the SPR angle against time. The peptide-lipid binding event was analyzed from a series of sensograms collected at seven different peptide concentrations. The sensograms for each peptide-lipid bilayer interaction (L1 chip) were analyzed by curve fitting using numerical integration analysis (34Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Chaiken I.M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The BIAevaluation software offers different reaction models to perform complete kinetic analyses of the peptide sensograms. One curve-fitting algorithm (the two-state reaction model) was chosen on the basis of what was known about the possible binding mechanisms of lytic peptides. The data were fitted globally by simultaneously fitting the peptide sensograms obtained at seven different concentrations. The two-state reaction model was applied to each data set. This model describes two reaction steps (33Mozsolits H. Wirth H.J. Werkmeister J. Aguilar M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1512: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) which, in terms of peptide-lipid interaction, corresponds to Reaction 1,P+Lka1⇄kd1PLka2⇄kd2PL*Reaction 1 where in the first step, peptide (P) binds to lipids (L) to give PL, which is changed to PL* in the second step. PL* cannot dissociate directly to P + L and may correspond to partial insertion of the peptide into the lipid bilayers. The corresponding differential rate equations for this reaction model are represented by Equations 1 and 2,dRU1/dt=ka1×CA×(RUmax-RU1-RU2)-kd1×RU1-ka2×RU1+kd2×RU2(Eq. 1) dRU2/dt=ka2×RU1-kd2×RU2(Eq. 2) where RU1 and RU2 are the response units for the first and second steps, respectively; CA is the peptide concentration; RUmax is the maximal response unit (or equilibrium binding response); and ka1, kd1, ka2, and kd2 are the association and dissociation rate constants for the first and second steps, respectively. Whereas ka has 1/(m× s) units, kd1, kd2, and ka2 have 1/s units. Thus the total affinity constant for the all process, K, has m-1 units. Antimicrobial Activity—The antimicrobial activities of the compounds under study were examined to rule out functional modifications induced by fluorescein conjugation. No substantial changes were observed when comparing the acti"
https://openalex.org/W2019305946,"The transcription factor RovA of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and analogous proteins in other Enterobacteriaceae activate the expression of virulence genes that play a crucial role in stress adaptation and pathogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that the RovA protein forms dimers independent of DNA binding, stimulates RNA polymerase, most likely via its C-terminal domain, and counteracts transcriptional repression by the histone-like protein H-NS. As the molecular function of the RovA family is largely uncharacterized, random mutagenesis and terminal deletions were used to identify functionally important domains. Our analysis showed that a winged-helix motif in the center of the molecule is essential and directly involved in DNA binding. Terminal deletions and amino acid changes within both termini also abrogate RovA activation and DNA-binding functions, most likely due to their implication in dimer formation. Finally, we show that the last four amino acids of RovA are crucial for activation of gene transcription. Successive deletions of these residues result in a continuous loss of RovA activity. Their removal reduced the capacity of RovA to activate RNA polymerase and abolished transcription of RovA-activated promoters in the presence of H-NS, although dimerization and DNA binding functions were retained. Our structural model implies that the final amino acids of RovA play a role in protein-protein interactions, adjusting RovA activity.

Enteropathogenic Yersinia species are Gram-negative bacteria that can cause food-borne infections in animals and humans (yersiniosis), with symptoms such as self-limiting enteritis and mesenteric lymphadenitis (1Bottone E.J.

During infection Yersinia penetrates and crosses the epithelial layer of the intestine through M-cells and colonizes underlying lymphatic tissues (3Grutzkau A. Hanski C. Hahn H. Riecken E.O.

Maximal RovA-mediated transcription of the invasin gene inv requires the binding of RovA to two AT-rich sequences located in a DNA segment extending 200 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of the inv gene (8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). RovA also functions as an activator of its own transcription. It interacts directly and specifically with sequences far upstream in the rovA regulatory region, and this interaction is required for full activation of two different rovA promoters located 76 nt 2The abbreviations used are: ntnucleotide(s)RNAPRNA polymeraseα-CTDα C-terminal domainHTHhelix-turn-helixwtwild-type.2The abbreviations used are: ntnucleotide(s)RNAPRNA polymeraseα-CTDα C-terminal domainHTHhelix-turn-helixwtwild-type.

Transcription of the rovA gene and the RovA-dependent inv gene are both subject to silencing by the nucleoid-associated H-NS protein. The binding sites of H-NS and RovA are superimposed within the inv and rovA promoters, indicating that RovA might act as an antirepressor (8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recently, it has become evident that RovA is involved in the regulation of multiple genes of Yersinia in addition to inv and rovA, some of which seem to play an important role in pathogenesis (6Revell P.A.

They regulate a wide range of physiological processes involved in survival, stress adaptation, and virulence. In Salmonella, SlyA regulates virulence factors necessary for environmental adaptation and survival in mice (10Daniels J.J. Autenrieth I.B. Ludwig A. Goebel W. Infect.

SlyA of Escherichia coli induces a cryptic clyA gene, encoding a contact-dependent pore-forming cytolysin of the RTX toxin family.

Cox A. Bycroft B.W. Stewart G.S. Williams P. Salmond G.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Comparison of amino acid sequences in genomes revealed that the RovA/SlyA proteins share low level sequence similarity (≤40% identity) with a large number of different transcriptional regulators identified in diverse bacterial and archaeal genomes (supplemental Fig. A). A prototypic member of the entire regulator family is MarR, a repressor of the marROAB operon mediating intrinsic multiple antibiotic resistance in E. coli (17Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. J.

To date, the crystal structures of three MarR-like proteins have been determined without their DNA targets. Despite their low amino acid sequence similarity, all three family members show a similar overall structure. They form dimers and share a common internal fold with a conserved winged-helix motif that is believed to mediate interactions with DNA (19Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F.

Despite this, MarR-like proteins seem to retain a very flexible and highly adaptable protein fold and show significant divergence at their terminal ends, which apparently allow them to fulfil different functions (21Wu R.Y.

In this context it is important to note that, unfortunately, several members of other MarR-type subgroups with distinct functions and very low homologies (<25%) to the RovA/SlyA family were also named SlyA, e.g. the crystallized protein SlyAEF of Enterococcus faecalis and SlyA2 (Hos) of E. coli (supplemental Fig. A) (21Wu R.Y.

In addition, little is known about the interaction of this RovA/SlyA subfamily with DNA and the transcriptional machinery, in particular RNA polymerase. For this reason, this study was aimed to define the functional domains of the RovA protein and to investigate direct transcriptional activation of the inv and rovA promoters by this transcription factor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Fig. B. Overnight cultures of E. coli were routinely grown at 37 °C under aeration in LB medium plus appropriate antibiotics.DNA Manipulations and Sequence Analysis—All DNA manipulations and transformations were performed using standard genetic and molecular techniques (24Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar, 25Miller J.H. Laboratories C.S.H A Short Course in Bacterial Genetic: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992Google Scholar). T4 ligase and DNase I were obtained from Roche Applied Science; all restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Metabion. Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs) and Pfu polymerase (Promega) were used for amplification by PCR. PCR products were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Sequencing reactions were carried out by Agowa (Berlin, Germany). Radiolabeled [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci mmol-1) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplemental Fig. B. The rovA gene and its mutant alleles were amplified by PCR and cloned into vectors pQE or pET28a for the synthesis of His6-tagged proteins, generating the pHis series. Plasmids pHT102, pHT103, and pHT104 used for in vitro transcription experiments are derivatives of pJL28 carrying PCR generated DNA fragments of Y. pseudotuberculosis harboring different segments of the inv (pHT102: -207 to +101) or the rovA regulatory region (pHT103: -455 to -114; pHT104: -455 to +96).Random and Site-directed Mutagenesis of the rovA Gene, Construction of N- and C-terminal Deletions—Random chemical mutagenesis with hydroxylamine of pGN12 (rovA+) was performed as previously described (26Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992Google Scholar). Ten plasmid samples were mutagenized independently and transformed into E. coli pAK002, encoding a RovA-dependent invphoA reporter fusion. White/light blue colonies on LB plates with X-P were isolated and analyzed.N-terminal deletions and site-directed mutagenesis to introduce alternative amino acid in RovA were performed by a four-primer/two-step PCR procedure of pGN12 with two common external and two internal mutagenesis primers. For C-terminal deletion alleles, PCR fragments were amplified using a universal upstream and a mutagenesis-specific downstream primer. The resulting fragments encoding the rovA gene with the desired mutations were cloned into vector pBAD33 cut with KpnI and XbaI.Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Cell extracts of identical amounts of E. coli bearing pBAD33-derivatives encoding the RovA wild-type or various mutant proteins were prepared and separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (24Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar, 25Miller J.H. Laboratories C.S.H A Short Course in Bacterial Genetic: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992Google Scholar). For the immunological detection of the RovA proteins, the samples were transfered onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and probed with a polyclonal RovA-specific antiserum as described (8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Expression and Purification of RovA and H-NS—The RovA wild-type protein, the RovA mutants and the H-NS protein of Y. pseudotuberculosis with a His-tag at the C-terminal end were expressed in E. coli and purified from 1-liter cultures via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) as described in previous studies (7Nagel G. Lahrz A. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1249-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The purity of the RovA proteins and H-NS was estimated to be >95%.DNA Binding Studies—For the DNA retardation assays a DNA fragment encoding a RovA-binding site of the inv regulatory region (-223 to +90) was generated by PCR. The binding of RovA or RovA mutants to the PCR fragment and separation of the DNA-RovA complex on a 4% polyacrylamide gel was carried out as described (7Nagel G. Lahrz A. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1249-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For DNase I footprinting, an inv promoter fragment (-276 to +224) was amplified by PCR with a digoxigenin-labeled primer (5′-digoxigenin-ACCATCAGGATTAATGCGG-3′) and a non-labeled primer (5′-ATTCCTTATCAAGAGAAACTC). PCR fragments were incubated with the purified RovA protein, digested with DNase I, and the resulting products were separated and visualized as described (8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The protected bands were identified by comparison to a DNA sequence ladder generated with the same DIG-labeled primer used for the amplification of the fragment by PCR. For double-stranded sequencing pPD264 was used as template.Run-off Transcription Assay—Linearized plasmids pHT102, pHT104, and pHT103 were used as templates for single-round in vitro transcription. Binding reactions contained 4 μl of each DNA template (20 nm), 4 μl of increasing concentrations of RovA and/or H-NS (0.3-1.0 μg) in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 50% glycerol), or buffer A alone (control) were kept at room temperature for 20 min. 3.5 μl (0.31 unit/μl) RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme of E. coli (Epicenter) in buffer B (40 mm Hepes, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm potassium glutamate) was added to 8 μl of this mixture, previously incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Elongation was started by the addition of 3.5 μl of prewarmed rNTPs (1 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP, 50 μm UTP, 1 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, and 500 μgml-1 heparin) and allowed to proceed for 6 min. The reactions were stopped with a form-amide solution containing 20 mm EDTA, 0.25% xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue. Samples were heated to 70 °C for 5 min before loading on a 6% denaturing sequencing gel with a radiolabeled size marker fragment. To generate the size marker, a 135-bp DNA fragment (20 pmol) was radiolabeled in a 20-μl reaction mix, containing 2 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and 2 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol-1). The labeling reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped by addition of 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8. Radiolabeled transcripts were quantified on a Fuji phosphorimager and normalized against vector-encoded 106 and 108-nt RNA I transcripts present in each lane.Cross-linking and Gel Filtration of Purified RovA—For cross-linking, 3-12 mm N-(α-maleimidoacetoxy)succinimide ester (AMAS) or form-aldehyde (0.05-0.1%) in the presence of 2 units of RNAP (Epicenter) was added to 200 ng of purified RovA protein in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1mm EDTA. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and stopped by adding ethanolamine, pH 7.4, in a final concentration of 50 mm. Subsequently, the samples were analyzed by immunoblotting as described (8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To analyze the oligomerization state of the RovA protein, purified RovA protein was subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazol, 1 mm MgCl2, and calibrated using a set of different proteins with known molecular sizes: aprotinin, 6.5 kDa; ribonuclease A, 13.7 kDa; chymotrypsinogen A, 25 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa. 200-μl samples of the purified RovA protein (1.4 mg ml-1) were applied to this column run by the Akta 100 Explorer system (Amersham Biosciences). The elution profile was monitored by UV absorption and visualized with the Unicorn 3.0 program (Amersham Biosciences).Alkaline Phosphatase Assays—Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in permeabilized cells as described (7Nagel G. Lahrz A. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1249-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The activities were calculated as follows: OD420·6.46·OD578-1·Δt (min)-1·volume (ml)-1.RESULTSOligomerization State of the RovA Protein—The homology of RovA to homodimeric members of the MarR family of transcriptional regulator proteins (supplemental Fig. A) (19Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 20Lim D. Poole K. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29253-29259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and the fact that RovA protects multiple binding sites in the inv and rovA promoter region (8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) suggested that RovA might act as an oligomer. Despite this finding, a non-palindromic consensus sequence has been derived from RovA-protected DNA regions (8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), making homotypic RovA-RovA interaction questionable. To assess the ability of RovA to form oligomers we performed in vitro cross-linking experiments with the purified RovA protein using AMAS and analyzed the samples by Western blotting using anti-RovA antibodies. Treatment with the cross-linking agent generated species of RovA with the size of a homodimer (35 kDa) (Fig. 1A). To confirm this result, the purified RovA protein was also size fractionated on a Superdex 75 column. No protein was detected of predicted molecular mass <25 kDa, where monomeric RovA with an apparent molecular mass of 17.2 kDa would be expected to fractionate, but a peak elution occurred in a region predicted to contain proteins of about 35 kDa (Fig. 1B). This demonstrated that the majority of the RovA protein in the solution is present as homodimer.Direct Activation of rovA and inv Transcription by RovA—In our previous study we demonstrated that the RovA regulatory protein is required for the expression of the inv gene. However, RovA was dispensable for inv transcription when the negative modulator protein H-NS was absent, indicating that RovA acts as an antirepressor (8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Since RovA caused an additional increase in inv expression even in the absence of H-NS, it was assumed that RovA may also have the capacity to stimulate RNAP directly (8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To assess the capability of RovA to stimulate transcription of the inv and rovA promoter(s), we performed in vitro transcription assays with RNAP of E. coli (Epicenter), which is almost identical to that of Y. pseudotuberculosis. Purified RovA and linearized plasmids were employed that carry the entire inv promoter fragment (pHT102) or harbor different portions of the rovA regulatory region (pHT103, pHT104) to analyze transcription from P1rovA and P2rovA, respectively. The amount of the inv and rovA transcripts was expressed relative to the level of the RNA I transcripts, which are produced from the rna I gene encoded on the same plasmids. As shown in Fig. 2, inv and rovA specific run-off transcripts of the expected size were detected with RNAP alone. In the case of the inv promoter (Fig. 2A) only a single transcript was found, whereas additional minor transcripts were detected for rovA (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that RNAP formed productive complexes at closely adjacent nucleotides in vitro. Addition of increasing amounts of the RovA protein in the presence of RNAP further stimulated the production of the inv and rovA transcripts about 3-fold. We conclude that RNAP can initiate considerable basic transcription starting at the inv and both rovA promoter(s) without RovA, but the RovA protein further activates inv and rovA transcription directly.FIGURE 2In vitro run-off transcription from the inv and rovA promoters. Plasmids pHT102, pHT103, and pHT104 were incubated with either E. coli RNAP in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of RovA and H-NS as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” pHT102 carries a 3′-terminally truncated inv gene and generates a transcript of 136 nt (A), pHT103 harbors a 3′-terminally truncated rovA gene and generates a transcript from P2 of 124 nt (B), and pHT104 carries a 3′-terminally truncated rovA gene and leads to a transcript of 115 nt from P1 (C). The inv and rovA transcripts and the RNA I transcripts (106 and 108 nt) encoded by the vector are indicated on the right; a radiolabeled DNA marker fragment of 135 nt was loaded on the left. Numbers below show the quantification of the result, the inv′ and rovA′ transcripts were normalized to RNA I transcripts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In contrast to these results, a relative low basal activity of the inv and rovA promoter(s) was observed in vivo (7Nagel G. Lahrz A. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1249-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Heroven A.K. Nagel G. Tran H.J. Parr S. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 871-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This may be explained by the fact that the promoters are all subject to silencing by H-NS, which is not present in the in vitro system. To confirm this, in vitro transcription experiments with the inv and rovA promoter fragments were performed in the presence of purified H-NS of Y. pseudotuberculosis. The data presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that inv and rovA transcription from both promoters was strongly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner when H-NS was present, whereas the production of the RNA I control transcript remained unaffected. When both H-NS and the RovA protein were present, significantly higher amounts of the inv and rovA run-off transcripts were observed compared with samples in which only the H-NS protein was applied. Derepression of the P2rovA promoter was less pronounced than that of P1rovA, but the transcription start site seemed more defined. Taken together, these results are in agreement with the action of RovA both as direct transcriptional activator and as antirepressor when the negative regulatory factor H-NS is present.Interaction of RovA with RNA Polymerase—To further test whether direct activation of transcription occurs via RovA interaction with RNAP, we performed in vitro cross-linking experiments with purified RovA and the RNAP core enzyme of E. coli. Western blot analysis with anti-RovA antibodies demonstrated the formation of higher molecular RovA-core enzyme complexes (Fig. 3A), whereas no complexes were seen in samples without RovA or RNAP. This indicated that RovA is able to interact directly with the RNAP core enzyme in a DNA-independent manner. We also performed gel retardation assays with an inv promoter fragment including a RovA-binding site, RNAP, and/or RovA on ice to prevent open complex formation. A single band of binary RNAP-DNA complexes was observed in the sample without activator (Fig. 3B). RovA-DNA complexes and bands with slightly lower mobility than the RNAP-DNA complex were detected in the samples containing activator. We presume that these species represent the ternary complex. In total, more RNAP-DNA complexes were detectable in the presence of RovA, suggesting that the ternary complex was more stable than the binary complex.FIGURE 3Interaction of RovA with RNA polymerase.

https://openalex.org/W2093390493,"ACK1 is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that associates specifically with Cdc42. Relatively few ACK1 substrates and interacting proteins have been identified. In this study, we demonstrated that ACK1 phosphorylates the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), a Cdc42 effector that plays an important role in the formation of new actin filaments. ACK1 and WASP interact in intact cells, and overexpression of ACK1 promotes WASP phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of WASP in vitro was enhanced by the addition of Cdc42 or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, presumably due to release of the autoinhibitory interactions in WASP. Surprisingly, when we mapped the sites of WASP phosphorylation, we found that ACK1 possesses significant serine kinase activity toward WASP (directed at Ser-242), as well as tyrosine kinase activity directed at Tyr-256. A serine peptide derived from the Ser-242 WASP phosphorylation site is also a substrate for ACK1. ACK1 expressed in bacteria retained its serine kinase activity, eliminating the possibility of contamination with a copurifying kinase. Serine phosphorylation of WASP enhanced the ability of WASP to stimulate actin polymerization in mammalian cell lysates. Thus, the tyrosine kinase ACK1 acts as a dual specificity kinase toward this substrate. In contrast to other dual specificity kinases that more closely resemble Ser/Thr kinases, ACK1 is a tyrosine kinase with an active site that can accommodate both types of hydroxyamino acids in substrates.

In contrast to other dual specificity kinases that more closely resemble Ser/Thr kinases, ACK1 is a tyrosine kinase with an active site that can accommodate both types of hydroxyamino acids in substrates.

(activated Cdc42-associated kinase-1) is a specific effector kinase for the GTP-bound form of Cdc42. ACK1 is a member of a distinct family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that includes ACK1, ACK2, and TNK in mammals and homologs in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans (1Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain sequences of ACK family kinases are characteristic of tyrosine kinases, yet they are divergent from most other families of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases; they are most closely related to the epidermal growth factor receptor family kinases (3Robinson D.R. Wu Y.M. Lin S.F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5548-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 4Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6160) Google Scholar). ACK kinases also have a unique structural organization; C-terminal to the catalytic domain, they possess SH3 domains, Cdc42-binding CRIB domains, and polyproline regions. The placement of the SH3 domain C-terminal to the catalytic domain is different from the other families of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. ACK kinases are activated by cell adhesion, and they play important roles in cell spreading and motility (5Coon M. Herrera R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Recent work has also focused on the involvement of ACK kinases in signaling pathways leading to clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis (8Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol.

Relatively little is known about the physiological substrates of ACK kinases. Upon epidermal growth factor stimulation, ACK2 binds and phosphorylates sorting nexin 9 (SH3PX1), which promotes epidermal growth factor receptor degradation (9Lin Q. Lo C.G. Cerione R.A. Yang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10134-10138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, ACK1 binds and phosphorylates the adaptor protein HSH2 (10Oda T. Muramatsu M.A. Isogai T. Masuho Y. Asano S. Yamashita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For both HSH2 and SH3PX1, ACK substrate recognition is governed by interactions with the noncatalytic regions of ACK; a proline-rich region of HSH2 binds to the SH3 domain of ACK1, whereas the SH3 domain of SH3PX1 mediates the interaction with the polyproline region of ACK2. The polyproline region of ACK kinases has also been shown to interact with Grb2 (11Satoh T. Kato J. Nishida K. Kaziro Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Nck (8Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although it is not known whether these proteins are physiological substrates for ACK. ACK1 has also been reported to phosphorylate and activate the guanine nucleotide exchange factors Dbl and Ras-GRF1 (13Kato-Stankiewicz J. Ueda S. Kataoka T. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Identification of additional ACK substrates would aid in investigations into the functional importance of ACK kinases. In this report, we have identified an interaction between ACK1 and the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), a Cdc42 effector that plays an important role in the formation of new actin filaments. WASP family proteins contain a C-terminal VCA (verprolin, central, acidic) domain that binds to actin monomers and the Arp 2/3 actin nucleation complex (14Ramesh N. Anton I.M. Martinez-Quiles N. Geha R.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 15-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In its unactivated state, the VCA domain is engaged in autoinhibitory interactions with the Cdc42-binding region of WASP (16Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In the presence of Cdc42-GTP and PIP2, the autoinhibitory interactions are disrupted, and WASP stimulates the actin-nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex (17Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 18Caron E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). WASP is cooperatively activated by Cdc42 and PIP2, so WASP proteins act as integrating devices that respond maximally in the presence of both input signals (19Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In Xenopus egg extracts, Toca-1 has recently been identified as an additional protein factor that is required for Cdc42- and PIP2-induced actin assembly (20Ho H.Y. Rohatgi R. Lebensohn A.M. Le M. Li J. Gygi S.P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 2004; 118: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The activity of WASP is also regulated by phosphorylation at Tyr-256 by Hck and other kinases (21Torres E. Rosen M.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1215-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 22Cory G.O. Garg R. Cramer R. Ridley A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45115-45121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). (N-WASP numbering is used throughout this report.) Binding of Cdc42 to WASP increases the accessibility of Tyr-256, promoting phosphorylation and increasing activity toward the Arp2/3 complex. ACK1 and WASP are present in many of the same signaling complexes. Both ACK1 and WASP contain CRIB domains that mediate interactions with Cdc42. We and others have demonstrated that both ACK1 and WASP interact with the Src family kinase Hck in intact cells (12Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Cory G.O. Garg R. Cramer R. Ridley A.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 28238-28246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These findings led us to investigate whether WASP is a substrate for ACK1. Here, we demonstrated that ACK1 phosphorylates WASP in vitro, and co-expression of ACK1 promotes WASP phosphorylation in intact cells. When we mapped the sites of WASP phosphorylation by tandem mass spectrometry, we found that ACK1 catalyzes phosphorylation of Ser-242 as well as Tyr-256 of WASP. We confirmed the intrinsic serine kinase activity of ACK1 using bacterially expressed enzyme. A serine peptide derived from the Ser-242 WASP phosphorylation site is a substrate for ACK1. Serine phosphorylation of WASP enhanced the ability of WASP to stimulate actin polymerization in cell lysates. Thus, the tyrosine kinase ACK1 acts as a dual specificity kinase toward WASP. Materials—Monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-ACK polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). 5,6-Dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) was obtained from Calbiochem. Ni-NTA affinity resin was from Qiagen, and TRITC-phalloidin was from Sigma. Plasmids encoding poly-histidine-tagged WASP (mini-N-WASP, 178–274-GSGSGSGSG-392–501) and full-length rat N-WASP were gifts from Dr. Wendell A. Lim (University of California (UCSF), San Francisco, CA). A mammalian expression vector encoding a WASP fusion with green fluorescent protein was produced by subcloning N-WASP DNA into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, purified by preparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and characterized by matrix-assisted laser description/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. ACK1 was expressed and purified using the Sf9/baculovirus system, as described previously (12Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This construct contains the ACK1 catalytic, SH3, and CRIB domains and poly-His and chitin-binding domain tags at the C terminus. To remove the tags, ACK1 was digested with thrombin, and untagged ACK1 was then repurified by Mono Q-Sepharose or Superdex-200 chromatography. K158R ACK1 was produced by similar procedures. ACK1 Activity Assay—ACK1 kinase activity was determined using the phosphocellulose paper assay, as described previously (12Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm ATP, varying concentrations of peptide substrate, and [γ-32P]ATP (200–400 cpm/pmol). Incorporation of 32P into peptide was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Purification of Mini-WASP—Mini-WASP was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.25 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3.5 h. Cells (0.3 liters) were harvested and lysed in a French pressure cell in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were applied to a Ni-NTA column (3 ml). The column was washed with buffer containing 15 mm imidazole, 0.3 m NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH. 8.0) and further washed with buffer containing 1 m NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH. 8.0). Mini-WASP was eluted with buffer containing 100 mm imidazole, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH. 8.0). To produce the version of mini-WASP lacking tyrosines (YF-WASP), site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene). In addition to Tyr-256, two tyrosines within the poly-histidine tag were mutated to phenylalanines. The mutation was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing, and YF-WASP was expressed and purified as described above. S242A and Y256F/S242A WASP were produced by similar methods. Phosphorylation of Mini-WASP—Wild type or YF-Mini-WASP (1 μg) was incubated with 0.25 mm [γ-32P]ATP (400–700 cpm/pmol) and ACK1 (0.1–0.3 μg) in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4 at 30 °C for 40 min in the presence or absence of Cdc42 or PIP2 (PS:PC:PIP2 vesicles at 49:49:2). After reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-sample buffer, proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. PIP2 vesicles were prepared by dissolving phospholipids in chloroform, drying, and resuspending in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and carrying out several freeze-thaw/bath sonication cycles. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—WASP and YF-WASP were phosphorylated by ACK with 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (700–1000 cpm/pmol) for 2.5 h. The phosphorylated WASP or YF-WASP proteins (6 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The bands were excised, and proteins were extracted from the gel using 500 μl of a freshly prepared solution containing 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 10 μl of 10% SDS, and 50 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol. Eluted proteins were precipitated in the presence of bovine serum albumin by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (100%). The precipitates were washed with ice-cold acetone and air dried. The precipitates were hydrolyzed in 50 μlof6 n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C and then lyophilized. The pellets were suspended in 5 μl of pH 1.9 buffer (24Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) containing unlabeled standards. Samples were spotted onto 20 × 20 cm cellulose TLC plates and electrophoresed in two dimensions using a Hunter thin layer electrophoresis apparatus (CBS Scientific, Inc.) (24Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). The buffers used were as follows: pH 1.9 (horizontal dimension) and pH 3.5 (vertical dimension). Spots were detected with ninhydrin solution, and 32P-labeled products were detected by autoradiography. Mass Spectrometry—ACK1-phosphorylated Mini-WASP (4 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were stained with Coomassie brilliant Blue. WASP bands were excised from the gel, cut into small pieces, and transferred to siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. After washing with 50% methanol and 5% acetic acid, gel fragments were dehydrated by the addition of acetonitrile. Proteins were reduced and alkylated by the addition of dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide and then digested with trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C. The tryptic peptides were extracted by treatment with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 5% (v/v) formic acid in water. Samples were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry (nano-LC/ES/MSMS) using an API QSTAR Pulsar LC/MSMS System (Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX, Foster City, CA) equipped with a Protana nanospray source (Protana Engineering A/S, Starmosegardsvej, Denmark) and an UltiMate capillary high pressure liquid chromatography system (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA). The column was a 75 μm × 15 cm PepMap C18 nano-column (LC Packings). The flow rate was 180 nl/min. Nitrogen was used as collision gas. The tryptic digest of WASP was analyzed by nano-LC/MSMS in positive ion mode using rolling collision energy for optimum peptide bond fragmentation. A phosphopeptide (NLFDMCGIpSEAQLK) was detected by a data base search using the Pro ID software (Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX). The molecular mass of the peptide was measured at 1847.65 Da, showing a 79.96-Da increase from the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide. However, no fragment ions bearing the phospho-moiety were detected in the product ion spectrum. The sample was further analyzed with variable collision energy at 30, 40, and 50 eV. Several fragment ions (b11, b12, b13, y11, y12, and y13) with the phospho-moiety were detected in the product ion spectrum at 30 eV of collision energy, indicating that the serine residue was phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of Tyr-256 was established by a similar procedure. Cell Culture and Transfection—U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin, Invitrogen). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic at 37 °C. COS-7 cells were cultured to 70% confluence in 100-mm dishes. Transfections were performed in OPTI medium (Invitrogen) using 10 μg of plasmid DNA and TransIT polyamine transfection reagent (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 40 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—COS-7 cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The postnuclear lysate was precleared with protein A-agarose and used for immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibody. After the addition of 10 μl of protein A-agarose, incubations were continued 5 h or overnight at 4 °C. The resin was collected and washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. Blots were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody with ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence, Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Actin Polymerization Assay—Ni-NTA beads were loaded with His-tagged mini-WASP (wild type or mutants). To phosphorylate immobilized mini-WASP, the beads were incubated with ACK1 that had been purified from Sf9 cells. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation under these conditions was 10–15% (data not shown). U937 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, (pH 7.4), 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4,1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and 2 mm MgCl2 was added. Lysates (2 mg of protein) were incubated with 6 μl of immobilized mini-WASP beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Ni-NTA resin was used as control. The beads were washed with washing buffer plus 2 mm MgCl2 three times and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 15 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl. Beads were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with TRITC-phalloidin for 1 h. The beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and mounted on glass slides and dried. Images were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M wide-field fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using a Zeiss AxioCam with AxioVision software (version 4.3). Exposure times were kept constant for all experiments. ACK1 Phosphorylates WASP—In our initial studies, we used a minimal fragment of N-WASP (mini-WASP) consisting of the control region linked to the VCA domain; this fragment retains the regulatory properties of full-length N-WASP (19Prehoda K.E. Scott J.A. Mullins R.D. Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We expressed a construct consisting of the ACK1 kinase, SH3, and CRIB domains in Sf9 cells and then purified the enzyme as described previously (12Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We produced mini-WASP in E. coli. Purified ACK1 phosphorylates mini-WASP in vitro (Fig. 1A). As described previously for Src kinases (21Torres E. Rosen M.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1215-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 25Suetsugu S. Hattori M. Miki H. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Mikoshiba K. Takenawa T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 645-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the addition of Cdc42 or PIP2 enhanced the phosphorylation of mini-WASP by ACK1, presumably by disrupting the autoinhibited conformation (Fig. 1A). In U937 monocytic cells, endogenous levels of ACK1 and WASP interact, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B). The two proteins also interact in ACK1-transfected COS-7 cells, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation using ACK1 or WASP antibodies (Fig. 1B). To test for ACK1-mediated phosphorylation of WASP, we carried out anti-WASP immunoprecipitation reactions from untransfected or ACK1-transfected COS-7 cells. Precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP was increased by ACK expression (Fig. 1C), indicating that ACK1 can promote tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP in intact cells. ACK1 Acts as a Dual Specificity Kinase toward WASP—To characterize the sites of phosphorylation on WASP, we treated bacterially expressed mini-WASP with purified ACK1 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and followed the reaction by autoradiography. Surprisingly, treatment of phosphorylated WASP with YOP, the Yersinia tyrosine-specific phosphatase, did not decrease phosphorylation of WASP (Fig. 2A). In contrast, treatment with the nonspecific (Ser/Thr/Tyr) acid phosphatase eliminated WASP phosphorylation (Fig. 2A), raising the possibility that WASP is phosphorylated on Ser/Thr residues. Treatment of tyrosine-phosphorylated p130Cas with YOP confirmed the activity of YOP under these conditions (Fig. 2B). There is only one tyrosine (equivalent to Tyr-256) in mini-WASP, and we mutated this tyrosine to phenylalanine. The YF-WASP mutant was phosphorylated by recombinant ACK1 (Fig. 2A), and phosphorylation was reversed by treatment with acid phosphatase but not YOP (Fig. 2A). The results suggest that ACK1 has the capacity to phosphorylate Ser/Thr residues on WASP. In ACK1-transfected COS-7 cells, we detected serine phosphorylation of WASP by anti-WASP immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with phospho-Ser antibodies (Fig. 1C, pSer). To analyze the phosphorylation in more detail, we carried out phosphoamino acid analysis (PAA) of ACK1-phosphorylated wild type and YF-WASP. As shown in Fig. 3A, ACK1 phosphorylates serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of WASP. The signal for serine/threonine phosphorylation appeared to be stronger than that for tyrosine phosphorylation. We incubated pure ACK1 with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of WASP to study ACK1 autophosphorylation. Phosphoamino acid analysis of this reaction also showed the presence of phospho-Ser, phospho-Thr, and phospho-Tyr (Fig. 3B, pS, pT, and PY). The ACK1 used in these experiments migrates as a single band on SDS-PAGE (12Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but to reduce the possibility that a trace amount of Ser/Thr kinase was present as a contaminant, we cleaved off the C-terminal His and chitin-binding domain tags by thrombin treatment. The untagged ACK1 was then repurified by MonoQ anion exchange chromatography; untagged ACK1 eluted under different conditions from tagged ACK1. We treated YF-WASP with untagged ACK1 together with [γ-32P]ATP. PAA of this reaction showed predominantly phosphoserine (Fig. 3C). We expressed a kinase-inactive variant of ACK1 (K158R) in Sf9 cells and purified the protein under identical conditions to those used for wild-type ACK1. We incubated K158R ACK1 with wild-type WASP and [γ-32P]ATP, but no phosphorylation of WASP was detected by PAA (Fig. 3D). Similarly, incubation of K158R ACK1 with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of WASP failed to show a signal for ACK1 autophosphorylation by PAA (Fig. 3E). These results for kinase-inactive ACK1 confirmed that WASP phosphorylation was due to the intrinsic kinase activity of ACK1. To eliminate the possibility that serine phosphorylation could be due to a contaminant in the ACK1 preparation, we expressed ACK1 in bacterial cells, which lack serine/threonine kinases. We subcloned the ACK1 fragment (kinase-SH3-CRIB) into the bacterial expression vector pGEX4T. This GST-ACK1 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified on glutathione-agarose. Although the specific activity of the bacterial ACK1 was lower than the enzyme expressed in Sf9 cells, the bacterial enzyme was still able to phosphorylate wild-type mini-WASP or the YF mutant lacking all tyrosines (Fig. 4A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the reaction between GST-ACK1 and the YF mutant form of WASP confirmed the serine kinase activity of the enzyme (Fig. 4B). Identification of ACK1-catalyzed Serine and Tyrosine Phosphorylation Sites on WASP—Next, we analyzed the phosphorylation sites on mini-WASP by tandem mass spectrometry. ACK1-phosphorylated mini-WASP was digested with trypsin, and the fragments were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry (nano-LC/ES/MSMS). A major phosphopeptide (NLFDMCGIpSEAQLK) was detected; the molecular mass of the peptide showed the 79.96 Da increase from the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide (Fig. 5A). This peptide corresponds to the sequence of mini-WASP from Asn-234 to Lys-247 (numbering as for full-length N-WASP). To directly detect phosphorylation of the single serine residue (Ser-242) within this sequence, the sample was further analyzed with variable collision energy at 30, 40, and 50 eV. Several fragment ions (b11,b12,b13, y11, y12, and y13) with the phospho-moiety were detected in the product ion spectrum obtained at 30 eV of collision energy, confirming the phosphorylation of Ser-242 (Fig. 5A).

Variants in the bacterial sensor domain of NOD2 are genetically associated with an increased risk for the development of Crohn disease, a human chronic inflammatory bowel disease. In the present study, global protein expression changes after MDP stimulation were analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE of total protein extracts of human cultured cells stably transfected with expression constructs encoding for wild type NOD2 (NOD2WT) or the disease-associated NOD2 L1007fsinsC (NOD2SNP13) variant. Differentially regulated proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) peptide mass fingerprinting and MALDI MS/MS. The limited overlap in the responses of the NOD2-overexpressing cell lines to MDP included a down-regulation of heat shock 70-kDa protein 4. A complex pro-inflammatory program regulated by NOD2WT that encompasses a regulation of key genes involved in protein folding, DNA repair, cellular redox homeostasis, and metabolism was observed both under normal growth conditions and after stimulation with MDP. By using the comparison of NOD2WT and disease-associated NOD2SNP13 variant, we have identified a proteomic signature pattern that may further our understanding of the influence of genetic variations in the NOD2 gene in the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.

NOD2 belongs to a growing family of regulatory nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins with a central nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain and N-terminal caspase recruitment domains that are involved in programmed cell death and immune responses. The domain structure consists of two adjacent N-terminal caspase recruitment domains, a central nucleotide binding domain, and 10 C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (1Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). The leucine-rich repeats of NOD2 are homologous to those seen in R proteins and Toll-like receptors, which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, thus enabling an innate cellular response to pathogens.

Upon MDP stimulation, NOD2 has been shown to activate the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) by interacting with the RIP-like interacting CLARP kinase (RICK/RIP2) (4Inohara N. Koseki T.

A frameshift mutation in the leucine-rich repeats of NOD2 (L1007fsinsC, SNP13), which leads to a partial truncation of the leucine-rich repeats in the protein, has been associated with the development of Crohn disease, a human chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory bowel disease (5Ogura Y.

The truncation leads to a decreased MDP responsiveness and subsequent NF-κB activation. Expression of NOD2 sensitizes intestinal epithelial cells to release the chemotactic cytokine IL-8 upon stimulation with bacterial cell wall components (8Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C.

Nod2-/- mice are deficient in epithelial cryptdin expression and exhibit a higher susceptibility to oral Listeria infection (11Kobayashi K.S. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Henegariu O. Inohara N. Nunez G. Flavell R.A. Science. 2005; 307: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). Thus, NOD2 has been implicated as a sentinel in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier against luminal pathogens (12Schreiber S. Rosenstiel P. Albrecht M. Hampe J. Krawczak M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, the complex changes in protein expression subsequent to an activation of NF-κB induced by NOD2 remain to be elucidated. We have addressed this task using a global proteomic approach. HEK293 cells were stably transfected with expression constructs encoding for the wild type form of NOD2 (NOD2WT) or the disease-associated NOD2 L1007fsinsC variant (NOD2SNP13) stimulated with MDP-LD for 4 and 24 h, respectively, and protein extracts were analyzed by two-dimensional GE. Differentially regulated protein spots were detected by a semi-automated digital image analysis system, sampled from the gel, and the contained proteins subsequently were identified by MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting and MALDI-TOF/TOF fragment ion analysis. Results for selected proteins were independently confirmed by immunoblots. The identified proteins were categorized into functional groups, and their implications for pathophysiology of Crohn disease are discussed. Cell Culture and Generation of Stable Transfectants—Human HEK293 and myelomonocytic THP-1 cells were purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany). The cells were cultured in RPMI + 10% fetal calf serum. One day before transfection, the cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/2 ml on 6-well plates. Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's manual, using 1 μg of the indicated plasmid/well. 48 h after the transfection, cells were selected over 4 weeks with 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) to select for stable transfectants. For each plasmid, 24 colonies were picked, after they had reached a diameter of 1 cm, and were assessed for stable expression of the encoded protein by Western blot. To avoid experimental bias from stable plasmid integration, six independent stable clones were pooled per plasmid to generate polyclonal cell lines. For confirmatory experiments, NOD2WT- and NOD2SNP13-expressing cells were generated with the FLP-IN system (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells containing the FRT recombination site were purchased from Invitrogen. Wild type and mutated (SNP13) NOD2 were inserted to the genomic recombination site by FLP recombinase enzyme. A control cell line was generated by transfecting an empty mock vector. All stable cell lines were selected for hygromycin B resistance and consequently cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum + 1% penicillin/streptomycin + 50 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Single colonies were picked and expanded in selection medium. Vector inserts and the genomic DNA context in the selected clones were sequenced to verify the NOD2 sequence and proper integration in the genomic locus. Expression of NOD2 (wild type and SNP13) was monitored by immunoblotting using anti-NOD2 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) antibody. MDP-LD and MurNAc-d-Ala-d-iso-Gln (MDP-DD) were obtained from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland) and applied at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. IL-8 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Supernatants of HEK cell lines stimulated with MDP-LD were collected after 12 h. IL-8 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The results were expressed as picograms of cytokine/5 × 105 cells. Plasmid Constructs—The whole reading frame of NOD2 was amplified from pooled leukocyte cDNAs (MTC panel, Clontech) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid carrying the L1007fsinsC mutation (SNP13) was generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were sequence-verified using an ABI3700 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) prior to use. All primers were purchased from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). Protein Extraction—From five parallel cell cultures for each cell line, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were weighed. Proteins were extracted from the pellets using a modification of the protocol of Klose and Kobalz (13Klose J. Kobalz U. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1034-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In short, the cells were ground in a ceramics mortar cooled in a liquid nitrogen bath, adding the 1.25-fold weight of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.1), 20% (v/v) glycerol (Sigma), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Applied Science). After 5 min of grinding under continued cooling, the homogenates were transferred to fresh vials where they were mixed with urea and thiourea in the ratio 3:2:1 (w/w) under continuous stirring at room temperature for 5 min. After the urea had dissolved, dithiothreitol (700 mm) was added to a final concentration of 70 mm, and the samples were stirred for another 25 min at room temperature. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature, the supernatants were stored at -80 °C until analysis by two-dimensional GE. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Isoelectric focusing was performed with an Ettan IPGphor™ apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) in 24-cm-long IPG strips with nonlinear gradients in the pH range of 3–10 (Amersham Biosciences). Prior to loading, the samples were centrifuged sharply for 30 min (22,000 × g; 25 °C) to remove insoluble aggregates and large organelles. Protein concentrations in the supernatant samples were determined with the two-dimensional Quant kit (Amersham Biosciences). Samples containing 200 μg of protein were diluted to a final volume of 450 μl in a rehydration buffer consisting of 5 m urea (Merck), 2 m thiourea (Sigma), 2% CHAPS, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 0.8% IPG Buffer (pH 3–10) (Amersham Biosciences), and 1 tablet of CompleteMini™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) per 1.5 ml. For reduction and alkylation of cysteines, a one-step method using dithiodiethanol was employed (14Olsson I. Larsson K. Palmgren R. Bjellqvist B. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Dithiodiethanol (Fluka, Germany) was added 20 min prior to starting the isoelectric focusing to a final concentration of 100 mm. The samples were loaded on the IPG strips by rehydration loading, and focusing was performed for 3 h at 30 V, followed by 6.5 h at 60 V. Subsequently, the voltage was increased to 500 V in a gradient over 1 h, and this voltage was maintained for another hour and thereafter increased first to 1000 V and then to 8000 V by a two-step gradient (1 h each). The final voltage of 8000 V was kept for another 7.5 h, providing a total of 60,000 V × h during the 21 h of focusing. After isoelectric focusing, the IPG strips were stored at -80 °C until further use. For second dimension electrophoresis, standard continuous SDS-polyacrylamide gels were cast in Ettan DALTtwelve™ glass cassettes of 255 × 205 × 1 mm (Amersham Biosciences) with a final concentration of acrylamide of 12% (w/v). The acrylamide was obtained as ready (37.5:1) stock solution with 30% (w/v) (Biosolve BV, Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). Gel solutions were prepared with MilliQ water, filtered through 0.45-μm diameter cellulose acetate filters (Corning, NY), and degassed for 10 min before adding UltraPure™ TEMED (Invitrogen) and ammonium peroxodisulfate (Merck). Gels were allowed to polymerize for 3 h at room temperature and for an additional 4–6 days at 5 °C before use. Before loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the IPG strips were equilibrated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation in a solution containing 100 mm dithiodiethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and 30% (v/v) glycerol. Second dimension electrophoresis was performed in an ETTAN DALTtwelve™ chamber (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. When the running fronts were 2 or 3 mm from the lower end of the gel sandwich, the gels were fixed and stained. Colloidal Coomassie staining was performed according to the protocol by Doherty et al. (15Doherty N.S. Littman B.H. Reilly K. Swindell A.C. Buss J.M. Anderson N.L. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). After staining, the two-dimensional gels were rinsed twice with MilliQ water and scanned with an EPSON 1640 XL A3 scanner in the transparency mode (8-bit gray scale). Two-dimensional GE Image Analysis—The gel images were analyzed with the Proteomweaver 2.1 software (Definiens, Germany). After optimization of parameters, spot detection was performed with the following parameters: radius limit of 4, intensity limit of 2,000, and contrast limit of 10. This resulted in detection of 1,450–2,243 spots per gel, with an average of 1,960 spots per gel (from 9 randomly chosen gels). Based on the total protein load, it was estimated that 15–30 ng of protein could be detected reproducibly in one spot. The dynamic range exceeded 173, covering at least a range of 0.015–2.6 μg of protein per spot, corresponding to 0.0075–1.3% of the total protein loaded on the gel. Saturation of staining was not observed, as judged by the optical density distributions of the most dense protein spots. Automatic matching of spots was performed using Proteomweaver with maximum y/x shifts of 800 pixels, a pattern radius of 500 pixels, and a pattern size of 50 pixels. In a number of cases, spot editing and manual matching were required. Following the matching process, pair-match based normalization of data were performed with the Proteomweaver software. First a normalization factor was calculated for each pair of gels as the median of the quotients of the intensities of all matched spots, and from these an intensity factor was computed for each gel, allowing normalization of intensity data. A reliable detection of regulation factors of 1.49 (single-sided regulation) was determined to be possible, if the data from the 500 most intense spots of 9 random pairs of gels were considered (with p < 0.05, from groups comprising 5 gels each). When drawing on the data from the 900 most intense spots, the reliable regulation factor was calculated to be 1.67 (p < 0.05). Consequently, for detection of protein spots with significant up- or down-regulation in any of the comparisons between cell lines or treatments, the minimal regulation factors were set to 1.5 and 0.667, respectively. This requirement was combined with the following settings. First, the gel spot must be detected in at least 4 of 5 gels in one group. Second, the mean intensity in that group was required to be at least 0.05 (arbitrary intensity units). Third, the Student's t test (p < 0.05) was used to filter out statistically insignificant variations in spot densities. It may be pointed out that the average intensities provided by the Proteomweaver software are geometric averages, not arithmetic averages. Clustering analysis and heat maps of differentially regulated proteins were generated using Spotfire Decisionsite 7.2 software (Spotfire, Somerville, MA). Excision and Tryptic Digests of Protein Spots—For handling excised protein spots, 96-well polypropylene microtiter plates (MTPs) (Costar Thermowell, Cornis, NY) were used, and they were pierced in order to allow removal of solutions and recovery of protein digests. The protein spots were excised from the two-dimensional gel at an automatic gel excision work station (Proteineer SP, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) by using an excision tool with a diameter of 1.5 mm. The gel samples containing the protein spots were delivered into the wells of the modified MTPs. In situ tryptic digestion was performed according to Shevchenko et al. (16Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7784) Google Scholar) with some modifications. First, the excised gel plugs were washed three times for 20 min in 100 μl each of washing buffer (50 mm NH4CO3 (pH 8), 50% (v/v) ethanol) and then dehydrated for 5 min with 100 μl of ethanol. Removal of buffers and ethanol between incubation steps was performed by centrifugation of the gel-containing MTPs for 1 min at 1000 × g. The gel pieces were then placed for 15 min in a vacuum centrifuge (Savant, SVC100H) in order to completely remove any remaining liquid. For digestion of proteins, a trypsin solution (Roche Applied Science) containing 10 ng/μl trypsin in 50 mm NH4CO3 (pH 8) was freshly prepared and kept on ice. 4 μl (40 ng of trypsin) of the trypsin solution was added to each gel piece, and these were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, 8-μl volumes of 50 mm NH4CO3 (pH 8) buffer were added to each sample, and the digestion was performed at 37 °C for 4 h. The digestion was stopped by addition of 10 μl of extraction buffer containing 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and 2 mm n-octyl glycopyranoside. The extracted peptides were recovered by centrifugation into fresh MTPs placed under the modified plates. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI sample preparation was performed on MALDI 600–384 AnchorChip sample plates (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) as described previously (17Gobom J. Schuerenberg M. Mueller M. Theiss D. Lehrach H. Nordhoff E. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Nordhoff E. Egelhofer V. Giavalisco P. Eickhoff H. Horn M. Przewieslik T. Theiss D. Schneider U. Lehrach H. Gobom J. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 2844-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A TeMO automatic liquid handler (Tecan, Switzerland) was used to deposit 1-μl aliquots of the tryptic digests onto pre-formed microcrystalline layers of the MALDI matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. After the solvent had evaporated, the samples were briefly washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectra of positive ions in the m/z range 640–4,000 were recorded on an Ultraflex LIFT and a Reflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) operated in the reflector mode using delayed ion extraction. Fragment ion mass spectra of selected peptides, recorded on the MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument, were used for verification of uncertain identification results. Selection of the first monoisotopic signals in the spectra was performed using the signal detection algorithm SNAP implemented in the FlexAnalysis software (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The spectra were calibrated using a recently described procedure (19Gobom J. Mueller M. Egelhofer V. Theiss D. Lehrach H. Nordhoff E. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 3915-3923Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) based on a combination of external calibration (using polyethanolglycol) followed by internal calibration using signals from tryptic autodigestion products (monoisotopic masses (MH+) are as follows: 842.51, 1045.562, and 2211.1045 Da) and two peptide standards (human angiotensin I and human ACTH-(18–39); 1296.6853 and 2465.1989 Da, respectively). The calibrated mass lists were then filtered, removing calibration masses and common contaminants. Protein identification was performed with the MASCOT data base search engine (version 1.8) querying primarily the SwissProt data base (SwissProt www.expasy.org/sprot/) and secondarily the NCBI data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The minimum MOWSE scores used as requirement for identification were 52 for SwissProt searches (setting for organism Homo sapiens) and 66 for NCBI (setting for organism mammalia), corresponding to a statistical significance level of p < 0.005 in both searches. The identification of a protein was considered reliable if it was identified with this level of significance from at least two gels (without conflicting identifications in any parallel gels). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Western blotting was performed as described (9Rosenstiel P. Fantini M. Brautigam K. Kuhbacher T. Waetzig G.H. Seegert D. Schreiber S. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). 15 μg of protein extract was separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking, the membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as secondary antibody. The PDX2 and PDX4 antibodies were purchased from ACRIS (Littleton, CO), TCP-η from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and YB1 from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). The detected proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). siRNA Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Stable FLP-IN HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNAs against PDX4 (Invitrogen Stealth select HSS116212 and HSS116213) or a scrambled control without any homology to known transcripts together with 400 ng of NF-κB reporter plasmid and 100 ng of pRL-TK Renilla reference plasmid by using a standard protocol. 8 h later, transfection medium was replaced with regular cell culture medium. After 24 h MDP was added at the indicated concentration. Luciferase activity was determined after 8 h with a dual luciferase reporter gene kit from Promega according to the manufacturer's manual. The cells lysates were analyzed with a MicroLumatPlus LB96V microplate luminometer (EG & G Berthold, Wellesley, MA) after automatic injection of the necessary substrate solutions. All samples were at least measured in quadruplicates in three independent experiments. The results for firefly luciferase activity were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen. 500 ng of total RNA were reverse-transcribed as described elsewhere (20Waetzig G.H. Seegert D. Rosenstiel P. Nikolaus S. Schreiber S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5342-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Primers used were as follows: NOD2_F, CGT TCT GCA CAA GGC CTA CC, and NOD2_R, TCC ATT CGC TTT CAC CGT G; PDX4_F, CAG CTG TGA TCG ATG GAG AA, and PDX4_R, ATC CTT ATT GGC CCA AGT CC; PDX2_F, GTG TCC TTC GCC AGA TCA CT, and PDX2_R, TGG GCT TAA TCG TGT CAC TG; TCPH_F, CCG AGC AGT TTA TGG AGG AG, and TCPH_R, CAA AGC CAG CAT TGT CAC AC; YB1_F, TGG GCG TCG ACC ACA GTA TT, and YB1_R, GCT GCT GAC CTT GGG TCT CA. For PCR, denaturation was for 5 min at 95 °C; 28 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 58 °C, 60 s at 72 °C; final extension was for 5 min at 72 °C. To confirm the use of equal amounts of RNA in each experiment, all samples were checked in parallel for β-actin mRNA expression. All amplified DNA fragments were analyzed on 1% agarose gels and subsequently documented by a BioDoc Analyzer (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). This study presents for the first time an analysis of the changes in the cellular proteome upon activation of NOD2 by using its ligand, the bacterial cell wall component MDP-LD, as a stimulus. The experimental design is schematically depicted in Fig. 1. The following three stable transfectants of HEK293 cells were used in the study: cells stably overexpressing NOD2WT, cells overexpressing the mutant NOD2SNP13, and mock transfected control cells (mock transfectant) (Fig. 2A). Samples were harvested from five parallel cell cultures under normal growth conditions and 4 and 24 h after the stimulation of the cells by MDP. Protein extracts were analyzed by two-dimensional GE. Transfected HEK293 cells represent an accepted model system for exploration of NOD2 signaling pathways, as the cells normally do not express NOD2 at detectable levels (1Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A.

https://openalex.org/W2011848835,"Expression of decorin using the vaccinia virus/T7 expression system resulted in secretion of two distinct glycoforms: a proteoglycan substituted with a single chondroitin sulfate chain and N-linked oligosaccharides and a core protein glycoform substituted with N-linked glycans but without a glycosaminoglycan chain. In this report, we have addressed two distinct questions. What is the rate-limiting step in glycosaminoglycan synthesis? Is glycosylation with either N-linked oligosaccharides or glycosaminoglycan required for secretion of decorin? N-terminal sequencing of the core protein glycoform, the addition of benzyl-β-d-xyloside, and a UDP-xylose: core protein β-d-xylosyltransferase activity assay show that xylosylation is a rate-limiting step in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis. Decorin can be efficiently secreted with N-linked oligosaccharides alone or with a single chondroitin sulfate chain alone; however, there is severely impaired secretion of core protein devoid of any glycosylation. A decorin core protein mutant devoid of N-linked oligosaccharide attachment sites will not be secreted by Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in xylosyltransferase or by parental Chinese hamster ovary wild type cells if the xylosyltransferase recognition sequence is disrupted. This finding suggests that quality control mechanisms sensitive to an absence of N-linked oligosaccharides can be abrogated by interaction of the core protein with the glycosaminoglycan synthetic machinery. We propose a model of regulation of decorin secretion that has several components, including appropriate substitution with N-linked oligosaccharides and factors involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis.

The extracellular matrix is a complex array of secreted molecules, including collagens, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), 2The abbreviations used are: GAGglycosaminoglycanPGproteoglycanDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCHOChinese hamster ovaryERendoplasmic reticulumXTxylosyltransferaseWTwild typepfuplaque-forming unitsCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMBPmaltose-binding proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: GAGglycosaminoglycanPGproteoglycanDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCHOChinese hamster ovaryERendoplasmic reticulumXTxylosyltransferaseWTwild typepfuplaque-forming unitsCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMBPmaltose-binding proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and a number of glycoproteins (1Hocking A.M.

Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Maintenance of the structural and functional organization of extracellular matrix components requires the correct targeting of proteins to their destinations. This is achieved by the delivery of newly synthesized glycoproteins and proteoglycans via the secretory pathway. Newly synthesized proteins in the secretory pathway encounter several important components such as recognition elements for nascent protein insertion into the ER, molecular surveillance chaperones, endogenous enzyme for post-translational modifications, and routing molecules to deliver the finished protein to the cell exterior (3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar). Mutant proteins with abnormal conformations frequently fail to pass through the secretory pathway. Improperly folded proteins are either retained in the ER lumen until they become properly folded or destined for degradation (4Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The N-linked oligosaccharide moieties of these proteins not only promote folding directly by stabilizing polypeptide structures but also promote folding indirectly by serving as specific recognition structures that allow glycoproteins to interact with a variety of lectins, glycosidases, and glycosyltransferases (4Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 5Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) that in turn affect the folding and secretion of the protein. glycosaminoglycan proteoglycan Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Chinese hamster ovary endoplasmic reticulum xylosyltransferase wild type plaque-forming units 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid maltose-binding protein glutathione S-transferase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. glycosaminoglycan proteoglycan Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Chinese hamster ovary endoplasmic reticulum xylosyltransferase wild type plaque-forming units 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid maltose-binding protein glutathione S-transferase 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. The biosynthesis of GAGs, including chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate is initiated by the sequential addition of four monosaccharides, xylose-galactose-galactose-glucuronic acid, onto targeted serine residues in the core protein. Subsequently, the sugar chains are extended by the addition of two alternating monosaccharides, either N-acetylgalactosamine/glucuronic acid in chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate or N-acetylglucosamine/glucuronic acid in heparin/heparan sulfate on the linker tetrasaccharides. A number of biological functions have been demonstrated for different GAGs through the combination of biochemical and genetic approaches (6Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 7Mizuguchi S. Uyama T. Kitagawa H. Nomura K.H. Dejima K. Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Sugahara K. Nomura K.

The core protein of the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan decorin has three consensus sites for N-linked oligosaccharides and a GAG attachment site. We have previously detected the secretion of recombinant glycosylated decorin but not of a nonglycosylated form using the vaccinia virus expression system (9Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Decorin core protein devoid of a GAG chain has been isolated (10Fleischmajer R. Fisher L.W. MacDonald E.D. Jacobs Jr., L. Perlish J.S. Termine J.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 11Sampaio Lde O. Bayliss M.T. Hardingham T.E. Muir H. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), although it has yet to be demonstrated whether this is due to postsecretory cleavage of the GAG attachment domain or to synthesis and secretion of core protein that by-passes the GAG synthetic machinery. The proportion of secreted decorin core protein devoid of GAG chain is cell type-dependent and inversely proportional to the endogenous activity of UDP-xylose:core protein β-d-xylosyltransferase (XT), the enzyme that catalyzes the first sugar transfer reaction initiating chondroitin sulfate polymerization on a core protein substrate. Previous studies using canine renal tubule (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells have suggested that distinct sets of secretory proteins are released from their apical and basolateral poles and that the chondroitin sulfate chain plays a role for apical sorting and secretion of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (12Caplan M.J. Stow J.L. Newman A.P. Madri J. Anderson H.C. Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. Jamieson J.D. Nature. 1987; 329: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Kolset S.O. Vuong T.T. Prydz K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1797-1801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation may suggest that the GAG chains contain structural determinants for sorting and/or that glycosyltransferases involved in the GAG biosynthesis may have a quality control function on proteoglycan secretion. Structures in the core protein may also affect sorting of the proteoglycan. For example, studies from different groups have shown that a globular domain, G3, in the core protein of aggrecan affects glycosaminoglycan modification and product secretion (14Kiani C. Lee V.

In this report, we have investigated the role of glycosylation in decorin secretion using inhibitors of glycosylation and site-specific deletion mutagenesis combined with overexpression of decorin and decorin mutants in CHO cell lines deficient in specific glycosylation steps. We suggest that xylosylation of the core protein is a rate-limiting step in GAG synthesis. Xylosylation not only is a function of the activity of XT but also affected by the overall structure of the core protein substrate. We also present data that are consistent with a role for either the GAG chain itself or the enzymes involved in GAG synthesis in controlling secretion. We propose a model of regulation of decorin secretion that has several components, including appropriate N-linked oligosaccharide substitution and GAG synthesis. Cell Culture—Cell lines used for virus propagation, titration, and recombinant protein expression were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CV-1, ATCC-CCL70; HeLa, ATCC-CCL2; 143B (Hu TK–), ATCC-CRL8303; UMR 106-01, ATCC-CRL 1661; HT-1080, ATCC-CCL121; CHO K1 (WT), ATCC-CCL61; pgsA-745, ATCC-CRL 2242; pgsB-618, ATCC-CRL2241; pgsC-605, ATCCCRL2245). The cell lines CV-1, UMR 106-01, and HT-1080 were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 20 mm HEPES and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. CHO cell lines, including cell line pgsG-224 generously provided by Dr. Jeffery Esko (University of California, San Diego), were cultured in F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 20 mm HEPES and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cell lines HeLa and 143B (Hu TK–) were cultured in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 20 mm HEPES and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cell cultures were metabolically labeled by including TRAN35S-label (MP Biomedicals) in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen). Mutagenesis of Human Decorin cDNA—The construction of plasmid pDCN1, which drives the expression of full-length human decorin as a polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein, was described previously (9Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This protein has one GAG attachment site at Ser34 and three potential N-linked oligosaccharide attachment sites at Asn211, Asn262, and Asn303. A sequential deletion strategy, whereby each site was deleted in a separate cloning step, was employed to produce the constructs used in the current study. Mutations were generated by specific base changes in the decorin cDNA by the method of strand overlap extension PCR (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar, 19Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar), utilizing synthetic oligonucleotide primers and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Further verification was done by in vitro transcription directly from the plasmid vector with T7 RNA polymerase and translation with a reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of 40 μCi of TRAN35S-label (MP Biomedicals), and reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. pDCN3 is a GAG attachment site deletion. A PCR was done using primer P5 (5′-GGGGCATGCTAGAAGATGAGGCTGCTGGG-3′) containing a SphI site and a Ser34 → Ala mutation, and P2 (5′-CGGAAACTATAAGTAATTCTCTGCAGCCGCGGGGA-3′) containing a SacII site. Using pDCN1 as a template DNA, the resulting PCR product was directly cloned into pT-cam1 at SphI and SacII sites. pDCN4 harbors a single amino acid substitution at Asn211 → Gln. The first PCR step used pDCN1 as template, with primers P2 and P3 (5′-GCATTGCTGATACCCAGATCACCAGCATTCC-3′). The second PCR step used primers P1 (5′-CGGAATCCGAATTCGCCATCGAGGGTAGGGGCATG-3′) and P4 (5′-GGAATGCTGGTGATCTGGGTATCAGCAATGC-3′). The products of the first and second PCRs were combined, and a final PCR product was generated with primers P1 and P2. The PCR product was cloned into pT-cam1 at EcoRI and SacII sites. pDCN5 contains a double mutation, Ser34 → Ala and Asn211 → Gln. The first and second PCRs were identical to that described for pDCN4. The final PCR product was generated with primers P5 and P2. pDCN6 contains a GAG site mutation (Ser34 → Ala) and two N-linked glycosylation site mutations (Asn211 → Gln and Asn262 → Gln). pDCN5 was used as a template for strand overlap extension PCR amplification. The first PCR step was done with primers P6 (5′-CACGAATTCATCATCGAGGGTAGG-3′) and P9 (5′-CGTGTTGGCCAGAGAGCCCTGGTCAACAGCAGAATGC-3′) and the second with primers P7 (5′-CCCGCGGCTGCAGAGAATTACTTATAG-3′) and P8 (5′-GCATCTCTGCTGTTGACCAGGGCTCTCTGGCCAACACG-3′). A third PCR was performed using equal amounts of these products, with primers P6 and P7, and the product was cloned into pT-cam1 at EcoRI and PstI sites. pDCN7 contains two N-linked glycosylation site mutations (Asn211 → Gln and Asn262 → Gln). pDCN6 was digested with SacI and PstI, and the resulting 524-bp fragment containing two N-glycosylation site mutations was isolated. pDCN1 was digested with SacI and PstI, and the deleted 524-bp fragment was replaced with the same fragment from pDCN6 containing the two N-linked glycosylation site mutations. pDCN8 has mutations in all glycosylation acceptor sites, Ser34 → Ala, Asn211 → Gln, Asn262 → Gln, Asn303 → Gln. The first PCR step used pDCN6 as the template, with primers P6 and P11 (5′-GATCCAACTACAGAGATCTGGTTGTTATGAAGGTGAC-3′). In a second PCR, pDCN6 was amplified with primers P10 (5′-GTCACCTTCATAACAACCAGATCTCTGTAGTTGGATC-3′) and P7. These products were combined and a final product amplified with primers P6 and P7. The PCR product was cloned into pT-cam1 using EcoRI and PstI sites. pDCN9 contains three N-linked glycosylation site mutations, Asn211 → Gln, Asn262 → Gln, and Asn303 → Gln. The 524-bp fragment from pDCN1 was deleted using SacI and PstI digestion and replaced with the 524-bp fragment from pDCN8 harboring the three N-linked glycosylation site mutations. pDCN1, pDCN8, and pDCN9 were used to generate recombinant vaccinia viruses for the investigation. Recombinant Vaccinia Viruses—All recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing both wild type human decorin and mutant decorins were generated by homologous recombination between plasmid constructs and wild type vaccinia virus, as described previously (20McQuillan D.J. Seo N.S. Hocking A.M. McQuillan C.I. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 201-219PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant vaccinia virus, vTF7-3, the wild type vaccinia virus strain (WR), and vT7-CP, a recombinant vaccinia virus engineered to express T7 bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase in CHO cell lines (21Ramsey-Ewing A. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16962-16966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), were generously provided by Dr. Bernard Moss (NIAID, National Institutes of Health). Recombinant Decorin Expression and Purification—Recombinant decorin glycoforms were expressed in HT 1080 cells using the vaccinia/T7 bacteriophage expression system. In brief, confluent monolayers of HT-1080 cells were co-infected with vTF7–3 (10 pfu/cell) and vDCN1 (10 pfu/cell). Virus was allowed to adsorb for 2 h at 37°C. At 8 h postinfection, the virus innoculum was replaced with serum-free DMEM. Medium was harvested at 30 h postinfection. To express wild type or mutant decorin, a confluent monolayer of CHO cells (CHO WT, pgsA-745, pgsB-618, pgsG-224, and pgsC-605) was co-infected with vT7-CP (10 pfu/cell) and vDCN1, vDCN8, and vDCN9 (10 pfu/cell). At 8 h postinfection, the virus innoculum was replaced with 100 μCi/well of TRAN35S-label in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM. The culture medium was harvested at 30 h postinfection, and the recombinant decorin was purified. To examine the kinetic effects of glycosylation on secretion, HT 1080 cells were co-infected with vTF7-3 (10 pfu/cell) and vDCN1 and vDCN9 (10 pfu/cell). At 8 h postinfection, cells were starved for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM. Cells were pulsed with TRAN35S-label at 100 μCi/ml for 30 min in the same medium and chased in serum-free DMEM for the indicated times. The media and cell layer were harvested and extracted with 4 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, 0.5% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. Purification of Recombinant Decorin—Conditioned medium was applied to Sephadex G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted with 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% CHAPS to separate macromolecules from unincorporated radioactive precursors. The eluted macromolecular fraction was applied to a 1-ml column of iminodiacetic acid immobilized on Sepharose 6B (Sigma) that had been equilibrated with nickel chloride. After sample application, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of 30 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% CHAPS, and bound material was eluted with 150 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% CHAPS. Fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Fractions containing decorin were pooled and applied to Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter devices (membrane size: Biomax 10; Millipore Corp.) to concentrate the sample, which was then applied to PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) to exchange the solvent to phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% CHAPS. Protein concentrations were determined by the molar extinction coefficient (22Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar). Expression of Decorin and Decorin Fragments in Escherichia coli—The cloning, expression, and purification of full-length decorin as an MBP fusion protein (MBP-decorin), and of a decorin N-terminal peptide as a GST fusion protein (GST-MD4) and the production of the isolated peptide (MD4) have been described previously (23Yang V.W. LaBrenz S.R. Rosenberg L.C. McQuillan D. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12454-12460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE—7.5% polyacrylamide gels were prepared in the buffer system of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar), with a 3.5% polyacrylamide stacking gel. Gels were fixed in 40% (v/v) methanol containing 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and radioactive components were detected by fluorography using AMPLIFY (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tunicamycin Treatment—The addition of N-linked oligosaccharides was inhibited by treatment of cultures with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation. Tunicamycin was dissolved in DMSO at high concentration, such that the final DMSO concentration in cultures did not exceed 0.5% (v/v). An equivalent concentration of DMSO was included in control cultures. CHO WT and pgsA-745 cells were co-infected with vT7-CP (10 pfu/cell) and vDCN1 (10 pfu/cell). At 2 h postinfection, either culture medium alone or medium containing 5 μg/ml tunicamycin was added to each well. At 6 h postinfection, medium was replaced with 100 μCi/ml TRAN35S-label (MP Biomedicals) with or without 5 μg/ml tunicamycin. At 10 h postinfection, the medium and cell layer were harvested and extracted with 4 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, 0.5% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. The macromolecular fraction was separated from unincorporated radioactive precursors by chromatography on Sephadex G-50 columns equilibrated and eluted with 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% CHAPS. The eluted macromolecular fraction was applied to a column of iminodiacetic acid immobilized on Sepharose 6B that had been equilibrated with nickel chloride. After sample application, the column was washed with the application buffer supplemented with 30 mm imidazole, and bound material was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in the same buffer. N-terminal Sequencing of Recombinant Decorin Core Protein—An aliquot of purified recombinant decorin core protein was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and eletrotransferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The core protein was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and the band was excised and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing (Protein Chemistry Core Facility, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Incubation with Benzyl-β-d-xyloside—HT1080 cells were co-infected with vTF7-3 (10 pfu/cell) and vDCN1 (10 pfu/cell). At 8 h postinfection, culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing [35S]sulfate (100 μCi/ml; MP Biomedicals) with or without 1 mm benzyl-β-d-xyloside (a kind gift of Dr. H. Clem Robinson, Monash University, Australia). Control cultures were uninfected or infected with vTF7–3 alone. The medium and cell layer were harvested at 24 h postinfection and extracted with 4 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm NaAc, pH 5.8, 0.5% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. Samples were applied to PD-10 columns to isolate macromolecules, and total [35S]sulfate incorporation into GAG was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Determination of XT Activity—XT activity assays were performed following a protocol previously described with some modifications (25Brinkmann T. Weilke C. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11171-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Campbell P. Jacobsson I. Benzing-Purdie L. Roden L. Fessler J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, HT1080 and pgsA-745 cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C until confluent. Cells were collected and resuspended in a sucrose buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium azide). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 ml of reaction buffer (50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 50 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 5 mm manganese chloride, 0.3% Triton X-100). Cells were extracted by agitation on ice for 10 min, and the protein concentrations of the extracts were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) using the standard microtiter plate protocol. The conditions for the standard XT activity assay were determined by incubating 0.1 μCi of UDP-[14C]xylose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 15 μg of decorin core protein, and 500 μg of tissue extract in a total volume of 100 μl of reaction buffer, varying the temperature, time, and pH. In all activity assays, after incubation at 25 °C for 1 h, the reaction mixture was placed on a glass microfiber filter membrane (GF/F; Whatman International Ltd.) with 100 μl of reaction buffer and 100 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and then allowed to dry completely at room temperature. The membranes were washed for 15 min with 10% trichloroacetic acid and then washed twice for 15 min with 5% trichloroacetic acid and dried at room temperature. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To examine xylose substitution of decorin core proteins, 0.3 μCi of UDP-[14C]xylose and 20 μg of decorin core protein of DCN1 and DCN9 from different CHO mutant cells were added to the 300-μl cell extracts containing XT activity. UDP-[14C]xylose was added to the decorin core proteins without the cell extracts under the same conditions as a control. Cell extracts alone or 0.3 μCi of UDP-[14C]xylose alone were used as controls. All samples were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h, analyzed on SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Detection—CHO cells (CHO WT, pgsA-745, pgsB-618, pgsG-224, and pgsC-605) were co-infected with vT7-CP (10 pfu/cell) alone or in combination with recombinant viruses (10 pfu/cell). Total RNA was extracted at 24 h postinfection using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen), electrophoresed on a 1% (v/v) agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Northern blot analysis was performed using a Northern blotting kit (Ambion). A 442-bp HincII fragment from the human decorin cDNA and 1076-bp mouse β-actin DNA were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a random primer labeling kit (Invitrogen) and used to probe membranes. Hybridization was detected by exposure to x-ray film overnight. Overexpression of Recombinant Decorin Glycoforms and N-terminal Sequencing—We have previously shown the expression of two distinct glycoforms of recombinant decorin by HT1080 cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 bacteriophage expression system (9Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One glycoform is presented as a proteoglycan substituted with a single chondroitin sulfate chain and N-linked oligosaccharides. The second form was composed of a core protein substituted with N-linked glycans but devoid of chondroitin sulfate. The absence of detectable GAG on up to 40% of the secreted decorin could be due to several possibilities, including proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal GAG attachment domain or lack of substitution of the Ser-Gly dipeptide attachment site. Cleavage of an N-terminal peptide would have resulted in a subtle change in apparent molecular weight of the core protein that would be difficult to discern on SDS-PAGE. We now have examined these possibilities by N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the two core protein glycoforms. Confluent HT1080 cells were infected with vTF7–3 and vDCN1 (encoding full-length human decorin) and incubated in the presence of TRAN35S-label for 30 h. The secreted decorin glycoforms were purified, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and fractions enriched in decorin core protein glycoform were pooled (not shown). The decorin core protein pool was further purified by a second metal-chelating chromatography step that included extensive washing with solvent containing 80 mm imidazole to prevent binding of the proteoglycan glycoform, followed by elution of the bound core protein with 250 mm imidazole (Fig. 1a). The eluted decorin core protein migrated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE as a doublet of 45–48 kDa (Fig. 1b) that represents core protein substituted with 2- and 3-N-linked oligosaccharides, respectively (9Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of purified decorin core protein was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. The recombinant decorin core protein doublet was visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1b), and each band of the doublet core protein was excised and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The amino acid sequences of both core protein glycoforms were identical and matched exactly with the predicted sequence for intact recombinant protein (Fig. 1c), demonstrating that the N terminus had not been cleaved. Furthermore, the efficient sequencing through the Ser-Gly GAG"

PBDs are genetically heterogeneous and classified into 13 complementation groups (CGs). CG8 is one of the most common groups and has three clinical phenotypes, including Zellweger syndrome (ZS), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum disease (IRD). We recently isolated PEX26 as the pathogenic gene for PBD of CG8. Pex26p functions in recruiting to peroxisomes the complexes of the AAA ATPase peroxins, Pex1p and Pex6p. In the present work, we identified four distinct mutations in PEX26 from five patients of CG8 PBD including 2 with ZS and 3 with IRD, in addition to 7 mutant alleles in 8 patients in the first report describing the pathogenic PEX26 gene for CG8 PBD. Phenotype-genotype analyses revealed that temperature-sensitive (ts) peroxisome assembly gave rise to a milder IRD in contrast to the non-ts phenotype of the cells from ZS patients. Furthermore, we present several lines of evidence that show that the instability, insufficient binding to Pex1p·Pex6p complexes, or mislocalization of patient-derived Pex26p mutants is most likely responsible for the CG8 PBDs.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the temperature-sensitive (ts) peroxisome biogenesis remain elusive.

Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—CHO pex26 mutant ZP167 cells were transfected with normal or mutant FLAG-PEX26, pCMVSPORT·PEX1-HA, and pCMVSPORT·PEX6-HA. After a 2-day culture at 30 °C, cells were lysed with lysis buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (8Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). FLAG-Pex26p variants were immunoprecipitated using agarose beads conjugated with anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma). The immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Other Methods—Western blot analysis was performed using primary antibodies to HA and a second antibody, donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), or using mouse anti-FLAG antibody and horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). In fibroblasts derived from CG8 patients, ZS GM17398 and IRD GM17399, catalase was detected in a diffused staining pattern at 37 °C (Fig. 1A, panels a and c), indicative of cytosolic localization (8Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). When these cells were cultured at 30 °C for 3 days, catalase and a PTS2 thiolase were observed as punctate-staining structures only in IRD GM17399 fibroblasts (Fig. 1A, panels d and l), suggesting catalase and thiolase were imported to peroxisomes in a ts manner. In contrast, these two enzymes were not imported at 30 °C in ZS GM17398 fibroblasts (Fig. 1A, panels a, b, i, and j). Similar phenotypes were observed in cells from two patients with IRD and one ZS patient (Table 2), in good agreement with our earlier findings (9Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Furuki S. Miyata N. Moser A. Shimozawa N. Moser H.W. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 73: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts from a ZS patient GM16866, showed a milder ts-type import of PTS2 thiolase, but not catalase, hence implying that catalase more reliably reflected the severe ZS phenotype, as in CG1 pex1 ZS patient PBDE-04 (21Tamura S. Matsumoto N. Imamura A. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). PTS1 proteins were detected in peroxisomes in fibroblasts derived from basically all of the CG8 patients at both temperatures, where PTS1-positive particles, peroxisomes, are distinctly less in number in fibroblasts from ZS patients than those in cells from IRD patients (Fig. 1A, panels e–h; Table 2). These findings suggested the less efficient import of PTS1 proteins in cells from the most severe ZS-type PBD patients, consistent with a recent report (18Weller S. Cajigas I. Morrell J. Obie C.

Pex14p was observed in punctate structures representing membrane remnants at both temperatures in all of the CG8 fibroblasts, indicating that import of peroxisomal membrane proteins was normal (Fig. 1A, panels m–p).

Open table in a new tab PEX26 expression restored the impaired import of catalase and thiolase and also enhanced the import of PTS1 proteins in fibroblasts from ZS patient GM17398 (Fig. 1B, panels a–c) and other PBD patients (data not shown). These results suggested that PEX26 was responsible for the defects of peroxisomal matrix proteins in these CG8 patients. Patients with ZS:intG231T—To investigate the cause of the dysfunction of PEX26 in CG8 patients with ZS, we isolated PEX26 cDNA from fibroblasts of ZS GM17398 by means of RT-PCR. One point mutation of nucleotide G231 (the A of the initiator ATG being no. 1) to T was detected from all of the cDNA clones of GM17398 (Fig. 2). G231 is the first nucleotide of an intron between exon 1 and exon 2, and located on a splice site GT-AG. Consequently, introns of various lengths were more likely inserted, thereby rendering the translation of amino acids distinct from normal Pex26p. Therefore, only the N-terminal 77-amino acid sequence was identical with Pex26p. Of 8 clones sequenced, 6 were inserted with a 236-bp intron, and 2 clones were with 58-bp and 650-bp introns, respectively. We named it homozygous mutation PEX26intG231T. Transfection of PEX26intG231T to a CHO pex26 mutant ZP167 defective in import of matrix proteins including those with PTS1 and PTS2 (8Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) did not restore matrix protein import at 37 and 30 °C (Fig. 3B, panels e and j and Table 3), basically reproducing the phenotype of GM17398 fibroblasts. In regard to the PTS1 protein import, the failure of PTS1 protein import in PEX26intG231T-transfected CHO ZP167 cells was consistent with the phenotype of GM17398 fibroblasts showing the reduced level of PTS1 import. Moreover, FLAG-Pex26pintG231T was not detected at 37 °C in ZP167, but was detectable at a very low level when cultured at 30 °C (Fig. 3C, lane 6). These results suggested that the N-terminal 77-residue polypeptide of Pex26p was not functional; readily degraded at normal temperature.TABLE 3Transfection of patient-derived PEX26 to CHO pex26 mutant ZP167PEX26 mutanttsats, common to all of catalase, PTS1, and thiolase (PTS2). catalasePTS1PTS2-EGFP37 °C30 °C37 °C30 °C37 °C30 °C%%%%%%Wild-typeb60-80% cells were complemented by PEX26 transfection; import-restoring activity of PEX26 mutants was represented as a percentage of normal Pex26p.100100100100100100intG231T000500R98W2060708070100L44P00030010P117L03020801080L153V/C861del7010080100100100Co-expression R98W + L44P055305060 P117L + L153V/C861del05090100100100a ts, common to all of catalase, PTS1, and thiolase (PTS2).b 60-80% cells were complemented by PEX26 transfection; import-restoring activity of PEX26 mutants was represented as a percentage of normal Pex26p. Open table in a new tab The RT-PCR product was under the detectable level with the first cycle of PCR of poly (A)+ RNA from fibroblasts of a ZS patient GM16866, consistent with our earlier results (9Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Furuki S. Miyata N. Moser A. Shimozawa N. Moser H.W. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 73: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the second cycle of PCR using the first PCR products resulted in PEX26-related cDNAs. In 7 clones sequenced, any common mutation was not detected. We interpreted this to mean that PEX26 mRNA may be unstable and degraded or the transcription of PEX26 may be defective. Patients with IRD:R98W/L44P—PEX26 cDNA was likewise isolated from fibroblasts of IRD patients, GM17399 and GM17400. Subsequent sequencing revealed a point mutation of nucleotide C to T at position 292 in a codon (CGG) for Arg98, resulting in a codon (TGG) for Trp, termed PEX26R98W (Fig. 2). Of 16 respective clones isolated, 6 clones from GM17399 and 9 from GM17400 showed the same mutation. The remaining 10 and 7 respective clones showed a different point mutation, nucleotide T to C at position 131 in a codon (CTC) for Leu44, resulting in a codon (CCC) for Pro, named PEX26L44P (Fig. 2). Together, we concluded these two patients with IRD are heterozygotes. ZP167 transfected with PEX26R98W showed a moderate and ts phenotype in the import of matrix proteins including PTS1 proteins, catalase, and thiolase (Fig. 3B, panels a and f; Table 3), whereas expression of PEX26L44P showed very low level ts-import of PTS1 proteins and PTS2 thiolase, but no restoration of the impaired catalase import (Fig. 3B, panels b and g; Table 3). FLAG-Pex26pR98W was detected in ZP167 at a lower level at 37 °C compared with normal FLAG-Pex26p and was elevated at 30 °C (Fig. 3C, lane 2). Contrary to this, FLAG-Pex26pL44P was expressed in almost the same amount at 37 °C as the normal Pex26p (Fig. 3C, lane 3). These findings imply that a severe impaired form, Pex26pL44P, is expressed at a higher level than a mild form, Pex26pR98W, in the fibroblasts of the patients, thereby representing the phenotype. Patients with IRD:P117L/L153V+C861del—PEX26 cDNA from fibroblasts of IRD GM17397 was sequenced. Half of the isolated 14 clones showed a point mutation of nucleotide C to T at position 350 in a codon (CCC) for Pro117, resulting in a codon (CTC) for Leu, named PEX26P117L (Fig. 2). In the remaining 7 clones, we identified two mutations: nucleotide C to G at position 457 in a codon (CTT) for Leu153, resulting in a codon (GTT) for Val, plus the one base C deletion at position 861, resulting in a frameshift causing a 78 amino acid sequence distinct from Pex26p (Fig. 2). We termed it PEX26L153V/C861del. Taken together, we concluded that this IRD patient GM17397 was a compound heterozygote for the mutations. PEX26P117L expression restored the import of matrix proteins in a ts manner, as assessed by transfection to pex26 ZP167, where the import of PTS1 and PTS2 proteins was distinct at 30 °C (Table 3). Catalase was slightly imported at 30 °C, but not at 37 °C (Fig. 3B, panels c and h; Table 3). PEX26L153V/C861del was nearly as functional as normal Pex26p in import of catalase as well as PTS1 and PTS2 proteins at both temperatures (Fig. 3B, panels d and i; Table 3). FLAG-Pex26pL153V/C861del was expressed at a very low level at 37 °C and a little higher at 30 °C in ZP167 (Fig. 3C, lane 5). FLAG-Pex26pP117L was detected in a similar level to FLAG-Pex26pR98W, but less than normal Pex26p (Fig. 3C, lane 4). Taken together, these results suggested that the mutation of L153V/C861del is not responsible for the dysfunction of Pex26p, but rather the decrease in the protein stability. It is more likely that in GM17397 fibroblasts a mild form Pex26pL153V/C861del is expressed at a lower level than a severe form Pex26pP117L, together representing the phenotype. In our earlier report (8Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that Pex26p interacts with Pex1p·Pex6p complexes in a Pex6p-dependent manner. To determine whether the mutations identified in PEX26 from CG8 PBD patients affect the Pex26p interaction with Pex1p·Pex6p complexes, we expressed FLAG-tagged Pex26p mutants together with Pex1p-HA and Pex6p-HA in ZP167 cells. FLAG-Pex26p mutants expressed here were all of the variants that we have identified in 13 CG8 PBD patients, including the 5 mutants described above and 5 earlier variants from 8 patients, missense mutants: PEX26G89R, PEX26L45P, and PEX26M1T, and the one base insertion type: PEX26T35insC and PEX26G255insT (9Matsumoto N.

We earlier reported that transfection of PEX26T35insC and PEX26G255insT restored the impaired import of peroxisome matrix proteins in CHO pex26 ZP167 and that PEX26T35insC and PEX26G255insT encoded Pex26p variants only with the normal deduced amino acid sequence at 1–11 and 1–85, respectively (9Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Furuki S. Miyata N. Moser A. Shimozawa N. Moser H.W. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 73: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To assess this finding, we constructed FLAG-PEX26T35insC(PmaCI-NotIdel) and FLAG-PEX26G255insT(PmaCI-NotIdel) in which the 3′-region downstream of the frameshift-induced termination codon (nucleotide position at 340–342) were deleted. Both FLAG-PEX26T35insC(PmaCI-NotIdel) and FLAG-PEX26G255insT(PmaCI-NotIdel) were inactive when expressed in ZP167 cells (data not shown), consistent with the phenotype of fibroblasts from patients, GM07371 and GM16865. FLAG-Pex26p variants were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with antibodies to FLAG and HA. Pex1p-HA and Pex6p-HA were detected in the immunoprecipitates of normal FLAG-Pex26p (Fig. 4A, lane 9), consistent with our earlier observation that Pex1p-HA and Pex6p-HA were co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Pex26p (8Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Pex6p-HA was similarly co-immunoprecipitated with all of the mutant forms of FLAG-Pex26p, except that FLAG-Pex26pM1T co-immunoprecipitated only about 10% level of the Pex6p-HA with normal FLAG-Pex26p (Fig. 4A, lane 13). On the other hand, Pex1p-HA was discernible only at a lower level in the immunoprecipitates of almost all of the Pex26p mutants (Fig. 4, A and B), thereby inferring that the Pex26p mutants less efficiently recruited the Pex1p·Pex6p complexes to peroxisomes. Furthermore, we found that the extent of deficiency in binding to Pex1p correlated well with the complementing activity of Pex26p mutants such as Pex26pR98W and FLAG-Pex26pL153V/C861del giving rise to a moderate activity (Table 3). Pex26p mutants, FLAG-Pex26pT35insC, FLAG-Pex26pG255insT, and FLAG-Pex26pintG231T, encompassed 113-, 113-, and 159-amino acid long sequences that contained only 11, 85, and 77 authentic residues from the N terminus of Pex26p, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3A) (9Matsumoto N.

These mutants barely showed the complementing activity (Table 4), although they bound to Pex1p more efficiently than FLAG-Pex26pL44P and FLAG-Pex26pL45P. FLAG-EGFP-fused Pex26p mutants including Pex26pL45P, Pex26pT35insC, Pex26pG255insT, and Pex26pintG231T, were expressed in CHO-K1 cells and their subcellular localization was determined by EGFP fluorescence. FLAG-EGFP-Pex26p and FLAG-EGFP-Pex26pL45P were detected in punctate staining pattern, in a manner superimposable on Pex14p-positive structures, peroxisomes (Fig. 5, panels a, b, f, and g). In contrast, FLAG-EGFP-Pex26pT35insC, FLAG-EGFP-Pex26pG255insT, and FLAG-EGFP-Pex26pintG231T were discernible in a diffuse staining pattern, indicative of cytosolic localization (panels c–e and h–j), thereby suggesting that these mutants were defective in peroxisomal localization. Other FLAG-EGFP-Pex26p variants, FLAG-EGFP-Pex26pL44P, FLAG-EGFP-Pex26pP117L, FLAG-EGFP-Pex26pM1T, FLAG-EGFP-Pex26pG89R, FLAG-EGFP-Pex26pR98W, and FLAG-EGFP-Pex26pL153V/C861del, were also discernible on Pex14p-positive particles, peroxisomes (Table 4). FLAG-tagged forms of all of these Pex26p mutants were similarly expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Their subcellular localization was consistent with the results using FLAG-EGFP forms, except that FLAG-Pex26pintG231T was apparently unstable, rather degraded, and undetectable (data not shown). In this study, we further verified the genotype-phenotype relationship in fibroblasts derived from CG8 PBD patients. The ts import of catalase was observed only in fibroblasts from patients with the milder form of PBD, IRD, not in those from patients with severe PBD ZS. The assessment of catalase import at 30 °C is more reliable and predictive of the clinical severity between the most severe ZS and less severe NALD and IRD (Tables 2, 3, 4). These results support our earlier findings that the temperature dependence of peroxisome biogenesis reflects the clinical severity of CG8 patients (9Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Furuki S. Miyata N.

Such correlation was observed in fibroblasts from patients of several CGs including PEX1-deficient CG1 (10Tamura S. Okumoto K. Toyama R. Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Osumi T. Kondo N.

Pex1pG843D was unstable at 37 °C, despite normal interaction with its binding partner Pex6p (21Tamura S. Matsumoto N. Imamura A. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 417-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In our earlier reports (8Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat.

In the present work, we identified another 4 different mutated alleles from 5 CG8 patients (Table 2), including the patient GM17398 analyzed by PCR amplification of the RT-PCR product reported in Ref. 9Matsumoto N.

Very recently, these three mutations, L153V/C861del, P117L, and L44P, were also identified (17Steinberg S. Chen L. Wei L. Moser A. Moser H. Cutting G. Braverman N. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 83: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Weller S. Cajigas I. Morrell J. Obie C. Steel G. Gould S.J. Valle D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2005; 76: 987-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We found that the mutations R98W and P117L showed the ts phenotype in the matrix protein import when expressed in pex26 ZP167. The mutations R98W and P117L are more likely responsible for the ts restoration of protein import in cells from 3 IRD patients. Moreover, it is plausible that the stability of another allele PEX26 product affects the phenotype of IRD patient-derived cells. A severe form Pex26pL44P, presumably co-expressed with a milder Pex26pR98W in the fibroblasts of patients, was more stable than Pex26pR98W in ZP167. Likewise, a mild form Pex26pL153V/C861del co-expressed with a severe form Pex26pP117L in patient's fibroblasts was less stable than Pex26pP117L. Such combinations of the mutants likely gave rise to the dysfunction of Pex26p in IRD cells of patients. PEX26intG231T, the mutation identified in a ZS patient GM17398, was completely inactive in transport of matrix proteins including catalase, thiolase, and PTS1 proteins when expressed in ZP167. Its product, Pex26pintG231T, was extremely unstable, reflecting the severe ZS phenotype. In ZS GM16866 fibroblasts PEX26 transcript was difficult to detect by PCR. Therefore, we conclude that these 2 ZS patients have the severe phenotype because of the instability of PEX26 products. Almost all of the mutations in Pex26p, including the 5 mutations identified here and 5 ones in our earlier report (9Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Furuki S. Miyata N. Moser A. Shimozawa N. Moser H.W. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 73: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), were in the N-terminal part of Pex26p (see Fig. 3A), implying that the N-terminal region of Pex26p is crucial for its function. To address the molecular mechanisms underlying the impaired peroxisome biogenesis in CG8 PBDs, we verified the interaction of patient-derived Pex26p with Pex1p·Pex6p complexes by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Several mutants, including FLAG-Pex26pG89R, FLAG-Pex26pL45P, FLAG-Pex26pM1T, FLAG-Pex26pL44P, and FLAG-Pex26pP117L, showed a lower potency to form the ternary complexes with Pex1p and Pex6p, thereby recruiting the Pex6p·Pex1p complexes with very low efficiency. Although Pex6p-HA and a small amount of Pex1p-HA were co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Pex26pL45P, neither Pex6p-HA nor Pex1p-HA was detectable on peroxisomal membranes by cell staining with antibodies (data not shown). These results suggested that localization of Pex6p and Pex1p on peroxisomes requires the formation of ternary complexes. The relationship between the degree of clinical severity and binding ability to Pex1p implies that formation of the ternary complexes and their localizations on peroxisomes are very important for peroxisome biogenesis. Although FLAG-Pex26pT35insC, FLAG-Pex26pG255insT, and FLAG-Pex26pintG231T did not restore the impaired peroxisome biogenesis in ZP167, they were co-immunoprecipitated with Pex1p-HA more efficiently than other FLAG-Pex26p mutants such as FLAG-Pex26pL44P and FLAG-Pex26pP117L. Contrary to this, FLAG-Pex26pT35insC, FLAG-Pex26pG255insT, and FLAG-Pex26pintG231T, with truncation in the C-terminal transmembrane segment, were not localized to peroxisomes. These findings raise several possibilities regarding the relation between Pex26p dysfunction and PBDs. Pex26p may interact with other peroxins and act as a scaffold protein to specify the target of ATPase activity of Pex1p and Pex6p. It is also possible that Pex26p may be involved in regulation of re-localization of Pex5p, including its export step from peroxisomes (15Miyata N. Fujiki Y. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2054641618,"Packaging of double-stranded DNA into bacteriophage capsids is driven by one of the most powerful force-generating motors reported to date. The phage T4 motor is constituted by gene product 16 (gp16) (18 kDa; small terminase), gp17 (70 kDa; large terminase), and gp20 (61 kDa; dodecameric portal). Extensive sequence alignments revealed that numerous phage and viral large terminases encode a common Walker-B motif in the N-terminal ATPase domain. The gp17 motif consists of a highly conserved aspartate (Asp255) preceded by four hydrophobic residues (251MIYI254), which are predicted to form a β-strand. Combinatorial mutagenesis demonstrated that mutations that compromised hydrophobicity, or integrity of the β-strand, resulted in a null phenotype, whereas certain changes in hydrophobicity resulted in cs/ts phenotypes. No substitutions, including a highly conservative glutamate, are tolerated at the conserved aspartate. Biochemical analyses revealed that the Asp255 mutants showed no detectable in vitro DNA packaging activity. The purified D255E, D255N, D255T, D255V, and D255E/E256D mutant proteins exhibited defective ATP binding and very low or no gp16-stimulated ATPase activity. The nuclease activity of gp17 is, however, retained, albeit at a greatly reduced level. These data define the N-terminal ATPase center in terminases and show for the first time that subtle defects in the ATP-Mg complex formation at this center lead to a profound loss of phage DNA packaging.

The purified D255E, D255N, D255T, D255V, and D255E/E256D mutant proteins exhibited defective ATP binding and very low or no gp16-stimulated ATPase activity. The nuclease activity of gp17 is, however, retained, albeit at a greatly reduced level. These data define the N-terminal ATPase center in terminases and show for the first time that subtle defects in the ATP-Mg complex formation at this center lead to a profound loss of phage DNA packaging. In double-stranded DNA bacteriophages and herpes viruses, genome packaging is the fulfillment of viral DNA metabolism and an indispensable step in the assembly of infectious virions. Packaging is initiated by the endonucleolytic cleavage of the newly synthesized concatemeric DNA, which in T4 is a highly branched, head-to-tail polymeric network with very few, if any, ends (1Black L.W. Showe M.K. Steven A.C. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1994: 218-258Google Scholar, 2Black L.W. Annu. Rev.

The cleavage is catalyzed by holoterminase, a nonstructural, multisubunit complex, composed of the small subunit gp16 3The abbreviations used are: gp16-17, and -20, gene product 16, 17, and 20, respectivelyaaamino acid(s)dsDNAdouble-stranded DNAGTglassy, transparentRHround, healthycscold-sensitivespsmall plaquetstemperature-sensitive.3The abbreviations used are: gp16-17, and -20, gene product 16, 17, and 20, respectivelyaaamino acid(s)dsDNAdouble-stranded DNAGTglassy, transparentRHround, healthycscold-sensitivespsmall plaquetstemperature-sensitive.

The cleaved end is linked to the unique dodecameric portal vertex of the empty prohead through specific interactions between the terminase and the portal protein (gp20, 61 kDa). A packaging motor is thus assembled, which drives directional translocation of DNA into the prohead by an ATP-dependent mechanism (4Smith C.A. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C. Nature. 2001; 413: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Following head filling, the terminase 4In the literature, “terminase activity” refers to the endonuclease activity that generates the ends or termini of the packaged dsDNA (2Black L.W. Annu. Rev.

Although this activity has been implicated as the T4 terminase (25Rentas F.J. Rao V.B. J. Mol.

Single molecule packaging studies determined that the phage DNA-packaging motor is the strongest molecular motor measured to date (4Smith C.A. Tans S.J. Smith S.B. Grimes S. Anderson D.L. Bustamante C. Nature. 2001; 413: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Cryoelectron microscopy imaging and atomic structure of phage Phi29 portal are consistent with the symmetry mismatch model, which postulates that the mismatch between the 5-fold viral capsid and 12-fold portal allows an ATP-driven portal rotation that is coupled to DNA translocation (8Hendrix R.W.

Nature. 2000; 408: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) suggested that the subunits of a pentameric ATPase “fire” sequentially, promoting compression and relaxation of the portal, which is coupled to DNA movement. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to experimentally test the portal rotation model and no direct evidence is yet available. Our ultimate goal is to elucidate the biochemical mechanism by dissecting the catalytic transitions of the packaging ATPase and linking them to specific steps in the pathway. Sequence analyses by Mitchell et al. (10Mitchell M.S. Matsuzaki S. Imai S. Rao V.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4009-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) showed that numerous phages encode a common ATPase domain in the N-terminal half of the large terminase protein. Despite a lack of overall sequence similarity, the functional signatures of this ATPase are strictly conserved. Molecular genetics and biochemical evidence implicate this ATPase in DNA packaging. The evidence includes the following: (i) the T4 gp17 alone exhibits ATPase and in vitro DNA packaging activities (11Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Leffers G. Rao V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37127-37136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); (ii) both the activities are stimulated 50-100-fold by the small terminase protein gp16 (12Leffers G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 4618-4623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); (iii) the N-terminal Walker A motif, 161SRQLGKT167, is critical for function and any substitution in the conserved residues results in a loss of stimulated ATPase and in vitro DNA packaging activities (14Rao V.B. Mitchell M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); and (iv) a critical catalytic carboxylate, Glu256, which is involved in the cleavage of the β,γ-phosphoanhydride bond of ATP (15Goetzinger K.R. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), has been identified. The catalytic center of ATPase motors consists of a conserved Walker B signature, which is required to position the ATP-Mg complex in a precise configuration for harnessing the ATP energy (16Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It encodes a critical aspartate preceded by four hydrophobic residues that form a β-strand. Atomic structures and biochemical data show that the carboxylate coordinates with Mg2+ through a water bridge, which is chelated to the β,γ-phosphates of ATP (17Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 18Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Velankar S.S. Wigley D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses suggest that the gp17 sequence 251MIYID255 is a potential Walker B motif (10Mitchell M.S. Matsuzaki S. Imai S. Rao V.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4009-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Davison A.J. Virology. 1992; 186: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Its disposition with an adjacent catalytic carboxylate (Glu256) and other similarities in the region suggested an interesting connection between terminases and superfamily 2 DEAD box helicases (10Mitchell M.S. Matsuzaki S. Imai S. Rao V.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4009-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 20Linder P. Lasko P.F. Ashburner M. Leroy P. Nielsen P.J. Nishi K. Schnier J. Slonimsky P.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Additional Walker-B motifs have also been predicted in T4 and other phage terminases (21Franklin J.G. Mosig G. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 177: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Franklin J. Haseltine D. Davenport L. Mosig G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), but the functional relevance of any of these motifs is unknown. In this study, using a combination of bioinformatics, molecular genetics, and biochemical approaches, we have performed a thorough and rigorous analysis of the functional significance of the 251MIYID255 sequence in the context of its potential involvement in phage DNA packaging. Combinatorial mutagenesis clearly demonstrated that the Asp255 residue is extremely critical for function. Not even a highly conserved glutamate substitution was tolerated. Biochemical analyses using a series of purified mutant proteins revealed that the mutants exhibited defects in ATP binding and lost the gp16-stimulated ATPase and in vitro DNA packaging activities. These data define the N-terminal ATPase catalytic center in gp17. It is remarkable that subtle perturbations in the catalytic pocket, such as an increase of the aspartyl side chain by a single C-C bond resulted in a profound loss of stimulated ATPase and DNA packaging activities. The evidence is compelling to propose that this ATPase is a core component of the phage DNA packaging machine and potentially involved in the ATP energy-coupled DNA translocation mechanism. Additionally, this study also reports the most thorough molecular genetic analysis of the Walker B motif from any ATPase motor, generating the first set of conditionally lethal mutants. Implications of these results for the structure and function of ATPase motors in general are discussed. Bacteria, Phage, and Plasmids—The Escherichia coli P301 (sup-) strain was used for marker rescue and preparation of packaging extracts. The E. coli suppressor strains were kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Miller (UCLA) (24Kleina L.G. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, the tRNA suppressor plasmids for Gly, Ala, Cys, Lys, Glu/Gln, 5It was reported that this mutant glutamate tRNA is charged with glutamine 20% of the time (24Kleina L.G. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Arg, Pro, His, and Phe, were transferred into the genetic background of E. coli BL21(DE3). These strains, for reasons unknown, gave a stronger and more uniform suppression (14Rao V.B. Mitchell M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Rentas F.J. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These and the original suppressor strains were used to rule out any ambiguities in the suppression efficiencies. Phage yields in the packaging reaction mixtures were determined by plating the samples on E. coli NS3529 (26Rao V.B. Thaker V. Black L.W. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The following E. coli strains (Novagen) (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar) were used to transform pET plasmids containing the g17 inserts: (i) BL21, lacks T7 RNA polymerase, nonexpression strain, used for initial transformation of ligation mixtures and long term maintenance of recombinant plasmids; (ii) BL21 (DE3), expression strain, produces significant basal levels of T7 RNA polymerase, used for in vivo terminase lethality assays; (iii) BL21 (DE3) pLys-S, expression strain, produces very low basal levels of T7 RNA polymerase, used for overexpression and purification of gp17, in vivo terminase toxicity, and DNA cleavage assays. Wild-type phage T4, 16am-17Q425am-rIIA(del), 17K166am, 17Q425am, and 17Y253am were prepared in this laboratory. The T7 expression vectors, pET-15b (His tag), and pET-9d (non-His tag) (Novagen) were used for recombinant constructions. Mutagenesis and Clone Construction—A site-specific, PCR-directed, splicing by overlap extension strategy (14Rao V.B. Mitchell M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Kuebler D. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Horton R.M. Hunt H. Ho S. Pullen J. Pease L. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 2643-2654Google Scholar) was used to construct (i) Y253am mutant, (ii) combinatorial mutant libraries at residues Met251, 252IYI254, and Asp255, (iii) D255N,Q,K,H library, and (iv) D255E/E256D double mutant. The four primers and two successive PCRs required to engineer the respective mutation(s) were designed using the basic principles described earlier (14Rao V.B. Mitchell M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Kuebler D. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Horton R.M. Hunt H. Ho S. Pullen J. Pease L. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 2643-2654Google Scholar). The combinatorial libraries consisted of all possible nucleotide combinations at the mutant site. The g17 end primers consisted of the BamHI restriction site. Amplifications were carried out using the purified wild-type phage T4 DNA as a template and the high fidelity “TaqPlus Precision” DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The amplified mutant g17 DNA having BamHI ends was digested with BamHI and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis using a Qiaquick spin column protocol (Qiagen). The mutant DNA was ligated with the BamHI-linearized and dephosphorylated pET-15b vector. The ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21, and ampR colonies were selected. The Y253am mutation was transferred into phage by recombinational marker rescue (14Rao V.B. Mitchell M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Goetzinger K.R. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The suppression pattern was determined using the two sets of suppressor strains mentioned above. In addition, two control amber phages (17-K166am and 17-Q425am), whose suppressor patterns were well established by earlier studies (14Rao V.B. Mitchell M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), were used for comparison. Combinatorial mutant libraries were screened using the amber mutant phages, Y253am and K166am (control; for some experiments, Q425am was used), and the phenotypes were scored according to the procedures described earlier (14Rao V.B. Mitchell M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Goetzinger K.R. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). More than one independent phage mutant/plasmid clone were sequenced to confirm the mutant phenotype. 6All of the mutants constructed in this study were sequenced to confirm/identify the DNA sequence at the mutant site. In many cases, more than one independent phage/clone was sequenced, and the phenotypes were confirmed to eliminate the possibility of any second site mutations. For overexpression and purification of mutant proteins, the inserts in the right orientation with respect to the T7 promoter were selected. The g17 end primers were designed so that cloning in the right orientation would fuse the N-terminal hexahistidine tag sequence (25 aa) in frame with gp17. Following marker rescue, the orientation of the g17 insert was tested, and the clones with the right orientation were directly used for overexpression and purification of the His-tagged gp17 by nickel affinity chromatography. Incorrectly oriented inserts were excised with BamHI and religated into pET-15b, and clones with the right orientation were selected. Non-His-tagged recombinants were constructed by subcloning the mutant g17 into the NcoI site of pET-9d vector, which does not have a hexahistidine sequence. The mutant DNA was amplified using g17 end primers containing the NcoI tags. The clones having the insert in the right orientation were isolated and induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to overexpress the mutant proteins in the non-His-tagged format. Standard Procedures—Transformations were performed either by the CaCl2 method or the electroporation method. The orientation of g17 insert DNA was determined by restriction enzyme analysis, using BglII or XbaI. DNA sequencing was done using the Fentamole cycle sequencing kit (Promega) or the Thermo Sequenase Cycle Sequencing Kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Overexpression of g17 mutants and SDS-PAGE was performed according to Studier et al. (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). Wild-type gp17 and the D255 mutants were purified according to Leffers and Rao (12Leffers G. Rao V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37127-37136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In vitro DNA packaging, ATPase, in vivo nuclease toxicity, and DNA cleavage assays were performed according to the procedures described earlier (12Leffers G. Rao V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37127-37136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Kuebler D. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Azido-ATP cross-linking was done according to Suana et al. (30Suana Z.E. Müller M. Peng X-H. Ambudkar S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13989-14000Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Sequence Analyses—The Walker B aspartate in ATPases is commonly located 50-130 residues downstream of the Walker A lysine (31Yoshida M. Amano T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), although in rare cases it can be as close as 27 residues (superfamily 3 helicases) (32Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) or as far away as 750 residues (Rad50) (33Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) downstream of the Walker A lysine. Two Walker B motifs have been proposed in gp17: 251MIYID255 (10Mitchell M.S. Matsuzaki S. Imai S. Rao V.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4009-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Davison A.J. Virology. 1992; 186: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and 463GVSVAKSLYMD473 (21Franklin J.G. Mosig G. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 177: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Franklin J. Haseltine D. Davenport L. Mosig G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments show that only the G and D residues of the latter are conserved among the T4 family terminases; more importantly, the Walker B Asp473 is 307 residues downstream of the Walker A lysine (Lys166) and preceded by a predicted α-helix, not a β-strand. These do not satisfy the basic features of the classic Walker B motif (20Linder P. Lasko P.F. Ashburner M. Leroy P. Nielsen P.J. Nishi K. Schnier J. Slonimsky P.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 31Yoshida M. Amano T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Asp255 residue is 89 aa downstream of the Walker A lysine; it is preceded by four hydrophobic residues that are predicted to form a requisite β-strand (Fig. 1). Furthermore, it is followed by catalytic glutamate (Glu256) (15Goetzinger K.R. Rao V.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), a key feature of Walker B from DEAD box helicases (20Linder P. Lasko P.F. Ashburner M. Leroy P. Nielsen P.J. Nishi K. Schnier J. Slonimsky P.P. Nature. 1989; 337: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Alignments of more than 200 phage and viral large terminase sequences from the data base support the above analyses (Table 1; data not shown). The terminases show a striking conservation of the putative Walker B motif, which is typically found 80-100 residues downstream of the Walker A motif. These analyses also brought to light novel Walker B deviants. In Deviant I, the aspartate is replaced by glutamate, and in Deviant II it is replaced by serine; in Deviant III, the adjacent catalytic carboxylate is replaced by an aspartate. Perhaps the most interesting one shows “swapping” of Walker A serine and Walker B aspartate (phage VP2, last line under Deviant II; Table 1). Deviants of the Walker A motif have also been reported (34Mitchell M.S. Rao V.B. Virology. 2004; 321: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Table 1), but no linkage is evident with regard to the association of particular Walker A and Walker B deviants.TABLE 1Novel and deviant Walker B motifs in large terminase proteins The conserved aspartate and catalytic glutamate in the classic Walker B motif are shown in purple. In the Deviant I and II Walker B motifs, the conserved aspartate is replaced with glutamate (blue) and serine (red), respectively. In the Deviant III motif, the conserved catalytic glutamate is replaced with aspartate (green). The deviant Walker A motifs (Deviant I, blue; Deviant II, red; Deviant III, green) have been reported earlier (34Mitchell M.S. Rao V.B. Virology. 2004; 321: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These are included here in relation to the Walker B deviant motifs. Note the unique deviant in phage VP2 (last line under Deviant II), which shows swapping of the conserved Walker A serine and Walker B aspartate.

Open table in a new tab Suppressor-based Mutagenesis of Residue Tyr253—In order to perform combinatorial mutagenesis, it is necessary to first construct an amber mutation within (or very close to) the putative Walker B motif (14Rao V.B. Mitchell M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The Tyr253 residue, which is flanked by sequences that are favorable for efficient amber suppression (24Kleina L.G. Miller J.H. J. Mol.

As summarized in Fig. 2A, the 17Y253am mutation was suppressed by the native Tyr as well as Phe, Gln, Glu/Gln5, His, Leu, Cys, and Ser suppressors, but not by the Gly, Pro, Ala, Lys, or Arg suppressors. These data and secondary structure predictions (Fig. 2B) suggest that three features of the Walker B motif are important for function ((i) integrity of the β-strand, (ii) hydrophobicity, and (iii) electronic environment), because a break in the predicted β-strand in mutants Y253G and Y253P, reduced hydrophobicity in the mutant Y253A, or introduction of a charged/polar side chain in mutants Y253K and Y253R, respectively, resulted in a loss of function. These results are consistent with the data from combinatorial mutagenesis experiments (see below). Combinatorial Mutagenesis of 252IYI254 Sequence—A mutant library was constructed, wherein the 252IYI254 sequence was replaced by all possible codon combinations. Of several hundred random mutants screened by marker rescue using the Y253am mutant, only six functional phenotypes were recovered (Fig. 3A). It is striking that all functional mutants retained hydrophobicity, β-strand structure, and no charged aa. On the other hand, all of the null mutations disrupted one or more of these features, most of them interfering with the integrity of the predicted β-strand (Fig. 3B). Further phenotypic analysis revealed that the LAL mutant produces small to minute plaques at 37 °C (sp phenotype), and the SYV mutant was defective at 42 °C (ts phenotype). To determine which of the combinations (I252S, I254V, or both) is required for the ts defect, a rare “suppressor” mutant showing the wild-type phenotype was isolated from the SYV phage stock and sequenced. Phage in this plaque retained the I254V substitution, but the I252S mutation was reverted to the wild-type Ile residue. Thus, decreased hydrophobicity due to I252S substitution is responsible for the ts phenotype, although a contribution from the I254V mutation cannot be completely excluded. Mutagenesis of Residue Met251—The importance of the Met251 residue, which is situated at the beginning of the Walker B β-strand, was tested by combinatorial mutagenesis. Of the 59 mutants analyzed, 44 (74.5%) were functional. DNA sequencing revealed that Arg, Glu, or Pro, substitution resulted in a null phenotype (Fig. 4). Three double mutants were also recovered; of these, two mutants, A250V/M251G and M251T/F259L, showed the cs phenotype and the third mutant, A250T/M251G, showed a null phenotype. These data reaffirm the importance of hydrophobicity, β-strand structure, and the negative impact of the charged substitutions. The Asp255 Residue Is Critical for Function—Of the 269 combinatorial mutants tested, only five (1.9%) exhibited a functional phenotype. Since there are two codons for aspartate (3.1% of the total triplet combinations"

Here we have mapped the interaction domain between human FGF-BP1 and FGF-2. For this, we generated T7 phage display libraries of N-terminally and C-terminally truncated FGF-BP1 fragments that were then panned against immobilized FGF-2. From this panning, a C-terminal fragment of FGF-BP1 (amino acids 193-234) was identified as the minimum binding domain for FGF. As a recombinant protein, this C-terminal fragment binds to FGF-2 and enhances FGF-2-induced signaling in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and GM7373 endothelial cells, as well as mitogenesis and chemotaxis of NIH-3T3 cells. The FGF interaction domain in FGF-BP1 is distinct from the heparin-binding domain (amino acids 110-143), and homology modeling supports the notion of a distinct domain in the C terminus that is conserved across different species. This domain also contains conserved positioning of cysteine residues with the Cys-214/Cys-222 positions in the human protein predicted to participate in disulfide bridge formation.

FGF-1 (acidic FGF) and FGF-2 (basic FGF) are the best studied members of this family. FGF-1 and -2 are tightly bound to the extracellular matrix, and FGF-2 is a relatively abundant protein in numerous adult tissues, from which it can be extracted as a biologically active growth factor (2Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the extracellular matrix, FGF-1 and -2 interact with low affinity heparan sulfate proteoglycans and remain in a latent state until they are released to bind to their high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs) and elicit their biological activities (reviewed for example in Refs 5Powers C.J.

Vice versa, locally stored FGFs can be released from the extracellular matrix by digestion of the heparan sulfate chains or proteoglycan protein core by heparinases and proteinases, respectively (9Damon D.H.

Physiol. 1989; 138: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). An alternative mode of release of FGFs involves binding to a secreted FGF-binding protein (FGF-BP) that was initially described by Wu et al. (11Wu D.Q. Kan M.K. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a low affinity heparin-binding protein isolated from human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. FGF-BP has been shown to bind to FGF-1 and -2 in a non-covalent, reversible manner. A related protein designated FGF-BP2 has recently been identified by our laboratory (5Powers C.J. McLeskey S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar), and we will thus refer to the original protein as FGF-BP1. FGF-BP1 is expressed below the level of detection by Northern blotting in normal adult human tissues, whereas its expression is significantly elevated in various tumor cell lines and tumor tissues (12Czubayko F.

On the other hand, overexpression of FGF-BP1 in human tumor cells induces highly vascularized xenograft tumors in athymic nude mice (12Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol.

To localize the interaction interface between FGF-2 and FGF-BP1 and gain further insight into the mechanism of action of FGF-BPs, we sought to identify a minimum interaction domain of FGF-BP1 that can retain the interaction with FGF-2 using a T7 phage display/panning system. Phage display combinatorial libraries have become invaluable tools for the identification of novel peptides or protein fragments from libraries, and the approach has been applied successfully to the selection-interacting peptide or protein ligands for antibodies (26Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar), FGFR (27Ballinger M.D. Shyamala V. Forrest L.D. Deuter-Reinhard M. Doyle L.V. Wang J.X. Panganiban-Lustan L.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The most commonly used vectors are based on filamentous phage M13 (31Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). However, in M13 display, all components of the phage particle need to be exported through the bacterial inner membrane before phage assembly; thus, only protein that can be exported can be displayed on the M13 phage. Recently, phage display vectors based on lytic phage T7 have been developed (32Novagen T7Select System Manual (TB178). Novagen Inc., Madison, WI2000Google Scholar). Since T7 phage assemble within the cytoplasm, there is no need for protein export, thus eliminating the issue of an incomplete representation of a protein library on the phage surface. In the present study, we mapped the interaction domain(s) between FGF-BP1 and FGF-2 using this T7 phage display system. We found that FGF-BP1-expressing phage bind to immobilized FGF-2 and that the FGF-BP1-expressing phage can be enriched by biopanning against immobilized FGF-2. From biopanning of phage libraries that contained different length fragments of FGF-BP1, we found that phage containing a short C-terminal fragment of FGF-BP1 bind to immobilized FGF-2. To rule out the possibility that phage portions are required for this interaction, a recombinant fusion protein containing the C-terminal fragment of FGF-BP1 and maltose-binding protein (Malt) was generated and found to bind to immobilized FGF-2 in steady-state and in kinetic studies using surface plasmon resonance. Also, FGF-2 signaling and biologic effects were enhanced. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal domain from FGF-BP1 abolished its binding to FGF-2. Homology modeling supported these results and showed that the C-terminal residues of FGF-BP1 can form a stable domain that is sufficient for its binding to FGF. Cell Culture—NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum.

Generation of FGF-BP1-expressing Phage—The human FGF-BP1 open reading frame (nucleotides 199-799) cDNA was ligated into the T7select 10-3b vector at EcoRI and HindIII sites. Phage packaging, amplification, and titration were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (32Novagen T7Select System Manual (TB178). Novagen Inc., Madison, WI2000Google Scholar). Binding of Phage to Immobilized FGF-2—Human recombinant FGF-2 (0.5 μg, Invitrogen) was diluted in 100 μl of Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and incubated overnight in 96-well plates. (EIA/RIA strip plate; Corning Inc., Corning, NY) at 4 °C. Excess unbound FGF-2 was removed by washing the wells twice with TBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked by the addition of 300 μl of LB medium (Bio 101, Carlsbad, CA) to the wells for 1 h at room temperature. Phage expressing FGF-BP1 or control empty phage (100 μl) were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound phage were removed by washing the wells five times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The bound phage were rescued by adding 100 μl of host bacteria BLT5403 (A600 at 0.6-0.8) to the wells followed by a 10-min incubation. The titer of the rescued phage was determined as described above (32Novagen T7Select System Manual (TB178). Novagen Inc., Madison, WI2000Google Scholar). In addition, an aliquot was amplified for the next round of biopanning. For biopanning, rescued phage solution was added to 5 ml of host bacteria with 50 μg/ml penicillin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The amplified phage was then added to a well coated with FGF-2 for the next round. The procedure was repeated several times as indicated in the respective figures. In the competition assays, different amounts of FGF-2 or EGF were preincubated with the phage for 30 min prior to addition to the wells. Construction of Libraries Expressing Different Size Fragments of FGF-BP1—The deletion libraries were generated using “Erase-a-Base” (Promega, Madison, WI) from the 5′ or 3′ end of the FGF-BP1 open reading frame in a pSP72 vector (Promega). For the 5′ deletion library, BamHI was used to generate the 5′ overhang, which is susceptible to exonuclease III treatment, whereas KpnI generated a 3′ overhang to protect the backbone. For the 3′ deletion library, NotI and ApaI restriction sites were introduced into pSP72-FGF-BP1 with NotI close to the 3′ end of FGF-BP1. NotI was used to generate the 5′ overhang, which is susceptible to exonuclease III treatment, whereas ApaI generated a 3′ overhang to protect the backbone. Exonuclease III was added at 20 °C with an estimated erasing rate at around 90 bp/min. Enzymatic digestion of plasmids was stopped at 30-s intervals. Digested plasmids were then pooled, religated, and cloned at the EcoRI and HindIII sites into the phage 10-3b vector (see Fig. 1a). In vitro packaging generated the stock library solution, which was then used for biopanning. To generate phage expressing a C214A mutant of FGF-BP1, the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate a mutation of cysteine 214 (TGT) to alanine (GCT). Phage packaging, amplification, and titration were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR Amplification of Plaques—5 μl of phage solution or a portion of top agarose of an individual plaque of interest were scraped by a pipette tip, dispersed in a tube containing 50 μl of 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and heated at 65 °C for 10 min. The phage lysate served as a template in a PCR reaction with primers 5′-GGAGCTGTCGTATTCCAGT-3′ and 5′-TTGGGGAGTTCTGGGCAAAT-3′ (Novagen). PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min followed by 35 cycles (95 °C for 50 s, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min) and final extension at 72 °C for 6 min. 20 μl of the reaction product was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. For sequencing, the band of interest was excised, and DNA was purified by gel extraction (Qiagen). Generation of a Recombinant Fusion Protein Containing the C Terminus of FGF-BP1—The pMAL protein fusion and purification system (New England Biolabs) was used for production of a fusion protein with Malt released into the periplasm of bacteria, using the pMAL-p2 expression vector. The cDNA coding for the C-terminal 42 amino acids of FGF-BP1 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pMAL-p2 vector. Culture of transformed cells was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, leading to the expression of a 43-kDa fusion protein that reacts with anti-MBP antibodies (for example, see Fig. 3a). The respective fusion protein was purified from the bacterial periplasm by affinity chromatography on an amylose column. Commassie Blue Staining and Western Blot Analysis—10 μl of recombinant Malt-BP1 protein were resuspended with 5× Laemmli buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and separated by electrophoresis on a 10% gradient polyacrylamide gel. The protein was then detected by Coomassie Blue or silver staining. For immunoblotting, the fusion protein was detected with a rabbit anti-Malt antibody (New England Biolabs) that was then visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection using horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit as the secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Binding of Radiolabeled FGF-2 to Different Immobilized FGF-BP1 Fragments—100 ng/ml recombinant fusion protein containing the 42-amino-acid C terminus of FGF-BP1 (Malt-BP1) or of other proteins as indicated in the figures were diluted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and incubated overnight in 96-well plates (EIA/RIA strip plate, Corning Inc.) at 4 °C with constant rocking. Excess unbound fusion protein was removed by washing the wells twice with TBS. 125I-FGF-2 (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the wells followed by washing and measuring the bound radioactivity as described (24Tassi E.

Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Assay—Biacore 1000 (Biacore AB) and BIAeval (version 4.1, Biacore AB) were used for surface plasmon resonance measurements and kinetic analysis, respectively. Human recombinant FGF-2 in HEPES-buffered solution (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) was immobilized on a CM-5 sensor chip (research grade, Biacore AB) via amine coupling. An inactivated blank channel was used as a control for nonspecific binding to the sensor surface and the 42-amino-acid human N-terminal FGF-BP1 fragment fused with Malt (see above) or FGF-BP1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for the positive read-out. Different concentrations of either of the latter proteins in HEPES-buffered solution with 0.1% bovine serum albumin as a carrier were used in the throughput, and dissociation constants were calculated from the association rates and dissociation rates of the proteins after the wash-out. Furthermore, steady-state binding at the different concentrations was analyzed by non-linear regression analysis for a single binding isotherm as described earlier (28Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Binding experiments were performed at 25.0 °C in HEPES-buffered solution. Phosphorylation Studies—50% confluent NIH-3T3 or GM7373 cells were serum-deprived overnight, treated with FGF-2 (Invitrogen) ± recombinant fusion protein containing the C terminus of FGF-BP1 for 5 or 10 min, respectively, and then analyzed for the induction of MAPK phosphorylation. Detection of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and actin from total cell lysates was carried out as described earlier (24Tassi E. Al-Attar A. Aigner A. Swift M.R. McDonnell K. Karavanov A. Wellstein A. J. Biol.

Proliferation Assay—Proliferation assays of NIH-3T3 cells were conducted as described earlier (24Tassi E. Al-Attar A. Aigner A. Swift M.R. McDonnell K. Karavanov A. Wellstein A. J. Biol.

In brief, cells were treated for 48 h with FGF-2 (1 ng/ml) (Invitrogen) ± recombinant 42-amino-acid C-terminal FGF-BP1 or recombinant FGF-BP1 at 6 ng/ml (R&D Systems), and the proliferation rate was evaluated by WST-1 assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotaxis was measured in a modified 96-well Boyden chamber using polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size, Neuroprobe Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) coated with fibronectin (50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) as described in Ref. 35Le Stunff H.

Briefly, different concentrations of human recombinant FGF-2 ± recombinant FGF-BP1 (6 ng/ml) (R&D Systems) or recombinant Malt-BP1 C-terminal fragment (6 ng/ml) were added to the lower chamber, and NIH-3T3 cells (1 × 105/well) were added to the upper chamber. After an 18-h incubation, non-migratory cells on the upper membrane surface were mechanically removed with a cotton swab, and the cells that traversed and spread on the lower surface of the filter were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik (VWR Scientific Products, Buffalo Grove, IL). Stained migratory cells were solubilized by dissolving individual well areas in 200 μl of 0.1% citric acid/50% ethanol solution for 30 min at room temperature. Optical density of these solutions was read in a Bio-Rad Ultramark spectrophotometer at 630 nm. Computer-assisted Homology Modeling—A Profile Library Search (FUGUE search; v2.s.07 (36Shi J.

Using the alignment from FUGUE, the model three-dimensional structure of the FGF-BP1 fragment was calculated using SWISS-MODEL (39Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

Non-linear regression analysis was applied in the calculation of the apparent Kd from the steady-state binding data (Fig. 4b) using an equation describing a single site binding isotherm (B = Bmax/(L + Kd) as described previously (28Stoica G.E.

FGF-BP1-expressing Phage Bind to FGF-2—Previously, we had demonstrated that FGF-1 and -2 bind to recombinant human FGF-BP1 with similar affinity and demonstrated by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry that recombinant human FGF-BP1 protein can specifically recognize FGF-2 even when present at low abundance in a protein mixture (24Tassi E.

Here we sought to identify the FGF-interacting domain of FGF-BP1, and we adapted the T7 phage display system for this since that would afford systematic mutational analysis of protein-protein interaction without having to generate and purify different recombinant protein fragments for functional analysis. First, we examined whether FGF-BP1 binds to FGF-2 in the T7 phage display system. For this purpose, we inserted the coding sequence of the mature, secreted portion of the human FGF-BP1 protein (amino acids 35-234; see Fig. 7a) into the 10-3b vector of T7 phage and verified this by PCR with primers flanking the insertion site and sequencing of the insert (Fig. 1, a and b). In contrast to control phage, FGF-BP1-expressing phage bind to immobilized FGF-2 and preincubation with FGF-2 reduced binding to FGF-2, whereas a negative control protein, EGF, did not (Fig. 1, c-e). Furthermore, FGF-BP1-expressing phage, diluted 20-fold by a control phage, were recovered and purified after biopanning against immobilized FGF-2 over three rounds (not shown). Thus, we established an approach to monitor FGF interaction with FGF-BP1 by expressing the binding protein in a phage vector. A C-terminal Fragment of FGF-BP1 Is Sufficient for FGF-2 Binding—To map the interacting domain between FGF-BP1 and FGF, we generated a library of phage that expressed different size fragments of FGF-BP1. For this, exonuclease III digestion of the FGF-BP1 cDNA contained in a plasmid vector either from the 5′ end or from the 3′ end was run for different time intervals, and the resulting fragments were pooled and then cloned into the phage vector to generate two distinct libraries. FGF-BP1 fragments resulting after different time intervals of exonuclease digestion from the 5′ end and the pooled fragments used for subcloning into the phage vector are shown as a representative example in Fig. 2, a and b. The N- and C-terminal deletion libraries were panned repeatedly against immobilized FGF-2, and the phage recovered from the panning were screened for inserts using PCR with primers flanking the inse"

Their importance in cellular processes is underscored by their conservation across all forms of life. Here, we describe a new form of clamp loader from the archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans. Unlike previously described archaeal clamp loaders, which are composed of one small subunit and one large subunit, the M. acetivorans clamp loader comprises two similar small subunits (M. acetivorans replication factor C small subunit (MacRFCS)) and one large subunit (MacRFCL). The relatedness of the archaeal and eukaryotic clamp loaders (which are made up of four similar small subunits and one large subunit) suggests that the M. acetivorans clamp loader may be an intermediate form in the archaeal/eukaryotic sister lineages. The clamp loader complex reconstituted from the three subunits MacRFCS1, MacRFCS2, and MacRFCL stimulated DNA synthesis by a cognate DNA polymerase in the presence of its sliding clamp. We used site-directed mutagenesis in the Walker A and SRC motifs to examine the contribution of each subunit to the function of the M. acetivorans clamp loader. Although mutations in MacRFCL and MacRFCS2 did not impair clamp loading activity, any mutant clamp loader harboring a mutation in MacRFCS1 was devoid of the clamp loading property. Mac-RFCS1 is therefore critical to the clamp loading activity of the M. acetivorans clamp loader. It is our anticipation that the discovery of this unique replication factor C homolog will lead to critical insights into the evolution of more complex clamp loaders from simpler ones as more complex organisms evolved in the archaeal/eukaryotic sister lineages.

As the molecular complexes that switch DNA polymerases from distributive to processive DNA synthesis, clamp loaders are critical to the evolution of large genomes. Replicative DNA polymerases are incapable of de novo DNA synthesis. Therefore, they require initial synthesis of primers by a specialized protein called DNA primase. After playing its role, the primase is displaced by a clamp loader, which couples ATP hydrolysis to loading of a ring-shaped sliding clamp onto the DNA template (1Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1999; 96: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Through physical interaction with its cognate DNA polymerase, the sliding clamp enables the polymerase to achieve the high speed DNA synthesis required for replication by tethering the polymerase onto the template (2Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The critical functions of sliding clamps and clamp loaders are underscored by their conservation across the three domains of life and also in bacteriophage such as T4 phage (3Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).

Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The four RFCS proteins are very similar in amino acid sequence, and although they seem redundant, each subunit is essential for cell proliferation (5Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Previous analyses have shown that archaeal clamp loaders are related to their eukaryotic functional homologs. However, all hitherto reported archaeal clamp loaders comprise one RFCS subunit and one RFCL subunit (6Cann I.K.O Ishino Y. Genetics. 1999; 152: 1249-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kelman Z.

Interestingly, in the archaeal clamp loaders, the single RFCS subunit oligomerizes to mimic the four different RFCS subunits in eukaryotes (8Pisani F.M. De Felice M. Carpentieri F. Rossi M. J. Mol.

The striking similarities among the eukaryotic RFCS proteins suggest that they evolved from a single ancestral gene. However, evidence for how this might have occurred has been elusive. Our effort to systematically assemble the proteins required for replicating the genome of Methanosarcina acetivorans, a mesophilic species of Archaea, has led to several findings of interest to evolution of DNA replication proteins in the archaeal/eukaryotic sister lineages (13Cann I.K.O Komori K.

Here, we present the results from biochemical and mutational analyses of an unusual clamp loader found in Methanosarcinales. This clamp loader type (composed of two RFCS subunits and one RFCL subunit) may represent a critical link in the evolution of complex clamp loaders from simple forms in the archaeal/eukaryotic sister lineages. In addition to the RFC complex, each subunit of the methanosarcinal RFC homolog was expressed as an individual protein and biochemically characterized. Furthermore, we used mutational analysis of residues involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis to study the contribution of each subunit to the function of the M. acetivorans clamp loader. Nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are critical to loading of the sliding clamp by the clamp loader. Clamp loaders are members of the AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) ATPase family, and their ATP-binding sites are located at subunit interfaces (10Oyama T. Ishino Y. Cann I.K.O Ishino S. Morikawa K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J.

Critical to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in these proteins are the P-loop (Walker A motif) and an SRC motif from an adjacent subunit (11Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J.

The organisms in which the clamp loader type described in this report is found are quite interesting among the species of Archaea. Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 harbors a genome of ∼2.0 Mb in size, and in addition, it has two large extrachromosomal replicons of 350 and 200 kb (18Ng W.V. Kennedy S.P. Mahairas G.G. Berquist B. Pan M. Shukla H.D.

Biosci. 2001; 6: 262-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery of this new form of RFC in these organisms is of major importance, as further biochemical and genetic analyses may provide us with critical insights into cellular developments that might have led to a requirement for more complex clamp loaders from the equally competent but simple ones found in the archaeal/eukaryotic sister lineages. Construction of Plasmids for Overproduction of RFC Proteins—During annotation of the genome sequence of the mesophilic archaeon M. acetivorans (Mac), we discovered two genes coding for two different RFCS subunits designated MacRFCS1 and MacRFCS2 and another gene coding for one RFCL subunit (MacRFCL). To express the individual genes for biochemical analysis, they were placed in-frame with the His6-encoding sequence of a modified pET28a plasmid (Novagen). The modification in the pET28a plasmid was a replacement of the kanamycin resistance gene with the ampicillin resistance gene (14Robbins J.B. Murphy M.C. White B.A. Mackie R.I. Ha T. Cann I.K.O J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6315-6326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The individual genes were also placed in a pET21a plasmid (Novagen) for expression as proteins without a His6 tag. The plasmid constructs were thus designated pET28/rfcs1, pET28/rfcs2, and pET28/rfcl for the pET28a derivatives and pET21/rfcs1, pET21/rfcs2, and pET21/rfcl for the pET21a derivatives. In the experiments in which genes were coexpressed, the pET28a construct and a second plasmid, pACYCDuet (Novagen), were used except for the coexpression of rfcs1/rfcs2, which was carried out in pACYCDuet alone. Note that the pACYCDuet plasmid allows insertion of one or two genes for expression. The plasmids for coexpression of the three genes in different combinations were therefore pET28/rfcl-pACYCDuet/rfcs1, pET28/rfcl-pACYCDuet/rfcs2, pACYCDuet/rfcs1/rfcs2, and pET28/rfcl-pACYCDuet/rfcs1/rfcs2. The pET28a constructs contained an ampicillin resistance gene, and the pACYCDuet construct contained a chloramphenicol resistance gene; therefore, the medium for coexpression contained the two antibiotics for selection. All DNA inserts were sequenced (W. M. Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) to ensure the integrity of the gene.

The RFCL subunit lacks an SRC motif. Therefore, only the lysine in the Walker A motif was mutated to alanine. The mutations were carried out with the QuikChange® multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primers for the mutagenesis are shown in TABLE ONE. To allow cloning of both RFCS subunits into pACYCDuet, an NcoI site in MacRFCS1 was abolished through site-directed mutagenesis with primer RFCS1ΔNcoI (TABLE ONE), which introduced only a silent mutation into the gene. The gene for MacRFCS1 was cloned with NdeI and XhoI, and the gene for MacRFCS2 was digested with NcoI and XhoI and cloned into the NcoI/SalI site in pACYCDuet. The genes for the mutant subunits were used in different combinations to create different mutants of the MacRFC complex. Production of Recombinant Proteins—Plasmids harboring each individual RFCS gene were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-Codon-Plus(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene) and spread on LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After an overnight incubation, a single colony was picked from each plate, inoculated into LB broth containing the two antibiotics at the concentrations mentioned above, and incubated with vigorous shaking at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.3. Gene expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; the incubation temperature was dropped to 16 °C; and cells were cultured for 12 h. One liter of culture from each cell line was centrifuged to pellet the cells. The cells were suspended in a lysis buffer or in buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 300 mm NaCl) and lysed using a French pressure cell (American Instruments Co.) to release the cell contents. Because both MacRFCS1 and MacRFCS2 were produced with an N-terminal His6 tag, the supernatants for MacRFCS1 and MacRFCS2 were each applied to a cobalt affinity resin (TALON™, Clontech) to immobilize the His6-tagged proteins (His6-MacRFCS1 and His6-MacRFCS2). The resin was washed extensively with the lysis buffer, and the bound protein was eluted with buffer A containing 150 mm imidazole. Aliquots of samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the fractions containing the respective RFCS subunit were pooled together, suspended in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 20% glycerol), and dialyzed against the same buffer. The samples were then loaded onto a Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B. The chromatography was developed with buffer B at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected for analysis by SDS-PAGE. In the case of MacRFCL, the plasmid construct was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene). The production of the MacRFC complex and all of its derivatives and also all other combinations of the MacRFC subunits tested was carried out in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The cells carrying MacRFCL were selected on ampicillin-containing LB medium, whereas the cells carrying MacRFCS1/MacRFCS2 were selected on chloramphenicol-containing LB medium. The RFC complex and its derivatives were selected on ampicillinand chloramphenicol-containing LB medium. Therefore, His6-MacRFCL and the MacRFC complex (coexpressed His6-RFCL, RFCS1, and His6-RFCS2) were purified by affinity chromatography on cobalt affinity resin as described above, followed by passage through a heparin column and then gel filtration chromatography. For affinity chromatography on a His-Trap™ HP column (5 ml; Amersham Biosciences), the elution buffer contained 500 mm imidazole. In the heparin chromatography step, His6-RFCL or the MacRFC complex obtained from the affinity chromatography was dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm KH2PO4 (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) and then loaded onto HiTrap™ heparin HP column (5 ml; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer C, followed by elution of bound proteins with buffer C containing 1 m NaCl. The fractions containing the proteins were dialyzed against buffer B and applied to a gel filtration column as described above for the RFCS subunits. His6-RFCL and the MacRFC complex were each stored in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT until used. The gene for a homolog of the eukaryotic proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in M. acetivorans was cloned into pET21a for expression. The expression and purification of MacPCNA were performed following a method described previously (22Cann I.K.O Ishino S. Hayashi I. Komori K. Toh H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6591-6599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for Pyrococcus furiosus (Pfu) PCNA, except for the omission of the heating step because MacPCNA is from a mesophilic organism. In brief, this method involved Polymin P treatment for 30 min at 4 °C, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and anion exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q, Amersham Biosciences). The cloning, expression, and purification of M. acetivorans DNA polymerase BI (PolBI) and its truncated forms were as described in our previous reports (14Robbins J.B. Murphy M.C.

The primers for the C-terminal truncation of MacPolBI are shown in TABLE ONE. All of the mutant MacRFC proteins were expressed and their products were purified as described for their wild-type counterparts. Western Blot Analysis—Polyclonal antibodies were raised against purified recombinant MacRFCS1 and MacRFCS2 (Immunological Resource Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). In the case of His6-MacRFCL and His6-MacRFCS2, an antibody commercially available for detection of the His6 tag (Amersham Biosciences) was purchased and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. All protein samples of interest were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond™-P, Amersham Biosciences), and analyzed as described previously (13Cann I.K.O Komori K. Toh H. Kanai S. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Estimation of Subunit Organization by Gel Filtration—To estimate the subunit organization of individual proteins and protein complexes in solution, the RFC proteins were subjected to gel filtration analysis. Purified proteins were dialyzed against buffer B. Samples were then loaded onto a Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer B. The chromatography was developed with buffer B at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The column was calibrated by running a set of protein standards (thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; catalase, 58 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; and ribonuclease A, 13.7 kDa) under the same conditions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The MacRFC complex and its individual subunits were tested for their ability to bind to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and singly primed ssDNA (pDNA). The pDNA was made by end labeling the pDNA primer (38-mer) and annealing it to the partially complementary pDNA template (76-mer). The nucleotide sequences of the primer and template are shown in TABLE ONE. Increasing amounts of proteins were incubated with 0.5 pmol of γ-32P-end-labeled ssDNA (CDC6-1F (40-mer oligonucleotide) in TABLE ONE) or γ-32P-labeled pDNA in 10 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0) and 0.5 mm magnesium acetate) at 37 °C for 30 min. Two microliters of loading dye (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0) 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) were added to the product of the reaction and resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.1× Tris acetate/EDTA buffer (15Robbins J.B. McKinney M.C. Guzman C.E. Sriratana B. Fitz-Gibbon S. Ha T. Cann I.K.O J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15325-15339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The gels were dried, and the products were visualized by autoradiography. ATPase Activity—ATPase activity was measured in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm DTT, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.034 μm [γ-32P] ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and one of the following: 2.4 μg of MacRFCS1, 1.2 μg of MacRFCS2, 2.1 μg of MacRFCL, or 0.45 μg of MacRFC complex. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and then terminated by addition of 2 μl of a 400 mm EDTA solution. When dATPase activity was investigated, the radioactive and non-radioactive ATPs were substituted with radioactive and nonradioactive dATPs, respectively. One microliter of products from each reaction mixture was spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and then developed in a solution containing 1.0 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl for 10 min at room temperature. When their effects were assessed, cofactors or effectors were added as follows: ssDNA (39-mer, 130 ng), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA; 375 bp, 50 ng), pDNA (56 ng), or MacPCNA (12 pmol). The method used to make the pDNA is described above under “Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay.” Note that, for this purpose, the primer was not end-labeled. The sequences of the nucleic acids are shown in TABLE ONE. The thin layer chromatography plates were dried and exposed for autoradiography, and the results were quantified using a BAS-1800 II bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Primer Extension Analysis—We used a primer extension assay to compare the capacity of the MacRFC proteins and their mutants to stimulate MacPCNA-dependent DNA synthesis of MacPolBI. An oligonucleotide that is complementary to positions 6205–6234 of the M13mp18 (+)-strand was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.). Two picomoles of the end-labeled primer were annealed to 1 μg of template (M13mp18 (+)-strand circular ssDNA) as described previously (15Robbins J.B. McKinney M.C. Guzman C.E. Sriratana B. Fitz-Gibbon S. Ha T. Cann I.K.O J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15325-15339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The primer extension reaction (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 250 μm each dNTP, 20 mm ATP, and 0.5 μg of MacPolBI. When accessory factors were added, they were included as follows: MacRFCS1, MacRFCS2, and MacRFCL at 2.4, 1.2, and 2.1 μg/reaction, respectively; MacRFC complex or its mutants at 0.34 μg/reaction; and MacPCNA at 6 pmol/reaction. Each reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by termination by addition of 6 μl of stop solution (98% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). After heating to 95 °C for 5 min, the samples were resolved on 1% alkali-agarose gel in 50 mm sodium hydroxide and 1 mm EDTA. Growth of M. acetivorans Cells—M. acetivorans cells were grown in HS/methanol/acetate broth medium (400 mm NaCl, 54 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 45 mm NaHCO3, 19 mm NH4Cl, 13 mm KCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 4 μm resazurin, 2.8 mm cysteine HCl, and 0.4 mm Na2S·9H2O) at 35 °C under strictly anaerobic conditions (23Metcalf W.W. Zhang J.K. Shi X. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5797-5802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells at mid-exponential phase (A600 nm ∼ 0.3) were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 15 min. Next, 1.5 g of wet cell pellet were resuspended in 2.25 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The cells were lysed using a French pressure cell, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at 4 °C until used for Western blot analysis. N-terminal Sequencing—An aliquot of the MacRFC complex was fractionated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gel) and electroblotted onto a membrane optimized for protein transfer (Hybond™-P). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (0.02%"
https://openalex.org/W2047150650,"It has become increasingly clear that hyaluronan is more than the simple matrix molecule it was once thought to be but instead takes part in a multitude of biological functions. Three genes encode for hyaluronan synthases (HAS). We demonstrated earlier that HAS2 and HAS3 are constitutively activated in type-B synoviocytes (fibroblast-like synoviocytes) and, furthermore, that the only gene that readily responds to stimulation with a series of proinflammatory cytokines is HAS1. Here we probe the involvement of the transcription factor NF-κB in induced and noninduced HAS activation. Transforming growth factor (TGF) β1 as well as interleukin (IL)-1β are both strong inducers of HAS1 transcription. Stimulation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes with IL-1β resulted in rapid degradation of IκBα, an event that was preceded by IκBα phosphorylation. Interestingly, TGFβ1 neither affected IκBα levels, nor did it cause phosphorylation of IκBα. In addition, TGFβ1 had no effect on IκBβ and IκBϵ levels. Electrophorectic mobility shift assays demonstrate that IL-1β is a potent inducer of NF-κB translocation; however, TGFβ1 treatment did not result in shifting bands. Two adenovirus constructs were used to further clarify differences in TGFβ1- and IL-1β-induced HAS1 activation. Overexpressing IκBα completely abolished the IL-1β effect on HAS1 but did not interfere with TGFβ1-induced HAS1 mRNA accumulation. Identical results were obtained when a dominant negative IKK was overexpressed. Interestingly, neither overexpression of IκBα nor of IKK had any effect on HAS2 and HAS3 mRNA levels. Taken together, HAS1 can be activated by distinct pathways; IL-1β utilizes NF-κB, and TGFβ1 does not. Furthermore, HAS2 and HAS3 are activated without the involvement of NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W1964070162,"The serine/threonine kinase Mirk/dyrk1B is activated in several solid tumors where it mediates cell survival, but the mechanism by which Mirk is activated in tumors is unknown. We now demonstrate that Mirk is activated as a kinase by signaling from Rac1 to the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MKK3. Rac is a Ras superfamily GTPase that, when activated, functions downstream of Ras oncoproteins to promote cell survival, transformation, and membrane ruffling. The constitutively active mutant Rac1QL activated Mirk in several cell types through MKK3, which in turn activated Mirk by phosphorylation. Dominant negative Rac1, dominant negative MKK3, and knockdown of MKK3 by RNA interference inhibited the kinase activity of co-expressed Mirk. E-cadherin ligation in confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells is known to transiently activate Rac1. Mirk was activated by endogenous Rac1 following E-cadherin ligation in confluent MDCK epithelial cells, whereas treatment of confluent MDCK cells with an Rac1 inhibitor decreased Mirk activity. Disruption of cadherin ligation by EGTA or prevention of cadherin ligation by maintenance of cells at subconfluent density blocked activation of Mirk. Engagement of cadherin molecules on subconfluent cells by an E-cadherin/Fc chimeric molecule transiently activated both Rac1 and Mirk with a similar time course. Rac activity is up-regulated in many human tumors and mediates survival signals, which enable tumor cells to evade apoptosis. This study characterizes a new anti-apoptotic signaling pathway that connects Rac1 with a novel downstream effector, Mirk kinase, which has recently been demonstrated to mediate survival in human tumors.

Nat Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation of Mirk in tumors is unknown. However, Mirk is widely expressed in normal tissues at low levels (2Lee K.-M. Friedman E. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39: 273Google Scholar, 3Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar) where it has a post-translational function in maintaining G0 arrest (4Deng X. Mercer S. Shah S. Ewton D. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22498-22504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This function is readily abrogated in tumors that have lost the capacity for G0 arrest by up-regulating G1 cyclins or cyclin-dependent kinases or by inactivation or deletion of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Possibly some of the components of the signaling cascade that activated Mirk in non-transformed cells might be conserved in cancers. Mirk was most active as a kinase in G0 in non-transformed NIH3T3 cells (4Deng X. Mercer S. Shah S. Ewton D. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22498-22504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) when cells were contact inhibited, so we hypothesized that some signals generated by contact inhibition activated Mirk. Mirk is activated by the stress-activated p38 MAPK kinase, MKK3 (5Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas Mirk itself competes with p38 MAPK for access to MKK3 (6Lim S. Zou Y. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49438-49445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

Rac has been shown to be transiently activated by E-cadherin ligation when MDCK cells become confluent (7Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), making Rac a candidate upstream activator for Mirk. Moreover, Rac is associated with MKK3 through at least two scaffolding proteins. The scaffold protein OSM binds to actin, Rac, and the upstream kinases MEKK3 and MKK3 in the p38 MAPK activation module and functions to activate p38 MAPK during hyperosmotic shock (9Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The GTPase activity of Rac is activated upon interaction with Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which promote the release of GDP from Rac. In epithelial cells, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 suppresses invasion and promotes adhesion through cell-to-cell contact mediated by E-cadherin (9Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Tiam1 interacts with the scaffold protein IB2/JIP2, which in turn binds to the Rac target mixed lineage kinase 3, MKK3, and p38 MAPK (10Buchsbaum R.J. Connolly B.A. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4073-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus Rac signals through a protein kinase cascade to MKK3 and potentially to either p38 MAPK or to mixed lineage kinase 3. The current study demonstrates that Rac1 is an upstream activator of Mirk. Materials—Antibody to Rac1 and the PAK-1 PBD-agarose for GST pull-down experiments were from Upstate Biotechnology, and antibodies to GST and to the His epitope tag were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to a unique sequence at the C terminus of Mirk was raised as described previously (3Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer paper Immobilon-P was purchased from Millipore. PLUS reagent and Lipofectamine were from Invitrogen, all radioactive materials were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and ECL reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. The specific Rac1 inhibitor 553502 was purchased from Calbiochem. HuSH MAP2K3 RNA interference constructs against MKK3 in the pRS plasmid under U6 promoter control were obtained from Origene. All other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture—NIH3T3 cells, 293T cells, and MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum and modified and supplemented as described (5Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For density experiments on epithelial cells, MDCK cells were trypsinized, extensively triturated to generate a maximally dispersed cell suspension, and plated in the presence of serum. Plasmids—pcDNA3.1-HisA-Mirk and the kinase-inactive mutants pcDNA3.1-HisA-YF-Mirk and pcDNA3.1-HisA-KR-Mirk had been previously generated (5Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), as had FLAG-p27 and FLAG-p27-S10A (4Deng X. Mercer S. Shah S. Ewton D. Friedman E. J. Biol.

All other Mirk expression plasmids and Mirk promoter constructs were prepared by Dr. Xiaobing Deng (11Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The (β-28)3-luciferase plasmid encoding three tandem repeats of the β-fibrinogen HNF1α binding domain in front of a TATA box promoter and a luciferase reporter gene, the expression plasmid pBJ5-DCoH, and the expression plasmid pBJ5-HNF1α were the kind gifts of Dr. G. Crabtree, Stanford University. FLAG-MKK3E and -MKK6E, each in pcDNA3, were the kind gifts of Dr. J. Han, Scripps Institute. Constitutively active Cdc42-QL, Rac1-QL, and RhoA-QL were obtained from S. Gutkind, National Institutes of Health. Transient Transfections—MDCK cells were transiently transfected by adding a complex of Lipofectamine (2–4 μg/μg of DNA) in serum-free media for 24 h. For reporter gene assays, NIH3T3, 293T, and MDCK cells were seeded the day before transfection at 0.9 × 105/well and allowed to grow overnight in 7% serum-containing media. Cells were transfected by incubating with a complex of PLUS reagent (3 μl/μg DNA) and Lipofectamine (2 μl/μg DNA) in serum-free media for 18–24 h in a CO2 incubator. The amount of total DNA used was kept constant by the addition of empty vector DNA, and luciferase activities were calibrated by co-transfected β-galactosidase activity to normalize the transfection efficiency. These assays were carried out in triplicate, and the data shown are representative of three independent experiments. Immunoprecipitations—Cells in multiple 60- or 100-mm dishes were transfected with 1 μg of DNA for Mirk or the pHisA vector and allowed to express for 24 h, and then each dish was lysed in 0.25 or 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride. An aliquot of total lysate of 500 μg was immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-Mirk rabbit polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C; the complexes were then collected by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-agarose, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with lysis buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. E-cadherin/Fc Assay—Suspended cells were plated at a 1:10 dilution for low density cultures. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h. The cells were incubated at various time points at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml of the murine recombinant E-cadherin/Fc chimeric protein (Sigma). Calcium Blocking Assay—Suspended cells were plated either at one-tenth confluent density or at confluent density. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h. The cells were incubated with 4 mm EGTA for various time points at 37 °C. In Vitro Kinase Assay—The kinase activity of Mirk was tested with the myelin basic protein (MBP) from Upstate Biotechnology, or with recombinant GST-p27 prepared as described (4Deng X. Mercer S. Shah S. Ewton D. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22498-22504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EGTA), incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μm unlabeled ATP plus 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of MBP as substrate, and then analyzed by PAGE and autoradiography. Immunodetection—Following treatment as indicated and washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in lysis buffer. Lysates were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 15 min to remove insoluble material. Depending upon the experiment, 10–50 μg of cell lysate was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation by SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody in TBST buffer-3% milk, and proteins were subsequently detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. All Mirk blots used an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed to the unique C terminus of Mirk. Band density in autoradiograms was measured using a Lacie Silverscanner and Silverscanner III software and analyzed by the IP LabGel program. Affinity Precipitation of GTP-bound Rac1—The activation state of Rac1 was assessed by the ability of GTP-Rac1 to bind to the GST-Rac-binding domain of PAK. The GST-PBD construct consists of amino acids 67–150 of human PAK-1 bound to glutathione-agarose (Kit 17-283, Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, the cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis/wash buffer. The lysates were incubated for 1 h with 5–10 μl of PAK-1 PBD-agarose, followed by three washes. The GTP-bound forms of Rac1 associated with GST-PAK1 PBD were quantified by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against Rac1 (1:1000 dilution). In Vivo Labeling and Immunoprecipitations—Cells in multiple 60-mm dishes were transfected with MKK3E, pcDNA3.1-HisA-Mirk, or the kinase-inactive mutant constructs pcDNA3.1-HisA-YF-Mirk or pcDNA3.1-HisA-KR-Mirk as noted for 4 h, then switched to growth media for 19 h. Cells were then switched to phosphate-free media for 1 h, and then incubated with 400 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h in 2 ml of reduced phosphate medium (75% phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). Cells were washed twice and then lysed in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture, and Sigma Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture I and II (lysis buffer). Lysates were pre-cleared by rocking incubation at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h and then pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material. An aliquot of total lysate of 500 μg was immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-Mirk rabbit polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C; the complexes were then collected by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-agarose, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with lysis buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Analysis—Trypsin cleavage and two-dimensional analysis of Mirk phosphopeptides was carried out as described (12Kim G.-Y. Mercer S. Ewton D. Yan Z. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29792-29802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Following immunoprecipitation of phospholabeled proteins, the substrate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the protein band was identified by autoradiography and excised from the membrane. Proteins were digested with sequencing grade trypsin (20 μg in 200 μl of freshly prepared 50 mm NH4HCO3 overnight at 37 °C), and the polypeptides were spotted onto 20- × 20-cm thin-layer cellulose plates and separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis for 45 min at 1000 V on an HTLE-7002 electrophoresis system (CBS Scientific) using pH 1.9 buffer (2.2% formic acid, 7.8% acetic acid). Peptides were separated in the second dimension by chromatography for 9 h in phosphochromatography buffer (38% n-butanol, 25% pyridine, and 7.5% acetic acid). Dried plates were exposed to Kodak Biomax MS film for 2–8 days. The Rho GTPase Rac1 Is Upstream of Mirk in a Signaling Pathway, whereas Other Rho Family Members, Cdc42 and RhoA, Induce Expression of Mirk—We tested the hypothesis that Mirk was activated in vivo by signaling initiated by endogenous activated Rac1. We co-expressed Mirk in 293T cells with increasing concentrations of dominant negative N17Rac1, and then measured the activity of immunoprecipitated Mirk using in vitro kinase reactions with MBP as the substrate (Fig. 1A). Dominant negative N17Rac1 blocked the activation of Mirk in a dose-dependent manner from 6- to 13-fold. Conversely, co-expression of Mirk in 293T cells with increasing concentrations of constitutively active mutant Rac1 (Rac1QL) increased Mirk activity ∼4-fold in multiple experiments (Fig. 1B). As a control we measured the protein level of Mirk in cells transfected with the constitutively active constructs Rac1QL, Cdc42QL, and RhoAQL (Fig. 1C). Cdc42QL and RhoAQL increased Mirk protein levels 2-fold, whereas Rac1QL induced at best a marginal 10% increase, indicating that the increase in Mirk activity seen in Fig. 1B was due to activation of Mirk. Possibly Rac1QL or Cdc42QL altered the stability of Mirk protein. Both of these constructs were transfected into 293T cells and allowed to express, and the stability of co-transfected His-Mirk was then tested by translation arrest by cycloheximide, followed by measurement of Mirk levels by Western blotting. Neither activated rho protein altered the stability of Mirk protein (Fig. 1D). We then speculated that the increase in Mirk protein seen when Cdc42QL or RhoAQL were expressed was due to transcriptional up-regulation of Mirk. In an earlier study, we had found that Cdc42 and RhoA induce the transcription of Mirk 8-fold in C2C12 myoblasts, whereas Rac1 had less effect (11Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A Mirk promoter construct coupled to the luciferase reporter gene was co-expressed with constitutively active Rho proteins in 293T cells. The constitutively active constructs RhoA QL or Cdc42QL induced an average 3-fold increase in Mirk promoter reporter activity (Fig. 1E). Thus activated RhoA and Cdc42 function in vivo to increase transcription of the Mirk gene, as had been seen in C2C12 myoblasts. In sharp contrast, no increase in Mirk promoter reporter activity was induced by co-expression with constitutively active Rac1QL. Thus Rac1 does not increase Mirk protein level, but instead Rac1 is upstream of Mirk in a signaling cascade. In addition to these direct kinase assays, we used reporter studies to assay the activation of Mirk by signaling from Rac1. In our earlier studies, signaling from MKK3 to Mirk had been shown to mediate the transcriptional activation of HNF1α (5Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that exogenously expressed constitutively active mutant Rac1 would act as an upstream activator of endogenous MKK3 in 293T epithelial cells and thus would activate Mirk in reporter assays. The effects of co-transfected constitutively activated Rac1QL on Mirk transcriptional activation of HNF1α were determined using the β-fibrinogen promoter reporter construct (β-28)3-Luc in transient transfection experiments. Rac1QL activated Mirk to enhance HNF1α-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 1F). Little activation was seen when Rac1QL and HNF1α were co-transfected without Mirk or with either of two kinase-inactive forms of Mirk, Mirk-YF, doubly mutated at the activation domain, or Mirk-ΔN, deleted of amino acids 1–110 (3Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar, 11Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although Rac1 activates p38 MAPK (13Coso O. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 14Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), p38 was not able to substitute for Mirk in activation of HNF1 (Fig. 1F). We also tested whether Cdc42QL would activate Mirk in this assay. Cdc42QL increased Mirk activity 6-fold ± 0.8 (Fig. 1F). However, Cdc42QL increased Mirk transcription nearly as much, 4-fold (Fig. 1E). Possibly CDC42QL can induce a slight activation of Mirk in addition to its transcriptional up-regulation of Mirk. However, Rac1 is the more potent activator, is upstream of Mirk in a signaling pathway, and increases Mirk activity without increasing Mirk abundance. We repeated the reporter activation studies in both NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2A) and MDCK cells (Fig. 2B) and found similar results. Rac1QL activated Mirk 3- to 4-fold to enhance HNF1α-dependent reporter activity. Similarly, the constitutively active constructs RhoA QL or Cdc42QL induced an average 3-fold increase in Mirk promoter reporter activity in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2C) and MDCK cells (Fig. 2D), while Rac1QL was ineffective. Therefore, Rac1 is upstream of Mirk in a signaling pathway and increases Mirk activity without increasing Mirk abundance in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, non-transformed MDCK kidney epithelial cells, and SV40 T antigen-transformed 293T kidney epithelial cells. Activation of Endogenous Rac by Homophilic E-cadherin Ligation in MDCK Cells Results in Activation of Mirk in Vivo, whereas Dissociation of Cell-to-Cell Adhesion by EGTA Decreases Mirk Activity—Rac has been shown by others to be activated by E-cadherin ligation when MDCK cells become confluent (7Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that Mirk would be activated by signaling cascades initiated by ligation of cell-surface cadherins when MDCK epithelial cells were grown to confluence. Mirk expression is limited in non-transformed MDCK cells, so exogenous Mirk was studied initially. A His-epitope-tagged Mirk expression plasmid was transiently transfected into MDCK cells, which were then plated into multiple parallel dishes, which became confluent by overnight culture (Fig. 3A). One confluent plate was harvested, and the others were gently trypsinized, replated without dilution, and then incubated for 6 h to 4 days before lysis. Mirk was immunoprecipitated from these cultures, and its activity was determined by in vitro kinase assays on MBP. Mirk activity was high in the confluent culture but was almost completely lost in cells that had been trypsinized and replated for 6 h. The activity of Mirk increased after 12 h, returned to control levels after 1 day of culture when cells had regained confluence, and continued to increase with 3–4 days of postconfluent culture (Fig. 3A). We next tested whether the sharp decline in Mirk activity was due to the loss of cell-to-cell contact in trypsinized cultures and whether the recovery of Mirk activity was due to restoration of cadherin-cadherin junctions. A His-epitope-tagged Mirk expression plasmid was transiently transfected into MDCK cells, which were then plated at either subconfluent or just confluent cell density. Cell density was carefully controlled so that MDCK cells became confluent after 24 h of culture, whereas the majority of cells in the subconfluent cultures remained single cells, not forming cell-to-cell adhesions. The activity of immunoprecipitated exogenous Mirk was determined by in vitro kinase reactions on MBP. Mirk activity was ∼6-fold greater in cells that had just attained confluence than in subconfluent cells, whereas expression levels of Mirk were similar in all cultures (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 3). Cadherin engagement in epithelial cells is known to activate both Rac1 and Cdc42 while decreasing the activity of RhoA (7Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Mirk was activated, at least in part, by Rac1, which was activated by cell-to-cell adhesion through cadherins. To test this hypothesis, cell-to-cell junctions were disrupted by incubation with 4 mm EGTA for 10 min. Disruption of homophilic E-cadherin ligation in the confluent cultures dramatically reduced Mirk activity (Fig. 3B), whereas EGTA treatment of non-cadherin-ligated, subconfluent cells did not diminish Mirk activity. Next, the effect of EGTA on Rac1 activity was measured by using pull-down assays using a Pak-1 binding domainagarose conjugate that specifically binds the activated GTP-bound form of Rac1. In confluent MDCK cells, EGTA treatment decreased Rac1 activity by 10 min and blocked Rac1 activation 10-fold after 30 min while not altering Rac1 abundance (Fig. 3C, quantitation shown as percent activity). We next tested whether Mirk activation by cell-to-cell contact could be inhibited by a cell-permeable Rac1 inhibitor. MDCK cells were transfected with His-Mirk and then cultured at confluent density for 24 h. The confluent MDCK cells were then treated for 10–30 min with the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766. This inhibitor effectively inhibited Rac1 binding by Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors, without interfering with the closely related Cdc42 or RhoA binding or activation by their specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (15Gao Y. Dickerson J.B. Guo F. Zheng J. Zheng Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7618-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Mirk was immunoprecipitated, and Mirk kinase activity was determined. Mirk activity was decreased 2-fold by the Rac1 inhibitor at both time points (Fig. 3D). Complete inhibition was not seen. Possibly other upstream activators of Mirk are active in confluent MDCK cells. Additional transfection and kinase experiments in MDCK cells, performed as in Fig. 1 (A and B), also demonstrated that Rac1QL increased Mirk activity in vivo, whereas expression of the dominant negative N17Rac1 inhibited Mirk activity (data not shown). Therefore, Mirk is activated in vivo when cells become confluent and adherent to one another through EGTA-sensitive cell-to-cell contacts, and this activation is mediated, at least in part, by activated Rac1. Endogenous Mirk Is Activated by Endogenous Rac1—Endogenous Mirk was more active in confluent MDCK cultures than nonconfluent ones, whereas disruption of cadherin junctions in confluent cultures by EGTA treatment decreased Mirk activity. Mirk was immunoprecipitated from these cultures, and its activity was determined by in vitro kinase assays on MBP (Fig. 4A). The activation of endogenous Mirk by cell-to-cell adhesion was next shown by in vivo phosphorylation of the Mirk substrates, FLAG-HNF1α (Fig. 4B) and FLAG-p27 (Fig. 4C). Both proteins are phosphorylated on at least one unique site by Mirk (4Deng X. Mercer S. Shah S. Ewton D. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22498-22504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After expression of exogenous FLAG-HNF1, or exogenous FLAG-p27, cells were plated so that they reached confluence in 24 h or at lower cell density so that they remained subconfluent. Cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for the final 5 h of culture, then treated for 10 min before lysis with 4 mm EGTA to disrupt homophilic cadherin ligation. The in vivo labeled FLAG-HNF1 and FLAG-p27 were collected with anti-FLAG antibody bound to agarose beads, then examined by autoradiography and by Western blotting for the FLAG epitope. There was up to 7-fold higher labeling of the Mirk substrates FLAG-HNF1 and FLAG-p27 in vivo in the confluent cultures versus subconfluent ones, and this labeling was decreased ∼3-fold following disruption of cell-to-cell cadherin ligation with EGTA (Fig. 4, B and C). Some low level phosphorylation of both substrates remained when Mirk activation was blocked by EGTA treatment of confluent cultures (Fig. 4, last lanes) and was probably due to other kinases. When data from all of these experiments were complied, growth to confluence was found to activate Mirk 4- to 7-fold, whereas EGTA treatment inhibited Mirk activation ∼10-fold in the confluent cultures. Together these experiments demonstrate that Mirk was activated by signaling from homophilic cadherin ligation in epithelial cells to activate Rac1.

Unlike most retroviruses, β-retroviruses, including Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV), assemble immature capsids within the cytoplasm of the cell. The activation of β-retroviral proteases must be highly regulated, because processing of the Gag-related polyprotein precursors occurs only after transport of immature capsids to the plasma membrane and budding. Several β-retroviral proteases have unique C-terminal extension sequences, containing a glycine-rich motif (G-patch), which specifically binds in vitro to single-stranded nucleic acids. In M-PMV PR the G-patch is removed in vitro as well as in vivo by autoproteolytic processing to yield truncated active forms of PR. To investigate the role of the G-patch domain on the virus life cycle, we introduced mutations within the C-terminal domain of protease. We found that the G-patch domain of M-PMV PR is not required for the processing of viral polyproteins, but it significantly influences the infectivity of M-PMV, the activity of reverse transcriptase, and assembly of immature capsid within the cells. These results demonstrate for the first time that the G-patch domain of M-PMV PR is critical for the life cycle of β-retroviruses, and its evolutionary conservation within members of this genus suggests its importance for retroviruses that display D-type morphology.

The retroviral protease is translated as a domain of the Gag-related polyproteins. For most retroviruses, Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins assemble into an immature particle at the plasma membrane during viral budding, in a process referred to as “C-type” viral assembly. Gag-polyprotein preassembly in the cytoplasm of the host cell, away from the plasma membrane, is termed “B/D-type” assembly and is unique to the β-retroviruses (B- and D-type retroviruses), and the spumaviruses. Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV) is the prototype of the type-D retroviruses. The genomic organization of M-PMV consists of four genes in the order 5′gag-pro-pol-env-3′. The precursors to the viral enzymes, Gag-Pro and Gag-Pro-Pol, are produced by ribosomal frame shifts at the ends of the Gag and protease reading frames, respectively (1Bradac J.A. Hunter E. Virology. 1986; 150: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Gag-polyproteins and genomic RNA assemble into immature viral capsids in the pericentriolar region of the infected cell (2Sfakianos J.N. LaCasse R.A. Hunter E. Traffic. 2003; 4: 660-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The dominant signal responsible for this targeting was identified within the N terminus of the Gag polyprotein in the matrix domain (MA) and has been termed the cytoplasmic targeting/retention signal (CTRS) (3Rhee S.S. Hunter E. Cell. 1990; 63: 535-546Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 4Choi G. Park S. Choi B. Hong S. Lee J. Hunter E. Rhee S.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5431-5437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This motif of 18-amino-acid spanning residues 43-60 within MA sequence mediates intracytoplasmic targeting by interaction with the dynein/dynactin molecular motor complex (2Sfakianos J.N. LaCasse R.A. Hunter E. Traffic. 2003; 4: 660-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutation of a single amino acid (R55W) within M-PMV CTRS converts the D-type morphogenesis into a C-type assembly pathway (3Rhee S.S. Hunter E. Cell. 1990; 63: 535-546Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (133) Google Scholar), confirming that there are no inherent differences in the process of capsid assembly for different retroviruses. A bipartite membrane-targeting signal, consisting of the myristilated N-terminal 14 amino acids and a highly basic region of 17 residues of the matrix domain of human immunodeficiency virus, type-1 was shown to be responsible for assembly of viral polyproteins at the plasma membrane (5Zhou W. Parent L.J. Wills J.W. Resh M.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2556-2569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, structural signals located within Gag polyproteins direct polyprotein transport for capsid assembly. protease cytoplasmic targeting/retention signal reverse transcriptase Mason-Pfizer monkey virus wild type. protease cytoplasmic targeting/retention signal reverse transcriptase Mason-Pfizer monkey virus wild type. The immature particle proceeds to a mature morphology during budding and virion release when the protease is activated. The first proteolytically active M-PMV PR excised from Gag-precursors is a 17-kDa protein (per monomer) (17PR), which undergoes further C-terminal self-processing yielding 13-kDa protease (13PR). These two forms of protease were detected in released virions. In vitro, autoprocessing of 17PR yields another truncated 12-kDa form of M-PMV PR (12PR) (6Zábranský A. Andreánsky M. Hrusková-Heidingsfeldová O. Havlïcek V. Hunter E. Ruml T. Pichová I. Virology. 1998; 245: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All three forms display similar substrate specificities (7Pichová I. Zábranský A. Kost'álová I. Hrusková-Heidingsfeldová O. Andreánsky M. Hunter E. Ruml T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 436: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiencies of 13PR and 17PR are comparable; however, further truncation of 13PR into 12PR decreases the catalytic efficiencies more than 10-fold (8Veverka V. Bauerová H.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All retroviral proteases belong to the family of aspartic proteases. The active retroviral protease is a homodimer with a single active site. A key structural feature of PR homodimer is a four-stranded antiparallel β sheet that results from an interaction of N-terminal sequences of one subunit and C-terminal sequences of the second subunit (for review see Ref. 10Wlodawer A. Gustchina A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 16-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). NMR structural study of the 12-kDa form of M-PMV protease revealed that its overall structure follows the conservative structural motifs of retroviral proteases despite the lack of C-terminal sequences. 12PR can exist in solution in the form of a fully folded monomer, which dimerizes and becomes active in the presence of substrate or inhibitor. The C-terminal sequence of M-PMV 17PR likely forms a separate structural motif independent of the catalytic core of the molecule (8Veverka V. Bauerová H. Zábranský A. Lang J. Ruml T. Pichová I. Hrabal R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A bioinformatic analysis of proteins containing RNA binding sequences revealed a conserved glycine-rich module, termed the G-patch, in M-PMV Gag-polyproteins within the C-terminal sequence of protease (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 342-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, the C-terminal domains in M-PMV protease and the protease of mouse intracisternal A-type particles endogenous retrovirus have been demonstrated to specifically bind in vitro to single-stranded DNA and RNA oligonucleotides (9Svec M. Bauerová H. Pichová I. Konvalinka J. Strïsovský K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A similar domain was identified in over 100 eukaryotic proteins many of which are involved in RNA processing (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 342-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here, we report an analysis of the influence of the C-terminal domain of the M-PMV protease on the life cycle of the virus. We show that although this C-terminal G-patch-containing sequence is not necessary for virus maturation, it is important for its infectivity and an activity of the reverse transcriptase. Surprisingly, this domain affects the morphogenesis of viral particles. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—Mutations of single amino acids were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) into the previously described bacterial phagemid pBP (12Andreánsky M. Hunter E. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 626-633PubMed Google Scholar) harboring DNA sequences encoding a 28-kDa N-terminally extended precursor of protease from M-PMV. The primer sequences were as follows: A114R, 5′-GCCCCAATGACATAGTAACTCGTCAAATGTTAGCCC-3′ and A114R-rev, 5′-GGGCTAACATTTGACGAGTTACTATGTCATTGGGGC-3′ to generate vector pBP-A114R; Q115I, 5′-CATAGTAACTGCTATTATGTTAGCCCA-3′ and Q115I-rev, 5′:TGGGCTAACATAATAGCAGTTACTATG-3′ to generate vector pBP-Q115I; N109I-for, 5′-GATGTGTAGCCCCATTGACATAGTAACTG-3′, N109I-rev, 5′-CAGTTACTATGTCTCAATGGGGCTACACATC-3′, 115I-for, 5′-CATAGTAACTGCTATTATGTTAGCCCA-3′, and Q115I-rev, 5′-TGGGCTAACATAATAGCAGTTACTATG-3′ to generate vector pBP-N109I/Q115I; Y121SForII, 5′-AGCCCAGGGCTCCAGCCCGGGAAAAGGGTTAGG-3′ and Y121SR-evII, 5′-CCTAACCCTTTTCCCGGGCTGGAGCCCTGGGCT-3′ for creating vector pBP-Y121S. To construct mutated viral vectors pSARM4-A114R, pSARM4-Q115I, pSARM4-N109I/Q115I, and pSARM4-Y121S, the corresponding mutated sequences were excised from the pBP vectors by digestion with StyI and Eco72I and were ligated into proviral vector pSARM4Xba, which was created from proviral vector pSARM4 (13Song Ch. Hunter E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7779-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) by introducting XbaI into the position 2542 by site-specific mutagenesis (primers SarmXba-for, 5′-CACTTTTGGATTAATTCTAGACCGAAGTAGCATTAC-3′ and SarmXba-rev, 5′-GTAATGCTACTTCGGTCTAGAATTAATCCAAAAGTG-3′). Although the introduction of the XbaI site into this position leads to point mutation of Gly into Asp in the protease sequence, subcloning of the mutated insert via StyI and Eco72I restriction enzyme digestion into pSARM4-Xba, digested with XbaI and Eco72I, restores the glycine residue. The truncated mutants pSARM4-PRΔ111-145 and pSARM4-PRΔ118-145, lacking sequences encoding the C terminus of protease, were created by introduction of two XhoI sites into vector pSARM4, by removing DNA sequences between them and by ligation of the cohesive ends. The first XhoI site was introduced upstream of the frameshift sequence at the 3′-end of the gene encoding PR and the second one 9 bp downstream from the 3′-end of the sequence encoding either 13PR (12PR, respectively). The following primers were used: CtermPR17-for, 5′-GACAATCTAACCTCGAGGGTTGAAATT, CtermPR17-rev, 5′-GACAATCTAACCTCGAGGGTTGAAATT, CtermPR13-for, 5′-TGACATAGTAACTGCTCAAATGTTACTCGAGGGCTACAGCCC, Cterm-PR13-rev, 5′-GGGCTGTAGCCCTCGAGTAACATTTGAGCAGTTACTATGTCA, CtermPR12-for, 5′-CCCCAATGACCTCGAGACTGCTCAAATGTTAGCCC, and CtermPR12-rev, 5′-GGGCTAACATTTGAGCAGTCTCGAGGTCATTGGGG. By this approach the wt DNA sequences encoding the protease cleavage sites in positions P1′-P3′ were retained (see Fig. 1). Introduction of XhoI site at the 3′-end of the gene for PR changed Lys146 and Lys147 into Leu and Glu, respectively. These amino acids represent the P′4 and P′5 residues of the protease cleavage sites and do not influence significantly the auto-catalytic processing of PR from the C terminus. All DNA manipulations were carried out by common cloning techniques as described in Sambrook and Russel (14Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001Google Scholar). All newly created constructs were verified by DNA sequencing of the whole coding region. This sequencing confirmed that no undesired mutations occurred in the constructs. Bacterial Expression and Purification of M-PMV Protease—Expression of PR and its mutants in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) from pBP phagemids were carried out in LB (Luria-Bertani) medium containing ampicillin (at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml). When the cells reached A600 ∼ 0.9-1.1 the expression was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were harvested 2 h postinduction by centrifugation. The PR and all of its mutants were isolated from the inclusion bodies by solubilization in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, with 8 m urea, followed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, with 0.1% mercaptoethanol and by batch chromatography on QAE-Sephadex A25 under the same conditions (6Zábranský A.

Autocatalytic Cleavage of Protease in Vitro—The protease at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml was dialyzed into 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.3, containing 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% mercaptoethanol and then incubated at 37 °C for different time (0-10 days). The aliquots were then analyzed by SDS electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gel. Cell Cultures and Transfection—COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of the DNA constructs into COS-1 cells was performed by using the FuGENE 6 reagent according to the instruction manual. Radiolabeling and Immunoprecipitation—At 20 h posttransfection, cells were starved for 30 min in Cys/Met-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then labeled for 30 min in Cys/Met-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 35S-labeled methionine-cysteine (100 μCi/ml) (ICN). Pulse-labeled cells were lysed in lysis buffer A (0.025 m Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05 m NaCl, pH 8). For the chase, the cells were incubated in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for an additional 4 h and then lysed in lysis buffer A. Nuclei were then pelleted from both the pulse and chase cell lysates at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. After addition of SDS to the final concentration of 0.1% the viral proteins were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-M-PMV antiserum or with rabbit anti-CA antiserum. The chase-plate culture medium containing radiolabeled viral particles was filtered through a 0.45-μm pore size filter. It was then loaded onto a 20% (w/v) sucrose cushion in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 60 min at 55,000 rpm in a 90Ti rotor (Beckman). The pelleted virus particles were then lysed in lysis buffer B (0.025 m Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, pH 8), and the proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-M-PMV or anti-CA antisera. Radiolabeled proteins were separated on SDS electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. Infectivity Assay—COS-1 cells in 100-mm diameter plates were transfected with individual DNA constructs. At 48 h posttransfection the medium was collected, filtered and the relative levels of CA protein were determined for each sample by Western blot analysis with chemiluminescent detection using a CCD camera. The levels of CA protein concentration in the samples were normalized by dilution with complete medium, and the normalized supernatants were used to infect COS-1 cells on a 60-mm diameter plate in the presence of Polybrene (10 μg/ml). After overnight incubation the medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were incubated for another 48 h. The medium was collected, and the viral particles were pelleted through a sucrose cushion as described above and were resuspended in 50 μl of PLB (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 5% glycerol, pH 6.8). The level of CA protein released into the medium was determined by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal rabbit anti-CA antiserum and detected on a CCD camera using chemiluminescent substrate West Femto (Pierce). Activity of the Reverse Transcriptase—COS-1 cell cultures cultivated in 100-mm diameter plates were transfected with individual DNA constructs. 48 h posttransfection the medium was collected and filtered, and the pelleted viral particles were lysed in lysis buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The relative levels of CA protein were determined for each sample by Western blot analysis using West Femto (Pierce) chemiluminescent substrate. The reaction mixture for the RT assay contained 40 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2,2 mm dithiothreitol), 0.6 mg of polyU, 60 pmol of oligod(A)15, 2.5 nmol of [35S]dATP, and 10 μl of lysed viral particles normalized to the content of CA protein. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 3 h and was stopped by addition of 5 μl of 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Products of the polymerase reaction were transferred to the nylon membrane IMOBILLON-Ny+ (Millipore), and the intensity of the radioactivity level was evaluated on a PhosphorImager Amersham Bioscience Typhoon v. 3.0 using Image Quant program. Electron Microscopy—At 20 h posttransfection, COS-1 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C. Fixed cells were scraped, washed with cacodylate buffer, postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated through an increasing ethanol series (including a 30-min incubation in 1.5% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol), and embedded in Agar 100 resin (Gröpl, Tulln, Austria). Sections (70 nm) were contrasted with a saturated uranyl acetate solution in water (10 min, room temperature) and Reynold's lead citrate (7 min, room temperature). The electron microscopy images were obtained with a JEOL JEM-1010 electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Mutations within the C-terminal Domain of M-PMV Protease Do Not Affect Specificity of Protease and Rate of Virion-associated Proteolysis— Previous studies showed that proteolytic processing of the 17-kDa form of M-PMV PR into the truncated form both in vitro and in vivo is a time-dependent process. The freshly released mature particles contain only 17PR and the truncated 13PR appears in virions within 2 h after their release (6Zábranský A. Andreánsky M. Hrusková-Heidingsfeldová O. Havlïcek V. Hunter E. Ruml T. Pichová I. Virology. 1998; 245: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments confirmed that the first autocatalytic processing of 17PR occurs at the C terminus in position Ala114-Gln115 and it is followed by cleavage in position Ser107-Pro108 yielding the 13 and 12 kDa forms of M-PMV PR, respectively (see Fig. 2). To determine an influence of the G-patch and the rate of its processing on the virus life cycle, we introduced several mutations into the C-terminal domain of PR (see Fig. 2). Asn109, which forms the P2′ position of the 12PR/13PR processing site, was mutated into Ile, Asp, Lys, Ser, Glu, Leu, Thr, Met, and Val. Furthermore, Ala114 in the P1 position of the 13PR/17PR processing site was replaced by Arg. Gln115 from the P′1 site of this cleavage site was mutated into Lys, Arg, Glu, and Ile. These protease mutants were expressed in bacteria and purified, and their autocatalytic cleavage was monitored by SDS-PAGE at different time intervals (Fig. 3). The purified sample of the wt M-PMV PR (17PR) contained 17PR and 13PR and traces of 12PR. Three of the analyzed mutations significantly changed the rate of the PR processing. Arg introduced into the P1 position of the 13/17 cleavage site (mutant A114R) slowed down the autoprocessing and prolonged the existence of 17PR in the sample. The replacement of Gln115 by Ile in the P1′ position of this cleavage site (mutant Q115I) significantly accelerated the C-terminal processing of PR. The 17-kDa form was processed into truncated PRs during the renaturation, and the purified sample contained mostly the 12-kDa form of PR. After two additional days of incubation at 37 °C the sample contained only the shortest form of PR. In contrast, Ile introduced into the P2′ position of the 12/13 cleavage site decreased the autoprocessing of 13PR into 12PR (data not shown). To obtain a mutant of PR that yielded a more stable 13PR, the double mutations (N109I and Q115I) were cloned into the protease processing sites. Mutations A114R, Q115I, and N109I/Q115I influencing the C-terminal autoprocessing of M-PMV PR were then cloned into the infectious proviral clone pSARM4. In addition, proviral clones containing truncated PR mutants (PRΔ118-145) and (PRΔ111-145) were constructed. Finally, a mutation Y121S in the PR, which was shown to significantly decrease binding of nucleic acids to the G-patch in vitro (9Svec M. Bauerová H. Pichová I. Konvalinka J. Strïsovský K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was introduced in pSARM4.FIGURE 3SDS-PAGE analysis of autocatalytic cleavage of M-PMV wt protease and its mutants. The enzymes at 0.2 mg/ml concentration were incubated at 37 °C for different time periods (0-10 days) in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.3, containing 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% mercaptoethanol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of M-PMV-specific proteins was analyzed 20 h after transfection of the respective plasmids into COS-1 cells. Both cell-associated and released virion-associated proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-M-PMV antiserum (Fig. 4). Similar levels of Gag, Gag-Pro, and Gag-Pro-Pol precursor proteins were synthesized in cells transfected with truncated mutants as well as with wild-type genomes (Fig. 4a), confirming that deletion of sequences encoding a substantial part of the C-terminal domain of protease did not disturb the ribosomal frameshifts. Following virus release, Gag precursors were processed by wt PR as well as by the protease mutants (Fig. 4b). The truncation of the most C-terminal domain (mutants PRΔ118-145 and PRΔ111-145) did not affect the proteolytic processing of protein precursors in released viral particles. Similar processing of Gag polyproteins and a comparable amount of the capsid protein in the released virions was also detected for the G-patch mutant, Y121S. Viral particles of constructs Q115I and N109I/Q115I contained, besides the mature proteins, a low level of unprocessed Gag polyprotein even after a 24 h incubation of virions at 37 °C (Fig. 4b). In some cases we also observed the other viral precursors, Gag-Pro (Pr95) and Gag-Pro-Pol (Pr180) in these particles (data not shown). The presence of unprocessed polyproteins suggests that the cleavage of Gag-polyproteins by these PR mutants was impaired compared with the wild type. In contrast, the in vitro autoproteolytic cleavage of the isolated 17-kDa protease containing Q115I and N109I/Q115I mutations was significantly faster than the wild type, confirming that these mutations affect in vivo substrate specificity of PR and not the activity per se. Mutations within C Terminus of Protease Decrease Virus Infectivity— To analyze the effect of the mutations introduced into the C terminus of the protease region on the virus infectivity, virus particles released from the COS-1 cells transiently transfected by mutant and wild-type viral constructs were normalized to the content of the capsid protein, and equivalent amounts of viral particles were used for infection of the fresh COS-1 cells. The level of CA protein released into the medium was determined by Western blot analysis using polyclonal rabbit anti-CA antiserum. Mutant A114R retained ∼70% of the infectivity of wt virus (Fig. 5), but a significant decrease in infectivity was observed for mutants displaying accelerated C-terminal autoprocessing (Q115I, N109I/Q115I) as well as for the C-terminally truncated protease mutants (PRΔ111-145, PRΔ118-145). Importantly, the G-patch mutant, Y121S, with defective nucleic acid binding retained only ∼20% infectivity of the wt virus, confirming that this region plays an important role in virus infectivity. The C-terminal Domain of Protease Is Important for the Activity of Reverse Transcriptase—As the decrease of virus infectivity caused by deletion or substitution mutations within the C-terminal protease domain was not because of impaired protease activity or virion maturation, we analyzed the virion-associated RT activity of all protease mutants described here (Fig. 6). Mutant and wild-type viral particles were isolated from media of transiently transfected COS-1 cells, and the rate of incorporation of [35S]dATP in an RT reaction was measured. As expected, replacement A114R had no significant influence on the RT activity, which is in agreement with the results obtained from the infectivity assay. However, for constructs Q115I, N109I/Q115I, and Y121S, RT activity was reduced by 50% and deletion the G-patch region (PRΔ111-145, PRΔ118-145) decreased RT activity by 70% in comparison with wt. These results demonstrate that the G-patch domain of PR is necessary for the activity of M-PMV reverse transcriptase. Both the virus infectivity and the activity of reverse transcriptase of all the constructs presented in Figs. 5 and 6 are average values of three independent experiments. Mutations within the C-terminal Domain of PR Change the Type of Assembly—To analyze the effect of mutations within the C terminus of protease on the morphogenesis and morphology of the viral particles, ultrathin sections were prepared and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 7). The wt M-PMV particles assembled within the cytoplasm and were subsequently transported to the plasma membrane, representative of D-type morphogenesis as described by Chopra and Mason (15Chopra H.C. Mason M.M. Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 2081-2086PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, all constructs with a mutated C-terminal domain assembled particles with both D-type (assembly of spherical particles within the cytoplasm) and C-type (assembly at the plasma membrane) morphogenesis. The average number of C-type assembled particles for the A114R mutant was ∼20% (TABLE ONE), which is in good agreement with lower virus infectivity and exogenous RT activity. Mutants with accelerated C-terminal autoprocessing (Q115I, N109I/Q115I) and truncated protease mutants (PRΔ111-145, PRΔ118-145) displayed ∼40% of the C-type assembly. The G-patch mutant assembled ∼60% of the particles at the plasma membrane. Importantly, the release of viral particles was not impaired for any of the mutants because the amount of virus-associated proteins was comparable to that of the wt virus, indicating that the C-type assembled particles were not retained in COS cells.TABLE ONEThe frequency of particles assembled with the C-type morphogenesis in COS-1 cells transfected with wt M-PMV and protease mutants A total of 300-400 viral capsid structures for each mutant were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy to yield the percentage for C- and D-type morphogenesis.ConstructFrequency of C-typemorphogenesis[%]wt M-PMV<1A114R20PRΔ111-14535PRΔ118-14546Q115144N1091/Q115143Y121S60 Open table in a new tab Proteases from several endogenous retroviruses and β-retroviruses (MIA-14, HERV K10, rabbit endogenous retrovirus H, M-PMV) undergo autoprocessing from the C terminus both in vitro (16Strïsovský K.

However, the significance of the C-terminally extended domain of PR and its processing for their life cycle has not been elucidated. The first active form of the M-PMV protease is released as a dimer of two 152 amino acid subunits (17PR), which undergoes further autoprocessing from its C terminus yielding proteolytically active homodimers that contain 114 (13PR) or 107 (12PR) amino acid monomers (6Zábranský A.

Importantly, the RNA-binding module, whose function is in most eukaryotic proteins associated with RNA processing and also with specific protein-protein interactions (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 342-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 20Silverman E.D. Maeda A. Wei J. Smith P. Beggs J.D. Lin R.J. Mol. Cel. Biol. 2004; 24: 10101-10110Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), is present at the C terminus (amino acid residues 108-152) of M-PMV 17PR as well as in closely related simian retroviruses I and II (SRV) and in squirrel monkey retrovirus (SMRV) PRs. The G-patch is a region of ∼45 amino acids, which contains six highly conservative glycines and a number of hydrophobic and basic residues (see Fig. 2). The position following the first Gly (Gly120 in M-PMV PR) is occupied almost invariably by an aromatic residue (Tyr121 in M-PMV PR) that has been shown to be critical for interaction with nucleic acid bases (21Guglielmi B. Werner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35712-35719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that mutation Y121S in M-PMV PR prevented binding of single-stranded DNA and RNA oligonucleotides to the protease (9Svec M. Bauerová H. Pichová I. Konvalinka J. Strïsovský K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis showed that the G-patch is present in most endogenous retroviruses of class II that are clustered with β-retroviruses. This domain was probably acquired early in evolution (22Gifford R. Kabat P. Martin J. Lunch C. Tristem M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6478-6486Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that it could fulfill a specific role in the life cycle of β-retroviruses. M-PMV protease is expressed by ribosomal frame-shifting as a domain of the Gag-Pro and Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins. Thus, three polyproteins Pr78Gag, Pr95Gag-Pro, and Pr180Gag-Pro-Pol are targeted to the pericentriolar region of the cell where the immature particle is formed. The processing of polyproteins is initiated only after transport of the capsids to the plasma membrane, budding, and release of the particle when the protease is activated. M-PMV protease might utilize an additional control mechanism to delay the process of the activation in assembled immature capsids. It is tempting to speculate that the conservative G-patch domain of M-PMV PR and/or its time-dependent release might regulate the proteolytic activity of PR and might prevent the premature processing of the Gag-polyproteins within the immature particle. However, the experiments with mutated M-PMV proviral genomes presented here demonstrate that truncation of M-PMV PR does not affect the maturation of viral particles and that the C-terminal domain of PR is not necessary for proteolysis. Even the activity of the PR mutant Δ111-145, corresponding to the shortest variant, 12 PR, which has been never detected in released particles (6Zábranský A. Andreánsky M. Hrusková-Heidingsfeldová O. Havlïcek V. Hunter E. Ruml T. Pichová I. Virology. 1998; 245: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was sufficient for maturation of M-PMV when subcloned into the proviral genome. Unexpectedly, virion-associated proteins of Q115I and N109I/Q115I mutants contained a low level of unprocessed Gag-polyproteins (Fig. 4b), and a fraction of the released particles was immature as documented by electron micrographs (Fig. 7), even though the in vitro autoprocessing of proteases containing these mutations was accelerated. We can hypothesize that the mutated 13/17PR processing site in PR is preferentially cleaved within the embedded polyprotein and yields a conformationally altered Gag-product with a sterically less accessible N-terminal cleavage site of the protease domain. Because the initial proteolytic cleavage within the Gag-Pro precursor is primarily directed at the N terminus of the protease, 4H. Bauerová-Zábranská, J. Stokrová, K. Strísovský, E. Hunter, T. Ruml, and I. Pichová, unpublished data. release of the protease could be altered in the Q115I and N109I/Q115I mutants and processing of the Gag-polyproteins might be decreased. The results presented here clearly confirm that the G-patch domain does not affect maturation of released viral particles. Importantly, we demonstrate that deletion of the C-terminal domain in PRΔ118-145 and PRΔ111-145 mutants, acceleration of the C-terminal processing of PR in Q115I, N109I, and Q115I mutants, and/or mutation of the RNA binding sequence (Y121S mutant) decreased the activity of RT in released virions by 50-70% and the infectivity of the virus by 80-95%. The M-PMV reverse transcriptase domain is expressed by the -1 ribosomal frameshift at the 3′-end of the protease reading frame within the Gag-Pro-Pol polyprotein. In this long precursor the protease region is followed by the reverse transcriptase sequence. It is likely that the proteolytic digestion of this polyprotein yields the reverse transcriptase covalently linked at its N terminus with the G-patch sequence of PR, since Entin-Meer et al. (23Entin-Meer M. Avidan O. Hizi A. Virology. 2003; 310: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported that mature mouse mammary tumor virus RT contained C-terminal flanking residues of the protease within virions. In vitro experiments with this extended RT confirmed that this transframe form of RT is active. However, mouse mammary tumor virus is the only virus from the β-retroviruses that does not contain the C-terminal extension and the G-patch at the C terminus of the protease domain (see Fig. 2). A surprising observation of this study was that the G-patch of the protease influences the type of virus assembly. Electron micrographs of all the mutants studied here show that morphogenesis is shifted, to different degrees, from the D-type to the C-type morphogenetic pathway. M-PMV as the prototypical representative of D-type retroviruses assembles very few particles (<1%) via the C-type pathway (24Strambio-de-Castillia C. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7021-7032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, ∼40% of PRΔ111-145, PRΔ118-145, Q115I, and N109I/Q115I mutant particles assembled at the plasma membrane and as many as 60% of Y121S particles displayed C-type morphogenesis. M-PMV Gag precursors together with genomic RNA assemble into capsids at a pericentriolar region of the cytoplasm in a microtubule-dependent process through interactions between a short peptide signal, known as the cytoplasmic targeting-retention signal, and the dynein/dynacting motor complex (2Sfakianos J.N. LaCasse R.A. Hunter E. Traffic. 2003; 4: 660-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Sfakianos J.N. Hunter E. Traffic. 2003; 4: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The C- and D-type morphogenetic pathways appear distinct; however, a point mutation of Arg55 within the CTRS signal in the matrix domain, abrogates the pericentriolar targeting of Gag-polyproteins, and this mutant follows the C-type assembly pathway (3Rhee S.S. Hunter E. Cell. 1990; 63: 535-546Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Insertion of M-PMV CTRS into the same region of murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV), which exhibits C-type morphogenesis, results in intracytoplasmic assembly of the Gag-polyproteins. However, only 20-30% of MoMuLV Gag-polyproteins containing M-PMV CTRS were incorporated into stable, pelletable particles within the cytoplasm (4Choi G. Park S. Choi B. Hong S. Lee J. Hunter E. Rhee S.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5431-5437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that efficient assembly of M-PMV immature capsids in the cytoplasm requires other domains that are present in the Gag-related polyproteins. The G-patch of the protease, which contains the basic as well as the hydrophobic amino acids might represent a signal that promotes the efficient intracytoplasmic assembly of immature capsids by both the binding of genomic RNA during the assembly process and/or by the protein-protein interaction with cellular proteins involved in intracellular trafficking. The influence of the G-patch on the ratio of incorporated Gag-Pro and Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins into the immature particles might be also considered. In summary, the observations presented here describe the so far uncharacterized function of the RNA binding domain in β-retroviruses. We showed that this domain located within the C terminus of the protease does not affect the maturation; however, more surprisingly it influences the morphogenesis and the virus infectivity. The mutations that impair the function of the G-patch, which is evolutionarily conserved among endogenous retroviruses and β-retroviruses, allow the polyprotein precursors to escape from the intracytoplasmic site of assembly and redirect them to the cytoplasmic membrane."

The main biological functions of the STATs are carried out at the level of transcription activation of thousands of different genes in response to stimulation by various ligands. The transcription activation domain (TAD) of STATs is located in the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule (9Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4956) Google Scholar). The STAT TADs can function as independent domains for gene activation by recruiting other proteins, such as the transcription co-activator cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CBP)/p300 (10Chrivia J.C.

In addition to the well studied tyrosine phosphorylation in STATs, the serine residue (Ser-727) in the LPMSP motif has also been shown to be required for the maximal transcription activities of Stat1, -3, and -4 (20Wen Z.

Several serine kinases, including CaMKII, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways have been shown to be involved in the phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3 (26Chung J.

However, it is not clear what structural elements determine the specificity between the different STATs and the serine kinases activated by the various cytokines. The biochemical function underlying the physiological importance of the phosphoserine and conserved LPMSP motif is not completely understood either. In this report, we show that, in addition to Ser-727 and its phosphorylation, the conserved Leu-724 residue is also essential for gene activation mediated by Stat1. Leu-724 is required for the phosphorylation of Stat1S727 both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, we present a Stat1 mutant that lacks transcription activity despite normal Ser-727 phosphorylation. Further analyses show that Leu-724, as well as the phospho-Ser-727, are essential for the recruitment of the transcription co-activator CBP/p300 to the promoters of Stat1 target genes. Our results demonstrate that Leu-724 is the key regulatory element that controls the maximal transcriptional activity of Stat1. Cell Culture and Antibodies—U3A cells (provided by G. Stark, Cleveland Clinic Foundation Research Institute, Cleveland, OH, and I. Kerr, Imperial Cancer Research Foundation, London, UK) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum. 293T and HT1080 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone). Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from whole blood obtained from healthy volunteers was done as described previously (31Tassiulas I. Hu X. Ho H. Kashyap Y. Paik P. Hu Y. Lowell C.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with a protocol approved by the institutional review board of the Hospital for Special Surgery (New York, NY). Human monocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells immediately after isolation by positive selection with anti-CD14 magnetic beads, as recommended by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec). The purity of the monocytes was >97%, as verified by flow cytometry. Antibody against phosphoserine-Stat1 and acetyl-histone H4 were from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibodies against phosphotyrosine-Stat1 and -Stat3 were from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibody against the Stat1 amino terminus was from Tansduction Laboratories. Antibodies against the p300, CaMKII, and Stat1 carboxyl termini were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Recombinant human IFN-γ (hIFN-γ) was from Roche Applied Science and used at 5 ng/ml hIFN-γ for the lengths of time indicated in each experiment. CaMKIIα/β purified from rat brain was from Calbiochem. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as previously described (32Yang E. Henriksen M.A. Schaefer O. Zakharova N. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13455-13462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Specifically, 107 cells were used for each precipitation reaction with the following antibodies: 2 μg of anti-Stat1C, 2 μg of anti-p300, or 2 μg of anti-acetyl-histone H4. ChIP PCR primer pair sequences for the human IRF-1 promoter are: 5′-CTTCGCCGCTAGCTCTACAACAG-3′ and 5′-GCTCCGGGTGGCCTCGGTTCG-3′. Primers for GBP-1 promoter are: 5′-TGAGAAATCTTTAAACCCTCCC-3′ and 5′-TGGCTTCTAGCACTTCTGTGTC-3′. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded oligonucleotides representing a STAT-1 binding sequence M67 (33Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) were labeled with 32P by Klenow filling. A total of 1 ng of labeled probe was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracts at room temperature for 10 min. The samples were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and run at constant voltage (200 V) for 3 h in a cold room. Lentiviral Transduction in Human Monocytes—The generation of viral stocks and transduction into human primary monocytes were done essentially as previously described (31Tassiulas I. Hu X. Ho H. Kashyap Y. Paik P. Hu Y. Lowell C.A. Ivashkiv L.B. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 34Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Briefly, lentiviral plasmids containing Stat1 and packaging vectors were transfected into 293T cells in 10-cm plates. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 and 72 h after transfection and titered on HT1080 cells. Viral particles were spun down at 25,000 revolutions/min for 90 min and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium and then added to the human primary monocytes at a ratio of 1:50 in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene. 48 h after transduction, the efficiency of transduction was monitored with fluorescence microscopy to measure green fluorescent protein expression and was typically >80%. The cells were then either untreated or treated with IFN-γ for 30 min followed by Western blotting analyses. RNA Analyses—Total RNAs were prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR analyses were done on the ABI PRISM® 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) with the SYBR Green PCR kit from Applied Biosystems as instructed by the manufacturer. The relative level of expression (RE) for a specific gene was calculated according to the equation REnI= 2–(ΔCtn–ΔCt0), ΔCt = Cttest gene–CtGAPDH, (Ct, cycle threshold; n, specific sample; 0, untreated wild type; test gene, IRF-1, GBP-1, etc). Primer pair sequences for the real-time RT-PCR are: hSOCS-1, 5′-TGTTGTAGCAGCTTAACTGTATC-3′ and 5′-AGAGGTAGGAGGTGCGAGT-3′; hGAPDH, 5′-ATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCA-3′ and 5′-GTCGCTGTTGAAGTCAGAGGA-3′; hIRF-1, 5′-CAAATCCCGGGGCTCATCTGG-3′ and 5′-CTGGCTCCTTTTCCCCTGCTTTGT-3′; and hGBP-1, 5′-AGAGGAAGGTGGAAGAAA-3′ and 5′-AATGGTCTAAAGTGTCCC-3′. In Vitro CaMKII Kinase Assays—In vitro CaMKII kinase reactions were carried out as previously described (29Nair J.S. DaFonseca C.J. Tjernberg A. Sun W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Chait B.T. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5971-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions—GST-Stat1TAD was constructed as previously described (23Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Stat1 expression plasmids in RcCMV (Invitrogen) were constructed as previously reported (20Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). Specific point mutations in Stat1 were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate lentiviral plasmids containing Stat1, DNA fragments containing the RcCMV promoter and Stat1 cDNA were PCR-amplified from the RcCMV plasmids containing wild type or mutant Stat1 and cloned into the lentiviral vector FUGW (kindly provided by David Baltimore, California Technology Institute, Pasadena, CA). Transfection Experiments—Transient transfections of U3A cells and 293T cells were done with the Lipofectamine 2000 method (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). All luciferase results were luciferase activities normalized against an internal control luciferase reporter of Renilla luciferase (Promega). For generation of stable clones, U3A cells were transfected with the calcium-phosphate transfection kit (Invitrogen) as instructed by the manufacturer. 24 h after transfection, the cells were plated into medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 for 6 days, and G418-resistant clones were screened by Western blotting. The Conserved Leu-724 Residue Is Required for Stat1-mediated Transcription Activation in Response to IFN-γ—We have previously reported that the conserved Leu-724 residue is required for Stat1 activity in transient transfection assays (23Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To understand the biochemical basis for the physiological importance of this conserved residue for Stat1-mediated transcription activation in IFN-γ signaling, we generated a panel of Stat1 mutants in the conserved Leu-724 or Ser-727 (Fig. 1A). The Stat1-null U3A cells (35Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) were reconstituted with these mutants to generate stable cell lines containing these various forms of Stat1 proteins (Fig. 1C). Multiple cell lines containing each mutant were analyzed for the expression levels of three IFN-γ-inducible Stat1 target genes, IRF-1, SOCS-1, and GBP-1, as well as an internal control gene GAPDH by real-time RT-PCR. Results of one representative experiment are shown in Fig. 1B. Very little expression of the three Stat1 target genes was detected in the U3A cells and Stat1-containing cells without IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 1B). After stimulation with IFN-γ for 3 h, the expression level of IRF-1 increased >15-fold, and the levels of SOCS-1 and GBP-1 increased by 3–4-fold in cells containing wild type Stat1 (Fig. 1B). Null mutations of L724A and S727A significantly reduced the IFN-γ-induced expression of all three target genes, indicating that both the conserved Ser-727 and Leu-724 are required for Stat1 transcription activity (Fig. 1B). To further understand the structural importance of Leu-724, we mutated Leu-724 to isoleucine (Ile), which should have caused a smaller structural change at this position than the L724A mutation. However, Stat1L724I failed to activate any of the Stat1 target genes (Fig. 1B), suggesting a stringent structural requirement for Leu-724 at this position. To dissect the biochemical function of the phospho-Ser-727, we mutated Ser-727 to aspartic acid to mimic the negative charge brought by serine phosphorylation. However, S727D could not induce significant levels of expression of the Stat1 target genes (Fig. 1B), suggesting that, in the context of a chromatin promoter, the single negative charge brought by Asp-727 to Stat1 is not sufficient to activate transcription. Altogether, these results indicate that the Leu-724 residue, in addition to Ser-727, is also essential for Stat1-mediated gene activation in response to cytokine stimulation. Requirement of Leu-724 for Stat1 Ser-727 Phosphorylation—To understand the molecular basis of the defects in the above mutants for Stat1-mediated gene activation, we first investigated the status of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation in these mutants in response to cytokine stimulation. Cells containing the various forms of Stat1 were first treated with IFN-γ to see the effect of these mutations on IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation of Stat1. Western blotting experiments were done using antibodies specific to phospho-Ser-727 and phospho-Tyr-701 of Stat1. IFN-γ treatment induced strong Tyr-701 phosphorylation in wild type Stat1 as well as in all the mutant Stat1 proteins, indicating that mutations of Leu-724 or Ser-727 do not affect IFN-γ-induced phosphorylation of Tyr-701 (Fig. 2A, second panel, lanes 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). For the status of Ser-727 phosphorylation, wild type Stat1 had a significant level of Ser-727 phosphorylation in untreated cells, and the level of Ser-727 phosphorylation increased moderately after IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 2; A, top panel, lanes 3 and 4; and B). However, the Stat1L724A mutant could not be phosphorylated on Ser-727 either in untreated condition or after treatment with IFN-γ (Fig. 2; A, top panel, lanes 5 and 6; and B). This result indicates that this L724A mutation causes a specific defect in Ser-727 phosphorylation in Stat1. Interestingly, the Stat1L724I mutant, which contains minimal structural change at position 724 and is defective for gene activation (Fig. 1B), could still be phosphorylated on Ser-727 (Fig. 2; A, top panel, lanes 9 and 10; and B), suggesting that Ser-727 phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for Stat1 transcription activity. None of the Ser-727 mutants had detectable levels of Ser-727 phosphorylation above the weak nonspecific signal (Fig. 2; A, top panel, lanes 7, 8, 11, and 12; and B). Similar levels of Stat1 were expressed in these stable clones compared with the endogenous level of Stat3 (Fig. 2C). These mutations do not affect the nuclear translocation of Stat1 (data not shown). The ability of these mutants to bind to DNA was further tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. IFN-γ-induced binding to the Stat1 site M67 was detected for all mutants, and quantitation of the Stat1 band normalized to the nonspecific band showed a similar level of binding (Fig. 2D; quantitation data not shown). These results indicate that Leu-724 is important for IFN-γ-induced Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat1. Furthermore, the L724A mutation also blocked UV irradiation-induced Ser-727 phosphorylation (28Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 36Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Novy M. Decker T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3660-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) in Stat1 (data not shown). Therefore, the conserved Leu-724 residue is likely required for Stat1 serine phosphorylation induced by cytokines as well as non-cytokine signaling pathways. To further examine the Leu-724 mutations in a physiological background, human primary monocytes were transduced with lentiviral vectors containing Stat1WT, Stat1L724A, or Stat1L724I. Western blot analyses showed that high levels of exogenous Stat1 were expressed in the transduced cells (Fig. 2; E, middle panel, lanes 3–8; and G) compared with the endogenous Stat1 expression in the primary monocytes (Fig. 2E, middle panel, lanes 1 and 2). In these primary cells, both Stat1 wild type and the L724I mutant were phosphorylated on Ser-727 (Fig. 2; E, top panel, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8; and F), whereas the L724A could not be phosphorylated on Ser-727 above the background level (Fig. 2; E, top panel, lanes 5 and 6; and F). These results demonstrate that the two Leu-724 mutations also have a differential effect on Stat1S727 phosphorylation in physiological conditions. Leu-724 Is Necessary for Stat1 Ser Phosphorylation by CaMKII in Vitro—Next, to further understand the mechanism for the impaired Ser-727 phosphorylation in the Stat1L724A mutant, we examined its ability for interaction with and phosphorylation by the multifunctional serine/threonine kinase CaMKII, which is responsible for IFN-γ-induced Ser-727 phosphorylation in Stat1 (29Nair J.S. DaFonseca C.J. Tjernberg A. Sun W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Chait B.T. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5971-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins containing the wild type Stat1 TAD, Stat1TADL724A, or Stat1TADL724I were prepared for in vitro binding assays and kinase assays. GST pull-down assays showed that the wild type Stat1 TAD could interact with CaMKII from nuclear extracts, whereas the Stat1TADL724A mutant was significantly impaired in this interaction (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 2 and 3). The Stat1L724I mutant could interact with CaMKII (Fig. 3A, lane 4) but at a lower level compared with the wild type. To further demonstrate that the lack of Ser-727 phosphorylation in Stat1L724A is a direct result of defective phosphorylation by the serine kinase, we performed in vitro kinase assays with purified CaMKII and GSTStat1TAD fusion proteins. The wild type Stat1TAD could be phosphorylated by CaMKII strongly (Fig. 3B, lane 5), and this phosphorylation has been shown to specific on the Ser-727 residue (29Nair J.S. DaFonseca C.J. Tjernberg A. Sun W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Chait B.T. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5971-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Stat1TAD containing L724A had little incorporation of 32P, whereas the Stat1TADL724I had a similar level of 32P incorporation compared with the wild type Stat1 TAD (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 7). Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were used in these experiments (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that Leu-724 is required for the interaction between the Stat1TAD and its kinase CaMKII for Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat1. Recruitment of the Transcription Co-activator CBP/p300 to Stat1 Target Gene Promoters—The results shown above suggest that serine phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for Stat1 to activate transcription, as the Stat1L724I mutant has normal tyrosine and serine phosphorylation (Fig. 2) but still lacks transcription activity (Fig. 1B). To further understand the molecular basis of the defect in these mutants, we analyzed the assembly of Stat1 and the transcription co-activator CBP/p300 on the promoters of Stat1 target genes in the context of chromatins. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed on the Stat1 target genes IRF-1 (37Yang E. Lerner L. Besser D. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15794-15799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and GBP-1 (38Lew D. Decker T. Strehlow I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) in stable cell lines containing the various Stat1 mutants. For the IRF-1 promoter, very little Stat1 was detected without IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 4A, top panel, lanes 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). After treatment with IFN-γ for 30 min, high levels of Stat1 were bound to the IRF-1 promoter, and none of the mutations in Stat1 affected the binding (Fig. 4; A, top panel; and B). CBP/p300 was not detected on the IRF-1 promoter in the untreated cells (Fig. 4A, middle panel, lanes 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). In cells containing wild type Stat1, the level of CBP/p300 on the IRF-1 promoter increased dramatically in response to IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 4; A, middle panel, lane 3; and C). In contrast, the Stat1L724A, L724I, and S727A mutants had no detectable levels of CBP/p300 on the IRF-1 promoter (Fig. 4A, middle panel, lanes 5, 7, and 9), indicating that both Leu-724 and Ser-727 are essential for recruitment of CBP/p300 to the IRF-1 promoter. The Stat1S727D mutant could recruit a small amount of CBP/p300 (Fig. 4A, middle panel, lane 11), and further quantitation analyses showed that it was ∼20–30% of the amount of CBP/p300 recruited by the wild type Stat1 (Fig. 4C), suggesting that indeed negative charges play a role in the recruitment of CBP/p300. The results for the GBP-1 promoter are essentially similar to that of the IRF-1 promoter (Fig. 4, D–F). All together, these results indicate that both the Leu-724 and the Ser-727 are required for the recruitment of CBP/p300 to the STAT target gene promoters for cytokine-induced gene activation. Histone Acetylation at Stat1 Target Gene Promoters—To further investigate the effect of these Stat1 mutants on chromatin remodeling at the IRF-1 and GBP-1 promoters, we analyzed the status of histone acetylation on the IRF-1 and GBP-1 promoters. ChIP assays with anti-acetyl-histone H4 showed that wild type Stat1 induced a significant increase in the level of acetylated-histone H4 (Fig. 5; A, lane 4; and B). Notably, mutations L724A, L724I, and S727A reduced the level of H4 acetylation to background levels (Fig. 5; A, lanes 6, 8, and 12; and B), whereas Stat1S727D had a residue level of H4 acetylation (Fig. 5; A, lanes 10; and B). Similarly, only wild type Stat1 could induce histone H4 acetylation on the GBP-1 promoter (Fig. 5, C and D). These results correspond to the effect of these mutants on the CBP/p300 recruitment shown in Fig. 4. All together, these results demonstrate that phospho-Ser-727 alone is not sufficient to recruit CBP/p300 and that both Leu-724 and Ser-727 are required for the recruitment of CBP/p300 to Stat1 target gene promoters in response to IFN-γ. Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common mechanisms to regulate protein function. The critical regulatory steps of STAT functions such as nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcription activation are at the phosphorylation of two residues, one tyrosine and the other serine. The crystal structures of STAT proteins (17Becker S. Groner B. Muller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 18Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D.

Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) showed that the members in the STAT family share considerable sequence and structural homology throughout the molecule, except the transcription activation domain, which has not been analyzed by crystallography. The LPMSP motif is the only sequence found to be conserved among the TADs of some of the STATs, which require serine phosphorylation for maximal transcription activity. Previous studies have shown that the serine residue is phosphorylated in response to ligand stimulation, and mutation of S727A impairs the transcription activity of Stat1 and Stat3 (20Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar, 23Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Biol. 2004; 24: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our results using Leu-724 mutations demonstrate that, in addition to the phosphorylation of Ser-727, the conserved Leu-724 is also critical for the transcription activity of Stat1 (Figs. 1B and 6) and Stat3. 4W. Sun, M. Snyder, and J. J. Zhang, unpublished results. Furthermore, these analyses indicate that Leu-724 is probably the controlling point for protein-protein interaction to recruit protein modification enzymes, such as CaMKII (serine kinase) and CBP/p300 (histone acetyl transferase), to regulate the transcription activity of the TADs of STAT proteins. Several serine kinases, including CaMKII (29Nair J.S. DaFonseca C.J. Tjernberg A. Sun W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Chait B.T. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5971-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (28Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), have been identified as the serine kinases for Ser-727 phosphorylation of Stat1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase for Stat3 (26Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6508-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how specificity is determined between the STAT TADs and the serine kinases. Further analyses of the status of Ser-727 phosphorylation showed that the L724A mutation in Stat1 impaired Ser-727 phosphorylation in response to either IFN-γ (Fig. 2) or UV irradiation (data not shown). However, Stat1L724I can still be phosphorylated on Ser-727 in response to the respective stimulations. In the case of Stat3, the L724A mutation does not affect Ser-727 phosphorylation induced by interleukin-6 or OSM. 4W. Sun, M. Snyder, and J. J. Zhang, unpublished results. It is possible that, because this motif contains two proline residues, it may have substantial structural flexibility as a recognition motif to recruit and present Ser-727 for phosphorylation by different kinases. Therefore, the control of STAT serine phosphorylation could be determined by type(s) of serine kinases activated in response to a particular stimulus. We have suggested previously that the function of the phosphoserine is to enhance the interaction of STAT TAD with other proteins, and the negative charge is important (23Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) perhaps through engaging positively charged residues on the interacting proteins (39DaFonseca C.J. Shu F. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3034-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The negatively charged residue Asp has been shown to mimic the effects of many enzymes that require auto-Ser/Thr phosphorylation with varying degrees of efficiency (40Fong Y.-L. Taylor W.L. Means A.R. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16759-16763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Pages G. Brunet A. L'Allemain G. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3003-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Our results with the Stat1S727D mutant indicate that the Asp residue can recruit a certain amount of CBP/p300 to the promoter (Fig. 4), but that limited amount is not sufficient to remodel the chromatin for transcription activation (Fig. 5). The Stat1S727E mutant had no activity.4 These results suggest that phospho-Ser-727 is involved in forming electrostatic interactions with positively charged residues on its binding partners, but the steric configuration of the side chain of phospho-Ser-727 may also be important for precise and high affinity interactions. Furthermore, these results also show that phosphorylation of Ser-727 alone is not sufficient to activate transcription. The Stat1L724I mutant can be phosphorylated on Ser-727 (Fig. 2) and yet be unable to activate transcription (Fig. 1B). ChIP assays on Stat1 target gene promoters demonstrate that it is defective in recruiting CBP/p300 necessary for transcription activation (Fig. 4). The Stat3 L724A mutant, which has normal Ser-727 phosphorylation, is defective in recruiting CBP/p300 and cannot activate transcription.4 It is possible that, to maintain optimal interaction between the STATs and CBP/p300, both the Leu-724 and phospho-Ser-727 are engaged in contact, and there is a more stringent requirement for steric configuration than in the case of the interaction with serine kinases (Fig. 6). Therefore, it is likely that the complete LPMSP motif, rather than the Ser-727 alone, is functioning as a unit for the recruitment of co-activators, such as CBP/p300 for maximal activity of STATs. The final analyses to understand the molecular mechanism of this conserved motif would be through the crystal structure of the STAT TADs. Earlier attempts suggest that the TAD by itself is unstructured. Therefore, these structural and functional analyses of the STAT binding proteins could be further utilized to co-crystalize the STAT TAD with its binding partners for a complete understanding of STAT-mediated gene activation.
